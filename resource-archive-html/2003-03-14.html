<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head J (cont.) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [13th March, 2003],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head J of

the  Main  Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Dr Ong  Chit

Chung].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K. Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

with  your  permission, I would like to  take  the  three

items, (d), (e) and (f), together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission statement of the Ministry of Defence is

"to  enhance Singapore's peace and security,  and  should

deterrence  and  diplomacy fail, to secure  a  swift  and

decisive victory over the aggressor".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence budget for 2003 is over $8 billion and

for  2002 it was also over $8 billion. This is a  lot  of

money.   It  is the largest budget compared to  the  next

Ministry, which I believe is that of Education, having  a

budget  of about $6.5 billion.  All of us would  like  to

see  this money being available for use for good deeds  - I  am  not saying that the Defence Ministry is not one  - including  for poor people and retrenched workers  during

this time of retrenchment and slow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



growth  in  Singapore.  But this is not to  be.   We  are

aware  that  the  defence of a country is  important  and

money  is required for this.  However, I ask the Ministry

of Defence:  do we need to spend so much? Can the sum not

be  reduced  during these difficult times?  Would  it  be

dangerously and critically insecure for Singapore if  the

budget  is reduced, even reduced drastically, and if  so,

why?   Please give us the reasons why this sum cannot  be

reduced. We are all aware of the need to have a deterrent

force,  fully ready for the worst scenario.  However,  we

have never had a war on major conflict since independence

in  1965. The last was in the 1960s during the Indonesian

Confrontation.  It has been 40 years since then,  and  we

have  had  peace all along, both in Singapore,  Indonesia

and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that we are always concerned about, if at

all, Malaysia and Indonesia.  I take it that there is  no

real  or perceived threat from any other external forces,

no  other  ASEAN  country or any other  foreign  country,

except  perhaps in today's context, terrorists, depending

on  how we define this term. There is so much talk  about

war and terrorism these days.  It is all gloom and, added

to  that, the economic gloom. Why is there so little talk

of   peace  and  harmony  by  our  leaders  and  all  the

international statesmen and spiritual leaders -  if  they

are  speaking about good and peace for the world?  Please

give it all the prime time airing.  And I urge the press,

radio and television to report them, instead of months of

Bush  and  Saddam conflict.  It may not even  be  US-Iraq

conflict,  mind  you, and Prime Minister  Tony  Blair  of

England, and it may not even be England that wants to  go

to war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, in my view, all countries should have a

Ministry  of  Peace, and not Ministry  of  Defence.   And

Ministers all over the world should make it their primary

objective   to  reduce  conflict,  reduce   build-up   of

armaments,  nuclear weapons or any form of arms  build-up

and  accessories,  including war planes,  warships,  army

tanks, artillery and a whole host of weaponry.  And  that

is what causes the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



increase  in defence budget, is it not?  And who benefits

economically  -  the big corporations,  manufacturers  of

armaments,  builders of planes, ships, etc,  USA,  France

and  the big powers?  I am not sure whether Singapore  is

involved.  If so, let us reflect and search our souls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the increase in military personnel in the

Army, Air Force and Navy and support administrative staff

goes   to  increase  the  budget.   Hopefully,  all   the

computerisation   would  reduce  the  cost   but,   then,

computerisation is expensive too.  My guess  is  that  we

fear  aggression  from Malaysia and  Indonesia;  Malaysia

fears  Singapore,  and  Indonesia and  perhaps  Thailand;

Indonesia   fears   Singapore,   Malaysia   and   perhaps

Australia.   We  all fear each other in our  minds.   Are

these fears real or perceived?  Are all the three or four

countries that I have talked about and their top military

generals  and Defence Ministers theorising  a  lot?   Are

they being realistic?  Am I being realistic?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably since the 1960s, after our independence in

1965,  which  has been about 37 years, the generals  have

been  harbouring this fear, I believe.  In  a  sense,  it

makes them all relevant and feel important.  There should

be  a  new thinking by political, military, and spiritual

leaders, and our citizens should play a greater  role  in

being critical of people who talk about war and conflict.

They  must  justify  their actions  and  remove  all  the

secrecy  which does not help at all for either Singapore,

Malaysia or Indonesia.  Individually, all of us are peace

loving.    Our  Ministers,  military  generals,   defence

officials  and  citizens all want peace  and  harmony,  a

decent  job and a happy family.  That is all we ask  for.

That must be the same with Malaysia and Indonesia, is  it

not, and USA, UK and Iraq or any country for that matter?

But  when individual human beings take on important roles

in   the  institution  of  government,  things  strangely

change.   How come?  Please review all our positions  and

search  our  souls  to  do good for Singapore  and  other

nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge our Ministry of Defence to initiate

this process of creating a Ministry of Peace, and for the

United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



Nations  and the rest of the world to seriously  consider

and  come  up with workable solutions.  And through  this

process, defence budgets could be drastically reduced and

made  available to other Ministries and for the  good  of

our people.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, MINDEF has

always maintained parallel diplomatic communication links

with  all  major defence forces all over  the  world,  in

particular  with  our neighbouring countries.   And  such

excellent diplomatic relation has stood the test of  time

even  during crisis, even with countries such as Malaysia

and Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to ask the Minister for Defence

is:   what  additional  steps  MINDEF  has  in  place  to

increase   greater  defence  cooperation  and  diplomatic

communication   with   the   various   defence    forces,

particularly  those involving our strategic partners  and

the neighbouring countries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong Chit Chung, you can take both

cuts together.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, earlier on, Mr

Chandra Mohan asked whether he was realistic. The  answer

clearly is no.  It reminds me of Neville Chamberlain, the

Prime  Minister of England in the late 1930s.  He met  up

with Hitler and he came back to England and waved a piece

of paper and said, "Peace at hand", and immediately after

that,  Hitler invaded France and other parts  of  Europe.

And Chamberlain lived in shame in history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot take peace for granted. To have peace,

you must be prepared for war and you must be prepared  to

take  your  defences seriously so that  with  deterrence,

peace will prevail.  But if you let down your guard,  you

would have no peace at all because people would take  you

for an easy ride. And this is what we in Singapore should

not  do.  So we should not be saying out in public  about

playing  down  our  defences because then,  we  would  be

defenceless.   To  have peace, you must be  prepared  for

war,  and with deterrence, war will never occur. That  is

our best bet for our security.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you look at the new strategic landscape in

South-east Asia, we can see that all the more  we  should

give  special attention and priority to defence.  We face

not  only  conventional threats, but also  low  intensity

conflicts and operations, terrorist attacks and  threats.

So  far,  Sir,  the SAF has concentrated on  conventional

threats  and operations.  Is the SAF able, in  these  new

circumstances, to adapt and reorientate itself to take on

both  conventional threats and low intensity  operations?

We  want to know whether the SAF is trained well  and  is

ready  for it for the new tasks ahead.  We know that  the

SAF  trains  rigorously here in Singapore as well  as  in

many  overseas  countries but some, Sir,  are  still  are

unaware  of  the operational readiness and capability  of

our armed forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, at an informal dialogue session in my

constituency,  a lady asked me whether SAF  soldiers  are

good  in  shooting  - she goes down  to  the  basic,  ie,

shooting,  although  defences and new technology  involve

more  than  that - and whether in real combat, our  NSmen

would  be  able to take on the regular soldiers of  other

armed  forces.   She also wanted to know  how  our  NSmen

fare,  in  comparison with other armed forces,  in  joint

exercises.   I  assured her, based on my knowledge,  that

all  is  well and our troops are well-equipped and  well-trained  for their tasks.  But it is better to hear  from

the Minister, from the horse's mouth, so to speak, on the

state of readiness of our armed forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bali bombings of 12th October 2002 have

suggested that regional terrorist organisations are  both

willing  and well able to mount sophisticated attacks  on

soft  targets  in the region.  It is therefore  incumbent

upon  governments  in the region to do  their  utmost  to

ensure   that   every  potential  target   within   their

territories is hardened so as to deter terrorist  attack.

Every  attack that succeeds will only play into the hands

of  the  terrorists  as it would send  off  a  signal  to

foreign investors that South-east Asia is not safe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If foreign investors pull out, the region, which is

still recovering from the financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



crisis  of  1997/1998,  will be in even  deeper  trouble.

Unemployment   will  continue  to  be  a   big   problem,

especially in the less well-off countries, and this would

only  prod more restless, embittered young men  into  the

arms of the extremists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, while it is certainly important to expand

sufficient resources on tightening border and immigration

controls,   cutting  terrorist  funding   and   improving

intelligence  flow  and exchanges  between  domestic  and

friendly  foreign  agencies,  it  is  more  important,  I

believe, to deal with the root cause of terrorism in  the

region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also clear that the governments in the region

must take care not to engage in any policy behaviour that

inadvertently  sends out the message  that  a  particular

religion,   in  this  case,  Islam,  is  being  targeted.

Otherwise,  some people may become vulnerable to  radical

appeals  suggesting that they have to  take  up  arms  to

defend  their  faith.  Eradicating the radical  terrorist

threat  will  require  more  than  just  law  enforcement

measures.  A coordinated strategy integrating enforcement

measures,   as   well   as   economic,   political    and

ideologically elements, therefore, is needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of countering terrorism, the Bali

bombings  have prodded the Indonesian Government  to  get

off the fence with respect to groups like the JI.  It can

no  longer  pretend that the problem with terrorism  does

not  exist  in  Indonesia and that  Indonesians  are  not

involved with the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the attacks in the United States on 11th

September 2001, efforts have been increased to coordinate

regional  and international actions against terrorism  in

South-east   Asia.   ASEAN   has   announced    increased

cooperation   at  its  annual  Ministerial   Meeting   in

July/August  2002.   During these  meetings,  the  United

States also signed an anti-terrorism agreement with ASEAN

members on 30th July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I wish to ask the Minister whether

we have adequate intelligence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



cooperation on terrorism with our neighbours.  I wish  to

ask the Minister whether the backbone of JI in the region

has  been  broken,  and how successful  is  our  national

security secretariat in its work in countering terrorism.

Further, I wish to ask the Minister whether SAF  is  able

to  deal  with terrorist attacks, including chemical  and

biological attacks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years, the SAF has participated in

various UN peace-keeping missions.  Recently, such peace-keeping missions have become larger and larger in  scale.

The  biggest  mission  so far is to Timor-Leste  or  East

Timor.  Sir, I had the opportunity to visit our troops at

our  peace-keeping mission in Timor-Leste.   I  must  say

that I am impressed with the enthusiasm and commitment of

our  soldiers and airmen.  However, there are reports  of

outbreaks  of  violence  there. Although  this  does  not

presage  a  general breakdown of the new state,  it  does

remind us that the road to building a viable nation state

is  an  arduous one.  In any case, peace-keeping missions

are  temporary and that sometime in the near  future,  we

should complete our mission in Timor-Leste and bring back

our  troops.  I would therefore ask the Minister  whether

there  are  any other plans in the future of sending  any

other  mission  under  US  auspices,  and  what  are  the

benefits  to  the  SAF and Singapore of  such  UN  peace-keeping missions.

subject  that was raised yesterday by Dr Ong Chit  Chung,

Ms  Irene  Ng,  Mr  Sin Boon Ann and Mr  Ravindran.   The

comments and views expressed by the hon. Members  reflect

how   well   Singaporeans  realise  that   our   security

environment is a difficult and uncertain one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From global developments, to the regional situation,

to our homeland, there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



are  forces  at  work  which could have  a  destabilising

effect   on  Singapore's  security.   At  this  time   of

geopolitical  flux,  we  must  put  enough   effort   and

resources into enhancing our defence, if we do  not  want

to put Singapore's security at risk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a general expectation that there will

soon  be  a war in Iraq. Such a war will not only  change

the  face of the Middle East, but it will also have  far-reaching ramifications for the whole world.  For us,  one

core issue is that weapons of mass destruction should not

be allowed to proliferate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar danger looms in the Korean Peninsula.

Here,  it  is  not  just the prospect of a  nuclear-armed

North  Korea  but the impact of this on the  geopolitical

landscape  in the whole Asia-Pacific region, as  the  US,

China  and  Japan respond to developments in  the  Korean

Peninsula.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These geopolitical developments at the global level

will   have   consequences  for  the  regional   security

environment and Singapore's strategic interests. We  have

limited influence on the policies and actions of the  big

powers.   But  we can enhance our security by  developing

cooperative  and  mutually beneficial relationships  with

those  countries  which share common strategic  interests

with  Singapore,  as well as by drawing  the  heavyweight

countries  into  playing a more active  and  constructive

role in multi-lateral forums which can help stabilise the

regional  security  environment, eg, the  ASEAN  Regional

Forum (ARF).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our region, serious political and economic

challenges which have beset some countries have yet to be

resolved.   Economic problems will take some time  to  be

sorted  out,  as  domestic  factors  are  compounded   by

external  factors such as the US economy and  a  possible

war in the Gulf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political stability will depend, to some extent, on

whether  or  not socio-economic conditions  improve.   So

long   as   political  and  economic  conditions   remain

difficult, there is an increased risk of low intensity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



conflicts erupting, with consequent destabilising effects

on the rest of the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect of elections and leadership transitions

could  also  have an impact on political  stability.   In

Indonesia,   there  will  be  a  more  heated   political

atmosphere, as parties and presidential aspirants  jostle

in  the  run-up to the elections next year.  In Malaysia,

there has also been talk of early general elections,  and

there  is  general expectation of a leadership transition

this October.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to emphasise that Singapore wants good

relations with all our neighbours.  But we should not  be

surprised if, at a time of political changes and economic

difficulties,  there  are those who find  it  politically

advantageous to raise the Singapore bogey.  We  have  had

some  taste  of  this recently, with  attempts  to  paint

Singapore as unreasonable and greedy, accompanied by wild

allegations in a media campaign to whip up anti-Singapore

feelings.  Even the word "war" and the threat of war have

been bandied about irresponsibly by some politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year-and-a-half, we have also faced

the real and present threat of terrorism in our homeland.

Singaporeans know how serious the threat is.  The  arrest

of  the Jemaah Islamiyah members has dealt a serious blow

to the network in Singapore, but terrorism is an enemy we

cannot  afford  to underestimate.  The Al Qaeda  has  not

been destroyed.  Nor has the Al Qaeda given up its war of

terror.   We  will  have to grapple with  the  threat  of

terrorism for years to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see, there are many challenges and

uncertainties in our security environment.  It is against

this  background that we have to consider our budget  for

defence,  a subject raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung,  Mr  Sin

Boon  Ann, Mr Ravindran and Mr Low Thia Khiang.  In these

difficult times, Members are naturally concerned that the

funds  allocated  for defence are spent wisely  and  with

care  to  ensure that we get the maximum value for  every

dollar  spent on defence.  I want to assure Members  that

the Government and the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



Defence  are  very  conscious of the need  to  scrutinise

carefully  every area of our defence spending  to  ensure

that  there  is no wastage or unnecessary expenditure  of

our hard-earned funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word about transparency of defence spending, a

subject raised by Mr Low Thia Khiang yesterday.   By  its

very  nature, defence procurement and SAF operations  are

not  subjects  which  can  be opened  for  discussion  in

public.  Doing so will compromise our security.  And  for

this  reason,  MINDEF  has always  kept  details  of  its

spending  secret, and this is the practice in many  other

countries.  This policy has worked and there is no reason

to change it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the context of the security environment,

which  I  have outlined, adequate spending on defence  is

not  an  optional  priority for the Government.   Nor  is

adequate  spending on defence just a desirable objective.

For  Singapore,  adequate  spending  on  defence  is   an

absolute necessity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security is the basic foundation on which we sustain

our  nationhood  and  build Singapore's  future.  Without

security,  there  can  be  no  economic  development   or

political   stability.   There   will   be   no   foreign

investments,  for  who  will want  to  put  money  in  an

insecure  small  country.  And, most critically  of  all,

without security, Singaporeans will have no confidence in

our  future.   Simply put, without a strong and  credible

SAF, there is no Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this light that I listened with

astonishment to Mr Chandra Mohan's thoughts  on  defence,

military  spending  and  global peace  and  harmony.   Mr

Chandra  Mohan argues essentially that the less we  spend

on  the  military, the greater could be  the  chances  of

peace.   Sir, the real world is quite different from  the

rosy picture drawn by Mr Chandra Mohan.  The fact of  the

matter  is, no matter how much we may wish it to  be  so,

less   military  spending  does  not  mean  more   peace.

Adequate  defence  spending is the insurance  premium  we

have to pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



for  peace.  We have to invest in defence so that  we  do

not need to go to war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing more tempting to a potential

aggressor  than a soft and easy target.  If we are  weak,

those  who want to impose their will on us may be tempted

to go beyond spouting the rhetoric of war to actually try

to  use military force to subjugate us or prevent us from

pursuing  our national interests.  If we want  peace,  we

have to prepare for war.  This is the basis of our policy

of   deterrence.   We  best  avoid  war  not  by   merely

advocating love and peace but by deterring those who  may

have  aggressive  designs  on our  security,  territorial

integrity  and national interests.  Potential  aggressors

must  know  that  the  cost of any  military  adventurism

against Singapore would be too high for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me make one point clear. Singapore is not

looking  for  a  fight with anyone. We have  put  a  high

priority   on   developing   cooperation   and   mutually

beneficial relations with the countries around  us.   And

we  have every interest in seeing our neighbours do well,

because  an economically thriving and politically  stable

region  is  important for Singapore's  own  security  and

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore desires friendly and cooperative relations

with   all  countries  in  our  region.   But  such  good

relations must be based on the fundamental principle that

Singapore  is  a sovereign nation with our  own  national

interests to safeguard and to promote.  Having a credible

defence  capability ensures that we will  not  be  pushed

around.  The SAF gives us the space to pursue Singapore's

own best interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SAF has been systematically built up over

more than three decades.  Developing a defence capability

takes  careful,  long-term planning and  investment.   It

requires  a  strong  and steady commitment.   It  is  not

possible to build up significant defence capabilities  at

short   notice.    We   cannot   develop   our   military

capabilities  in  a coherent manner and  plan  and  spend

prudently if we adopt a feast-and-famine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



approach, where we spend only in good years and cut  back

drastically in bad years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security threats can appear much more quickly than

it  takes  to develop the capability to deal  with  them.

The  steady  commitment  of the Singapore  Government  to

developing our defence capability, and the support  which

Singaporeans give to this, have not escaped the notice of

others.   It  is  as much our military  hardware  as  the

commitment  of the Government and our people to  ensuring

Singapore's security that underpin our deterrence policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, deterrence is one pillar of our defence policy.

The  second pillar is diplomacy, a subject raised  by  Dr

Ong  Chit  Chung  and  Mr Ravindran.   Singapore  desires

friendship   and   cooperation  with   other   countries,

particularly those which share common strategic interests

with  us.  MINDEF therefore puts significant efforts into

developing defence relations.  This pays off in terms  of

enhancing our security in a number of ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have interactions with armed forces and defence

establishments in our own region and all over the  world.

These include military exercises, military-to-military as

well  as  policy discussions, interaction  programmes  at

various levels, and cross-attendance of military training

courses.   The  SAF has access to training facilities  in

about  a dozen countries.  At the multilateral level,  we

conduct land, naval and air exercises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these interactions not only help to develop

friendship and mutual understanding and confidence,  they

also   offer   benefits  in  terms  of  the  professional

development  of  our servicemen, including  our  National

Servicemen who participate in these exercises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training and exercising with advanced militaries,

for example, the various services of the US armed forces,

allow the SAF to benchmark itself against the best in the

world.   The fact that advanced armed forces are keen  to

expand the scope and complexity of their military



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



exercises  with the SAF, reflects their high  regard  for

the  professionalism  of the SAF.  Our  cooperation  with

foreign  armed  forces also allows for collaborations  in

defence    technology,   and   we   have   had   fruitful

collaborations  with countries such as  the  US,  France,

Sweden and Israel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung has asked whether MINDEF has

enough  resources  to  tackle both conventional  military

threats and low intensity conflicts or LICs.  He has also

asked about our efforts to combat terrorism.  Dr Ong  has

zeroed in on the critical issue of security, and that is,

the  spectrum of threats, and potential threats that face

Singapore,  has  expanded.  This is one important  reason

why we are seeking an increased budget for defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 11th September 2001, MINDEF and our other

security agencies, as well as non-security agencies which

provide expertise to deal with the wide range of LIC  and

terrorist  threats,  have been working  hard  to  quickly

develop  our  capabilities to  deal  with  such  threats.

These  are  fundamentally different in  nature  from  the

security  challenges that we have had to  tackle  in  the

past.  Global catastrophic terrorism, in particular, is a

complex  threat  which impacts on all dimensions  of  our

national life.  The target is not just our security,  but

also our economy and the fabric of our society.  And  the

threat  is constant.  It is sustained.  Our response  has

to   be  multi-faceted,  and  it  must  be  coherent  and

integrated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In counter-terrorism, the effort has to be a multi-agency one, not only because of the multi-dimensional

nature of the threat but also because this allows  us  to

maximise  our  limited national resources.  The  National

Security Secretariat, which is an inter-agency department

located  in  MINDEF to coordinate this effort,  has  made

significant  progress in all three areas  of  prevention,

protection and consequence management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of prevention, intelligence is critical

and  we  have  had  good cooperation  with  our  regional

countries.   One of the most significant results  yielded

by this cooperation with our neighbours was the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



arrest  of  Mas  Selamet  Kastari,  the  leader  of   the

Singapore JI group.  The JI here has been crippled  after

the  arrest  of its members, but the threat of  terrorism

has  not  been  eradicated and we  cannot  afford  to  be

complacent.  We have to harden our defences so that we do

not  offer  tempting targets.  And all Singaporeans  will

have to remain alert and vigilant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that we are living in

uncertain  times.   Singapore is more vulnerable  to  the

influence  of  the external environment than  most  other

countries.   We  now have to grapple with  new  and  more

complex  threats  even  as we  have  to  continue  to  be

prepared  for  conventional  threats.   The  spectrum  of

threats  has  expanded  and  we  must  have  the  defence

capabilities to deal with the whole range of  threats  if

we  want to ensure Singapore's security.  The demands  on

our security apparatus have grown significantly.  We have

to  grapple with more issues.  We have to build  up  more

capabilities.  We have to develop more systems.  We  have

to  conduct more activities.  And we have to  do  all  of

these  within  the limits of our manpower, including  our

National Service resources.  These heavier demands on our

security  system  will continue for some  time  to  come,

given  that  the security environment in  our  region  is

unlikely to improve significantly for some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, to reiterate, security is the most

basic  requirement for our survival and continued success

as  a  nation.  The Singapore Armed Forces and our  other

security agencies must have the hardware and systems, and

Singaporeans  must  have the commitment  and  resolve  to

ensure Singapore's security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have dealt with most of the points raised by

Members.   The  other points will be  dealt  with  by  my

colleagues in the Defence Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong has already gone on a peace

mission.  Dr Maliki.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Before he

goes on to a peace mission in Pedra Branca ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Just carry on with your speech.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, the world has

seen tremendous amount of unsettling events, some of them

are  very unnerving.  While most of these events happened

in  other  countries, we often feel their ripple effects,

especially  when some of these happened so close  to  our

homes.  In a global village, everyone has a role to  play

in  maintaining  peace and order.  I am pleased  to  note

that  Singapore  is an active participant  in  UN  peace-keeping  missions.  Such missions not  only  provide  our

servicemen   with   invaluable  opportunities   to   gain

frontline  experience and build up confidence, they  also

ensure    Singapore's   presence   and   commitment    to

international and regional peace and stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that SAF personnel have been

involved in peace-keeping missions for the past 12 years.

This  is  certainly  an impressive track  record,  and  I

understand  that in this period, more than 900 personnel,

if   not  more,  have  been  deployed  in  various  peace

missions.  The duration of such missions, as I understand

it,  is, on average, about a year.  I would like to raise

two concerns that I have in this regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is on the issue of the mental health of SAF

personnel who have gone for such missions.  Studies of US

military personnel deployed to peace-keeping missions  in

places  such  as Somalia and Bosnia found  that  some  of

these  personnel  were  at risk of post-traumatic  stress

disorder (or PTSD), having been exposed to stresses  like

witnessing   the  aftermath  of  death  and  destruction,

observing sufferings and experiencing stress about peace-keeping  duties.    Sir, my questions are: what  are  the

processes  that these personnel were made to  go  through

before  and  after their peace missions  to  ensure  that

their  mental  health needs are met?  Have any  of  these

personnel shown any signs of PTSD, and, if so,  what  has

been done to assist them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern I have, Sir, is with regard to

the welfare of families



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



of personnel deployed in peace-keeping missions.  Another

study  involving  Australian military personnel  sent  to

peace-keeping missions highlighted the need for care  and

consideration  to be given to families  of  personnel  or

individuals on deployment.  Deployment of personnel is  a

very stressful time for families.  If personnel return to

difficult  family  situations, they  are  potentially  at

greater risk of developing chronic trauma symptoms.   The

study  also  found that good social support is  a  strong

factor   in   preventing  the  development  of  traumatic

symptoms.  My questions in this regard are: what is being

done  to  support families of personnel  sent  to  peace-keeping   missions?    How  are  families   assisted   in

understanding and supporting their members who have  gone

to  these peace-keeping missions to ease transition  when

they  return home?  And have such personnel faced  family

problems  upon their return from such missions?   If  so,

what is being done to assist them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise the value of such peace-keeping missions

have  on  Singapore  as  a country.   I  think  there  is

tremendous value for these individuals too.  However,  if

we  do  not  pay  attention to the  above  issues,  these

benefits  may be easily challenged with negative  effects

and  they  may end up being more costly to the personnel,

their families, and Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, you can take both cuts

together.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, my apologies for the

mistake earlier and the incursions, which are unintended,

unlike  the  Malaysians' incursions into our  territorial

waters at Pedra Branca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysian vessels continue to intrude into our

territorial   waters,  despite  Singapore  and   Malaysia

committing  the issue of Pedra Branca for ruling  at  the

International Court of Justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister whether our Navy will

increase  its patrols in our territorial waters at  Pedra

Branca.   What  measures can be taken to prevent  further

intrusions into our territorial waters?  What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



if  the  Malaysian patrol vessels refused  to  leave  our

territorial waters?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the collision between a commercial ship and our

Navy  ship,  RSS  Courageous, off Pedra Branca  was  most

unfortunate and tragic, and we grieved over the  loss  of

four  lives.  We were told that investigations are  still

in progress.  But much time has passed, and we wonder why

there   is   such   a  long  delay  in   completing   the

investigations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many unanswered questions. For

example, how did the accident occur when both crews  were

aware  that  the  ships  were on a  collision  path?   In

particular,  the crew of RSS Courageous had  sighted  the

commercial  ship on its radar and also through  its  duty

watch officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question uppermost in the minds of many is whether

the   accident  reflects  and  affects  the   operational

readiness  of  the Navy.  Further, what are  the  lessons

that  we  can  draw  from this accident,  and  are  these

lessons  being  followed up and internalised  within  the

Navy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, it is best to complete the

investigations speedily.  We should conclude and draw the

right lessons, and then the Navy could move on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, like my colleague

before  me,  I  just want to say that  some  months  have

passed since the occurrence of the incident involving the

collision  between a commercial ship and RSS  Courageous.

We   lost  four  brave  daughters  in  that  tragic   and

unfortunate event.  And to this day, one is still missing

in the open sea.  Our hearts go out to the families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions that I would like to ask were touched

on  by  Dr  Ong in his comments earlier.  In addition  to

those questions, I would like to ask whether or not  this

accident  was  a result of a systemic error  or  a  human

error.   And  if  it  was  a systemic  error,  would  the

Ministry give us an assurance that such an incident  will

not  happen  again?  I would like to have  an  indication

from the Minister when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



Ministry is likely to be in a position to give us a  full

account of what happened.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, when the

collision  between  the  RSS  Courageous  and   the   ANL

Indonesia  took  place on the night of 3rd  January  this

year,  it  immediately  sent  shock  waves  of  disbelief

throughout  the country.  The immediate response  of  the

Navy  in  searching  for the bodies  of  those  who  were

missing  and  in  giving much emotional  support  to  the

families was the correct thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that passage of seaway is an extremely busy

one.   Hundreds of ships pass by every day.  So  we  must

know  what steps can be taken to prevent such an accident

and  tragedy  from  happening again.  I  recall  that  in

January,  when this matter was raised in the  House,  the

Minister  told  us that the Maritime and  Port  Authority

would  finish its investigations by the end  of  January.

But  until now, we have heard nothing.  We were also told

that  the  findings would be made public and that  MINDEF

would also conduct its own board of inquiry.  May I  also

ask whether MINDEF's findings would be made public?



<br>11.45 am



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that investigations of this nature have

to  be  very  thorough.  But the delay in completing  the

investigations  and  presenting  their  report  are   not

helpful  to the image of the Navy and that of  our  Armed

Forces.   The  delay of this nature would  just  lead  to

unnecessary,  unfair and wild speculation.   And  only  a

full  accounting will put this matter to rest  and  allow

the  families  who lost their loved ones  to  close  this

tragic chapter and move on with their lives.  Above  all,

we  must  be able to assure the many people who  dedicate

themselves  to  the security of our nation,  as  well  as

their families, that lesson has been learnt and that  all

steps are being taken to avoid accidents and tragedies of

a similar nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my question is: why have the investigations taken

so long to complete and when will the report be ready?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, the United Nations' peace-keeping missions

play  a critical role in bringing peace and stability  to

troubled  areas.   And  as a responsible  member  of  the

international community, Singapore tries to make a useful

contribution to this effort and we will continue to do so

within our means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1989, Singapore has participated in 13 UN

missions,  with a total of 1,235 SAF personnel  who  have

participated  in these UN missions.  SAF  servicemen  are

currently serving in UN missions in Timor-Leste  and  the

Ethiopia-Eritrea  and  Iraq-Kuwait  border  areas.    Our

participation  in  the  UN  mission  in  Timor-Leste,  or

UNMISET,  is  our  largest to date.  We have  253  people

there  currently.   Right now, the  Singapore  contingent

comprises  160  peacekeepers, 72 men  in  the  helicopter

detachment, several staff officers, and there are also 25

police  officers  there.   A senior  SAF  officer,  Major

General  Tan  Huck  Gim, is Force Commander  of  UNMISET.

Besides doing our part as a member of the UN and making a

direct contribution to peace and stability in our region,

the  SAF's  participation in UNMISET and other UN  peace-keeping  missions has also gained us valuable operational

experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SAF prepares its servicemen thoroughly

before  they  are sent on UN missions.   They  are  given

rigorous training, which is operational in nature, and we

give them briefings on the legal aspects, what rules  are

in  place, and we also give them training in country  and

cultural  familiarisation.  This is to help prepare  them

to  handle any situation that they might face.  They  are

also  given  psychological counselling,  both  for  their

mission  and for their long period of absence from  home.

In  addition,  MINDEF has a comprehensive support  system

for  the  families  of the servicemen.  Liaison  officers

make regular home visits and assist the families, and the

families can also call hotlines when they need assistance

or  information.   We also, of course, appreciate  visits

and  the  concern  shown by Dr Ong and  others  who  have

visited our troops in Timor-Leste.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have any records of servicemen suffering

from  post  traumatic stress disorder.  But  we  do  have

psychiatrists   in   the   SAF   Medical   Services   and

psychologists   in   our  Applied  Behavioural   Sciences

Department  who monitor those individual servicemen,  not

just  those  on missions, such as these, as well  as  the

morale of our units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung and several others have also asked

about  Pedra Branca.  Sir, our Navy and the Police  Coast

Guard  patrol  Singapore's territorial waters  off  Pedra

Branca  round the clock.  We will continue to  do  so  to

safeguard   Singapore's   sovereignty   and   territorial

integrity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures we have in place and the various

contingency plans that we have are adequate to deal  with

violations of our sovereignty in the waters around  Pedra

Branca by Malaysian state vessels.  While Malaysian state

vessels  have  not always complied immediately  with  our

instructions to leave,  they do leave eventually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia and Singapore have signed a Special

Agreement  on  6th  February to refer  the  Pedra  Branca

dispute  to  the  International Court of Justice  and  we

should  both allow the legal process to take its  course.

It  is  unfortunate that Malaysian naval vessels continue

to  violate  our territorial waters around Pedra  Branca,

even though the Malaysian government knows full well that

this  will  not  advance their case in the  International

Court  of Justice.  Such violations could lead to a tense

situation  on  the  ground  and  increase  the  risk   of

unintended incidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Tan

Soo  Khoon have asked about the collision between the RSS

Courageous and ANL Indonesia. Sir, MINDEF had convened  a

Board   of   Inquiry  into  the  collision  between   RSS

Courageous  and the merchant vessel, ANL Indonesia.   The

Board  of  Inquiry has completed its work and MINDEF  has

provided a summary of the Board of Inquiry's findings  to

the  Coroner to facilitate the Coroner's Inquiry.  MINDEF

has  also  fully  cooperated with the Maritime  and  Port

Authority in its investigation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



into  the accident.  The MPA's investigation report  will

be  released in due course.  I do not expect that it will

take  very much longer.  That will contain a full account

of the events leading up to the collision.  Let me assure

Members  of this House that MINDEF, the SAF and the  Navy

are  also  as interested as Members here in finding  out,

getting  to  the bottom of this collision, learning  from

the lessons and moving on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crew of RSS Courageous has undergone counselling

and   assessment   to   prepare  them   for   operational

deployment.  In addition, RSN has re-examined its  safety

practices  and  shipboard  safety  procedures  have  been

reinforced.    The   RSN   has   also   re-examined   its

professional training systems, and steps have been  taken

to  further enhance the training and qualification system

for  Officers of the Watch.  Sir, morale in the RSN  was,

of  course, affected by this accident.  But the RSN is  a

strong family and our people have recovered, learnt  from

the  tragic incident and moved on.  They are, after  all,

fully  aware  of  the  onerous and potentially  dangerous

nature  of military duty, and they know that they have  a

job  to  do.   The  men and women of the Navy  are  fully

professional,  and the Navy's operational  readiness  was

not affected by this accident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the men and women of the SAF dedicate their

lives  to the service of our nation.  The tragic loss  of

our  four servicewomen in the collision of RSS Courageous

is  a sad reminder of how those who serve in the SAF work

under  tough  and,  sometimes,  dangerous  conditions  to

protect  Singapore's security.  The Navy  plays  a  vital

role in the defence of Singapore and will continue to  do

so  with  full  dedication and the  highest  professional

standards.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the SAF is a small National

Service  armed  force.   It relies  on  the  elements  of

intelligence, mobility and firepower.  The SAF has to  be

a  few  steps  ahead  of its rivals,  in  terms  of  arms

procurement, weapons systems and defence technology.   In

a conflict, we must use our cutting edge in technology to

overrun and overwhelm the enemy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



Hence, arms procurement and defence technology are  vital

to the SAF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this scenario, how does MINDEF ensure that

our   arms   purchase   meet  our   defence   needs   and

requirements?   Do we also leverage on our own  homegrown

defence R&D to achieve superiority in the battlefield?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have our submarines, stealth frigates,

bionics  armoured vehicles and Apache attack helicopters.

However,  other  countries  are  catching  up   and   are

acquiring  new and advanced weapons and weapons  systems.

How   do  we  therefore  ensure  that  our  technological

headstart  or  competitive  advantage  in  technology  is

maintained in the future?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read that SAF is embarking on a joint development

of  the  F35  joint fighters with the United  States  and

other  countries.   This is a new initiative  and  a  new

trend.   What are the benefits for Singapore in embarking

on the joint development of such prototype aeroplanes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, when the Defence Science and

Technology Agency (DSTA) was set up some three years ago,

one  of  the concerns raised in this House is whether  it

will  collaborate with the private sector to ensure  that

some  R&D  is  undertaken by the private sector  together

with  the  involvement of the academia.  As  one  of  the

biggest  R&D  organisations,  if  not  the  biggest   R&D

organisation  in  Singapore, I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister   for  Defence  as  to  what  extent  DSTA   has

collaborated with the private sector and the academia  to

ensure  that  many  of  these R&D  projects,  which  have

military  application,  can  be  tapped  by  DSTA.   And,

secondly, in particular, I would like to ask as  to  what

extent DSTA has passed on some of the technology that  is

developed  for  military application  for  usage  in  the

civilian sector, and vice-versa.  And as to the extent to

which  it  has tapped on some of the application  of  R&D

results  that  have been achieved in the private  sector,

how much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



of  it  has  been taken over for military application  by

DSTA?



<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I am glad

to  note the ERC's recommendations for the enhancement of

our human capital.  Towards this end, we should spare  no

effort  in  allowing  our young human  resource  as  much

opportunity  as  possible  to  strengthen.    Our   fresh

graduates today face very severe competition in  the  job

market, reportedly the worst ever in the last five years.

The percentage of the fresh graduates not able to find  a

job  after graduation has grown by close to 10%  year  on

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that while we open our economy and

job market to foreign talents, we need to remove some  of

the measures that blunt the competitive edge of our young

human  resource pool.  Our young graduates are not facing

only  competition in the local job market  on  an  uneven

playing field, but also worldwide.  The size of China and

India's   populations  allows  them  to  produce   bright

professionals in abundance.  They have an edge  over  our

graduates because they join the workforce earlier as they

do  not  have  to do national service.  Age to  age,  the

graduates  in  these countries would have some  years  of

working experience versus our own fresh graduates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of mandatory conscription, we are amongst

the  minority in the world.  I had moved this issue  last

year  and  am raising it again this year, as the Minister

had  responded  last  year that  the  Ministry  would  be

relooking into the period of national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the smallness of our population would dictate

that  our defence philosophy and strategy are not  solely

dependent  on size.  Throughout history, there  are  many

examples  of  military contests when numeric  superiority

does  not dictate the outcome.  This is especially so  in

the  present day where threats are from terrorist groups,

such  as  JI  and  the  Al  Qaeda.   Unlike  conventional

threats,  terrorist groups operate in the  dark.   It  is

almost similar to that of guerilla warfare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



and,  hence,  keeping large armies  is  no  guarantee  of

strength or security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thus asking the Minister for Defence to

expeditiously, with the timetable, review the  length  of

national   service   for  our  young   and   shorten   it

appropriately  and deliver a compact training  period  to

develop our defence force instead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, National

Service  is  the duty that our sons undertake with  pride

and  honour.   It  is an essential part of  our  military

defence.   Our  national sportsmen, on  the  other  hand,

contribute  to  our  psychological  and  social  defence.

Whenever they won, and when our national flag was  raised

and  Majullah  Singapura was played, pride,  passion  and

patriotism surged through us and we cheered for  them  as

one   people  and  one  nation  regardless  of  race  and

religion.  With the understanding and accommodation  made

by  the Ministry of Defence, it has been possible for our

national sportsmen doing NS to train and compete for  our

nation  without compromising the standard and demands  of

National Service.



12.00 noon



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that national sportsmen doing NS

has  a  special role to play in addition to  doing  their

military service.  Winning for Singapore whilst doing  NS

not  only brings pride and joy to our nation, family  and

to  oneself,  it  also  serves as a  morale  booster  and

inspiration  to the section, platoon, company,  battalion

and  to  all NSmen, and inspire them to want to do  their

best for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, like Oliver Twist, I am asking for more. I am

asking  the  Ministry  to  recognise  the  value  of  our

national  sportsmen in NS, and allow  them  even  greater

flexibility for them to excel for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, reservists have a

duty to the nation during reserve ICT, which they fulfill

gladly.  However, as they progress in their careers, they

also  face  increasing demands on  their  time  from  the

families and jobs.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



am  glad  that  MINDEF has been moving towards  a  system

whereby experienced reservists who have performed well in

their  individual units have been allowed to move towards

individualised  training  for upkeep  of  their  military

skills,  rather  than having to take part in  large-scale

ICT all the time.  This is a move in the right direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reservists go into in-camp training, I am also

glad  to note that the administration of in-camp training

has  been much improved, and the morale of servicemen  is

often  very  high.   I  had  the  privilege  recently  of

observing a live-firing exercise in New Zealand.  Despite

having  had  to put up with cold and windy conditions  in

the field, the camaraderie, esprit de corps and morale of

the   servicemen  concerned  were  very  high,  as  their

technical  proficiency and standards.  This is  all  very

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also hope that the SAF would do more to

improve  the  administration and in-processing  speed  of

reservists  when  they come for recall  manning,  because

despite this being more low key, reservists also have  to

drop  everything, get their uniforms and go back to camp.

They  answer the call of the nation.  I think it behooves

the  organisations  also  to  make  sure  that  they  are

speedily in-processed and are able to turn out into their

fighting units.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Although their

numbers are relatively small, women have made their  mark

as  regulars in the SAF.  In the last five years, we have

at least two female naval officers who commanded ships in

the  Navy,  a woman commanding officer in the  artillery,

and several women who command RSAF squadrons.  Whenever I

meet such women officers, I can feel their sense of pride

in,  first, serving their country and, second, in  rising

to  their positions in a male-dominated field.  They take

their  professions  and  their cause  of  protecting  the

country very seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they did not make much of their achievements as

women  because,  as far as they are concerned,  they  are

there on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



their  own  merits, and they want to be judged  by  their

male  counterparts and the country on the basis of  their

own abilities, leadership qualities and contributions  to

SAF.   They  work very hard to prove themselves  on  this

basis.   Their attitude is commendable.  But I also  know

that  it  has been a challenge for the women regulars  to

overcome   some   biases  and  mindsets   towards   them,

especially given this patriarchal society and their male-dominated working environment.  They take this  in  their

stride, but we need not make it harder for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fewer than one in 10 SAF regulars are women.

But  whatever their numbers - as is made clear  with  the

recent tragedy of RSS Courageous which took the lives  of

four  Navy servicewomen - women face the same dangers  as

men  while  on  professional duty.  Hence,  they  deserve

equal recognition and respect as the men in the SAF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we look at the MINDEF website, we will

find   a   video   clip   of   the   Army's   recruitment

advertisements, one for men and one for  women,  and  the

contrast  between them cannot be greater.  For  the  clip

titled  "Woman Officer", it shows a sexy woman  strutting

in  very  short  shorts in a halter top with  an  exposed

midriff,  with  a  silky tune playing in the  background.

She  gives sultry looks to a man - I think a male officer

-  and  as  she walks away, these words appear: "A  whole

world  of possibilities - Women in the Army".  I  am  not

sure  what  it meant but, watching the clip, one  of  the

possibilities that came readily to mind was  of  a  high-class karaoke hostess.  And, sometimes, looking at it, it

looks  more like an advertisement to recruit men than  to

recruit  women.  But when we contrast this with the  clip

for  men,  it  is studded with purposeful images  of  men

scanning  maps,  looking vigilant,  serious,  courageous,

protecting Singapore, and the word "Leadership" appeared,

and  the  clip ends with the words "Army 21, the decisive

force".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the clip for women regulars, which I

would say is quite sexist, demeans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



their  serious  contribution to the SAF in  securing  the

interest of Singapore.  The image portrayed also will not

help  them  in their aspiration to compete  with  men  as

equals  in  the SAF on the basis of their  abilities.   I

would  urge  the  Ministry to be more discerning  in  its

recruitment advertisements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also scanned the MINDEF recruitment advertisements

in  the  Sunday Times of 9th March 2003, and I  was  very

happy  to see the range of scholarships on offer.  But  I

find  it  curious that the SAF Overseas Scholarship,  the

most  prestigious of the lot, is open only to men, unlike

the  SAF Merit Scholarship, which is open to both  sexes.

Can  I ask the Minister what is the reason for this?   It

cannot  be  physical  fitness  because,  for  both,   the

criteria would be that they must qualify and excel in the

Officer  Cadet  School and, for both  scholarships,  they

must  have  a strong interest in a military career.   But

the SAF Overseas Scholarship is not open for women.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Ng, you have got to end your

speech soon.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> As we know, the SAF

Overseas  Scholarship  scheme has produced  a  number  of

outstanding leaders, some of whom sit here in  the  Front

bench.  The SAF Overseas Scholarship route can also be an

important  route for women to join the Front  bench,  and

that  route  is  presently  closed.   I  would  urge  the

Minister to review this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng):</b> Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about MINDEF

arms procurement and defence technology, and Mr Ravindran

has  enquired  about DSTA and whether it  is  cooperating

with other agencies like the universities and the private

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF ensures that the SAF has the best

possible  weapons and equipment to carry out its missions

effectively.    We  take  a  long-term  view   and   make

sustainable  investments of resources  to  build  up  our

capabilities to give the SAF



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



the  decisive edge.  Plans are reviewed regularly to meet

the  evolving security challenges.  When we are able  to,

MINDEF  buys  equipment  off-the-shelf,  to  exploit  the

efficiencies of the marketplace.  Sometimes,  we  upgrade

existing  equipment,  if that is the most  cost-effective

way to give us the capability that we need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is the upgrade of our F5 fighter

aircraft.  The programme has given the RSAF enhanced air-to-air  capability  at  a  fraction  of  the  cost  of  a

comparable  new  aircraft.   We  also  conduct  our   own

technology  development in areas where  we  have  special

requirements, and we do our development for  systems  and

technologies  that  we cannot buy from  the  market,  for

instance,  in  fields, such as electronic warfare,  cyber

security, chemical and biological defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investments in defence technologies have yielded

significant  technological capability  for  MINDEF,  SAF,

Defence  Science  and  Technology  Agency,  DSO  National

Laboratory, and ST Engineering.  DSTA has strong  systems

engineering   capability.    DSO   National    Laboratory

undertakes secret edge applied defence research,  and  ST

Engineering has developed strong systems integration  and

engineering  capabilities, and  they  have  designed  and

developed  such advanced weapons systems  as  the  Bionix

Infantry   Fighting  Vehicle,  and  the   Endurance-class

Landing Ship Tank.  All these taken together constitute a

significant   and   sustainable  advantage   in   defence

technology for our armed forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF, naturally, has also leveraged on the

capabilities  of  other organisations in  Singapore.   We

routinely tap the expertise in Temasek laboratories,  the

research institutes, and the talents in NUS, NTU and  the

polytechnics  for less sensitive work.   Local  companies

and start-ups that can offer innovative solutions for the

SAF operations also receive MINDEF funding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked about Singapore's participation in the

JSF programme.  Our participation in this programme as  a

security  cooperation participant gives  Singapore  early

access to operational and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



technical  information related to the JSF.  The programme

aims  to  develop an advanced multi-role  new  generation

stealth  fighter.  The JSF, or F35 as it is  known,  will

have  enhanced combat survivability, precision engagement

and  lower  cost of maintenance.  Singapore is the  first

Asian country to join the JSF programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran also asked about dual-use technology

and,  where  applicable, would MINDEF  and  its  agencies

explore such dual-use technology, and the answer is  yes.

Dual-use technology would help reduce the overall cost of

defence  procurement, and ST Engineering  routinely  does

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong Weng Chiew described the poor job market

which Singapore fresh graduates are facing, and the  fact

that  our  young  male citizens have had to  do  National

Service  compared  to their counterparts  in  some  other

countries,  and  he  asked if the  length  for  full-time

National Servicemen can be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, National Service plays a vital role in

safeguarding  the security and sovereignty of  Singapore,

with National Servicemen forming the backbone of the SAF.

It  is  therefore important that National Servicemen  are

well  trained, proficient and operationally  ready.   The

length of full-time National Service is determined by the

time  required  to train our National Servicemen  to  the

required  level  of military proficiency, especially  for

military commanders.  They are trained not only to handle

their  own  equipment,  but also  to  be  able  to  fight

effectively   as  an  integrated  force.   Our   National

Servicemen have to operate at the battalion, brigade  and

up  to  the  division levels.  The use of technology  and

sophisticated  weapons  systems  has  given  the  SAF   a

decisive  capability edge.  But soldiers still require  a

significant  period  of training and  familiarisation  to

operate these advanced weapons systems proficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has carefully reviewed the length of full-time NS and decided that it would be prudent to maintain

the  current NS duration.  The regional security  climate

remains volatile and uncertain, as many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



Members  of  the  House have pointed  out.   We  need  to

maintain our vigilance and ability to respond effectively

to a wide range of security threats.  Reducing the length

of NS would impact on the ability of our units to fulfill

their  missions, and we cannot compromise the operational

readiness and effectiveness of the SAF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, MINDEF would not want Singaporeans

to  spend  more time than necessary for NS  duties.   For

this  reason,  enlistees who have the required  level  of

physical  fitness  do  not have to undergo  the  physical

training phase before Basic Military Training.  Those who

achieve  at  least  a  Silver Standard  in  the  National

Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) test therefore enjoy a  2-month reduction in full-time NS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF recognises the sacrifices that NSmen have

made  in  order  to  protect Singapore.   Therefore,  the

Government  has  done various things  to  recognise  such

contributions by our NSmen, and these included  a  higher

allocation    for   New   Singapore   Shares,    Economic

Restructuring Shares, tax reliefs, as well  as  the  many

SAFRA  clubs that are provided for the benefit  of  NSmen

and their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support by Members in this House, as Dr Warren

Lee  has  pointed  out, the fact that ICT  has  improved,

morale  and  standards are high.  Such  recognition  that

Members of the House give to our National Servicemen is a

laudable one.



<br>12.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng Ser Miang asked about sportsmen in National

Service.  National Service is the responsibility  of  all

able-bodied  male  Singaporeans, including  athletes,  to

safeguard   our  nation  and  to  protect  our  families.

Nevertheless,  MINDEF  recognises  that  enlistment   for

National  Service  can  cause  some  disruptions  to   an

athlete's sports training programmes.  Hence, efforts are

taken  to minimise the impact of National Service on  the

sports training of our top athletes and, at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



same time, to ensure that they are adequately trained for

the  defence of the nation.  That is the primary  purpose

of National Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF allows a small number of the top national

sportsmen  to  train  in their respective  sports,  while

undergoing   their  full-time  National   Service.    The

sportsmen  must  first  complete  their  Basic   Military

Training,  Military  Leadership or  Vocational  Training.

Thereafter,  they would be deployed to serve in  military

units  and  they are eligible to be granted  time-off  to

undergo  sports  training  and  competitions.   Full-time

National  Servicemen  representing  Singapore  in   major

international  or regional competitions  may  be  granted

unrecorded leave or even disruption from National Service

to participate in these events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that always arises is how much further

we  can  do and how much more flexible MINDEF can be.  We

have also, in some instances, allowed officials, who have

accompanied  such sportsmen, time-off  to  take  on  such

duties.  However, it is always debatable as to the  level

of  proficiency and competency of a particular sportsman.

Many  claim to be a lot more able than they actually are.

Bearing  in  mind  that the main purpose  of  NS  is  the

defence  of the nation and military training, MINDEF  has

to be selective as to who we allow such unrecorded leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee commented on our mobilisation

exercises and the fact that many of our NSmen have  full-time  careers to attend to and whether or not MINDEF  can

be  more  efficient in the In-and-Out processing of  such

NSmen  when  they  come  back  for  ICT  or  mobilisation

exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF recognises that a large part of such

inefficiency today lies in manual processing  of  In-and-Out  processing.   MINDEF has been leveraging  on  IT  to

improve  NS  administration  in  general.   MIW.com,   an

Internet  website  is  one such initiative.   It  enables

NSmen  to carry out a variety of transactions with MINDEF

electronically,  such  as make-up  pay  claims,  overseas

notification and IPPT booking.  Electronic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



transactions  will  be extended to  as  many  aspects  of

National Service administration as possible.  In  respect

of  call-up administration, MINDEF has been conducting  a

trial  to  administer  in/out processing  electronically.

This  will reduce processing time by up to 50%.  Once  it

is  proven, the electronic in/out processing system would

be extended to all call-ups and mobilisation  exercises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng has commented about service women in the

SAF.   Indeed, service women in the SAF have  made  their

mark.   They  have done well, and continue  to  do  well.

MINDEF  provides  opportunities to both male  and  female

military  personnel in recruitment, training, advancement

and,  wherever possible, deployment.  Women compete  with

men   for   scholarships,  academic  awards  and   career

advancement.   Women  have a role  in  the  SAF.   MINDEF

recognises the value that they bring to the SAF and, over

the  last  five years, we have between 2-6 service  women

holding  appointments as Commanding Officers of  the  SAF

units  at  any  point  in  time.   Women  contribute   to

increasing the operational readiness of the SAF.  The SAF

has   often   depicted   its   service   women   in   its

advertisements,  posters and pamphlets.  These  publicity

materials  raise  the overall profile  of  women  in  the

service  and  help the SAF to attract women to  join  the

organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Ng pointed out to a certain advertisement on the

army  website  and  observed that it  may  be  sexist  in

nature.  We will take a look at the website again and  if

it  is so, we would make the necessary corrections.   The

SAF   will  continue  to  give  its  service  women   due

recognition  and  to  educate the public  on  the  career

opportunities and the significant role that women play in

the SAF.



<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, I agree with my parliamentary

colleagues that everybody's contribution matters  in  the

total  defence of a nation, whether male or female, young

or  old, and whatever roles we might play.  In a conflict

that  we are increasingly going to be seeing in the world

of  tomorrow,  there may be no frontline as  such.   With

weapons of mass



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



destruction,   low   level  intensity,   conflicts   with

terrorist acts, the role of homeland defence takes  on  a

new importance.  The lack of a front in the new types  of

warfare  means that Singapore's approach of having  total

defence is absolutely correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would call upon our Government to review how we

can  improve  the  roles of the Civil  Defence  Executive

Committees and their volunteers in our heartlands to  see

how they can be better trained and how their roles can be

better  integrated  with the roles of  our  active  civil

defence  forces, as well as the SAF forces  charged  with

the  protection of our homeland. I wonder  whether  there

are  also  plans  for a larger level and a  larger  scale

exercises  in the same way that the SAF built  itself  up

from small, medium and, now, large unit exercises.



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, as I was

thinking  through  what  to say  on  this  cut  on  total

defence,  I  had written down that, given  the  realities

that  Singapore  and Singaporeans have  to  confront  and

grapple  with today, the message and importance of  total

defence  stands  out.  And this is  in  contrast  to  the

earlier years of total defence where nobody would quarrel

with the need or comprehensiveness or far-sightedness  of

the approach but perhaps neither would many be taking  it

very  seriously  because the threat scenarios  then  were

less acute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having listened to some of the views expressed

by  my parliamentary colleagues on the subject of defence

and  the  need  for defence, or even the  possibility  of

scaling  back defence in this situation, I think  I  have

taken  too  much  for granted. What I thought  was  self-evident, that we have to have strong defence, is  not  so

self-evident  after all.  I think we have to  be  careful

about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are Lion City. And as any lion or lioness that

has  to  defend the interest of the pride would know,  we

have  got to be fast, we have got to be good in order  to

defend our territory because the wildebeest, the gazelle,

the  buffaloes  would  not just  walk  into  your  mouth.

Neither would other prides just leave your



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



territory  to you.  And many a weak lion would  lose  its

lunch  to hyenas and sometimes, if you are sick, you  end

up  as the hyena's lunch.  That is a fact of life.   Even

if  some of us find the imagery of a lion too aggressive,

or  too  carnivorous, and hope that we can have something

more  vegetarian,  I  would  say  that  the  defence   of

Singapore must at least be that of a rhinoceros.  We must

never,  never  let it become that of a  sloth,  or  worse

still, a dodo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore think that it is time that we stepped up

total defence education and the practice of total defence

because the circumstances are now upon us and we have  to

take  things  seriously.  Not only the Defence  Ministry,

not   only  the  Home  Affairs  Ministry,  not  only  the

Government, but our people, all of us.  This is a  window

of  opportunity because these circumstances do cause more

people  to  take this message seriously.  To do  this,  I

urge  MINDEF to engage, not only the usual channels  like

advertisements  and  exhibitions,  but  to   engage   the

resources   of  the  CDCs,  the  IRCCs,  the   grassroots

organisations, the unions - all channels.  Because  these

channels  tap  into  different  networks  and  they  have

different  credibility  with different  segments  of  the

population.  Tap  on  this,  think  about  how   we   can

operationalise total defence better given this window  of

opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like MINDEF to think about how to tap

on  all  the different languages - all the four  language

mediums  -  in order to do this, and not just  place  too

heavy  a weightage, for example, on English.  Tap too  on

the Chinese, Malay, as well as the Tamil medium.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, the significance

and  reality  of security threats to Singapore  has  been

underscored in this House for some time now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concept of total defence has also been

introduced to Singapore for many years now.  Singaporeans

are very familiar with the five arms of total defence -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



psychological,  social,  economic,  civil  and   military

defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Education curriculum has been

introduced  to  our schools to highlight  to  the  school

children  significant  events in  our  history  with  the

objective  of making them appreciate what we  have  today

and  not take our peace for granted. This would work well

as  school  children are a captive audience.   But,  Sir,

total  defence, as the name would suggest,  requires  not

only  a comprehensive approach that addresses all aspects

of defence.  It also should be comprehensive in its reach-out to the different groups of Singaporeans. Everyone has

a part to play in protecting and defending Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we can relatively conclude that

Singaporeans are aware of the threats facing us, I wonder

whether  they  are aware of what can be done  should  the

threat become a reality.  Are Singaporeans ready for  the

first  bomb  to  go  off?   What  about  the  threats  of

biological  weapons, anthrax?  Do they know what  to  do?

Also, one quarter of our residents of the population  are

foreigners.   In times of emergencies, they  are  equally

concerned  for their safety and protection.  Would  total

defence  strategies and programmes also consider reaching

out to these foreign friends who work and reside here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions to the Minister are: with the threat

of  security  being  so complex, how do  MINDEF  and  its

partners ensure that the people understand what they have

to  do in the event of an attack or emergency?  Given the

diversity of the different target groups - professionals,

elderly,  youths, foreign workers, etc - how will  MINDEF

ensure  that these groups are effectively and efficiently

reached   out  to?   Given  the  threat  from   religious

extremists  lurking at the doorsteps and threatening  our

social  cohesion,  does  the  National  Education  Office

intend  to  work  with  the  IRCCs  in  reaching  out  to

Singaporeans?  My suggestion is it should.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have often heard civil defence exercises

being  conducted to ensure that Singaporeans are prepared

during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



emergencies.   My question is:  how successful  are  such

exercises?  Apart from the numbers present, what would be

the other indicators that MINDEF uses in ascertaining the

effectiveness of such exercises and programmes?  What, in

MINDEF's  assessment, are the groups that need  the  most

attention,  ie, the groups that often do not  participate

in  such  exercises?  What are the plans  that  would  be

adopted in reaching out to such groups?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Sir, on behalf

of  the  Minister for Defence, I would like to thank  the

three Members of Parliament, Dr Warren Lee, Mr Heng  Chee

How and Dr Maliki, for raising the important questions on

total defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the relevance and importance of total defence

has  become  more  evident, given the broad  spectrum  of

challenges   facing   Singapore  today.    Although   the

relevance  of military and civil defence has always  been

more  readily grasped and appreciated, the importance  of

the other three elements of total defence, namely, in the

economic, social and psychological defence has not always

been that clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many Singaporeans, social and psychological

defence  took on added significance after the  events  of

September  11th and the uncovering of the JI  network  in

Singapore.  It showed that our security and stability and

our  strength  as a nation also depends on religious  and

racial  harmony,  the  points  reiterated  by  all  three

Members  of Parliament, the bonding among our people  and

Singapore's commitment and loyalty to the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current economic difficulties also remind all of

us of the important contribution of a strong economy will

make  towards  the  overall strength of  our  nation  and

importance of economic defence.  Sir, the central  notion

in the concept of total defence is rightly pointed out by

Dr  Maliki  that every Singaporean has a contribution  to

our  nation's defence.  Over the past year  or  so,  many

Singaporeans  would have realised that we  have  to  pull

together



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



and  each  do  our part, because everyone's  contribution

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is particularly relevant in the context of

the  unique  nature of the threat of global  catastrophic

terrorism.  Terrorists may target our homeland  and  this

threat  could come at any time from anywhere.  Our people

must  be alert and vigilant, and help to be the eyes  and

ears  of  the  community in looking  out  for  suspicious

activities.  Singaporeans can also  do  more  to  prepare

ourselves  so  that  they  are  equipped  to  respond  to

emergencies.   We have a responsibility to ourselves,  to

our families, to our community and to our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF's Central National Education Office has

been  working  closely with all agencies,  including  the

Ministry  of Education, MITA, the Civil Service  College,

the  People's  Association and the CDC to bring  National

Education  programmes  to  different  segments   of   our

society.   Dr  Maliki urged that more could  be  done  to

cement  the  link between the total defence agencies  and

the CDCs.  This has been done and, of course, more can be

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key objectives are to develop national

cohesion, the instinct for survival and confidence in our

future.   This  is  about  building  passion,  pride  and

commitment among Singaporeans.  So, National Education is

a long-term process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has asked about the indicators of the

success  of our National Education efforts.  Sir, this is

difficult to measure because it concerns the "heartware".

But  there  are  some proxy indicators  from  the  survey

results  which prove encouraging.  For instance, the  MOE

conducted  a survey amongst students, and from  the  year

1997 to 2001, there had been a steady improvement in such

indicators, as the sense of belonging, confidence in  our

future and tolerance for racial and religious harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans also generally acknowledge the

importance  of National Education and its objectives.   A

survey  by the Central National Education Office revealed

that 77% thought so.  Different agencies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



are  actively  promoting the concept  of  total  defence.

Their  routine  publications like this booklet  on  total

defence which I can pass on to the Members of Parliament.

Occasionally, key Ministers in the Cabinet make milestone

speeches  on  total defence.  Last year, at  the  Temasek

seminar,  the Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister,

Dr  Tony Tan, made his speech on total defence making  it

relevant,  a speech which is worth reading,  and  I  will

circulate it to the three Members of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked how we could involve the 1

million non-Singaporeans living in Singapore.  The  media

has  relayed the importance of total defence to different

segments   of   the   population,  including   the   non-Singaporeans living among us, and they are also aware  of

total  defence.   In  addition, we also  invite  them  to

participate in some of the activities.  Every year, there

is  a  Total Defence Day which is held on 15th  February,

and they are invited to take part in this event.  We also

have civil defence exercises.  The exercises are open  to

all  residents living within the community.   So  if  you

live  within certain blocks of HDB flats, everybody there

is  invited to join in the exercise, whether  you  are  a

Singaporean, PR and even non-PR.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, thank you for raising the important

topic of total defence.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, listening to the hon. Members just now speaking

on  total defence and having listened to the Deputy Prime

Minister  and  Defence  Minister,  Dr  Tony  Tan,  saying

earlier  that  we  cannot  underestimate  the  threat  of

terrorism,  it  strikes me that when  we  deal  with  the

problems  of home front security, it involves  more  than

just one Ministry but several.  In terms of terrorism and

home  front  security, this House had debated this  issue

very exhaustively on the White Paper just two months ago,

and yet when we speak to our people when we meet them  in

block visits or other functions, we are surprised and, in

a  way,  disappointed  that the  message  of  home  front

security has not really sunk in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising in a way because many

Singaporeans   are  now  juggling  with  bread-and-butter

issues,   with   the   poor   economic   situation    and

unemployment,  and  they  are more  worried  about  their

livelihood, and not about other issues, but I think it is

very  important  to  emphasise that home  front  security

should  be one of the priorities in every citizen's  list

of priorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sort of people have we met? What sort of

attitudes  do  we encounter when we talk  to  them  about

terrorism and home front security?  There is a  range  of

attitudes. Some say that it is not their business.   They

leave  it  to  the  security forces   -   the  tidak  apa

attitude  or  the bo chap attitude.  Some  say  they  are

concerned but they do not know very much about it.  These

are  the uninformed people.  Much fewer say that they are

interested.   They have been trying to learn  more  about

it,  but they actually do not know what to do.  They have

received some booklets from the Home Affairs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  telling  them what to do  in  emergencies  but,

really,  they have no time to read.  And, in  any  event,

sometimes  they do not understand the language which  is,

at the moment, in English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we do have a big problem in hand. Singaporeans

have,  very  rightly, thought that they are living  in  a

very peaceful and stable country, and our security forces

must  take  the credit for it.  But we are suffering  the

fruits  of our own success, because many have decided  to

leave  it  to  the security forces to deal with  homeland

security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this scenario, I regret to say that I have to

raise  once  more  with the Minister  how  to  bring  the

reality of the terrorist threat home to the people.  What

has  the  Ministry got to do to prepare and  educate  the

people  to  be  more aware and vigilant about  terrorism?

Given the current situation where people are more worried

about  jobs than security, what should we do in order  to

be  pro-active in creating some awareness of the problems

faced  by countering terrorism?  In particular,  I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister whether there could  be  some

activity-based programmes in school and grassroots levels

to  involve the public, not just to inform them about the

security  threat but to involve them in basic  skills  on

what  to do in emergency situations  -  situations  which

were  indicated  earlier by some Members  of  this  House

concerning  biological or bio-hazard attacks and  so  on,

what  should  the people be doing. Should  we  have  more

roadshows?   Should we have more campaigns to  alert  the

people on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Chin, could you wind up your

speech, please?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, to instill greater

awareness  at  the  national  level,  can  the   Ministry

organise  national vigilance campaigns to allow Singapore

to have a sense of involvement and responsibility in home

front security?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

terrorists'  activities  on September  11  and  the  Bali

bombing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



shocked  the  world and caused a lot  of  damage  to  our

people.  The JI conspiracy in Singapore has also given us

some   very  disturbing  thoughts.   I  think  we  should

continue  to  enhance our security  awareness.   Here,  I

would like to raise three points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Changi Airport. Our Changi Airport is a

transport hub for Asia.  Millions of local travellers  as

well  as  tourists  pass through the airport  each  year.

Recently,  I travelled overseas and I can feel  that  the

security  check  at our airport is very  stringent.   The

only  thing is that the time between the arrival  of  our

luggage and until it is checked by the security personnel

could  provide  an opportunity for the terrorists  to  do

something if they so desire.  Can something be done about

it?   Can  we  just check the luggage the  moment  it  is

brought  into the airport?  Can we also  step  up  patrol

within  the  terminal buildings, so that  any  unattended

luggage could be removed for security sake?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, MRT stations. The MRT has become the

most  favoured  mode of transportation  for  our  people,

young and old.  Can there be patrols in the MRT stations,

particularly those in the busy central business district?

We  could even engage private security companies to  step

up patrol in the MRT stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is on cruises. Many of our people

are  now  going on cruises, and every cruise ship carries

thousands  of  passengers on each trip.  Should  we  also

step up our security measures on the cruises?  Otherwise,

if  anything is to happen, it will bring heavy casualties

to our people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, homeland

security requires multi-agency cooperation.  The  US  may

have  swung to one extreme with a whole behemoth  in  the

form of Department of Homeland Security.  I am not asking

for  this,  as  we have to adapt what we  have  today  in

Singapore  to  suit  our own local  requirements.   As  a

nation, we have always been better organised, allowing us

to  pull ahead with limited resources.  The formation  of

the ICA is encouraging.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



timely   disruption  of  the  JI  networks  offers   much

reassurance  that our systems are working.  However,  now

that the internal and external threats have changed, what

had  worked  for  us previously needs to be  re-examined.

There  are  lots of capabilities, both in  expertise  and

technologies,  residing in many agencies, like  the  MPA,

LTA,  MINDEF and the Police Force, etc.  Let us focus  on

the  integration of these capabilities and expertise,  so

as  to effectively combat the new threats.  I would  like

to  know whether adequate resources have been deployed to

face the new threats and that adequate attention has been

given   to  inter-agency  cooperation  and  coordination,

especially  the key trade-offs between the  economic  and

the security agencies.



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, in the last two

years  since September 11, I must compliment MHA for  its

very  comprehensive  organisation  and  planning  of  the

security   infrastructure  in  Singapore.    The   recent

educational programmes on how Singaporeans should  manage

in  the  event of a crisis as well as visits to the  bomb

shelters  and  exhibits of our security capabilities  are

very  encouraging.  Nonetheless, we know  that  terrorist

attacks  can come in many forms.  The terrorists  can  be

both  ingenious in their methods and persistent in  their

objectives.    The   acquisition  of  weapons   of   mass

destruction  is  regarded as  an  act  of  piety  by  the

terrorists,  and  they  could  very  well  already   have

chemical  and biological capabilities.  It is noted  that

most  of  the detection systems are detection for weapons

and  explosives.  Could the Minister tell us if there are

sufficient measures to detect and neutralise chemical and

biological   agents  that  could  be  smuggled   by   the

terrorists into the country?



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Sir, Singapore is a small country with 4

million   people  living  in  an  area  of   682   square

kilometres.  It is certainly one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



of  the  most densely populated places in the world.   In

addition,  of  about 3 million of our people,  there  are

about  1 million foreigners of different social, economic

and  political  backgrounds who are in  the  same  living

space  with  us.  The compact living is already  a  great

challenge  to  those  maintaining our homeland  security.

The  September 11th 2001 and October 12th 2002  tragedies

were clear warnings to the world - that there is no place

in the world that is safe from possible terrorist attack.

This  has led the security authorities all over the world

to  review  their security policies and strategies.   For

Singapore,  the arrests of Jemaah Islamiyah  members  are

clear  indications that terrorist threat to our  homeland

security is a serious and real issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, there are also the possible

implications  arising  from  an  attack  on   Iraq.    In

addition,  there  is  also  a  common  phenomenon   about

possible  increase of criminal activities  following  the

economic  slowdown.  Figures available  have  shown  that

there  has been an increase in property-related offences.

The  number  of  first-time offenders  arrested  too  has

increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this background, I would like to ask

the  Minister  whether he could update the House  on  the

latest  measures  taken to ensure  homeland  security  of

Singapore.  Realising that there is a limit to  what  the

Police  could  do, the programme known as  the  Community

Security  and Safety Programme was launched to  encourage

the  community's involvement in ensuring the  safety  and

security of our neighbourhood.  I would like to  ask  the

Minister  what  else  we can do to make  sure  that  this

programme can be more effective.



<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the

threat  of  terrorism remains, and this  may  be  further

heightened  with  the possibility of war  in  Iraq.   Has

enough been done for our homeland security, especially in

the  area of engaging Singaporeans from all walks of life

in taking ownership of the security of our country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise this question as a result of my experience

as a union leader.  Recently,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



workers    in   Jurong   Island   and   other   important

installations elsewhere in Singapore were asked  to  fill

up   questionnaire   forms,   indicating   their   family

background and other very personal data, for the  purpose

of  security as required by the authorities.  I represent

some  of  these workers.  The workers were  reluctant  to

provide  some  of the information.  They  were  reluctant

because of a lack of awareness of the seriousness of  the

issue  at stake.  The union understood the importance  of

the requirement and met the workers to explain the issue,

and  eventually  everyone came  forward  to  provide  the

information willingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeland security cannot be just left to the

Government.   Every Singaporean has a role  to  play.   I

sense   a   certain   degree  of  apathy   amongst   many

Singaporeans, and this was also pointed out by Prof. Chin

earlier.   This is the reality on the ground.  Sir,  this

brings me to ask the Minister the following questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what are the steps taken by the Ministry to

educate  Singaporeans on dealing with terrorist  threats,

including what to do if an incident occurs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, does the Ministry plan to involve the public

on  a greater level in dealing with the threats at places

of  work and public places, such as through community and

work place watch activities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, can the Minister update the House on the

various   steps  taken  to  eradicate  or  minimise   any

terrorist  acts,  including the progress and  cooperation

levels from regional countries and intelligence agencies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir,

recently  the Government announced the formation  of  the

Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).  It  is  one

of  the  measures  taken in response  to  the  threat  of

international terrorism.  Its main aim is to enhance  the

security  of our borders.  Border security reorganisation

is  also being pursued in other countries, notably in the

United   States.   There,  the  inspection  and  security

functions of three departments (Justice,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



Treasury  and  Agriculture)  are  reorganised  into   two

bureaus - one bureau to deal with border protection;  the

other  to  deal with immigration and customs enforcement.

Here,  the  immigration  and  customs  functions  at  our

borders are being amalgamated under the authority of  the

ICA.  Several issues arise here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what would this move entail? Would customs

officers now also have to cover immigration security  and

vice  versa?  While multi-tasking may be good, would  not

specialisation  and focus be more important  in  security

matters?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, would this transformation process

adversely  affect  the  efficiency  and  morale  of   our

immigration and customs officers, at least in  the  short

term?  And how are these issues being handled?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, how would the formation of the ICA affect

the  tens  of  thousands of people who cross our  borders

every  day?   While enhancing security  is  vital,  would

there  be greater inconvenience?  We do have to  bear  in

mind that Singapore's openness is key to our survival and

growth,  and  therefore it is imperative that  we  ensure

smooth legitimate traffic flow across our borders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, perhaps, most importantly, how would the

establishment  of the ICA actually enhance  our  borders'

security?  I request the Minister to give details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, the Internal Security

Department  was  established  in  February   1966.    Its

predecessors  were  the Ministry of Interior  Defence  in

1965,  after  becoming  independent  from  Malaysia;  the

Special  Branch in 1948; and after World War I  in  1919,

the  British colonial government in Singapore  called  it

the  Special Branch.  That was how the Internal  Security

Department transformed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISD has over the years become more sophisticated and

professional.   They have ensured safety for  our  nation

through   information   gathering   and   detention    of

undesirable  persons.   However, Sir,  Singaporeans  know

very  little  about the ISD, and Singaporeans,  in  fact,

fear the ISD.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



Rightly  or  wrongly, intellectuals and some  politicians

would be fearful of them if they are seen or perceived to

be  anti-government or have views that are controversial.

ISD  should,  like  the CPIB, as I have  suggested,  give

annual  reports  to  Parliament so  that  there  is  more

transparency in what they are doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of reporting lines, I believe the ISD is

part  of  the  Ministry of Home Affairs.   Does  the  ISD

report  to  the Minister for Home Affairs and  any  other

persons?   Does  it report to any Ministry  or  Minister?

Who  gets information about ISD, besides the Ministry  of

Home  Affairs?  What is the level of cooperation  between

the  ISD  and  equivalent agencies  in  ASEAN  countries,

especially  Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines?   Do

we  cooperate fully with the Special Branch of the ISD in

Malaysia?   Do we have full cooperation between  our  ISD

and international agencies of an equivalent nature?  What

is  the  budget of ISD and how transparent  are  we  with

regard  to this matter?  How much is really spent and  on

what?  Can the Minister give some sort of a breakdown  on

the  activities  and the amounts spent  on  each  sector?

Again,  on the efficacy of the ISD, what is the yardstick

to  measure  the  efficacy of the ISD,  since  all  other

Ministries are being questioned?  Perhaps the  ISD  could

reveal some of the information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of espionage, Sir, how many

Singaporeans  and  non-Singaporeans  have  been  detained

under  the Internal Security Act in the years 2000, 2001,

2002  and currently, and for what reasons?  And how  many

of  them  are  non-Singaporeans - Malaysians, Indonesians

and from other ASEAN countries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11th September 2001 was, Sir, a sad and tragic day

for  the USA and the world at large.  Singapore faces its

own  problems.  Fifteen persons were detained in December

2001  - and it was reported - for their participation  in

terrorist-related activities.  Thirteen of them,  we  are

told, are cell members of the clandestine organisation  - Jemaah  Islamiyah (JI).  Unfortunately, this  has  raised

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



problem of Muslims somehow being connected to this group,

rightly or wrongly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask, Sir, based on ISD's collection

of  information, what is the feel on the  ground  amongst

Muslims and non-Muslims in Singapore?  Are they concerned

and disillusioned by all this?  Do Muslims feel that they

are  being discriminated against by the Government and/or

other citizens?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, Singapore is facing its greatest security challenge

since  the  communist threat in the 1950s and 1960s.   If

there  is  a  war  in Iraq, then this  will  add  another

dimension to Singapore's security environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had said previously in this House, during the

debate  on  the  Jemaah Islamiyah  (JI)  White  Paper  in

January, the Government has done and will continue to  do

whatever  it  can  to  secure our  borders,  to  step  up

security  at  our  land,  air  and  sea  checkpoints,  to

strengthen the security of likely targets, to control the

spread of extremist ideology and promote social cohesion.

So  far,  we have been successful, but we cannot let  our

guard down, because we remain a target.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From intelligence sources, we are aware that the

Jemaah  Islamiyah  planning  by  Hambali  for  the   Bali

bombings started as early as February 2002.  In fact, two

bombing  attacks  were planned.  One was  for  an  attack

against Western interests in Indonesia, which the  Jemaah

Islamiyah later narrowed down to Bali.  The other  attack

was  against Singapore.  However, by mid-2002, the senior

JI  operative  assigned to stage the attack on  Singapore

reported to Hambali that he could not get the job done in

Singapore.   The target hardening measures  that  we  had

taken and the disruption of the local JI network made  it

difficult for him and he reported that he could not  find

local  helpers or "kaki tangan" to assist him.   He  then

left  to  join  the other JI operatives in Indonesia  and

went  on to stage the Bali attack which happened on  12th

October last year.  We are lucky this time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



<br>1.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have succeeded this time in pre-empting an attack

against  us.   But no one can guarantee that a  terrorist

attack  will not happen here.  Our approach  must  be  to

make  it extremely difficult to carry out their evil acts

while,  at the same time, be prepared and ready  to  deal

with the repercussions if such an attack does happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to inform

the  House of several new initiatives which we introduced

recently,  or  which would be launched soon.   We  firmly

believe  that  it  is  better  to  deny  terrorists   the

opportunity  to  carry  out  their  operations  than   to

mitigate  the  consequences of their  actions.   In  this

respect,  we have been cooperating with our regional  and

international counterparts, with good results.   And  the

efforts  of the ISD, which Mr Chandra Mohan referred  to,

have  played  a great role in securing this  cooperation.

Aviation  security  will also be  enhanced  through   new

initiatives,  such as the formation of the  Air  Marshall

Unit.    The   Police  Coast  Guard  will   upgrade   the

surveillance  capabilities and acquire newer  and  better

patrol boats to strengthen our maritime security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng may be happy to know that post-September 11, we have enhanced the checks on arriving

persons  and  their  belongings  at  our  land  and   sea

checkpoints  to 100%.  All pieces of luggage through  the

Airport are also checked.  So Mr Ang and other travellers

need  not  worry  that,  if they go  to  Changi  Airport,

luggage  would  be compromised.  The only exceptions  are

the  checks  on  cars  and goods  vehicles  at  Woodlands

Checkpoint  and  the checks on motorcycles  at  Tuas  and

Woodlands Checkpoints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the escalation of threats in the Middle

East,  we  will be enhancing our checks further  to  100%

even   at   Woodlands  Checkpoint  for   all   cars   and

motorcyclists  during the peak hours.   This  means  that

every  car and motorcycle entering Singapore at Woodlands

Checkpoint  would have their boot and utility box  opened

up for inspection.  It would also mean that all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



cargoes arriving on lorries and container trucks will  be

subjected to a certain degree of checks.  This would take

effect  today.   There may be some inconveniences  during

the peak hours and traffic jams will build up.  But it is

a  balance we have to make, and we need to make, for  the

sake  of  our security and a small price to pay  for  the

inconvenience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen our border security, we have formed a

new  agency,  the Immigration and Checkpoints  Authority,

which   merges  the  border  control  functions  of   the

Singapore  Immigration and Registration and  the  Customs

and  Excise Department into one single entity.  This will

be  formed  in  two weeks' time on 1st April.   Mr  Ahmad

Khalis  asked  what  would  be the  implications  of  the

formation  of  ICA  on border control operations  to  the

Ministry,  the public and the staff.  Firstly,  ICA  will

provide  an  integrated command over all aspects  of  our

checkpoints  operations.   This  would  enable  all   the

agencies  operating at the checkpoints to share  critical

intelligence  in  a  timely manner and  work  closely  to

coordinate  the  enforcement actions.   Over  the  medium

term,   a   study  to  re-engineer  operations   at   the

checkpoints  to  further  streamline  the  functions  and

tighten coordination between the various agencies will be

carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st April, in the short term, there is no

change  to  what the officers do.  But a study  would  be

embarked  to see how we can streamline and make  it  more

seamless  and,  at  the  same  time,  better  deploy  the

officers.  So there will be multi-tasking.  Officers will

be  trained  to do the respective tasks.  In addition  to

that, they may also be reassigned from time to time.  All

this  will be transparent to the public.  In other words,

as  far  as  the public is concerned, they  will  not  be

affected  by  any  of  the changes.   There  will  be  no

degradation  in  the  level of service  provided  to  the

public   on  1st  April  when  ICA  is  formed  formally.

Inconvenience to travellers at land checkpoints  is  not,

and will not be, due to the reorganisation.  It is due to

the   stepped-up  security  measures  that  I  have  just

mentioned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo expressed concern about the

detection,  utilisation and smuggling of  biological  and

chemical agents, and whether we are equipped to deal with

this   threat.   The  threat  of  terrorists  using  non-conventional  means,  such  as  chemical  and  biological

agents, is a very real one.  The recent uncovering  of  a

plot to carry out a ricin attack in the United Kingdom is

just  one  example.   Yet,  many  of  the  chemicals  and

precursors  necessary to produce bombs  as  well  as  the

chemicals   and   biological  agents   have   legitimate,

commercial and medical uses.  In order to deny terrorists

access  to  dual-use materials which can  also  form  the

ingredients for bombs and other non-conventional weapons,

my  Ministry  will be coordinating a national  system  to

control  the import, storage, transport and use  of  such

materials.   Given  the diverse and wide  range  of  such

chemicals,  the  full  measures  will  take  a  while  to

implement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to reduce the likelihood of terrorist

attacks  using vehicles transporting hazardous materials,

all  drivers  driving such vehicles that  transport  such

materials  into and within Singapore will be required  to

obtain   a  Hazardous  Material  (Hazmat)  Transportation

Driver's  licence with effect from 1st April  this  year.

This  will  enable us to better control and monitor  such

vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, since the sarin attack in Tokyo in

1995,  we  have  built up the capability  to  respond  to

biological  and  chemical  threats  and  are  continually

improving  upon  it.  The Singapore Civil  Defence  Force

(SCDF)  is  trained and equipped to carry out  detection,

mitigation  and decontamination of these.  We  have  seen

some  of these being exercised from time to time  in  the

public.   Together with other relevant agencies, we  have

plans   to   conduct  chemical  and  biological  response

operations and equip ourselves to deal with these.  These

plans are reviewed and exercised from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim has commented that more needs to be

done  to  leverage on technology to enhance our  security

and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



form  inter-agency cooperation groups.  We have and  will

continue to do so.  There are several inter-agency groups

focusing on different issues.  The Home Team has employed

various biometrics, explosive detection, gamma ray, X-ray

and other techniques to further augment existing security

measures.   Radiographic scanners and biometric  systems,

for  example,  are already in use at some  of  our  entry

points  and  will  be used for the Hazmat  Transportation

Drivers' Permit scheme when it is launched.  We have also

begun  pilot  trials for two days at  Parliament  for  an

under  carriage surveillance system.  Some of you  coming

to  Parliament during the first two days will notice that

there  is  something on the ground.  That  is  the  under

vehicle  surveillance system which we  are  testing  out.

This   system  is  specially  designed  to  examine   the

undercarriages  of  vehicles with greater  accuracy  than

conventional techniques like using hands to manipulate  a

mirror.   Home  Team  departments are constantly  on  the

lookout for new and emerging technologies that will  help

enhance our security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung and Mr Nithiah Nandan have asked

about  efforts  to  raise the community's  awareness  and

involvement  in the homefront security issues.   I  fully

agree that there is a need to educate our people to prime

them  to take practical steps in exercising vigilance  to

prepare themselves.  For those who are unconcerned  about

such  a threat, or totally unaware that this is a serious

threat,  I  think they will be a liability to themselves.

They  will then not be able to protect themselves  should

they  see  something suspicious.  How can  we  bring  the

message  clearly  to  the people?   We  can  have  public

education  programme  which  we  will  do,  and  I   will

elaborate  afterwards,  but  the  only  way  to  heighten

security awareness and put people to the shock is to have

a  bomb  exploding in Singapore.  I do not think  anybody

wants  that  to happen, before they wake  up  to  such  a

threat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in raising public awareness, we have launched

the   National  Security  Awareness  programme  on  Total

Defence Day on 15th February.  This programme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



aims to educate and raise the awareness of the public  on

counter-terrorism  issues.  The Singapore  Civil  Defence

Force  recently  distributed an emergency  handbook,  not

just  in  one  language, but also in other  languages  as

well,  except  that the first issue on English  came  out

earlier.   The  Chinese  and the other  version  are  now

available.   The  handbook tells the public  what  to  do

during emergency situations and a million copies of  this

have been given to a million households.  The Police  has

also  launched  a  pamphlet outlining the  measures  that

residents,  as well as the managements of buildings,  can

take  to help the Police prevent terrorism, and what they

should  do in the event of a security threat.  I  believe

that the MRT operators will also look into the suggestion

by  Mr  Ang about hiring guards, etc, and tighten up  the

security at our MRT stations.  But the Police and the MRT

authorities  as well as the operators have  been  working

closely to step up security at our MRT stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complementing this effort in raising public security

awareness  is  a  web-based portal called  the  Emergency

Preparedness   Information  Centre  (EPIC),   which   was

launched  on  22nd  February.  EPIC not  only  keeps  the

public  informed on current developments during a crisis,

or   National  Emergency,  it  also  provides  them  with

information  on how to respond to various  scenarios.   I

hope  the  public will take an interest and go and  visit

the site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise public awareness on security issues, we

have  also  expanded  the Community Safety  and  Security

Programme (CSSP).  The Singapore Civil Defence Force  has

conducted an Exercise Community Spirit activities to give

the  public an opportunity to learn about how  to  handle

emergency,  and these are done not just in our grassroots

organisations but will also be done at our schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman asked what more can be done about CSSP.

Our  Community Safety and Security Programme,  which  was

traditionally focused on local security and safety issues

for  grassroots  organisations, schools  and  workplaces,

will also be expanded to cover issues, such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



as  training in emergency preparedness skills,  community

vigilance  and  education  on preventive  measures.   For

example,  in  Sembawang GRC, the Woodlands Civil  Defence

Executive Committee has organised many such activities to

garner  resident  involvement in the  security  of  their

community.  Prof. Chin himself has been involved in this.

So  he  knows  about it.  Last year, the Singapore  Civil

Defence  Force  also conducted emergency  and  evacuation

exercises with the management, tenants and workers of the

Jurong Point Shopping Centre and a large engineering  and

construction firm.  They would do more of such  exercises

in   the   workplaces.   Through  such  programmes,   the

Government would work hand-in-hand with the community  to

raise Singaporeans' stake in the security of our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people themselves must take an interest. They

just  cannot leave it to the Government to do  everything

for  them.   If they do not take an interest,  then  they

will  have  themselves to blame if something does  happen

due to their own neglect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on the White Paper in January this

year,  I  also  pointed out the need to  maintain  social

cohesion  and  religious harmony as part of our  counter-terrorism  strategy.   Steps have  since  been  taken  to

preserve  this  as  part of our social and  psychological

defence.   One such example is the Government's Community

Involvement  Programme.   Its  goal  is  to  ensure  that

Singaporeans gain a better understanding of each  other's

culture and religion.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as far as race relations are concerned, the

question which Mr Chandra Mohan raised, I think we are in

good  shape.   But more, of course, can be  done  by  our

different  races to reach out to understand  one  another

and,  at  the same time, to know our neighbours.  Despite

all  that we have done, I would urge and advise  that  we

must   not   be  lulled  into  a  sense  of  complacency.

Ironically,   the  efficiency  of  our  security   forces

actually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



throws  the gauntlet to the terrorists who see  it  as  a

challenge.   We  must be ready for such  an  eventuality.

The Government has and will continue to work closely with

the  community to maintain Singapore as a safe and secure

best  home  that it has always been for our people.   But

that requires the people's cooperation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will answer Mr Chandra Mohan's question on

the  Internal Security Department.  He has raised several

questions, such as to whom does ISD report to, to who  it

reports  its  findings, what are  the  checks,  and  that

Singaporeans know very little about the ISD.  In fact, he

said that Singaporeans fear the ISD and there should be a

report  on the ISD to Parliament, just like some  of  the

Government departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, because Singaporeans are quite ignorant

about  the  ISA,  and  there being some  doubts  or  even

questions whether the ISA has been misused, the  Ministry

took  the initiative to publish a booklet.  I am not sure

whether  Members themselves have seen this little booklet

called  "Why  the  ISA?"  In fact, I had  once  suggested

having this entitled "Everything you wanted to know about

the  ISA  and are afraid to ask"!  It is a simple booklet

describing what is the ISA, the origin of the  ISA,  what

are the threats facing us, what are the safeguards of the

ISA,  use of preventive detention and the advisory  board

and  its  roles.   These are clearly  explained  in  this

booklet.   It also gives examples of some previous  cases

in  regard  to each of the threats.  Members who  want  a

copy of it can let me know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internal Security Department is one of the

several  departments within the Ministry of Home Affairs.

The   Director  of  the  ISD  reports  to  the  Permanent

Secretary  on  all matters pertaining to  the  Ministry's

budget  and  the financial and human resource  management

issues.   He reports to the Minister on security matters.

The  Department's budget is governed, like all Government

departments,  by  the  general financial  procedures  and

rules in the public service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



Its  operating budget allocation and its intended use are

subject  to  scrutiny by and require the support  of  the

Ministry  of  Finance within the larger budget  allocated

for the Ministry of Home Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much do we spend on the ISD, Mr Chandra Mohan

asked.  It is less than 8% of the Ministry's budget.  The

ISD's budget and expenditures are also subject to regular

audit,  like  other  Government  departments.   In  other

words,  the  money  that  it has spent,  like  any  other

Government department, is subject to tight scrutiny,  and

they have to be justified before funds are approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISD officers also exercise powers like police

officers,  because  they need them  for  law  enforcement

purposes.   But they observe the same rules  like  police

officers.   They have the same standards of  professional

discipline and conduct, and they are held accountable for

their actions.  In other words, ISD officers cannot abuse

the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gets the information, findings and the products

of  the ISD's work?  It depends on the subject matter and

who  needs to know.  The Department's work comprises many

security   portfolios  and  programmes,   including   the

subjects  of  terrorism, espionage, racial and  religious

extremism, protective security, as well as educating  the

civil    servants   on   security.    Dissemination    of

intelligence is on a need-to-know basis.  In other words,

if  you do not need to know, there is no business for you

to  know, you will not be told, and reports are sent only

to  those  who need to know.  For example, the Department

gives   security  and  intelligence  briefings   to   the

Committee of Permanent Secretaries, to keep them informed

of  the  threats and the security issues facing  us.   It

also  briefs  me  and  the Prime Minister  and,  in  some

instances,  members  of  the  Cabinet  as  well,  on  the

subjects  of national security, eg, the Jemaah  Islamiyah

case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we work with the regional counterparts? ISD

has very close relationships with its counterparts in the

region,  as  well  as with the other friendly  countries.

They  share and exchange information and they also attend

courses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



of each other's services.  They keep each other informed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we measure the efficacy of ISD? Although

there  are  some  aspects  of  its  work  which  can   be

quantified and we can have quantitative output  measures,

the   efficacy   of  the  Internal  Security   Department

ultimately  rests on the qualitative judgment of  whether

it  is  effective  in  meeting  its  mission  of  keeping

Singapore and the country safe from security threats.   I

think the record speaks for itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many people are now detained for espionage

cases?   As  of today, actually nobody has been detained.

All  have  been  released, and one is  on  a  restriction

order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister in charge, I believe that the ISD

has acquitted itself very well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Chin, you can take both your

cuts together.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, recently, the

Minister announced that the crime rates have risen across-the-board - a 10% increase in crime.  Now that  the  Home

Team  has  the  demands of meeting the  twin  threats  of

terrorism  as  well  as  its traditional  role  of  crime

busting, how has the Home Team reorganised itself to meet

these twin threats?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my cut on community efforts to combat crime,

I  would  just  like  to ask whether the  Minister  would

consider  providing more help, funds  and  facilities  to

CSSP  programmes now that he wants such programmes to  be

integrated with the home front security aspects, so  that

the CSSP programmes can be further enhanced and improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Charles Chong is not here. Prof.

Chin, you are next again - juvenile and youth crime.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the statistics on

crime  rate show that there has been a great increase  in

youth  arrests, and the form of crime that they are doing

is  mainly  on shoplifting.  This increase is  about  49%

since  2001.   Can  the  Minister explain  what  are  the

possible causes for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



this  very dramatic increase?  Why is there such  a  high

number  of  students involved?  As the vast  majority  of

them are first offenders, what have caused them to stray?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Home Team has been working

together  with schools for a very long time to discourage

students  from straying.  So, why is there suddenly  this

very,  very surprising and dramatic increase?   Have  the

school programmes failed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Cynthia Phua is not here. Miss

Penny Low.



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, in the

recent  release of crime statistics for the year 2002  by

the  police, it was revealed that a significantly  higher

number  of  juveniles were arrested in 2002  compared  to

2001.   There was in fact an increase of 789 persons,  or

55.8%.  The three offences committed by juveniles  -  and

the police had defined juveniles as persons between seven

and  15  years of age - registering sharp increases  were

shop  theft,  as Prof. Chin has mentioned, simple  theft,

and  rioting.  Shop theft increased by 35%, simple  theft

by 116.6%, and rioting by 138.7%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is indeed an urgent call to look into the

possible   causes  of  this  worrying  trend  and,   more

importantly, what can we do about it.  I would also  like

to advocate that resources be committed to embark on such

a  research  on  the cause and effect of this  increasing

trend.   An appropriate sampling of the offenders  should

be  studied  with the aim of understanding the underlying

causes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From media reports, the crimes committed by youths

appear to be more violent nowadays than before.  This  is

again  another  worrying  trend.   For  many  years  now,

parents  and educators were concerned over the access  of

our  youths  to  materials which are violent  in  nature.

These   include  movies,  TV  programmes  and   cartoons,

Internet websites, arcade and computer games.  Whilst  we

may  have already banned toy weapons, it is very easy for

a child to acquire a formidable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



arsenal in a computer game to maim and kill.  The more he

kills,  the higher the score, and he ascends to the  next

level of the game, if he reaches the predetermined score.

The graphics and sound effects are very life-like and are

designed to keep the child, and even adults, hooked  onto

the  game.   Apart  from the concern  on  addiction,  the

increase  in the child's threshold for violence may  have

other ill effects, like violent behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are in the process of reviewing our

censorship  regime,  we  should  perhaps  look   at   the

classification  of games for different  age  groups,  not

unlike  the NC16 category we have for movies.  We  should

look  at  what the developed countries have done  in  the

area of alleviating violence in computer games.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the adage that the youths of today are the

leaders of tomorrow still holds true.  We should spare no

efforts  in  doing  something to arrest  this  increasing

trend  of  crimes  amongst  juveniles  and  youths.   The

problem is complex and Singapore is not alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, I have been reminded of the story of

two  British juveniles who lured an innocent toddler  and

stoned  him  viciously and left him to die on  a  railway

track, hit by an on-coming train.  We are far from  that,

but we certainly do not want to get there.  The Home Team

can  perhaps take the lead.  But the rest of society must

join hands.  Perhaps the Minister can comment on what and

how the community, family and schools can do to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Identify worrying signs in youths and

juveniles;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Reach out to help the juveniles and youths;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Network with various agencies, such as the

police  and  counsellors to help  identify  our  troubled

youths; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) See what else we can do to help.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seeds we sow today will bear fruits tomorrow.

We must therefore act fast.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Indranee Rajah is not moving. Mr

Yatiman Yusof.



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, following the studies on

the  success  of the Koban Community Policing  System  in

Japan,  the  Singapore  Police  Force  had  set  up   the

Neighbourhood  Police Posts.  For years,  residents  were

made   familiar   with   the   bicycle-riding   policemen

patrolling  their neighbourhoods and the  policemen  were

seen  as  friends by our heartlanders.  The effectiveness

of  this programme is public knowledge now.  However, due

to  the need to be cost-effective, the manpower aspect of

police   operations   was   reviewed.    An   island-wide

reorganisation of neighbourhood policing was carried out,

and  Neighbourhood Police Centres were set  up.   In  the

Tampines GRC, one such centre is now operating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to what extent has

the NPC been successful in providing the effective safety

and   security  network  in  Singapore,  especially   the

heartland areas.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, the elderly person is a

relatively  easier target for criminals in  any  society.

This  is partly because they are generally not physically

as strong or as fast as younger persons. Their ability to

put  up  a  successful  struggle or  even  to  accurately

identify  the  criminal would also tend to be  less  than

that  of younger persons.  The less educated elderly  are

also easier targets for cheats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a climate of economic uncertainty or economic

downturn, their vulnerability would be increased.  If  we

look  at  the  Police crime figures for last year,  crime

against   the   elderly  has  also  shown  a  significant

increase, whether it was robbery or cheating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's population is rapidly aging. What

this means is that the total



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



number  of elderly persons and the proportion of  elderly

persons  in our population would both grow.  I  therefore

think that we need to anticipate the implications of this

trend  and to take certain steps to address them so  that

our elderly can enjoy a good quality of life and not have

to contend with a progressive loss of a sense of security

and an increasing fear of crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, I urge MHA to continue to emphasise all

crime  prevention education efforts for the  elderly  and

their  families.   In addition, I also suggest  that  MHA

consider  different  ways  of  increasing  the  deterrent

factor to deter crimes against the elderly. For instance,

we  currently have laws that impose heavier penalties for

aggravated   forms   of  crimes  or   for   crimes   that

particularly  put  fear into the victims.   I  urge  that

crimes  against the elderly, especially violent  property

crimes,  such  as robbery, snatch theft and  cheating  be

classified  as an aggravated form of crime that  attracts

heavier penalties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, several MPs have raised

concerns  over an increase in crime rates in  2002.   The

nearly  10% increase in total seizable offence  for  2002

should  be  seen  in  the context of an  improving  crime

situation which has been trending downwards in a positive

direction in the last 15 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime rate in 2002 was the lowest in the last 15

years  with  the exception of 2001. The crime  rate  last

year  was  also  lower than that in 1998 when  a  similar

increase  in  crime rate was observed.   Efforts  by  the

Police last year resulted in 15.4% or 2,917 more arrests.

The  number of persons arrested last year was the highest

number in the last 15 years, and the increase of 15.4% is

proportionately more than the increase in crime  rate  of

about 10%.  So we must see the increase in crime rate  in

its proper context.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that Singapore remains one of

the  safest  cities in the world.  In a recent  worldwide

survey  of  cities in November 2002 conducted  by  Mercer

Human  Resource Consultancy, Singapore is jointly  ranked

the second safest city in the world, together with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



Helsinki, Zurich, Geneva and Bern.  Lumxembourg was named

the  world's safest city.  A few of Japan's cities, which

ranked 7th, were the only other Asian country in the  top

10  positions.  The next highest South-east Asian  cities

ranked  after  Singapore  were  Johore  Bahru  and  Kuala

Lumpur. They were at the 73rd position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin has asked if the competing demands of

security  and  crime threats have posed a strain  on  our

Home Team resources and, more importantly, whether we can

sustain  ourselves,  with  the  need  to  watch  out  for

security and, at the same time, also deal with crimes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to combat both crimes and security threats

after  911  has certainly stretched not just  the  Police

resources,  but  also our Home Team resources.   However,

the  Police  has coped well so far.  Following  September

11,   crime   and   security   patrols   were   increased

significantly, as Members would have noted.   The  Police

was  able to achieve this by firstly, leveraging on every

available  staff, Police NSmen as well as  officers  from

the  specialist  units  such as  the  Gurkha  Contingent.

Secondly,  Police streamlined its response to  non-urgent

cases  so  that resources can be focused on  more  urgent

ones.  Thirdly,  Police  has  scaled  down  non-essential

services, such as handling of the lost and found  reports

and  rescuing trapped animals, in order to free up scarce

resources.   Let  me assure Members that  the  Police  is

geared  up  to  face the challenges ahead.   Neither  the

challenges of security nor crime will be neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer examination of the crime situation reveals an

emerging  pattern of concern in two areas.  One, juvenile

crime  and the other crime against the elderly, as  Mayor

Heng suggested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On youth crime, 2002 saw a significant increase in

the arrest of youth offenders who are categorised between

7  and 19.  But actually, there are very few that are  at

the  younger ages.  This increase was by 49%, from  2,756

to  4,099  youths  arrested.  As in previous  years,  the

majority,  or  68%, of these offenders were arrested  for

theft



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



and  related  offences. For theft,  a  lot  of  them  are

shoplifting offences.  For shoplifting offences, many  of

them  can  be  prevented if the retailers themselves  are

more vigilant. 8% of those arrested for simple thefts and

shop  thefts were repeat offenders, because some of  them

have the habit of repeating the offence.  Youths arrested

for  public  order  offences,  namely,  serious  assault,

rioting  and  unlawful assembly, made up another  13%  of

youth  offenders arrested last year.  Of these,  5%  were

repeat offences.  Although the numbers of youth offenders

arrested  for  theft  and  related  offences  and  public

offences  were respectively 54% and 60% higher than  that

in  the year 2001, the overall figure is still lower than

in 1998.  So again, we must see this in the context of  a

declining  crime situation in the whole of Singapore  for

the last 15 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in youth crime is consistent with the

overall  increase  in crime, and it could  be  due  to  a

myriad  of reasons.  We note that this phenomenon is  not

peculiar only to Singapore but also it is endemic in most

developed  countries and we have taken measures  to  curb

this trend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the causes of the rising crime among the

youths?  That  is  a  subject  which  the  Inter-Ministry

Committee  on  Youth  Crime  (IMYC)  chaired  by   Senior

Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Assoc.  Prof.

Ho  Peng  Hee,  and comprising the senior representatives

from  the Ministries of Community Development and Sports,

Education,   Home  Affairs,  the  Police,   the   Prisons

Department, National Youth Council, the National  Council

of  Social  Services,  and academics,  etc,  could  study

further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But already under the Inter-Ministry Committee on

Youth Crime, there are various programmes introduced. For

example,  81  schools initiated the School Community  and

Safety Programme that was targeted at preventing juvenile

delinquency.   Other measures include  the  Police-School

Liaison System where there is direct liaison between  the

schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



and  the  Police  would  provide  them  with  an  instant

connection,  as  well as the Honorary  Volunteer  Special

Constabulary (School) Scheme.  These are the teachers  or

disciplinary   masters  who  become   voluntary   special

constables who can put on an uniform and help to  instill

some discipline among the young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the school programme failed? Again, the IMYC

could  take  a look at that.  My own guess right  now  is

that  I do not think so because if you look at the  types

of  people  who commit youth crimes, they are not  mainly

our students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To specifically address the rise in theft-related

public-order crimes amongst youth offenders,  the  Police

has produced and developed an information package on shop

theft  and rioting for more than 300 schools and tertiary

institutions.   The  Prisons  Visit  Programme  will   be

expanded  to  reach out to more youths and  not  just  to

those who are involved in gangs.  Over 4,000 students and

other  youths have attended this Prisons Visit Programme.

The students are organised in groups and they go and take

a  look  at  what is inside the prison.  Those  who  went

there  would  know what life is like.  I hope  that  they

would understand that it is not a comfortable place to be

in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various other measures in place to help

arrested  youth  offenders to  remain  crime-free.   This

includes   the  Guidance  Programme  and  the  StreetWise

Programme   which  comprises  counselling,   supervision,

developmental  and academic support, an  active  parental

involvement session aimed at keeping our youths away from

crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area of concern is crime against the

elderly.  We read about this in the papers from time  and

time. We are therefore wondering whether indeed this is a

serious  problem.  Let me put the numbers in perspective.

In  2002,  there  were  95  elderly  victims  of  robbery

compared  to  80  in  2001.  More than three-quarters  of

these  victims  are  females. Cheating involving  elderly

victims also rose from 43 to 63 persons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mayor Heng Chee How that crimes against

such  vulnerable persons are despicable and the offenders

deserve  enhanced punishment.  But I do not think  it  is

necessary   to  have  a  separate  scheme  of   graduated

penalties for those who commit crimes against the elderly

or  any  other  vulnerable groups, such as children,  the

handicapped  or  women.  Otherwise, we  start  to  divide

people  and punish them according to the age or according

to  their vulnerability.   In all cases of crimes against

such  vulnerable people, the prosecution can press for  a

deterrent  sentence and the courts may  impose  a  higher

sentence  if  there  are  aggravating  circumstances   or

factors.  Indeed, the prosecution, as well as the courts,

has done so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To educate the elderly on crime prevention, the

Police   launched   the   Crime  Prevention   Ambassadors

Programme  in  September 2002 to  recruit  active  senior

citizens  to help the Police to promote crime  prevention

awareness among the elderly. Police also organised  chit-chat  sessions, exhibitions and media campaigns  targeted

specifically at the elderly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also, on several occasions in this House,

stressed  the importance of the community to join  forces

with  the Police to fight against crimes.  Now more  than

ever,  the community is needed to safeguard our security.

Residents and communities must take responsibilities  for

their  own security as well.  The Police officers  cannot

be  everywhere.  A significant number in our community do

take part in the various activities. Efforts such as  the

Crime Prevention Ambassadors Programme, which I mentioned

earlier,  remind  us  of  the  important  role  that  the

community  can  play  in  combating  crime.  The   public

assisted in the arrest of 44.6% of all criminals involved

in  major crimes last year.  When I mentioned this figure

to visiting Police officers or the Ministers in charge of

Police,  they were surprised because, in their countries,

it is not easy to get the public to help out in arresting

suspects.  In our case, I think people know that we run a

clean  system, the Police can be trusted, and  they  have

confidence in the way we do things.  I want to commend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



these public-spirited citizens who come forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, the cornerstone of our

community partnership effort is the Community Safety  and

Security  Programme where members of the local  community

work together with the Home Team to tackle local security

and   safety   issues.   Today,  we   have   nearly   600

Neighbourhood   Watch  Zones  covering  almost   all   of

Singapore,  implementing  a wide  variety  of  programmes

ranging   from   Citizens-on-Patrol,   crime   prevention

discussions for the elderly, to house visits where  crime

prevention information is disseminated.  I would want  to

encourage  all Singaporeans to make themselves  aware  of

these  programmes and to take part in them, if they  wish

to play a more active role in tackling crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman Yusof asked about the Neighbourhood

Police  Centre  (NPC)  system of community  policing  and

whether   this   has  helped  the  level   of   community

involvement in crime prevention.  I am pleased to  inform

the  House  that  the transition has  gone  on  smoothly.

Members may recall that the Police decided to change  the

Neighbourhood  Police  Post system to  the  Neighbourhood

Police Centre (NPC) system in 1996.  Now, we have  31  of

the 32 planned NPCs in operation.  The last one, Sengkang

NPC, will be due to open in the middle of next year.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what extent have the Neighbourhood Police Centres

been  successful?   I  would  say  that  they  have  been

effective  in  keeping our crime rates low.   The  larger

number  of  personnel at each NPC allows  the  Police  to

deploy  more  officers  out on patrols,  thus  increasing

police   visibility   in   their   neighbourhood.    With

resources,  such  as fast-response cars,  the  NPCs  also

respond  faster  to urgent cases.  They have  established

strong     working    relationships    with    grassroots

organisations and other agencies, such as schools, family

service  centres and so on in their precincts.   And  the

residents  can  raise  any  local  safety  and   security

concerns, and our officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



will  work  with  them to design and implement  effective

solutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we going to give the CSSPs more resources?

CSSP, by its definition, is community effort.  The Police

will be there to help them, guide them, provide them with

much  knowledge  as possible, give them the  figures  and

tell   them  what  else  they  can  do  to  help  protect

themselves.   Ultimately, the community  themselves  will

have to find the resources with the support given by  the

Home Team.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the National Crime Prevention Council.

They  also  work very closely with the various industrial

sectors.   From  time  to time, they hold  meetings  with

industry representatives and give them suggestions on how

to  deal  with certain issues.  The Council also produces

publications, videos, etc, to help educate the  workforce

as  well  as  the management, and the Police provide  the

Council with as much support as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crime rate actually went up last year, but

it  is well under control.  Let me assure the public  and

Members  that the Police is well poised to deal with  the

situation  but,  again, as I have  said,  please  do  not

depend  on the Police to be everywhere.  The public  must

do  their part, if we want Singapore to remain a safe and

secure best home.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Indranee Rajah is not moving. Mdm

Ho Geok Choo.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to raise an

issue  with  regard  to drug abuse.  Drug  abusers,  last

year,  registered a marginal 1% decline.   On  the  other

hand,  the number of new drug abusers had increased,  and

this has hit a 5-year record high.  In fact, 911 new drug

abusers were arrested last year, making it a 16% increase

over  2001.  The good news is that the number  of  heroin

abusers  arrested has decreased.  It made up  of  66%  of

last  year's  arrests compared to 80% in previous  years.

Of  the number of new abusers last year, two-thirds  were

men aged 30 and above, and more than  half of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



them were men in their 20s.  Sir, this is worrying as the

trend   seems  to  indicate  that  younger   adults   are

experimenting with synthetic drugs, like ice and catamine

at  nightspots.   Last year, the number  of  ice  abusers

doubled  while catamine abusers went up almost 90%.   The

general  impression  is  that synthetic  drugs  are  non-addictive and harmless.  Doctors, on the other hand, have

warned  that  these  drugs may  give  abusers  kicks  and

altered  sensations,  and  prolonged  abuse  will   cause

irreversible damage to the organs.  Can the Minister tell

this House what is being done to arrest the growing trend

of  synthetic  drug  abuse?  What  programmes  are  there

available to ensure that the harmful effects of synthetic

drugs  are  made  known  to   students  and  the  general

population?



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, the latest figures have

indicated  a  general  decline in the  numbers  of  those

arrested  for old drug offenders.  These are  people  who

take heroin, morphine, marijuana and opium.  We have good

reasons  to  feel  encouraged  by  the  decline  of  drug

offenders under this category, congratulate the anti-drug

agency   and  the  community-based  groups  involved   in

counselling and rehabilitation for their fine  work.   At

the  same time, we are deeply concerned with the increase

in  the  number  of new drug offenders,  including  those

taking  ice  and  ketamine, especially among  the  young.

Given the tenacity in which the anti-drug agency work,  I

am  confident  that we can tackle this new  problem  too.

What  kind of cooperation that the Police needs from  the

people to make sure that this new effort is successful?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, during my meet-the-people sessions, I have

seen  less and less drug abuse related cases referred  to

me.   During  their  monthly  meetings,  members  of  the

Tampines  Anti-Drug  Task Force  Committee  shared  their

observations  with me.  They said that  one  of  the  key

factors for the declining number of drug offenders is due

to  the  long-term  detention which was  introduced  some

years ago.  I would like to ask the Minister whether this

is the case.  I also like to ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister on what other more effective measures  that

the  Ministry  has in mind to tackle the drug  menace  in

this country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, on the prison system.

Our  Prisons  Department's mission is "A key  partner  in

criminal  justice.  We protect society through  the  safe

custody  and rehabilitation of offenders, cooperating  in

prevention and aftercare."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a secure and exemplary prison system.

The  Prisons  Department has done a  good  job  over  the

years.    I   believe   there  are  many   rehabilitation

initiatives  conducted by the prison authorities.   Could

the  Minister  elaborate on some of the main  initiatives

being  taken?   Rehabilitative measures  adopted  by  the

prison authorities are commendable, and I hope they  will

continue  to  rehabilitate our prisoners  in  order  that

convicted persons can be fully or partially rehabilitated

and,  upon release from prison, would get a second chance

in  life to be law-abiding and good persons serving their

families and Singapore within their own capabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, are there studies being carried out relating to

sentencing  of  accused persons found  guilty  in  court,

detention  of drug addicts and the effect of imprisonment

on  these  persons  and  avoiding commission  of  further

crimes  by them?  In other words, has the deterrent  form

of  sentencing through imprisonment been effective?  What

is   the  effect  of  imprisonment  on  families,   their

employment  problems,  social and  matrimonial  problems,

etc?  Perhaps I could suggest that there be a joint study

done  by  sociologists, prison authorities,  Ministry  of

Home  Affairs and the legal fraternity to conduct studies

on  the  efficacy of rehabilitation of criminals  in  our

sentencing and prison system.  If available, what are the

findings  in  other jurisdictions on such  matters?   Are

there lessons to be learnt by us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of criminalisation, citizens who are

convicted may not be able to go abroad because  of  their

criminal  records.   Therefore, it  is  important,  where

possible, to avoid criminalisation of our citizens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



Perhaps these areas could be addressed by the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to add to the comments that hon.

Member,  Mr Chandra Mohan, has just mentioned.  Over  the

years,  the  Ministry has progressively taken  innovative

steps  to  improve the rehabilitation programmes  in  the

prisons,   reformative   training   centres   and    drug

rehabilitation centres.  These programmes, if  effective,

should  help  to reform the offenders.  These  programmes

too  should also be able to help different categories  of

offenders  under  the  charge of the Prisons  Department.

One  such group are those who commit offences of a sexual

nature arising from some psychological disorder, offences

such  as  outraging of modesty, exhibitionism and  sexual

assaults including rape, for example.  In this regard,  I

would  like  to ask the Minister (1) what has been  done;

and  (2)  is  enough  being done by  way  of  specialised

therapeutic treatment and other rehabilitation programmes

for such incarcerated offenders, so that there is minimal

danger  and,  ideally, no danger of them repeating  their

offences  upon discharge from the penal and  correctional

institutions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, former offenders

often  leave their penal institutions with the desire  to

turn  over a new leaf.  Many strive to build their  lives

and  they certainly desire to lead normal lives.  One  of

the constant struggles is the stigma that stays with them

for a very long time  - the label of being an ex-convict.

With  this label, many have difficulties securing  stable

employment  simply  because  employers  resist  employing

them, sometimes even disregarding the length of time they

have  been  able to stay away from crime  or  drugs,  nor

whether they have the necessary qualifications to do  the

job.   Sentencing  them  to  institutions  achieves   the

objective  of taking away their freedom from them,  apart

from penalising them for their misbehaviours.  But, often

times,  they do not necessarily gain total freedom,  even

when  they  are released.  Some continue to  struggle  to

achieve   normalcy,  but  after  several   attempts   and

constantly being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



tormented  by societal stigmas and prejudices,  many  are

led back to their old ways.  Yet, there are those who are

resilient enough to stick through the odds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many professionals who work with ex-convicts

will  testify that expunging the records of those  former

offenders who have shown their ability to stay away  from

crime  for  a period of time will enhance their continued

recovery   and   contribution  to  society.    They   are

resilient.   Expunging their records will  surely  enable

them  to  seek  regular  and  stable  employment.   Thus,

providing  stability to their lives  and  that  of  their

family  members.   Yesterday, we  heard  that  the  civil

service has started employing ex-convicts based on  their

merit.   Human  nature will not stop  us  from  having  a

second  thought about the person, no matter how qualified

he  is  if we know that he has a criminal record.   I  am

certain  their chances of seeking employment, whether  in

the  private or public sectors, will be greatly  enhanced

if their criminal records are expunged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we heard the Minister for Law agreeing on

the need to decriminalise some regulatory offences.  This

is  indeed  laudable.  Last year, the Senior Minister  of

State  for Home Affairs reported in this House  that  the

Ministry is considering the amendment to the Registration

of  Criminals  Act,  so  that those  convicted  of  minor

offences   will  have  their  criminal  records  rendered

stanched  or expunged after a certain period if  they  do

not  re-offend.   Indeed,  this  will  further  help  ex-offenders  find  jobs,  as the  records  will  no  longer

feature  in the assessment of an individual's suitability

for the job.  I would like to ask the Minister the status

of  this process.  When can we expect the amendment to be

introduced in this House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as our society develops and matures, we must

reflect  it  through our willingness to be forgiving  and

compassionate.  I look forward to the proposed  amendment

to  be  introduced  and  for us  to  be  able  to  indeed

facilitate  and enhance every Singaporean's potential  to

the fullest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I will respond to the

speeches of Mdm Ho Geok Choo, Encik Yatiman Yusof,  Prof.

Ngiam  and  Dr Maliki, and my colleague, Mr Maidin,  will

respond to Mr Chandra Mohan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the drug situation. Both Mdm Ho and Mr

Yatiman  have  expressed  some concerns  about  the  drug

situation, in particular, about the synthetic drug  abuse

situation, especially amongst the young.  Heroin used  to

be  the main drug abuse for more than 30 years.  However,

the number of people arrested for abusing heroin has been

falling steadily over the past 10 years.  Last year, some

2,200  heroin abusers were arrested, as compared to 5,300

in  1992.  So the number has come down quite a  bit.   On

the  other hand, synthetic drug abuse has risen in recent

years.   About  30% of local drug abusers  arrested  last

year   consumed   synthetic  drugs   such   as   ecstasy,

methamphetamine  and ketamine.  The number  of  synthetic

drug  abusers has more than doubled from 438 in  1999  to

970 last year.  Amongst young abusers, aged 19 and below,

synthetic drug abusers have displaced heroin as the  main

drug  of abuse.  And I think this is also the point  made

by  Mdm  Ho.  61% of young abusers arrested in 2002  were

synthetic drug abusers.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may sound like frightening figures. But I

think  I should put these figures in perspective, because

I  would  like to assure the House that the overall  drug

situation is not a bleak one.  Let me cite some  figures.

Firstly,  the  total number of drug abusers arrested  has

declined  from  over 6,000 in 1994 to  under  3,500  last

year.  Secondly, the number of drug abusers, aged 19  and

below,  has also declined over the years, from a high  of

679 young abusers arrested in 1993 to 215 last year.   As

a  percentage  of total abusers arrested, the  number  of

young  abusers  arrested for drug  consumption  has  also

fallen  from more than 11% in 1993 to about 6%  in  2002.

Hence,  the overall drug situation actually has  kept  on

improving,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



which has been the case for the last six or seven years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think all that we read points to this new

threat  that is emerging.  The absolute numbers  are  not

large.  But in terms of the percentage increase, I  think

that  is  a concern.  Hence, MHA takes a serious view  of

the  growing  abuse of synthetic drugs and we  will  take

action  to  nip it in the bud.  As Mdm Ho very succinctly

puts  it,  synthetic drugs are harmful and possibly  even

fatal.  I think that is the first misconception that must

be  dispelled.   Because anyone thinking of experimenting

with  synthetic  drugs  must not delude  themselves  into

believing  that these drugs are harmless or non-addictive

or  even hip.  They pose similar health and mental  risks

to the individual as opiate drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MHA takes a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach

to  tackling the drug problem.  What do I mean by  multi-pronged?  A total integrated approach encompassing strict

laws,  vigorous  enforcement, proactive  preventive  drug

education, rehabilitation and aftercare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, enforcement. The Central Narcotics Bureau

conducts   regular   raids  against  drug   abusers   and

traffickers.  Last year alone, CNB carried out  51  major

drug  raids  and broke up 32 drug trafficking syndicates.

CNB   also   works  closely  with  its  counterparts   in

neighbouring   countries  to  exchange  information   and

conduct  joint operations.  This ensures that  we  tackle

the  drug  situation even before it reaches  our  shores.

CNB  is also active in preventive drug education and  has

stepped  up efforts on publicising the dangers of abusing

synthetic   drugs.    A  host  of  preventive   education

initiatives, including talks, competitions and other mass

outreach  activities, have been organised to  communicate

the  anti-drug  message.   In  particular,  the  National

Council Against Drug Abuse, which is chaired by a private

sector  person  and also supported by a  lot  of  private

sector  people with different expertise and  backgrounds,

plays  a  key  role.  And it has been very innovative  in

mounting programmes that reach out to students and  young

people in ways that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



will appeal to them, in particular drawing in members  of

the  mass media and advertising agencies to put out  very

striking  publicity materials warning against the  taking

of drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third prong, Sir, is rehabilitation. New opiate

abusers   are  currently  given  a  chance   to   undergo

rehabilitation at drug rehabilitation centres.  These are

the  heroin  abusers.  In contrast,  new  synthetic  drug

abusers  are  prosecuted in court and, if convicted,  are

sent to prison.  MHA is now considering whether we should

also  send  synthetic drug abusers to drug rehabilitation

centres.   This  will ensure that such abusers  have  the

opportunity   to   undergo  structured   and   supervised

rehabilitation.   This  will  help  them   overcome   the

temptation to abuse drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman has asked about the effectiveness of the

long-term imprisonment scheme.  The scheme was introduced

in  1998  with  the twin objectives of removing  hardcore

drug   addicts  from  society,  to  prevent   them   from

contaminating others as well as deterring other  addicts.

Members will know that under the scheme, hardcore addicts

with three or more convictions are no longer sent to DRCs

but  to prison instead.  Sir, since then, more than 4,000

drug  offenders  have been admitted to prison  under  the

scheme.   The  first long-term prisoner was  released  in

December  2001 and to-date, about 650 of them  have  been

released.   Only  19  of  them  have  since  re-offended.

Although it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness

of the scheme, the initial results are encouraging.  But,

still,  in April last year, MHA further strengthened  the

scheme   by   extending  community-based   rehabilitation

programme to these long-term imprisonment offenders.   So

for  the  last few months, they will still get help  from

various  agencies, including half-way  houses.   To-date,

about  250 long-term inmates have been emplaced in  half-way houses with a successful completion rate of 98%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the drug situation. I want to assure

Members that we have things under control, but we do  not

rest on our laurels.  We recognise these new threats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



and  indeed will take steps to nip them in the bud.  And,

of  course,  we  will  continue to  remain  vigilant  and

continue  to monitor the global and regional developments

on  the drug scene.  I believe our multi-pronged approach

has borne fruits and we will continue to press on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang has asked what more can be

done  to  rehabilitate  sex  offenders  incarcerated   in

prisons,  the  reformative  training  centres   and   the

Singapore Boys' Home.  First, Sir, let me assure  Members

that  there are existing programmes in these institutions

to  rehabilitate sexual offenders.  Such  programmes  are

generally successful in preventing sexual offenders  from

re-offending.  Out of 156 offenders released from prisons

since  the year 2000, only seven have recommitted  a  sex

offence.  So that is a small percentage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Department conducts what is called a 3R

treatment programme for sex offenders detained in prisons

and  the  reformative training centres.   This  programme

aims  to  achieve  the  3Rs  of "respect,  restraint  and

responsibility"   in  the  individuals  through   empathy

training, victim awareness, relapse prevention and  self-monitoring.  The programme is tailored to the  needs  and

risk  profile  of  each  individual  sex  offender.   Sex

offenders also receive assistance in integrating back  to

society  after  their  release.  A  personalised  relapse

prevention  plan  is  developed  for  each  offender  and

reinforced  by  follow-up support sessions.   Eleven  sex

offenders  have completed the programme since its  launch

last  year.  Seven of these have since been released from

prison and so far, none has re-offended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sex offenders detained in the Singapore Boys'

Home,  the  Ministry of Community Development and  Sports

conducts  a  customised programme  called  the  "Positive

Adolescence   Sexuality  Treatment"   (or   PAST).    The

programme  aims  to  develop the  skills,  knowledge  and

awareness  needed to change the youth's sexual  offending

behaviour.  Psychological



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



counselling  is  also provided.  Fourteen offenders  have

undergone  the  programme since its introduction  in  the

year 2000, and so far, none has re-offended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, the re-offending rate of sex

offenders  is very low.  I think we are happy about  that

and  we  want to ensure that it keeps that way.  But,  of

course,  as  we  always do in MHA, we  will  continue  to

improve  our existing programmes, in this case,  for  sex

offenders  and,  where  necessary,  introduce  new  ones.

Indeed,  if Prof. Ngiam has some ideas on how to  improve

our programmes, I would be very  happy to hear from him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I agree with Dr Maliki that we should also help

ex-offenders who come out from prison, particularly those

who  are genuine, who really want to find a job.   And  I

think  many of us in our MPS will come across cases  like

that  - constituents who have served their time, who have

been  punished and who really want to get back on  track,

including  getting emplaced in a job.  Hence, MHA,  as  I

have  announced, has been reviewing the legal  provisions

to  allow  a person's criminal record to be removed.   We

are  studying the experience of other countries  such  as

the UK and Hong Kong, which currently have provisions  to

allow  criminal  records to be rendered spent.   Criminal

record that is rendered spent means that the record  only

surfaces  for  court sentencing purposes,  but  he  would

still have been considered to have a prior conviction for

employment purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, what we are considering is the possibility of

allowing  a  complete removal of a criminal record,  that

is,  expunging it.   Because, if implemented, this  would

mean  that the person whose record is completely  removed

is  deemed  not  to have been convicted  of  the  offence

recorded.   To  a  question in an employment  application

form  as to whether he has a prior conviction record,  he

can   then   reply  `no'.   This  will  be   helpful   in

rehabilitating  ex-offenders who have genuinely  changed.

Of  course, this is something which is very rarely  done.

But  I think this will really help the offender.  Because

it is not a matter of whether or not his record



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



has  been spent; in other words, whether it will  surface

in a court proceeding or whether it is taken out from the

record, but rather to a question in an employment form on

whether  he has a prior conviction, if he answers  `yes',

then  employers  may still be hesitant.   So,  it  is  an

intricate thing that we want to study, and we are  taking

some time because we want to do as much as we can to help

genuine  offenders.  We hope to complete  this,  possibly

within the next few months.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Mr

Chandra Mohan has asked for some elaboration on the  main

initiatives for rehabilitative programmes in the  prisons

and  also how and what we do to provide the best possible

second chance in life for ex-prisoners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as he rightly pointed out, the traditional role

of  our  prison and its systems is to protect our society

by  putting criminals who pose a threat to society behind

bars  and,  at  the  same  time, to  deter  any  would-be

criminals.    In  recent  years,  however,  the   Prisons

Department  has  done  a lot more to  help  prisoners  to

reform or rehabilitate themselves.  Programmes have  been

introduced  over the last few years to help  rehabilitate

them  and  reintegrate offenders back into  society.   We

have  seen  that these measures have had some measure  of

success.  For example, the re-offending rate has declined

steadily from about 56% in 1995 to about less than 35% in

the  year 2000.  And the Prisons Department has pioneered

the   concept   of   CARE  (Community  Action   for   the

Rehabilitation  of  Ex-offenders) which  provides  for  a

structured  rehabilitation programme for  offenders  that

begins  at admission, and continues beyond their release.

Upon  admission, inmates are individually assessed and  a

personalised  treatment  plan  is  drawn  up  for   them.

Inmates  first  undergo a core skills programme  to  help

them  cope  with  their  imprisonment.   Modules  covered

include  self-control, issues arising from  imprisonment,

stress  management, etc.  Each inmate is also assigned  a

prison  officer  as  his personal  supervisor.   And  the

offenders then undergo specialised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



treatment   programmes  targeted  at  specific  offending

behaviour.    Offenders  who  wish  to   continue   their

education can also be sent to the Prison School which was

established  in the year 2000.  The School  runs  courses

ranging  from  skills  training  up  to  'A'  levels  for

offenders.   And I am happy to report to this House  that

prisoners enrolled at the School have constantly achieved

good results when they sit for 'N', or 'O', levels.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suitable offenders are also given the opportunity to

undertake food training during their stay in prison,  and

training ranging from food preparation, hair dressing  or

IT  skills  is provided to prepare offenders for  a  wide

variety  of  jobs available in the Prison,  or  later  on

outside.   Besides,  inculcating  good  work  ethics  and

discipline,  such vocational training also  enhances  the

employability of offenders after their release.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help ease the often difficult transition

back   into  society,  the  Home  Detection  Scheme   was

implemented  sometime in the year 2000 to allow  selected

offenders to serve the last few months of their  sentence

at  home with electronic monitoring.  So far, over  2,000

have  benefited from this scheme, and the completion rate

for the scheme is almost 100%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the help that we give to offenders does not end

with  his release from prison.  In the area of aftercare,

we  have  brought  together various  agencies  under  the

Community  Action for the Rehabilitation of  Ex-offenders

network  to  provide aftercare counselling and assistance

to    released    offenders.    The   network    includes

organisations,   such   as   the   Singapore    Aftercare

Association  and  Singapore  Anti-Narcotics  Association.

Both  help  ex-offenders to return to society during  the

pre-release  phase and continue to support the  offenders

after   their  release.   We  also  have  the   Singapore

Corporation   of   Rehabilitative   Enterprise    (SCORE)

providing assistance in job placement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prisons Department will continue to work

with  the  relevant agencies to improve the effectiveness

of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



rehabilitation system.  We also need the support  of  all

Singaporeans  to  help  in  the  reintegration   of   the

offenders  into  society.   Much  will  depend   on   the

willingness of Singaporeans to give these ex-offenders  a

second chance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan also mentioned about the need

for  some  research and study to see the implications  of

all this. I think this matter will be looked into.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> I have two issues to

raise,  arising  out  of feedback  from  members  of  the

public.   The  first  has to do with  the  very  positive

response towards the new driving licence, which I  regret

I  do  not have one.  But I have seen them and they  look

rather attractive.  The question raised by members of the

public was whether we could not have that to replace  our

IC.   Because after all, the driving licence for citizens

is  the  same as the IC number.  So why can we  not  have

that to replace?

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I have is concerning this: Can

we  do  more  with this new driving licence because  they

complain  that  they are having too many cards  in  their

wallets that, sometimes, they look like they are carrying

a  pack  of playing cards, rather than carrying a wallet.

The  question is whether the Ministry of Home Affairs can

come   up   with  a  multi-purpose  IC  driving  licence,

cashcard, everything in one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is a matter of some concern, and it

has to do with the privacy of information in the registry

kept  by  the  Government.  In particular,  I  have  been

approached  by  parents with adopted  children  who  have

expressed  concerns  that, if a natural  mother  has  the

birth  certificate  number of the child,  would  she,  in

later  years,  be able to trace the whereabouts  of  that

child  simply  by  giving the number to any  institution,

like the hospital or other institutions?  If so, can such

adopted  children  be  given new numbers  so  that  their

identity   would  be  protected?   These  are   the   two

questions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Presently, children born

overseas  of a Singaporean mother and a foreigner  father

have  to  apply  for  citizenship  if  they  want  to  be

Singaporeans.   However, if they are born overseas  to  a

Singaporean father, they are citizens by descent.   I  do

not  want to argue this as a gender issue because I  know

where  this would get us in this House.  Instead, I would

offer  these  three  reasons why we  should  review  this

Article  in  the  Constitution, which was  written  in  a

totally different era.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, marriage trends. More Singapore women,

especially  our graduates, are marrying foreign  men  and

going overseas.  They have babies overseas and would like

their  children to be Singaporeans.  But because  of  the

constitutional hurdle, they face bothersome red tape when

they  are  trying to do the patriotic thing.  Ironically,

there  are  relatively fewer Singaporean  men  who  marry

foreign  wives and then have babies overseas.  Yet,  they

are  given  as a right the convenience of citizenship  by

descent for their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, demographic. We are facing falling

fertility rates.  We do not have enough babies to replace

ourselves.   I would think that we should be  looking  at

all  manner  of legitimate ways to increase our  pool  of

babies  and  to enrich our gene pool.  Allowing  children

born  to  Singapore  women overseas  to  be  citizens  by

descent would seem to qualify as one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third reason, globalisation. We live in an

increasingly globalised world and our citizens, both  men

and  women,  travel and work overseas in rising  numbers.

While  Singaporeans are overseas, they tend to feel  more

patriotic and conscious of being Singaporeans; some  more

than  others.   Such  national  consciousness  is  to  be

encouraged and we should be appealing to it, rather  than

making it that much harder for a group of Singaporeans  - in  this  case, the women - to nurture it and to pass  on

the rights of a citizen to their children by descent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his previous reply, the Home Affairs Minister

said   that  although  the  Constitution  has  made  this

differentiation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



between  men  and women for children born  overseas,  the

practical  effect  is  not  great.   He  said  that  most

applications for citizenship of children born overseas to

a  Singaporean parent are approved.  But this is  like  a

father saying to his son that his children can enjoy  the

privilege of becoming part of the family by descent,  and

telling  his daughter that her children have to apply  to

be  a  part  of  the family.  And then  adding  that  the

practical  difference  is not great  as  the  application

would probably be approved.  I think, to the daughter, it

would  make  all  the difference between feeling  whether

they  are  part of the family or not.  I would  urge  the

Minister to review this policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, I am not quite sure the Ministry of Home Affairs is

the  correct Ministry to address my point.  But since  it

is  redirected from the Prime Minister's Office  to  this

Ministry, here it goes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained recently in the Budget debate, there

must  be  greater benefits for our citizens than  foreign

nationals  working  here.   Singapore  citizenship   must

entail  greater privilege than just legal status,  rights

and  responsibilities.  We need to  offer  citizens  more

than what non-citizens can get.  Encouraging citizens  to

develop  a  sense  of emotional rootedness  to  Singapore

cannot  be  effective  when the  Government  is  actively

encouraging skilled and semi-skilled foreign workers  and

talents  into Singapore to compete with Singaporeans  for

that   premium   jobs.   This  is  especially   so   when

unemployment  is at its highest.  And for male  citizens,

they have to give up 21/2 years of their lives to protect

our  land.   On  top of that, there are a  few  weeks  of

reservist training every year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there must be strong economic and social

reasons for Singaporeans to be proud to want to remain as

a Singapore citizen.  My proposal is, Sir, over and above

the  tax  rebates, the ERS and the New Singapore  Shares,

citizens  should  also  get a  few  percentage  lower  in

personal  tax rate than non-citizens working  here.   For

men with active NS



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



liability, they should get another 2% off their  personal

tax  rate.  This would give stronger meaning to the  idea

of  citizenship, that citizens have their  privilege  and

show   the  Government's  greater  appreciation  of   our

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for social reasons, the Government will do well

to  go beyond electoral politics to uphold the principles

and  ideas  enshrined in our National Pledge.  This  will

greatly inspire pride in our citizens and give meaning to

what we truly stand for as a society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Prof. Chin raised two

questions.   One  is whether we can combine  the  driving

licence  and  other important licences into the  NRIC  so

that  it  serves multiple purposes.  Second, whether  new

registration numbers can be given to adopted children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me inform the Member that my Ministry has

actually  studied whether to combine the driving  licence

with  the  NRIC,  prior to introducing  the  new  driving

licence  last year.  In fact, we have even gone  further.

We have also studied the electronic national registration

IC  system which will have a chip on the card and it will

be able to do multiple services, like what Prof. Chin has

suggested  -  cashcard, driving licence, medical  record,

etc.   We looked around and asked many agencies but there

does  not seem to be a demand for this service and it  is

very  costly  to  provide such an IC  with  a  chip  that

performs  multiple  roles.   That  being  the  case,   we

abandoned  the project.  But that may not be the  end  of

it.   We will continue to look at it and see whether,  in

future, there may be a use for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards combining the driving licence with the

IC,  we actually have gone further than that.  We thought

of  doing away with the driving licence.  In other words,

no  need to carry a physical licence - the plastic  card,

or whatever.  We wanted to consult the people which we do

from  time  to  time.   So  we  had  many  focused  group

discussions with the community, with the residents,  with

the  ordinary Singaporeans.  The majority of  them  said,

"Please  let  us have the licence.  We like to  keep  the

licence.  We rather not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



do  without one."  They are afraid to leave home  without

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have the NRIC and the new driving licence. We

did  not want to combine the new driving licence with the

NRIC,   because  the  driving  licence  is   subject   to

revocation.  If something happens to the driver, he  does

not drive cautiously and the court were to debar him from

driving, the licence will have to be revoked.  Then  what

happens?  We would have to give back his NRIC.  Or if  he

takes  up another class of licence, what happens  to  his

NRIC?   We have to call him back and put another  sticker

to  it,  or change his NRIC.  So it is a bit complicated.

Or  even  when his licence is suspended, we have to  take

back  his  licence  and say, "Now,  you  don't  have  the

licence  for three months."  What does he do in  between?

Here,  he must have something to identify himself  if  he

needs  to  go to the authorities or the bank for whatever

services.   So we decided to simplify it by  just  having

the NRIC as the NRIC and have the new driving licence  as

a  new  driving licence.  Now, it is much more convenient

for  people to have the licence.  The new driving licence

is for a life-time.  Licence holders pay $50 and they can

keep the licence for life.  So please do take care of it.

Because  if  they  lose  it,  they  have  got  to  pay  a

replacement fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question on new registration numbers

for  adopted  children, in my view, the existing  system,

while not perfect, minimises the likelihood of an adopted

child's identity being divulged.  Although the child born

in  Singapore retains the same birth registration  number

when  he  is  re-registered after adoption,  he  actually

receives   a  new  birth  certificate  that   shows   the

particulars  of  his  adoptive parents.   His  new  birth

record after adoption is no longer linked to that of  his

natural  parents.  His original birth record  would  form

part   of  the  adoption  register  which  the  Singapore

Immigration and Registration will not disclose or release

to anyone.  So, it is a completely new birth certificate,

with the adoptive parents' names on it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



<br>2.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it better to give a new number? Maybe giving a

new  number  may make it more difficult for  the  child's

natural parents to trace the child.  But the drawback  of

this  is  that  the  adopted  child  would  get  a  birth

registration  that  is  out of sequence  with  the  birth

registration  numbers  of other children,  because  birth

registration  numbers  are  assigned  according  to   the

sequence of birth and registration.  Therefore, we should

keep  it  that  way rather than to change  unnecessarily.

Indeed,  a new number that shows a child registered  much

later when he is actually born in the earlier part of the

year may give away his identity.  So, we decided that  we

should  keep  to  the present system.   This  system  has

served us well for a long time and I do not think we need

to  change it at all.  For 23 years we have not  received

any adverse comments on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng's reasons for changing the Constitution

to  treat  women  and men who marry foreigners,  and  for

women who give birth to children overseas, equally  as  a

Singapore man who marries a foreigner are understandable.

I  am sympathetic to her reasons.  But when we change the

Constitution,  it is a serious matter.   There  are  good

reasons  why  we  have our present  system.   Ours  is  a

patrilineal society, just as a child follows the father's

surname,  citizen by descent is also tied to the father's

nationality.   But my Ministry has already  undertaken  a

review of this, and we are looking at all our citizenship

laws  to  ensure that they keep abreast of the times  for

some  of  the reasons mentioned by Ms Irene Ng.  But  any

change    would   have   significant   and   far-reaching

consequences and implications.  We not only have to amend

the  Constitution, we have to take into account the other

implications.   And  we will make changes  only  after  a

thorough review.  So, a review is in hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia was wondering whether I am the correct

person  or  whether the Ministry of Home Affairs  is  the

correct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  to  answer his cut.  Even if this  were  to  be

under PMO, as he originally intended, I believe the Prime

Minister will ask me to answer this question.   It  is  a

matter  of  citizenship, since anything that  looks  like

citizenship matters, it comes under the Ministry of  Home

Affairs.  So, he will get the same answer, whether it  is

listed under PMO or MHA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, Mr Chia talked about social and

economic  reasons why people want to become Singaporeans.

For social reasons, he suggested that we should give full

meaning  to the Pledge.  We do.  All citizens are treated

equally  as provided for in the Constitution.  Therefore,

we  have not made any distinction.  Otherwise, it will be

in  violation of the Constitution.  For economic reasons,

I  hope  people  do not become citizens just  because  of

economic gains.  That would be the wrong reason to do so.

They  come here because it is a good place to  be  in  to

bring up their children, to work, to make friends and  to

build their ties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his suggestion to grant special tax rates

for  citizens versus non-citizens, I am afraid I have  to

tell   him   that  under  international  law,   eg,   the

Organisation  for  Economic Cooperation  and  Development

Model  Tax  Convention, we cannot have discrimination  on

tax  on  account  of  nationality.  Violating  this  will

adversely  affect  the international agreements  that  we

have signed.  Instead, we have found other ways of giving

citizens  more in return.  We have given them  more  than

what  we  normally  would have given a  non-citizen,  and

these  are  in  the form of tax rebates  and  reliefs  to

citizens.  For example, for NSmen who have done  National

Service  -  and  that is where we talk about  recognising

people  who have contributed to National Service -  they,

their  parents  and  spouses receive  tax  reliefs.  Non-citizens  do  not.   Procreation tax  rebates  of  up  to

$20,000  per child are only available to the  parents  if

they  are  citizens.   The Government  has  also  treated

citizens differently in education, health, public housing

and,  in the last many years, as Mr Steve Chia cited,  we

have  given CPF and Medisave top-ups, Singapore  Telecoms

shares, New



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  Shares,  Economic Restructuring  Shares.   And

NSmen receive more in quantum than non-citizens and  non-NSmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to talk about privileges and to

calculate  whether to benefit more or not by  becoming  a

citizen.   Instead of asking what benefits a  citizen  is

entitled to, I think the Member ought to examine  how  he

and  every other Singaporean can contribute to  home  and

country.   Being  Singaporean is about  having  a  shared

sense  of  pride and belonging to our country.  Singapore

is  where our family, friends and hopes are.  All of  us,

as  Singaporeans, we believe in the Singapore way of life

and  our  shared  values,  ie, our  multi-racial,  multi-religious  society,  meritocracy,  compassion,   justice,

equality,  hard  work, determination, a safe  and  secure

best  home.  Indeed, there is a deep sense  of  emotional

rootedness amongst Singaporeans that ties them  together.

Although Singapore is a small country, our reputation  is

excellent  in  the  world, and this gives  pride  to  all

Singaporeans,   wherever  they  may  be.  The   Singapore

passport, for example, is highly valuable, even valued by

foreigners, because they see this as a reputable country,

safe,  secure  and  well-run, and, therefore,  foreigners

covet  our  Singapore passports even to  conduct  illegal

activities, such as trafficking in people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards National Service, I think Mr Chia must

not  undermine  the contributions made  by  our  National

Servicemen.  They have made a sacrifice.  They contribute

to  Singapore and we must recognise what they  have  done

that have ensured our sovereignty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head P (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the matter I want

to raise relates to the Traffic Police.  We heard earlier

today  that  the Minister for Home Affairs has  explained

that  the resources of the Home Team are strained because

of  their  twin  purposes of looking after  security  and

crime busting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police has always stood out, not like a sore

thumb,  but by itself, because the control of traffic  is

usually rather different, and police officers trained  in

traffic  control  really  do  not  need  other  types  of

training, eg, crime busting and so on, because  it  is  a

totally different activity altogether.  In 1998, I raised

the  same  issue in the Budget debate, and  I  asked  the

question  whether  Traffic Police should  be  in  another

Ministry, ie, the Ministry of Transport now, or under the

LTA.   I  should like to know whether there has been  any

rethinking on this issue, and whether the Home  Team  can

now  devote  itself to the needs of security as  well  as

crime busting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Charles Chong is not here. Mr

Chandra Mohan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, may I be permitted to

take the three items together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, the Societies Act

governs  the  registration of societies and associations.

There  are about 5,500 registered societies in Singapore,

including   civil  and  non-governmental   organisations,

sports and recreation clubs, members' clubs, welfare  and

religious   organisations,   etc.    The   members    and

participants are mainly Singaporeans doing voluntary work

on various aspects of life in Singapore.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



Constitution of Singapore, under Article 14, provides for

the  freedom of speech, assembly and association.   If  I

could just quote, it says in Article 14:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to clauses (2) and (3) -

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) every citizen of Singapore has the right to

freedom of speech and expression;

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) all citizens of Singapore have the right to

assemble peaceably and without arms; and

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) all citizens of Singapore have the right to

form associations."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

And  there  are  some restrictions to that under  Article

14(2)  and (3), especially on the full licence of freedom

in terms of what needs to be done in order to protect the

security of Singapore, public order or morality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many in Singapore do complain that there are many

restrictions imposed by the Government although there are

fundamental  liberties guaranteed by the Constitution  of

Singapore.   If  there  are  too  many  restrictions   or

exceptions  which affect Article 14 of the  Constitution,

then  the  citizens may be justified in complaining  that

their fundamental rights have been curtailed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether the Ministry would

consider  taking steps or initiatives - and I  hope  they

would  -  to organise a forum, seminar or even a  closed-door  session  to  review the Societies Act  and  related

statutes   and  rules  and  regulations,  together   with

interested   parties,   such  as  registered   societies,

especially  civic and non-governmental organisations,  to

see  what needs to be done so that there is a more active

and   vibrant   civil  society,  and  greater   voluntary

activities  in  Singapore.  We ought  to  tap  the  great

reservoir of energy of voluntarism from them, and I  hope

we will certainly want to do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the role of the Registrar of Societies also be

expanded  to  task him with creating a greater  level  of

participation  on  such matters?  There  needs  to  be  a

rethinking  on this.  I would like to ask  what  are  the

duties and roles of the Registrar currently, and what can

be done in order to vest him with greater powers to bring

about greater interaction by the Registrar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



of  Societies with civic organisations, so that there  is

greater  participation by the community  in  governmental

affairs   too.   How  can  the  Registrar   enhance   the

activities  of non-governmental organisations  and  civic

societies in Singapore as a whole?  Perhaps, the Registry

could also look at possibilities of financing some of the

common  projects that can be enhanced to  bring  about  a

greater image as a caring, people-oriented group to  help

the  Government and the community in various projects and

provide  some form of meeting place for seminars,  forums

as   most   civic  groups  and  organisations  lack   the

facilities  and  finances  to  do  so.    What   is   the

experience of other jurisidictions, as far as NGOs go and

civic  organisations in other countries?  I think  it  is

important to bring about a synergy of the people  through

these organisations with the powers that be, so that they

can  be  given a chance to do community work and  special

projects  as  per  the aims and objects  found  in  their

respective constitutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of public expressions and speaking

rights,   Sir,   there  have  been  recent  developments,

especially  on  the issue of potential US-Iraq  war.   We

have seen a lot of peaceful demonstrations throughout the

world  but,  in a sense, Singapore has not  shown  active

participation  in  that area.  Some would  complain  that

because  of the requirement for a police permit, it  does

curtail any form of initiation by civil groups to do such

things.   It may be argued that it is not necessary  but,

sometimes, it is important to express one's feelings, not

just   in   newspapers,  but  in  the  form  of  peaceful

demonstrations.  Generally,  Singaporeans  are   peaceful

people. There should not be the perceived fear that there

would  be  violence and things would go wrong.   Citizens

must  be given the right to do these things.  We  have  a

strong  police force that can easily contain, if at  all,

problems  should arise.  I would encourage the Government

to be a bit more liberal about these things and certainly

be more liberal about the granting of police permits, and

better  still,  why the need for such police  permits  at

all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, in terms of expression, we have the

Speakers' Corner.  I must admit in this regard  that  the

citizens  have  not responded very positively.   Perhaps,

this  should be reviewed.  Is it because of the  location

itself and the forms of restrictions imposed on people to

speak up?



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Thank

you,  Sir,  for the opportunity to speak on  this  issue.

There  is right now another kind of war that is going  on

and  has been going on for some time, and I think the sad

thing about this is not many of us are even aware of  it.

I  am  referring to the trafficking of people around  the

world in this discussion, particularly that of women  and

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This form of trafficking is tipped to eclipse the

arms  and drug trade as the most lucrative aspect of this

trafficking phenomenon is that of sexual exploitation  of

women  and  children.  According to the  United  Nations'

estimates,  trafficking of just women and children  alone

right  now  involves about four million  people  a  year,

bringing in a record profit of US$5-7 million.   Of  this

conservative  figure, about 250,000 women  and  children,

according  to  the latest International Organisation  for

Migration  Report, come from South-east  Asia.   One  may

ask:   what  has  all  this got  to  do  with  Singapore?

Plenty, I say, and allow me to express why.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Singaporeans are a well-travelled group.

We  travel  in the region and beyond.  UN's  figures  for

child  sex tourism in Cambodia show that it is coming  up

to  35%, more than 5,000 young girls from Yunnan province

are  trafficked and serving in the brothels  in  Bangkok.

This  is  a  1998/1999 figure, so it is outdated,  but  I

could  not find the latest figure.  Some hotels in  Bali,

Philippines  and Sri Lanka promote sex with  children  as

part  of  their  attraction and today, in each  of  these

respective countries, 60,000-100,000 children are kept in

brothels.   Please  note  that  I  am  not  saying   that

Singaporeans  visit these countries to partake  in  these

activities.  But what I am saying is that we cannot  rule

out this possibility either.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we also have many foreign workers amongst

us.  Many have work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



permits but there is also still a group among the foreign

workers who are illegals, sometimes taking on menial jobs

or sometimes working here as prostitutes.  Do we know how

they landed here?  Do we know whether they came willingly

or  they  were duped?  Do we know if they are  trafficked

persons?    But   the  way  to  finding  what   are   the

circumstances that brought them here, we do have a little

bit  of  a hurdle because under the Immigration  Act,  if

they are found to be illegal, they can be either caned or

sent  to  prison  or both.  However,  there  is  still  a

recourse  that  some  of them can turn  into  prosecution

witnesses  to  haul in the traffickers.  But  what  I  am

saying  here is that the obstacle is there that we  would

perhaps   sometimes  not  even  know  whether  they   are

trafficked individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, and more importantly, as to why Singapore is

involved in this business of trafficking of people around

the  world,  the  latest report in the  Sunday  Times  by

reporter  Arlina  Arshad showed that Singapore  men  have

been  making a beeline for some time for the Riau Islands

for  the  Indonesian girls.  And in her story,  she  also

said  that some of them are as young as 12. A Riau Island

parliamentarian whom I spoke to also confirmed that  many

of  these  girls are from villages, lured and  forced  to

stay in brothels, and in the weekly raids that his Police

force  is  carrying out, it is a fact that some  of  them

have  been  duped into the brothel service  and  some  of

these brothels are also businesses run by Singaporeans in

Batam and Bintan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all joked, cynically, often, I am sure,

about the weekend migration of our men to the islands  of

Batam and Bintan.  But today, I want to be a party-pooper

and say that this has to stop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has ratified the Convention on the Rights

of  the  Child  whereby Articles 34  and  35  state  that

governments shall take all appropriate action to  protect

children  from sexual exploitation.  We have not ratified

the optional protocol dealing with child prostitution yet

under this Convention.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Braema, you have to wrap up your

speech soon.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Okay. We have signed the

Convention   on   the  Elimination  on   All   Forms   of

Discrimination Against Children whereby Article 6  allows

us  to  suppress all forms of trafficking against  women.

Could I ask the Chair for a question here, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Just ask your question and resume

your seat.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> This is a new topic.

Could I just be given some extra time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Just ask your question and resume

your seat.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> All right. The question I

have  for the Ministry then is that, since we have signed

all  these documents, how can the Home Team work with the

officials in Indonesia to try and curtail this situation.

Is  it  also time for us to do what the Australians  have

done  to try and bring our citizens a little bit more  in

line with our own home laws?  My second question is:   is

it  time  also to review how we look at illegals  because

the  world  right  now is trying to  decriminalise  it  a

little  bit, having the understanding that some  of  them

are  victims  of  trafficking?  Thirdly, we  have  signed

different Conventions from different Ministries  as  part

of  our stand.  Do these Conventions harmonise at the end

of the day and, if so, what is our stand?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, in conclusion, Sir, we are living in a

globalised   world  which  means  dealing   with   global

problems.   It  is my hope that our men do  us  proud  in

every  sense of the word and, as a Government, we  cannot

afford to look the other way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Guillotine. Please sit down, Ms

Braema.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I join the call

earlier by NMP Mr Chandra Mohan.  I find it strange  that

we  need so many permits in Singapore - permit to  speak,

permit to entertain, permit to march,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



permit  to  protest and even a permit to gather.   It  is

absurd  if your group has more than five people, you  can

be charged for illegal assembly.  Many Singaporeans would

be guilty of that offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules, permits and licences are mental roadblocks

that  restrict  the  growth of  a  creative  and  vibrant

society. This point has been well-hammered into the minds

of the Government and the civil service over the last few

days  by  many  MPs.  I do not think I  need  to  go  any

further since the DPM has personally pledged to cut  down

on the number of rules, permits and licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just hope that the Home Affairs Ministry would

cooperate fully by removing those unnecessary permits and

laws  that are archaic and no longer relevant. Stop using

the  standard excuse of public safety and security as the

awe-inspiring reason to keep these rules and regulations.

The  Government can do better than giving us  a  standard

reply.  It is time to return more freedom to the citizens

so  that  they  can  learn to exercise  greater  personal

responsibility.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first let me respond

to  Prof. Chin's point.  His point is very specific.   He

has  made a renewed call for Traffic Police to be  merged

with the Land Transport Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me inform him that his call has not fallen on

deaf  ears  because discussions are now underway  between

MHA  and the Ministry of Transport and we plan to  effect

the transfer by the middle of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, traffic management and control

today  come  under  two agencies,  namely,  LTA  and  the

Traffic   Police.   This  has  resulted  in   unnecessary

coordination issues.  Other than the reason  that  if  we

take  away  Traffic Police from MHA agencies,  MHA  would

then  be  able  to  concentrate more  on  law  and  order

problems,  the  more positive rationale,  and  one  which

would  benefit Singaporeans, will be that there  will  be

greater synergy if this is done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite a few examples. First, duplication of

technology can be avoided.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



Today,  LTA locates cameras at the traffic junctions  and

the  expressways  and tunnels to monitor  traffic  flows.

Traffic  Police,  on the other hand, separately  operates

the  red  light and speed camera systems for surveillance

against   specific  traffic  offences.   There  is   much

potential  therefore in streamlining these systems.   For

example,  a camera system can be developed for  both  the

monitoring  of  traffic  at  major  junctions   and   for

surveillance against red light offences.  Duplication  of

systems  can  therefore  be avoided,  resulting  in  cost

savings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, enforcement can be streamlined. Today,

Traffic  Police  enforces  traffic  violations  such   as

speeding.   On  the  other  hand,  LTA  enforces  illegal

modifications    to    vehicles.     However,     illegal

modifications also compromise road safety.  So  there  is

some  overlap  there.  For instance,  a  driver  who  has

installed tinted glass windows may find it hard to see on-coming traffic clearly and thus overtake dangerously.  It

is  counter-productive  for  Traffic  Police  or  LTA  to

enforce  against  one  offence, whether  it  is  reckless

driving or illegal modification, without also having  the

authority   to  enforce  the  other.   Such   gaps   only

compromise safety on our roads.



<br>3.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the setting of rules and the downstream

enforcement  of  these rules.  For example,  as  part  of

LTA's measures to encourage usage of public transport, it

is  an  offence to drive in a bus lane during peak hours.

However, it is Traffic Police's responsibility to process

the  summonses, impose demerit points and also attend  to

appeals   for   such   violations.    This   is   clearly

undesirable,  as the agency responsible for defining  the

rules should also enforce the rules to ensure consistency

from   policy   formulation  to  downstream  enforcement.

Hence,  by integrating all traffic issues under a  single

agency,  the  enlarged LTA will be able to  offer  better

service  to all road-users.  LTA will then have a  direct

hand  in  influencing road-user behaviour, and strengthen

its  own  mission of creating an excellent land transport

system.  MHA officials and officials from the Ministry of

Transport have made good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



progress  at  the  working level  and  we  will  announce

specific details of the transfer when these are ready.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address Mr Chandra Mohan and Mr Steve

Chia's  points.  Both Mr Chandra Mohan and Mr Steve  Chia

made  a  call,  for  example, for more opportunities  for

Singaporeans  to speak in public.  Mr Steve Chia's  point

is  that of the number of licences and permits that  must

be  applied  for.   First, I want to  say  this.   As  Mr

Chandra   Mohan  himself  has  said,  yes,  we  do   have

fundamental rights and liberties in the Constitution, and

he  has mentioned some of these.  But, at the same  time,

the same Articles in the Constitution also set parameters

-   security, public order, morality.  I think Mr Chandra

Mohan, in his speech, also recognises that Singapore is a

unique   society,  special  in  a  very   small   country

physically, compact, and we are also multi-racial, multi-religious.  Therefore, working the Constitution, we  have

to  derive  positions which take into  consideration  and

recognise the situation in Singapore.  And, indeed, every

country  has  to strike a delicate balance between  these

fundamental liberties on the one hand, and law and  order

concerns  on  the other.  Therefore, it  is  not  just  a

matter  of saying why can other countries do it, why  can

we  not do it.  Because circumstances are different,  eg,

our historical experiences are different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan asked why can we not have peaceful

demonstrations. There is, in fact, contradiction in terms

there,  because  large gatherings  of  people  can  start

peaceful but can turn violent, particularly if it  is  on

matters  of  race, religion or politics, where  different

people  may have different opinions and different  groups

may  gather,  then you will have clashes.   And,  indeed,

even  in other countries with regard to this latest spate

of  gatherings on the possibility of a war in Iraq,  some

of  the demonstrations have turned violent.  So, I  think

we have to be careful there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, our position all these years has been clear.

Police will not allow public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



talks  on matters such as race, religion and politics  to

be given in open spaces as they may cause disaffection or

elicit  mock  response  when  inflammatory  speeches  are

given.   But  meetings can be held indoors or  in  sports

stadiums where the conditions are different and there  is

better control, and the concerns of law and order can  be

better  taken care of.  The Police also disallows  public

assemblies if public order may be compromised.  Likewise,

the  Registrar  of Societies will refuse registration  of

groups  that are prejudicial to public order or  national

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I think we must give credit where

it  is due, and this is that the Police and the Registrar

of  Societies exercise their discretion judiciously under

the   Public   Entertainments  and  Meetings   Act,   the

Miscellaneous Offences Act and the Societies Act.  Police

and the Registrar of Societies administer these Acts even-handedly  and  with  a light touch.   Let  me  cite  some

figures.   Over  the  two-year period, 2001-2002,  Police

approved   1,403  applications  for  public  talks,   and

rejected only four such applications.  In other words,  a

high  approval  rate of 99.7%.  Of the four applications,

three  were  rejected because of law and order  concerns,

while   the  remaining  one  was  rejected  because   the

application was made on the eve of the intended event.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan must surely appreciate the fact

that  rules have been relaxed, and I say this also to  Mr

Steve Chia who made that point because, over time, Police

also   reassesses  changed  conditions  and   where   the

possibility   of  relaxation  comes  in,  that   can   be

considered.    For   example,   since   September   2000,

Singaporeans  can speak at the Speakers'  Corner  without

the  need for a public entertainment licence.  That is  a

major  relaxation.   And, indeed, recently,  a  political

association  held an installation art exhibition  at  the

Speakers' Corner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan asked how other countries handle

public  expressions and what the international  community

and  media think about us. Like I have said, we  have  to

formulate  rules  to  fit  Singapore  because,  basically

essential and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



ultimately, it is the safety and security of Singaporeans

that  really  matter and, of course,  for  investors  and

tourists who are here.  Here again, I think Singapore has

scored very well in terms of public safety for many years

at  international polls.  I think we must  maintain  this

position.  In fact, other countries probably look  at  us

and  wonder how we do it.  So, before we throw  the  baby

out  with  the  bathwater, let us have a care.   And  for

these reasons, Singaporeans enjoy a great sense of safety

and  security.  Of course, in terms of history  also,  we

recall  turbulent times in the past.  Though those  times

may  be many years away physically in terms of number  of

years,  but  given  the make-up of our  society,  it  can

resurface if we are not careful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan also asked about the Societies Act.

Here  again,  the Societies Act has been applied  with  a

light  touch.   In fact, in MHA, I have said  earlier  on

when I answered earlier questions, we review our Acts and

measures  all  the time to see how they can be  improved.

And,  in  the  same  vein, we have  also  looked  at  the

Societies Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rarely has the Registrar had to refuse registration.

When  he  does,  it  is  for  very  good  reasons.    The

Registrar, in fact, cites the relevant ground of  refusal

provided  under the Act and which clause it comes  under,

eg,  that  the society is likely to be used for  unlawful

purpose  or for purposes prejudicial to public  peace  or

order.  So the rejected applicant will know on what basis

the  rejection has taken place.  Between 1998  and  2001,

the Registrar approved 888 applications and rejected only

7   applications.   Last  year,  263  applications   were

approved  and  only  3 applications, from  two  religious

groups  and a third group suspected of being involved  in

secret  society activities, were rejected.   So,  indeed,

the  number of registered societies has grown from  5,377

in 1999 to 5,642 as at end of last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward and taking a pro-active stance, ROS

has  been experimenting since January 2002 with  a  fast-track registration scheme for societies that pose minimal

law and order, safety and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



security concerns.  These societies can be registered  on

the  basis  of  the  applicant  self-declaring  that  the

society  meets  certain  criteria.   For  instance,   its

objects  and  activities  must not  relate  to  politics,

religion  and  ethnicity, and it must  not  have  foreign

connections.  These are well grounded reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are considering whether and how we can allow

eligible  societies to be registered automatically.   So,

we  are trying to improve all the time.  I think that  is

something  that  Mr  Chandra Mohan and  others  like  him

should appreciate.  So, there is really no need to hold a

big  seminar  where  we  take  feedback  from  everybody,

because we are always open to feedback.  I myself,  I  am

sure  he would know, have also met some groups to discuss

the Societies Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan suggested that the Registrar of

Societies  should  play a bigger role in  enhancing  and,

indeed,  even  in financing the activities  of  NGOs  and

civil  society groups.  I think he should think carefully

about  this  call, because it is really not a wise  move.

Why?    Because  these  NGOs  who  seek  help  from   the

Government  may  lose their credibility.   Civil  society

groups  must  make themselves relevant  and  be  able  to

engage  and  convince  citizens to  identify  with  their

causes.   It  is  not true that NGOs find  difficulty  in

getting premises to hold meetings and so forth.  Over the

past few years, civil society in Singapore has grown, and

NGOs  espousing  various causes have sprung  up.   So,  I

think  we should leave them be.  There is space for  them

to grow.  The ROS is certainly not an instrument to clamp

them  down.  And like I have said, from the  figures  and

from  our  approach, in fact, we are  pro-societies.   Of

course,   the  Registrar  of  Societies  must  have   the

discretion   to  act  against  societies;   hence,   even

constitutionally, law and order and other parameters  are

set out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia has talked about permits. Like I have

explained  just now, there is a need for  us  to  control

gatherings  of  large  people in  Singapore.   Therefore,

there  is a need for a permit if you want to hold a large

meeting in public.  As shown by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



figures given just now, it is not difficult to apply  for

a  permit  and, particularly, in the context  of  meeting

rooms and sports stadiums, they have been granted before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about licences. Here again, MHA

administers this matter with a light touch.  For example,

Police, currently, administers licences and permits under

nine  pieces of legislation.  We have considered  whether

or  not  such pieces of legislation are necessary and  we

have found them to be so.  Let me give you an example  of

the  Arms and Explosives Act.  There is a need to control

the  importation  and possession of arms and  explosives.

I  think Mr Chia will agree that we need to continue with

this  regime.   Likewise, the Private  Investigation  and

Security Agencies Act, so that anyone who wants to  be  a

private  investigator or security guard will have  to  be

screened.   So,  there is every reason why  a  permit  is

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about public activities, which Mr Chia has

focused  on?   Let  me say there are 15 types  of  public

entertainment    licences   catering   to   entertainment

businesses  and  to  those who wish to  organise  ad  hoc

public  entertainment.  These licences are, for  example,

for   performance  of  public  talks  and  for  operating

billiard  saloons and games machines.  If  Mr  Chia  sits

back  and thinks about it, there is every reason  why  we

should  require  these licences, not that  they  are  not

granted.   When the conditions are met, they are granted.

For example, control over computer games arcades and pubs

are required, so that on application, Police can look  at

it  and  see whether, eg, they are in residential  areas,

too  near  to HDB areas, thus posing social concerns  and

possibly  too  accessible to the young people.   Or,  for

example,  whether  or  not  large  outdoor  entertainment

events  could be held at a certain place, it is necessary

to  consider  whether  or not there  will  be  disamenity

caused  to  the residents, traffic problems  or  law  and

order problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure he will appreciate that, over the years,

he would have seen MHA



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



assess the relevancy of licences and, where possible,  we

have  done away with some of these licences.   I  am  not

sure whether he was in the House in the year 2000, when I

moved  a  Bill  to  amend the Public  Entertainments  and

Meetings  Act.   Part of the scheme of the  Bill  was  to

introduce  an  exemption scheme where certain  activities

were  exempted under class exemption.  Hence, under  this

amendment  to  the  Act,  we exempted  10  categories  of

activities.  And, indeed, the Speakers' Corner also arose

from  this  exemption.  People who speak at the Speakers'

Corner will not need to apply for a licence.



<br>3.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year, Police implemented a one-stop

public  entertainment  licensing centre  (or  OSPEC).   I

think  Mr  Chia  is also aware of that,  particularly  in

helping   people   who   want  to   start   entertainment

activities, pubs, for example.  So OSPEC, in fact,  as  a

one-step centre, has helped to bring down processing time

to  two weeks. That was about a year-and-a-half ago.   Of

course,  like I have said, in MHA, we always see  whether

we  can  improve  our  processes.  So,  here,  Police  is

currently   looking   at  computerising   its   licensing

operations.  When the system "PLUS" is ready  later  this

year,  we  can expect the processing time to  be  further

reduced  to seven working days for establishment  licence

applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure both Mr Chandra and Mr Steve Chia that

when  licences or permits are imposed, they are for  good

reasons.  If they are no longer necessary, we will modify

them or, in some cases, even remove them, and this is  an

on-going process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi has made several points which are

not  quite in line with her topic, because she made quite

diverse  points, for example, whether or not we  can  act

against  brothel owners in Bintan and Batam.  I  am  sure

she  appreciates  that  Bintan  and  Batam  are  out   of

Singapore's criminal jurisdiction.  Certainly,  in  terms

of what our Police can do, we cannot do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



anything.   What,  of  course,  we  can  do  is  we   can

discourage our men from going to visit these  places.   I

think, here, families can play a part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is whether or not those who come to

Singapore  are  being  trafficked.   Yes,  indeed,   many

illegals  come to Singapore; others overstay.  But  those

illegals who come to Singapore, they come on their own or

some  of them are smuggled in.  But that is not the  same

as  trafficking, because trafficking means that  you  are

brought  in against your will.  In the case of foreigners

who  enter Singapore illegally, they all come voluntarily

looking for a better life.  Some are smuggled in.  As far

as Singapore is concerned, I think she knows that we take

a  very tough position against all illegals who come,  as

well as smugglers or conveyors, as they are called.   For

example,  last  year,  about 50 of  such  conveyors  were

arrested   by   us.   We  have,  in  fact,  tough   laws,

particularly against such smugglers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for conventions, I think, again, this is a very

specific point.  Really, different conventions come under

different  Ministries.  I think the conventions  she  has

mentioned relating to the children are under the  purview

of  MCDS.   If she wants to ask a specific question,  she

should file a Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Chia, a short clarification



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, first, I would like

to  thank  the Ministry for the efficiency and  speed  of

approval.   The  two clarifications I want  to  make  are

these.  Where the gathering is five or more people, do we

need to apply for a permit?  Because under the law, it is

considered   illegal  assembly.   The   second   question

pertains  to  this.   When  we are  talking  and  meeting

residents  at  coffeeshops, and where some topics  become

interesting, you can get a crowd around you and the crowd

size  can actually increase to quite large, and  in  this

case, while we are addressing and talking to them, do  we

need to apply for a speaking permit, in a sense?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> On Mr Chia's first point,

if  somebody  is organising a gathering for  purposes  as

follows:   to  demonstrate  support  for  or  against   a

particular  view, to publicise a cause or to  commemorate

or  mark  an event, then it comes under the Miscellaneous

Offences  Rules, and he will have to apply for a  permit.

The  second point is if people gather in coffeeshops,  it

is  not an unlawful assembly, unless the people have  got

criminal  intent and, indeed, go on to commit an offence.

Because,  then,  the unlawful assembly provision  in  the

Penal  Code  comes in.  So, that is different.   That  is

another  provision altogether.  But if people  gather  to

watch  a  football  game on TV, say, in  the  S-League  - Woodlands Wellington against Home United - the  law  will

not come after them.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Could I ask for

clarification,   please?   We  have   ratified   the   UN

Convention against Transnational Organised Crime in 1966.

Right  now, we have the document for 2000.   The question

I  asked  was:  how  do we harmonise  all  the  different

conventions because they sometimes seem to be pulling  in

different directions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho, do you want to clarify?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I do not know how that

has anything to do with Home Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Okay. Prof. Chin, do you want to

withdraw your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, may I thank the

Minister,  the  Senior Minister of State and  the  Senior

Parliamentary Secretary for their very comprehensive  and

occasionally surprising answers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2). Mr Charles Chong

is  not here, so the item is not moved.  Item No. (3), Dr

Maliki.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code PF 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the drug menace has been with us for a very

long  time.   We have been grappling with the problem  of

high  relapse rate.  At one time, it was as high as  80%.

Recently,  it hovered over 60%.  This is still  high,  as

one  out  of  every six addicts returned  to  their  drug

habits.   One of the programmes implemented to deal  with

the  drug addiction is the Community-based Rehabilitation

(CBR) Programme The ex-addicts are either home-based  but

tagged   electronically  or  they  go   through   further

rehabilitation  at  the  half-way  houses.   The   Senior

Minister  of State for Home Affairs has earlier  reported

that  the completion rate for the half-way houses is 98%.

While many complete the programme, I wonder how many have

relapsed.  As such, I would like to ask the Minister what

is  the  relapse rate for addicts who have undergone  the

CBR programme since it was implemented.  What other plans

and  programmes are there in our efforts at reducing  the

relapse rate amongst the drug addicts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the half-way house concept is essentially that

it  is the half-way mark for ex-drug addicts as they move

from  the institution back home into the arms of society.

When  we  talk  about the Community-based  Rehabilitation

Programme,  the  assumption is that we are rehabilitating

the  ex-addicts  in the community.  But herein  lies  the

problem.  Is the community also being rehabilitated  into

accepting  these ex-addicts?  I have discussed the  issue

of  employment  and  how the stigma of  being  an  addict

affects their potential at seeking employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not too long ago, in fact, just January this

year,  we saw how a neighbourhood reacted to the presence

of  the shelter for ex-addicts called "The Promised  Land

Missions".   They  were  asked  to  leave  because   they

violated some URA regulations.  Some in the neighbourhood

expressed relief at the group's departure.  But I am glad

that there are some others,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



like  Mrs Lisha Holland who countered and remarked, "Some

of  the men look a little bit rough with their tattoos on

their  arms.  But if you take time to get to  know  them,

you'll   find  that  they  are  nice  people."    Another

neighbour,  Mdm  Ng Chwee Kim, also wrote  and  supported

that point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need more people like Mrs Lisha Holland and

Mrs  Ng  in our midst, people who would not judge  others

easily,  people  who are willing to give second  chances.

In  this regard, I would like to ask the Minister if  the

Ministry  has  plans  to implement programmes  that  will

assist  the  community  and the public  in  understanding

these  ex-addicts  better  and  thereby  facilitate   the

acceptance  of  these individuals.  If not,  I  urge  the

Ministry to consider implementing such programmes.   Such

acceptance  will  go  a  long  way  in  our  efforts   at

rehabilitating these addicts and reintegrating them  back

into  society and, in the same breath, make  our  society

more compassionate.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Dr Maliki has asked

about    the   effectiveness   of   our   Community-based

Rehabilitation (CBR) Programme.  Sir, this programme  was

launched   sometime  in  1995  and  it   was   aimed   at

reintegrating  drug offenders detained in our  DRCs  back

into  the  community.  Inmates who  are  assessed  to  be

receptive  towards the programme are emplaced  either  at

their own homes or at half-way houses at the end of their

detention.  Inmates emplaced at home are employed  during

the  day  and  must observe curfew hours in the  evening,

while  those  in the half-way houses will attend  various

rehabilitative  programmes  arranged  by   the   half-way

houses.  So far, about 6,000 inmates have benefited  from

this programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the results of the CBR programme have been

encouraging.   The completion rate for  all  the  cohorts

emplaced  on the programme from 1995 to 2000 has averaged

about  82%.   The  recidivism rate of  inmates  who  have

undergone the programme has also been consistently  lower

than those who have not.  For example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



among  the cohort of drug offenders released in the  year

2000, the recidivism rate for those who underwent the CBR

programme was 38%, compared to about 60% of those who did

not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that other inmates in

the  DRCs  who may not be suitable for the CBR  programme

are not forgotten.  They undergo  other programmes within

the centre, for example, substance abuse treatment, anger

management   and   violence  prevention   courses.    The

rehabilitation  effort, however, does not  end  with  the

completion  of  the CBR programme or the release  of  the

inmate from our DRC.  Programmes are also put in place to

help the drug offender reintegrate into our society.  And

these   include  aftercare  counselling  and   assistance

offered  by  the  Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative

Enterprise (SCORE) and the agencies participating in  the

Community  Action for the Rehabilitation of  Ex-offenders

(CARE) network.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the successful rehabilitation of drug

offenders,  as rightly mentioned by the Member,  requires

the support and cooperation of the agencies, the families

and  friends of the drug offenders as well as society  at

large.  As he has explained, in some incidents where they

were not clearly welcomed by some residents, I would like

to  take  this  opportunity  to  once  again  exhort  all

concerned   to   help   our   ex-offenders   successfully

reintegrate into society and to continue to lead a useful

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to educating our people, Sir, the CNB

has  its own preventive education programme reaching  out

to students in various schools, and I think SANA also has

its  own  programme to educate the community.  The  other

programme which I mentioned earlier is CARE.  Under CARE,

the   various   agencies  believe  that  some   kind   of

coordinated  aftercare programme  is  very  good  in  our

effort to bring the ex-offenders or drug addicts back  to

society.   These programmes, coordinated by  the  Prisons

Department, involving SCORE, National Council  of  Social

Service,   Singapore  Anti-Narcotics   Association,   and

others,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



are   actually   a  network  designed  to  provide   this

assistance.  They wanted a lot more people to be involved

and  to  participate in a collective effort to  help  ex-offenders  to come back to society.  I hope  we  can  use

this  opportunity to let more people understand  how  the

CARE   network  can  help.   Various  organisations   and

community leaders, MPs and others can also assist by  way

of  encouraging  our people to participate,  to  be  more

aware and involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Southeast Asia's short-term outlook remains

uncertain.   Besides the periodic haze, we have  to  live

with  dark  clouds hovering over our region.  The  region

has  indeed  not recovered from the 1997 Asian  financial

crisis.  Close on its heels came the disaster of 9/11  in

2001.   Prospects of a double-dip in the US  economy  and

its  impact  on the region worry many of  us.   With  the

decline  in  direct  oil investments in  Southeast  Asia,

coupled   with   much  investments  being   diverted   or

channelled to China, ASEAN has indeed lost its shine.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN seems to be in disarray in the post-Suharto

era  and  appears unable to find new directions  and  new

cohesion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



Will  ASEAN  put its acts together and be a force  to  be

reckoned   with?   The  rising  religious   fervour   and

political extremism in some countries cast doubts on  the

stability of the region and its ability to move  on  with

economic development.  The fallout from the October  2002

bomb blast in Bali has worsened the economic prospects in

the  region by driving away tourists and shaking  foreign

investors' confidence in the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at the beginning of 2003, war may break out

over  Iraq,  and North Korea is playing with  fire,  with

President Kim embarking on brinkmanship.  This is  indeed

a  topsy-turvy world.  There seems to be no good news  or

good stories to tell of the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are silver linings in the dark

clouds.   I believe that the Southeast Asian nations  can

emerge stronger economically and politically, if we focus

on  the problems and set our minds to deal with them.  We

can,   for   example,  leverage  on  the  Japan-Singapore

Economic Agreement for a New Age Partnership (JSEPA)  and

the  proposed China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement.   We  can

see that PRC, Japan and the United States of America, the

three  big  powers,  are  renewing  their  interests   in

Southeast Asia again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, there are signs that the US is

broadening  its  interest to encompass stronger  economic

relations  with Southeast Asia.  Singapore,  among  other

countries in the region, continues to have vital national

interests   and   supporting   long-term   US   strategic

engagement  in  Asia  and  in  helping  to  prevent   the

stabilising   strategic  competition  among   the   major

regional powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year will be the year of big political changes

in  the  region.   There will be elections  due  in  many

countries.   It  will  be  a  watershed  year.    Various

governments   and   opposition   groups   in    Malaysia,

Philippines and Indonesia will be gearing up and shifting

into "campaign mode".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of China is the most important long-term

trend in the region.  As China



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



grows,  Taiwan remains the other potential flashpoint  in

the  Asia  Pacific.  The state of US-China relation  will

also be an important factor for regional stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, China is responding to increasing ASEAN

concerns that it is an economic challenge to the  region.

To  mitigate this fear, Beijing agreed on a framework for

negotiating  the  world's largest free  trade  agreement.

And  after  several years of stalemate, China  and  ASEAN

also  agreed on a code of conduct on the South China Sea.

In  short, there are still some silver linings among  the

dark clouds surrounding the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, therefore, I wish to ask the

Minister  what  is his reading of the prospects  for  the

region.   Are  we able to continue to have a  balance  of

power  in  the region, with the big powers in place,  but

not  overwhelming  or  overbearing  in  influence?   What

positive roles can Singapore play in the region,  despite

our small size?



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Madam, the impending

war in and on Iraq will have a tremendous effect all over

the world.  Many analysts have argued that the length  of

the  war  will determine the extent of its effects.   The

Iraqi  crisis  is  indeed a serious acid  test  to  world

peace.   It  is  even challenging the  integrity  of  the

United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in today's Today, Derrick Paulo analyses the

lack of discourse on Iraq in Singapore.  Anecdotally,  we

have  heard many Singaporeans from all backgrounds,  they

are concerned with the impending war.  Like many all over

the  world, I am sure we agree that war must be the  last

resort.    The  issue  of  Iraq  provides  an   excellent

opportunity for Singaporeans to understand the complexity

of  international relations and Singapore's  position  in

such  a  complex  world.  As a small country,  there  are

factors  that  have  to be taken into consideration  each

time  Singapore  is  challenged to  make  a  decision  on

international  matters.  The Iraq issue  is  not  only  a

challenge to Singapore, but to the world over.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I have two questions in relation to this

issue.   One, I would like to ask the Minister  to  share

with  the  House  the principles that  guide  Singapore's

decision-making process in dealing with such complex  and

critical international issues.  Can he cite some previous

examples  on  decisions that Singapore has  made  on  the

United Nations based on such principles, especially  with

regard  to  issues in the Middle East?  How is  Singapore

being  viewed  by  the  world  community  based  on   the

principles  we  hold and the decisions we  made  in  such

international matters?  Next, since the war  in  Iraq  is

imminent  and  should it take place, what are  the  plans

that  we have in being part of the United Nations' effort

in rebuilding post-war Iraq?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, war clouds are looming

over  Iraq.  There are rumours of war.  Singaporeans must

be  mentally  prepared  for the potential  political  and

economic  fallout on our region in the event  of  war  in

Iraq.   If war breaks out, we can only hope that it would

be  a  short one.  Singaporeans must also brace ourselves

of potential terrorist backlash in the region.  Recently,

there was a deadly bomb blast in Davao, Philippines.  The

remnants of Al Qaeda and JI may seize the war in Iraq  to

target against US and other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Singaporeans must not be swept

along  by the political and religious sentiment  about  a

possible American attack against Iraq.  The drums of  war

are beating.  But Singaporeans must keep a clear head and

a  brave  heart  and stand united.  We  must  respond  as

Singaporeans.   We  must think and act according  to  our

national interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In difficult times, Singaporeans must have the

opportunity to rally together as a nation, and  must  not

be swayed by events beyond our shores, over which we have

no  control.  We must not be polarised by the war in Iraq

or   by   the   terrorist  backlash.   After   all,   all

Singaporeans, regardless of race, language and  religion,

are in the same boat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have enough challenges within. We have

to address the problems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



faced  by  retrenched  workers and create  jobs  for  new

graduates  and  other school leavers.  We must  therefore

work  together  for  the well-being of  Singaporeans  and

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister what will be the impact

of  impending  war  against Iraq  on  Singapore  and  the

region.   What is Singapore's stand on this issue?   Some

think that Singapore is too pro-United States of America.

Is  this  true?  I think not.  What is the likelihood  of

the  second  resolution being passed at the  UN  Security

Council?   What  if  war broke out without  a  second  UN

resolution?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Madam, I think none of us here is

naive  enough  to  believe that  there  will  be  a  15-0

Security  Council  vote  in  favour  of  military  action

against  Iraq.  Every day brings new revelations and  new

alignments.   Singapore has said that it  hoped  that  US

would  act  according  to UN resolutions.   It  has  also

signalled to Iraq to comply with these resolutions.  Now,

it  looks  like both sides are quite prepared  to  go  it

alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things stand now, the US has made it clear that

it  will  go  ahead with  its own battle against  Saddam,

whether  or  not the UN is with them.  At the same  time,

Iraq continues its dangerous cat and mouse game with  the

arms  inspectors.  My question to the Minister  is  this:

if  the  US  decides to strike out on its own, what  will

Singapore's response be?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have long been allies with the US. To speak

against  any  unilateral action by the US  and  turn  our

backs would make us fair weather friends with the US.  At

the  same time, Singapore relies on the UN to secure  its

position  and  to ensure its survival as a nation  state.

We  have always advocated the need to comply with and  to

act  in  accordance  with  the decisions  of  the  United

Nations.  If the US were to unilaterally act without  the

sanction  of the UN Security Council, we would be  caught

in a conundrum.  Should we break the rule and support the

US instead?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, although the US has repeatedly

said that it is fighting this war



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



against terrorism, it has had to do a lot of work on home

ground  to  make  sure that it does  not  risk  a  Muslim

uprising  in  its  own  country.   Singapore  is   in   a

predominantly  Muslim  region.   To  stand  with  the  US

against  the wishes of the UN Security Council  may  mean

that  we  run  the risk of alienating our neighbours,  no

matter how many clarifications we may make.  We also  run

the  risk  of  making ourselves unpopular  with  our  own

Muslim   population,  if  we  do  not   manage   emotions

carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this war starts, if it does, it can be

short and intense or long and bloody.  But whichever  way

it  turns,  as leaders of a multi-religious  country,  we

have  our  work cut out for us.  Over the past  year,  we

have seen how fragile our national bonds are, against the

primordial  calls  of religion, faith  and  language.   I

would  like to ask the Minister how else have we prepared

our  people  now for whatever that lies ahead  of  us  in

relation to this Iraqi crisis.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Despite all the flurry in

the  UN, it seems clear that US President George Bush has

decided  to  go to war against Iraq, with or  without  UN

sanction, and that the war will be waged soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq is clearly seen by the Bush administration as a

premier   source  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction   to

terrorist groups in the future.  And although it poses no

imminent threat to the US, the US is determined to disarm

Iraq  to  prevent it from becoming one.   What  does  our

Foreign  Minister make of the new doctrine of pre-emptive

strike - one which says that if you think a country  that

does  not  like you is going to attack you one day,  then

you have a legal and legitimate right to attack them now?

Is  this a legal and legitimate right of the US?  If  so,

then  is  it not also legal for Saddam to launch  a  pre-emptive strike to pre-empt the US' pre-emptive strike, if

it is able to do so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we all have contempt for Saddam Hussein; we

abhor his brutality.  He has attacked four countries.  He

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



used  chemical  weapons against his own people.   He  has

refused  to abide by the Security Council's demands  that

he  disarm.  The idea that ridding Saddam would  help  to

nurture  a  more progressive Iraq that could spur  reform

across  the Arab-Muslim world is seductive.  But none  of

us  relish the prospect of innocent lives being  lost  in

the war.  None of us will welcome the potential damage to

Muslim opinion, especially in this region, or the blow to

the  international coalition against terrorism.  None  of

us would like to be put in the position to have to choose

between following the international community and the  UN

on  the  one hand, or the US on the other.  There can  be

serious  consequences if the war were to go ahead without

UN  sanction: instability across the Middle East, an  end

to  hope  for  the Palestinians, a boost  for  terrorism,

Europe  divided,  an  outraged  Southeast  Asia,  and   a

weakened UN.



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, our stand on this critical issue would have

to  be  based on principle and on our national  interest,

and  not  on  mere expediency or on who our friends  are.

The  challenge  to us lies in summoning the  intellectual

strength  to  think  independently for ourselves,  rather

than   accepting   wholesale,   without   question,   the

conclusions   and   precepts   presented   and   packaged

elsewhere.  The question we must ask ourselves is whether

it  is  in our national interest to support a war against

Iraq.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if he sees Iraq as

a real threat to international security and order, and is

it  in  our national interest to have a war against Iraq.

Does  he  believe the US stand that Iraqi  non-compliance

with the arms inspections constitutes a "material breach"

of  Resolution 1441, thus allowing the US to  invoke  the

"serious consequences" clause?



<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Madam, as

Members have mentioned, war is imminent in Iraq.  I  join

fellow  Muslims and non-Muslims in prayers for a peaceful

resolution on Iraq.  While there is no love lost for  the

Iraqi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



President and his tyrannical and cruel regime, I fear for

the  loss  of lives and serious injuries to the innocent,

the young and old, if war breaks out.  War can be averted

if   Iraq  immediately  and  unequivocally  declares  its

compliance of UN Resolution 1441 and implements action to

destroy  its  arsenal  of weapons  of  mass  destruction,

including biological and chemical weapons.  UN inspectors

can  then be given adequate time to check and verify that

Iraq acts in accordance with its declaration, subject  to

the satisfaction of the United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War should only be fought as a last resort. My

colleagues have mentioned this.  We should be given  time

and  opportunity  to  exhaust  every  avenue  to  achieve

peaceful  disarmament.  However,  sometimes  we  must  be

ready  to go to war to win peace and stability.  If  Iraq

continues to wilfully ignore UN resolutions after  having

more   than   adequate  time  to  consider  the   serious

implications  of  its  decision, then  war  is  the  only

effective  solution left.  But it is better that  war  be

pursued with full UN backing.  We want the United Nations

Security  Council  to  be  united.   A  divided  UN  will

threaten international law and order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, what would be the position if the impasse

continues  in  the  UN Security Council  and  the  United

States  declares  war unilaterally without  UN  sanction?

The  UN  Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has  warned  that

such  a  war  will  be short on legitimacy  and  it  will

"violate  the world body's charter".  There can  also  be

other  consequences.  A war without UN backing can create

more  problems  for peace in the Middle East.   It  could

also  complicate the war against terrorism.  Worse still,

it could lead to increased threats of terrorism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, how can we best safeguard

Singapore's interests?  We want world peace and security.

We  want  the world economy to grow, so that our  economy

can  also grow, providing employment opportunities and  a

good quality of living for all Singaporeans.  We can only

pursue  life fully in accordance with our own  traditions

and beliefs if there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



sustained   peace  and  stability.   Given  the   current

political and security situation in the world, and if  it

takes a war regardless of how it is to be fought to get a

chance  for security, we must be ready for it.  Our  only

hope then is that it will be a short and decisive war for

peace and security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to ask the Minister what is

Singapore's position should the US go to war against Iraq

without  UN sanction and, generally, what is our position

on Iraq and the Middle East.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> The on-going disarmament issue which

is  continuing  to cause a great impasse  in  the  United

Nations  Security Council clearly shows that there  is  a

weakness in the UN Security Council's proceedings and the

way  it  makes its decisions.  What is clear is that  the

Iraqi  impasse is reaching a climax and that everyone  is

expecting military action sooner rather than later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is critical is that, being a small nation but

an   influential  international  player  in  the   world,

everybody   naturally  will  take  notice  of   what   is

Singapore's position.  It will be much easier for  us  if

the  UN  Security Council is able to make a decision  and

everybody follows the decision of the UN Security Council

on  Iraq.   But the problem arises when the  UN  Security

Council is unable to make a decision and the coalition of

the willing goes ahead and takes military action in Iraq.

The  problem that arises is what is Singapore's  position

in  this regard, if the UN Security Council is unable  to

make a decision.  Do we become part of this coalition  of

the   willing  and,  if  so,  what  will  then   be   our

interpretation of UN Security Council Resolution 1441?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, besides the terrorist

threat,  the  region  is  now  faced  with  the  distinct

possibility   of   an   ignition  of  one   long-standing

flashpoint in the Asia Pacific region, ie, in the  Korean

peninsula.  The recent actions of North Korea are clearly

timed  to  take advantage of the US' pre-occupation  with

Iraq.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If North Korea's development of weapons of mass

destruction is not stopped,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



it  could  either lead to a war or a "nuclearisation"  of

the   whole   region.   Beijing,  which  has  significant

leverage  over  North Korea, has a big role  to  play  in

solving this North Korean problem.  If China succeeds  in

restraining  North  Korea - and we certainly  hope  China

would  -  its  already  growing political,  economic  and

strategic weight will be further enhanced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, an aerial incident resulted when North

Korean  fighter planes confronted a US spy plane  in  the

Sea  of  Japan.   Such action is clearly provocative  and

dangerous.   Any  miscalculation  might  well   lead   to

escalation  and  into conflict in the  Korean  peninsula,

where  tensions  are  already  high  over  North  Korea's

decision to reactivate its nuclear reactors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, if war were to break out in the Korean

peninsula,   it   will  destabilise  the   region,   both

economically   and  geo-politically.   The  geo-political

landscape will also change if Tokyo and Beijing  were  to

beef  up  their  military significantly in  the  wake  of

instability in the Korean peninsula.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister what is the impact of

North  Korea's  hard-line position  and  brinkmanship  on

South  Korea, Japan, China and the US.  What if war broke

out over North Korea?  What will be the ramifications  on

Singapore's economy and security?



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Madam, the world has to contend

with a whole host of different challenges.  For instance,

even  as  a  possible war in Iraq looms, other countries,

such  as North Korea, are reported to have become  active

in  their  nuclear  programmes.  Whatever  might  be  the

purposes  in  acting in the manner that they  have,  they

have  compounded the complexities that the  international

community has to deal with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is the

position  of  Singapore vis-a-vis the nuclear  stance  of

North  Korea,  and what measures are we taking,  together

with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



international  community,  to  safeguard   our   national

interests in this case.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Madam, I thank the Members who have spoken.

I  shall first respond to Dr Ong Chit Chung, who gave his

own  views on the state of the world and the region,  and

he  ended up by asking me for my reading of the prospects

for  the  world  and  the region,  and  how  we  position

ourselves.   I  would like to agree with  him  by  saying

that, yes, indeed there has been much bad news.  I cannot

recall any other period in recent history when we have to

operate  in  such  a fluid, unpredictable  and  turbulent

environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I will do is to give an overview of how I see

our  position in the region, how Singapore is positioning

itself with regard to our neighbours and the major powers

and  then  point  out  how we see the  overall  strategic

landscape  in  which  we have to operate.   Members  have

spoken about national interests.  I will state how we see

our  national interests which guide our policies on  many

foreign  policy issues, including that of Iraq.   Then  I

will  respond to the specific questions on Iraq and North

Korea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our relations with our ASEAN neighbours

remain  a  key  focus  of our foreign  policy.   On  25th

January  2003, I had already spoken at length  about  our

relations with Malaysia.  Admittedly, they are not in the

best  state.   But  both  sides  have  brought  down  the

temperature.   Our relations with other  Southeast  Asian

countries are excellent and strengthening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Indonesia, our ties are deep and broad. To

demonstrate  Singapore's confidence in  Indonesia,  Prime

Minister  Goh  visited Jakarta last  December,  just  two

months after the Bali bombings.  He was the first foreign

leader  to  do  so.  It was a gesture of  our  consistent

support for President Megawati and her government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh also visited Thailand and Vietnam

earlier  this year.  Many new initiatives were undertaken

during these visits.  President Nathan's state visits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



to  Cambodia and Vietnam also underscored our  close  and

warm  ties  with those neighbours.  We will  continue  to

make  efforts to improve relations with Malaysia and,  at

the same time, consolidate our excellent ties with others

in ASEAN and the rest of the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards our relations with other countries,

beyond  ASEAN, we have strong and healthy relations  with

all  the  major  powers.   With  the  United  States,  we

concluded  a FTA which is now before Congress.   The  US-Singapore FTA is not just important for economic  growth,

it  also  has importance strategically.  It will  add  an

important  new dimension to our already strong  economic,

military and political ties with the United States.   And

the Prime Minister will visit Washington later this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With China, we continue to have excellent relations,

and  we  have  frequent exchanges  of  visits  by  senior

leaders  on  both  sides.  President  Hu  Jintao  visited

Singapore  last year before assuming the top  post.   The

new  Chinese  leadership is familiar to  us.   The  Prime

Minister  intends to visit China in the  course  of  this

year.   As  China  grows, our relationship  with  it,  of

course,  will  assume  even greater  importance,  and  we

believe  that China will become an even more  significant

part  of  the  regional equation.  Our strong  ties  with

Beijing are therefore, in my view, a plus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Japan, our relationship has been brought to a

new  height  with  the conclusion of the  Japan-Singapore

Economic Agreement for a New Age Partnership (JSEPA).   I

visited   Japan   last  year  and  held   very   fruitful

discussions   with  Japanese  Foreign   Minister   Yoriko

Kawaguchi on matters of mutual concern.  I am glad to say

that  Prime Minister Goh will visit Japan in a few weeks'

time.   Japan  is  struggling to shake a decade  of  slow

growth.   But  for all its problems, Japan is  still  the

second  largest economy in the world and of  considerable

importance  to Singapore and the region.   We  will  work

closely with Tokyo to enhance our bilateral relations, as

well  as  facilitate Japan's role in  ASEAN.   This  year

marks the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



30th  Anniversary  of  the  commencement  of  Japan-ASEAN

relations.   Prime  Minister  Goh  intends  to  attend  a

special ASEAN summit in Tokyo in December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With India, President Nathan visited India earlier

this year, and Prime Minister Goh will do so in a month's

time.  Our traditional ties with India are strong and  we

are   adding   to  them  in  many  ways,  including   the

possibility  of  negotiating  a  Comprehensive   Economic

Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with India.  We  share  many

common  strategic interests and our economic relationship

has  assumed  greater importance. We have  also  strongly

supported  the  convening  of  the  ASEAN-India  Leaders'

Summit.



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ties with the European countries are also strong

and  healthy.   The Prime Minister, the two Deputy  Prime

Ministers,  myself and other Ministers have visited  most

of the European countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with Australia and New Zealand, we also have good

relations with Australia and have just concluded  an  FTA

with  them.  New Zealand is a strong and reliable  friend

and was our first FTA partner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a very truncated account of our relations

with  countries in the region and the major powers.  What

I  want to stress is this:  that our relations with these

countries  and the stability of our region and the  state

of  health  of the region do not occur in a  vacuum.   We

must  view  them  in  the broader strategic  context  and

global  developments.  Let me briefly explain the complex

global environment which we are currently operating in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cold War has ended. But a decade after the end

of  the  Cold  War,  it has become very  clear  that  the

collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the dangerous

nuclear confrontation between the superpowers really have

not  made  for a more peaceful world. Yes, we  no  longer

have  the  eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation  between  the

world's  super  powers.  But we live now in  a  new  era,

which sees us facing many different challenges, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



new threats to our physical security, economic well-being

and social stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-Cold War world has proved to be a messy and

dangerous  place.  Just to name a few major developments,

the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the first Gulf  War  to

restore  Kuwaiti independence; the collapse of  countries

resulting in political and humanitarian crisis such as in

Somalia   and  Haiti;  genocidal  violence   in   Rwanda;

political  turmoil,  "ethnic cleansing"  and  ultimately,

NATO  interventions in the Balkans.  The Middle East  was

and continues to be wrecked by endemic violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if that was the state of affairs after the end

of  the Cold War, post 9/11, the world has become an even

messier  and  more  dangerous place.  9/11  revealed  the

existence   of   highly   organised   and   well-financed

transnational  terrorist organisations of  global  scope,

motivated  by  a  radical and deviant  interpretation  of

Islam,  determined  to  bring down secular  and  moderate

governments. These governments were predominately  Muslim

countries - Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Sudan,  Somalia,

Nigeria,  Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia.  Even  we  in

Singapore were not spared as the JI arrests have shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggle against terrorism is clearly not a

struggle  against  Islam.  But it is an unfortunate  fact

that  it is complicated by the campaign of the terrorists

to  portray it as a war against Islam. They have targeted

the  United States and its friends because the US is  the

chief   obstacle  to  their  designs.  The  war   against

terrorism  has  also been complicated by  the  discomfort

which  many  Muslims - and not just Muslims - have  about

United States' policies in the Middle East.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no one can be a bystander in this struggle.

And  terrorism will exist even if there is a solution  to

the  Middle  East  problem.   Pretending  to  ignore  the

problems will not buy greater safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post 9/11, all countries, including Singapore, have

had to reassess the secu-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



rity  priorities and strategic interests.  Singapore  has

been  compelled  to  do  so  because  Iraq's  decade-long

flouting  of UN efforts to disarm it of weapons  of  mass

destruction    (WMD)   has   assumed   more   threatening

proportions.   It  now  poses  an  unacceptable  risk  of

proliferation.   As Members will know,  North  Korea  has

taken advantage of the Iraqi crisis to push forward  with

its  own  nuclear  weapons  programme,  creating  a  very

dangerous situation in North Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, one paradoxical aspect of 9/11 has been

to  stabilise  major power relations in the  Asia-Pacific

making   for   a   more   favourable  overall   strategic

environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I refer to relations between China

and  the  US which have become more stable.  The US-China

relationship  is  a  key bilateral relationship  in  East

Asia.  If  that relationship is stable, it has a  calming

effect in the entire region.  But when China-US relations

become roiled, the entire region becomes unsettled.  Good

China-US  relations therefore are important for a  stable

strategic environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to ASEAN, which Dr Ong Chit Chung asked,

I   would   say  that  another  interesting   post   9/11

development  is that China, Japan and the  United  States

are  renewing their interests in South-east Asia.  So are

India  and Europe. Post 9/11, the major powers have  also

rediscovered ASEAN's importance in maintaining  stability

in  our  region  and  that  we  are  assuming  a  greater

prominence  in  the global anti-terrorism campaign.   The

major  powers are now engaging ASEAN, I would  say,  with

greater  enthusiasm, than I have seen a  few  years  ago.

This  is  a  plus for Singapore; and is a  plus  for  the

region as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism and these new challenges require national,

regional   and  international  responses.  We   have   to

structure  our responses within the international  system

that is no longer bipolar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would say that the key geo-political effect of

the post-Cold War is a pre-eminence of the United States;

a pre-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



eminence on the scale unprecedented in history and multi-dimensional in its scope; not just military but economic,

financial and technological.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not likely that American pre-eminence can be

seriously  challenged by any country  or  combination  of

countries in the foreseeable future.  Like it or not,  it

is  a  geo-political reality that no international  issue

today can be resolved without the active cooperation,  or

at least acquiescence, of the United States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the United States is at the forefront of the war

against  terrorism, proliferation, and security challenge

presented by Iraq and North Korea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheer scale of United States' pre-eminence has,

of course, provoked a degree of international discomfort,

even  among  United States' close friends and  allies  in

Europe,  South Korea and Japan. That discomfort  is  seen

now being focused on the Iraq issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are Singapore's national interests? We have to

ask this question because in the midst of these confusing

and  troubling  times, in the midst of  an  international

debate  in which seemingly valid points are made  by  all

sides, I think it is important, as several of the Members

have pointed out, that we in Singapore understand what is

Singapore's  national  interests.   And  I   agree   with

Members, Dr Ong Chit Chung and Dr Maliki, that it is  all

the  more  important  now for us  not  to  be  swayed  by

emotions  or the fashion of the moment, but to  carefully

and  calmly  assess our national interests with  a  clear

head.  Let me set out some basic considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, yes, of course, the world may well be

better   off   with   a   more  balanced   structure   of

international power.  There is no doubt about that.  But,

our  wishing it to be so is not going to make it  happen.

Would  we be better off if the Cold War was still on  or,

worse  still, if the Soviet Union had emerged triumphant?

I do not think so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Singapore has for many years emphasised

the importance of the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



States   in   providing  stability  and   that   is   the

irreplaceable  foundation for Asia-Pacific  growth  since

the  end  of  the Second World War.  We have stated  that

position  of  ours  even at the  time  when  it  was  not

fashionable  or  politically  correct  to  do  so.   Why?

Because   it  was  in  Singapore's  fundamental  national

interests.   A small country like Singapore  can  survive

and prosper only when there is a stable balance of power.

And  the  United States is an irreplaceable part  of  any

regional  or international balance.  And it is  not  just

statements  that we have made to that effect but,  within

our  limited means, we have done what we could to provide

access  to our facilities to enable the United States  to

maintain  its presence in our region.  And we  did  that,

again, because it was in our national interest to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, terrorism is a threat to Singapore as it is

to  all civilised countries. The proliferation of weapons

of  mass  destruction is a particular threat to  a  small

country  like  Singapore  where  a  single  chemical   or

biological attack will have a catastrophic effect  on  an

entire  nation.   A nuclear attack would  also  mean  the

physical  end  of Singapore.  And this is  not  something

theoretical  or  far-fetched -  only  two  days  ago,  Mr

Mohamad El Baradei said on BBC addressing a conference of

the  IAEA  where  he warned of the reports  of  terrorist

plans   to   build  and  deploy  radiological  dispersion

devices,  and he said, given the inadequacies  of  source

control,  it  is clear that additional security  measures

are  urgently needed.  So if action is not taken  against

Iraq  or  other countries who possess illegal weapons  of

mass   destruction,   what  will  be   the   implications

internationally?  This is a question that  everyone  must

ask  in  Singapore.  Supposing, after all that  has  been

said  and  done,  in the end, Iraq is not disarmed,  what

signal  would  this send to extremist groups  across  the

world?  After all, after 9/11, in other words, the  issue

of weapons of mass destruction proliferation has taken on

an entirely new and even more threatening dimension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Korea has already taken advantage of the

international pre-occupation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



with  Iraq  to push forward with its own nuclear  weapons

programme. Singapore has expressed its deep concern  over

North  Korea's  actions and called upon it to  reconsider

its actions.  I will come back when I answer the specific

questions later on on North Korea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that Singapore will not flinch

from  doing  what  is necessary to advance  our  national

interests.   But we will assess each situation  carefully

in  the  light  of our own interest, make  our  decisions

based  on the facts and our calculations of the long-term

national  interest  and good of Singapore.  We  will  not

hesitate  to  state  our  own views,  even  if  it  means

disagreeing  with  other countries, whether  they  are  a

major power or not.  And indeed, we have had occasions to

do  so.   But  it is in Singapore's overall  interest  to

maintain  the  best possible relations we can,  not  just

with the US, but with all the major powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members, I hope, will trust that the Government will

always  adopt  a foreign policy based on the  fundamental

principles which I had just elaborated.  We have earned a

reputation  internationally  as  a  principled  and  fair

country.  That reputation was reaffirmed during our  term

as a Security Council member in the last two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made those comments on the strategic overview

and    having   stated   the   key   national   interests

considerations,  let me now respond to Members  who  have

asked about our position in Iraq.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of our position, which has been stated

publicly on many occasions can be summed up as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the onus is on Iraq to disarm and it is

imperative that Iraq disarms immediately and comply  with

all United Nations Security Council Resolutions.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have insisted on this because of the need

for all UN members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



to  scrupulously  comply with UN  Resolutions,  and  also

because  of the grave threat to international  peace  and

security caused by the development and spread of  weapons

of mass destruction (WMD).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress that this is not a new position. Our

position predates the present diplomatic standoff in  the

UN.  It is a position we have consistently articulated in

the  United  Nations.  In fact, our position  dates  back

many   years  to  the  Gulf  War,  when  we  joined   the

international   community  then  in   condemning   Iraq's

aggression  against Kuwait as totally unacceptable  under

international law and the United Nations Charter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put matters in context, the current crisis

actually  stems  from some important  outstanding  issues

since  the  end  of  the Gulf War.  And  I  think  it  is

important to put matters in context, because we often get

the  wrong  picture when there is talk about  a  "second"

Resolution  of  the  Security  Council.   In  fact   this

resolution  would  have been the  18th  of  the  Security

Council  on Iraq's non-compliance, and the most  critical

of  these outstanding issues is the disarmament of Iraq's

weapons of mass destruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That critical aspect was central to the post-Gulf

War  ceasefire  settlement reached between the  coalition

forces and Iraq, and is set out in UNSC Resolution 687 of

April  1991.  In other words, to put matters in  context,

we have to go back to 1991.  In the Security Council last

year  (October  2002),  when we  were  a  Member  of  the

Security Council, we made a statement and we said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Regrettably, Iraq has not complied with many of the

terms  of  Resolution 687, even though  eleven  and  half

years have passed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it is not just Resolution 1441 that

we  are  talking about.  Iraq has had a deplorable record

of  complying with UNSC Resolutions.  Next, I want to say

that  the  United  Nations Security  Council  unanimously

decided  last  year in November 2002 on  Resolution  1441

that "Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its

obligations   under   relevant   resolutions,   including

Resolution 687



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



(1991)."  and  decided "to give a final  opportunity"  to

Iraq  to  comply and Iraq was warned that "it  will  face

serious   consequences  as  a  result  of  its  continued

violations of its obligations".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned just now, we have to take a strong

stand on the threat posed by WMD, particularly after 9/11

because  the  danger of WMD falling  into  the  hands  of

terrorists, terrorist organisations or extremist  groups,

as  I  said,  is not a hypothetical risk.   In  fact,  as

Members  who  have  read on this  subject  know,   Saddam

Hussein  actually  used biological and  chemical  weapons

against his own people and the people of Iran.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current intense diplomatic efforts show that the

Iraq  issue is a very complex one which necessitates  the

balancing   of  several  different  considerations   and,

unfortunately, not all of them fit neatly together.   The

United  States is facing a difficult time in the Security

Council.   There have been global anti-war protests.   No

one  in  this Chamber or outside this Chamber likes  war.

But  let us be clear about the facts and the equities  of

the  case.  And if you look at the facts of the case,  it

is  very clear to us that it is Iraq, not the US and  not

the  UN, not the international community, which is in the

dock.   The onus is on Iraq and if the consequences ensue

where  there  is a use of force, it must  be  because  of

Iraq's failure to comply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many other countries, Singapore also favours

that  there  be a second United Nations Security  Council

resolution.   And we have called for a UN resolution;  we

have  advocated the Council's unity, a point made  by  Mr

Othman  Haron.   I  do  not  want  to  speculate  on  the

likelihood  of  a  second resolution  being  passed.   As

somebody mentioned just now, things are changing  day  by

day, hour to hour and your guess is as good as mine.  The

Security Council members, according to the latest  e-mail

I  received  from  our  Ambassador, are  still  intensely

deliberating over the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what I would like to say here in response

to Mr Sin Boon Ann is that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



even  if  there  is  no second resolution,  it  does  not

automatically  follow that action against Iraq  is  taken

outside  international  law or  United  Nations  Security

Council   authorisation.   The  United  Nations  Security

Council  Resolution 1441 has clearly pronounced that Iraq

has   been   in  material  breach  of  Security   Council

resolutions for more than 12 years; from UNSC  Resolution

678  of  1990  right  up to Resolution  1441  last  year.

Singapore has said so at the UN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the war? Of course, any war in Iraq,

with  or  without a second UNSC Resolution, will  have  a

negative impact on the world and in our region.  It  will

result in loss of lives; it will result in destruction of

properties;  it  will affect investment  sentiments,  may

push up oil prices; and will leave a deep scar surely  on

those directly involved in the war for a long time.   And

I  think  it  will  also be exploited by  extremists  and

terrorists  for  their own purposes.   We  must  have  no

illusions on the effects of such a war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Singapore has taken a consistent position

on  Iraq since Resolution 678 in 1990 and Resolution  687

in  1991.  Our  understanding of United Nations  Security

Council  Resolution 1441, which was adopted by  consensus

when  we were in the Security Council, was that it  found

Iraq   in   material   breach  of  UN  Security   Council

resolutions.  It was intended as a final chance for  Iraq

and  would  have  serious consequences if  Iraq  did  not

comply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq's possession of illegal WMD is, post 9/11, an

unacceptable threat. If Iraq gets away without disarming,

it will send a very bad signal to extremist groups across

the  world.   The  fact that the Security Council  cannot

reach consensus on a second resolution cannot be taken as

an excuse for inaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, our key consideration must be

our national interest.  The UN can only operate within  a

stable  international environment and it is  that  stable

environment that Iraq's WMD threatens.  Hence, it  is  in

our  fundamental national interest to see Iraq  disarmed.

This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



necessary  to  send  the right signal to  extremists  and

other  states like North Korea that are trying to develop

WMD,  as  well  as to signal to non-state  players,  like

terrorists and extremist groups whose threat to the world

will be enhanced if they get their hands on WMD.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked whether our stand on Iraq

makes  us  too pro-United States.  Some Members  told  me

this  point  has  also arisen in their dialogue  sessions

with  their constituents.  Perhaps I should address  this

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not pro-US; we are not anti-any country.

What then are we?  We are being pro-Singapore.  By that I

mean  that  when we take positions, we do so  to  advance

Singapore's   national  interests.   Yes,   we   strongly

advocated   United   States'   continued   presence   and

engagement  in  this  region.   Yes,  we  have  excellent

bilateral  relations with the United  States.   But  that

does  not  mean  that we are subservient  to  the  United

States  or that we agree with everything that the  United

States does, or says, or requests, without regard to  our

own national interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those older colleagues of mine in this House need

not  be  reminded  in  this regard  of  the  Michael  Fay

incident, where on a matter concerning law and order,  we

stood  for our right to enforce our laws despite  immense

pressure  from  the  US.   There  have  been  many  other

instances  over  the  years  where  our  positions   have

differed  from the United States, and where we could  not

go along with their requests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give one example and this might also

answer  Dr  Maliki's  question  on  whether  I  can  give

examples where our positions are based on principles, how

we  are viewed and so on.  And the example I will take is

the  Palestinian issue which was, and is, still  a  very,

very heated and sensitive issue in the United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Palestinian issue, we have supported action

and decisions that could advance the prospects for peace,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



we   have  tried  to  play  a  moderating  role  wherever

possible.   In  March 2001, the United  States  vetoed  a

United  Nations  Security Council resolution  that  would

call  for an international observer force to be  sent  to

help   restore   peace   in  the   Palestinian   Occupied

Territories.   However, although the  United  States  was

opposed to this and urged us not to support it, Singapore

co-sponsored and voted for that draft resolution, because

we  felt  that  the  proposal to send  an  impartial  and

neutral  international presence had merits and  had  wide

support  in the UN as one way to stabilise the  situation

in  the  occupied territories.  And in the first half  of

2002  when we were in the Security Council, we were  also

closely involved in several initiatives to get Israel  to

comply   with  Security  Council   resolutions   and   we

supported  calls  for  an  immediate  ceasefire  and  the

withdrawal  of  Israeli  forces  from  West  Bank  towns,

including Ramallah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our voting records in the UN on the

Palestinian  issue  are very different  from  the  United

States.    Records  published  and  circulated   by   the

Palestinian  Authority show that Singapore has  voted  in

support  of all the key 17 United Nations resolutions  on

the  Palestinian issue.  On this issue also, we  are  not

pro  or  anti  any side; we have maintained a  principled

stand; we have maintained a constructive stand.  We  have

said that the countries in the region must recognise  the

right of Israel to exist within secure borders, and  that

we  have also said that we must also recognise the  right

of the Palestinian people to a homeland of their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, a quick response on North Korea. I

said  "quick" because our position on WMD,  the  risk  of

proliferation and the linkage with terrorism, also shaped

our  position  on North Korea. And we are concerned  also

for what it portends for the stability of North East Asia

and  for  Asia.  Therefore, we expressed our concerns  on

North   Korea's  decision  to  reactivate   its   nuclear

programme,  to  cease cooperation with the  IAEA  and  to

withdraw  from  NPT.   We have said publicly  that  North

Korea's  decision has grave repercussions on  the  Korean

Peninsula and for the international



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



non-proliferation regime.  We have issued  statements  to

express  our  concerns.  We have  urged  North  Korea  to

reconsider  its decision.  It is a retrograde steps  that

undermines    KEDO    (Korean    Peninsula    Development

Organisation)   and  raises  tensions   on   the   Korean

Peninsula, which complicates the Asia Pacific's  security

situation as a whole.  North Korea's recent missile tests

have further aggravated the situation.



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is not in the interest of Singapore and other

countries  to  see tensions on the Korean Peninsula.   If

the   current   tensions  escalate  further,   it   could

destabilise  the  strategic balance in  the  Asia-Pacific

region,  and possibly trigger a regional arms  race.   We

have  encouraged all interested parties, including United

States,  South Korea and Japan, China, Russia  and  North

Korea  to  continue their dialogue in  order  to  restore

stability in the Korean Peninsula.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One quick clarification, Mr Sin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Will the Minister please clarify

whether  the past resolutions of the UN Security  Council

on  Iraq  specifically allow the US  to  take  unilateral

action  in the event of non-compliance by Iraq  on  these

resolutions?  Secondly, as a matter of international law,

would  it  be  right for the US to take  such  unilateral

action without the specific sanction of the UN?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Madam, if the Member is

interested,  I could send him a copy of Resolution  1441.

But,  as I said, it is not just Resolution 1441.  We have

to  view  the whole series of resolutions.  And  that  is

why, to view matters in context, the debate clearly ought

not  to be viewed as a "second" UN resolution but as what

the  UN resolutions had authorised over a period of time.

And as I said, Resolution 1441 has made it very clear, it

has  found  unanimously, the Security Council  has  found

that  Iraq  has  been in material breach of  obligations.

"Iraq  has  been and remains in material  breach  of  its

obligations under relevant resolutions. ."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we can have a very fine debate on international

law,  UN  Charter.   Somebody mentioned  Kofi  Annan,  UN

Secretary-General.   Singapore and I have  great  respect

for him.  But I think these issues will be debated for  a

very  long time and the key point I want to emphasise  is

that,  while this debate goes on, the issue is:  if there

is  a paralysis in the decision-making of the UN Security

Council,  its  international order,  other  interests  of

peace-loving  countries  who  are  concerned   with   WMD

terrorists, are these served by inaction as a result of a

paralysis,  or  they  are served by  ensuring  that  Iraq

disarms?  That is the dilemma.  So, we can have this fine

international  debate,  I would have  to  meet  with  the

international lawyers in the Attorney-General's  Chambers

...it can go on.  This debate has already begun.  You have

read  both  sides of it but I would say that an  argument

has also been made - a very strong argument has also been

made  - that the legal basis for any military action  may

be  drawn  from  the  framework of all  the  UN  Security

Council's  resolutions.  As I have  said,  while  we  can

split  fine legal hairs, the key policy dilemma, the  key

law and order dilemma for the world and for us is, if war

breaks  out,  who has been responsible for  it?   In  our

view,  it  is  because of the failure of Iraq  to  disarm

promptly and effectively.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, ASEAN was established

with  goodwill  and had many good years of  unprecedented

economic   growth.   There  was  internal  cohesion   and

collective strength.  However, with the exit of President

Suharto  and the Asian economic crisis, many  think  that

ASEAN  has  lost  its  direction and momentum.   Internal

dissension  and  rivalry  have  surfaced.   One   wonders

whether  some  ASEAN states can settle their  differences

and  come  to  terms  with  each  other.   There  is  now

tiredness  about  ASEAN.  Attention  and  direct  foreign

investments have now shifted to China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the Minister is: has ASEAN expanded

too  fast and too soon in terms of membership?  Has ASEAN

eaten  more than it can chew or digest?  I would like  to

ask the Minister what role



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



can  ASEAN  play  in  the future and  whether  there  are

measures to strengthen ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, can we upgrade or strengthen the ASEAN

Regional Forum so that it will not merely be a talk  shop

but   also   a  platform  for  confidence  building   and

preventive diplomacy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Madam, there was a time when ASEAN

was  a  regional  grouping much envied by  many  for  its

ability  to  demonstrate its cohesiveness  and  unity  in

collectively  dealing with the world.  Its success  as  a

political organisation even inspired many to suggest that

ASEAN should move to the next level to become an economic

union  to  tap  on its huge market potential  of  half  a

billion people.  Many had held the hope that ASEAN  could

rival China as the next economic powerhouse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the sixties and the seventies, ASEAN was seen

as  a  bastion  of  Southeast Asia's  stand  against  the

onslaught  of  communism, both  within  and  outside  the

region.  As a consequence of the perceived common threat,

the  then  members of ASEAN were able to rally  together,

despite   real   differences.   This  successful   coming

together  to  deal with common problems, particularly  in

international forums like the United Nations, served as a

basis  for  Southeast  Asian nations  to  come  together.

Since  then,  the common threat of communism has  receded

and,  in the process, so has the rallying call for  ASEAN

to  come  together.  Some would argue that not  even  the

common  threat  of  terrorism is able  to  galvanise  the

region to the same extent as before.  In fact, the  level

of intra-regional cooperation that should have come about

to deal with terrorism could have been better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, ASEAN does not appear to have quite the same

polish.    Indonesia  continues  to  struggle  with   its

economy.   Each country within the grouping  seems  beset

with  its  own problems, whether it be rising nationalism

or rising unemployment.  The low point of ASEAN came with

the sacking of the Thai embassy recently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



by  an  angry  mob  in Phnom Penh, with  the  authorities

standing by and looking like they did nothing to  prevent

it.   The  question before us today is:  is  ASEAN  still

relevant?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that ASEAN has been more successful as a

political  group  than as an economic one,  even  if  the

increase in the number of members has made consensus  and

collective action more difficult.  To get 10 to agree  is

certainly  more  difficult than getting six,  bearing  in

mind that the 10 members are at very different stages  of

development  and, thus, having rather different  national

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact remains that cross-border economic

cooperation among member countries could have made better

progress.  Many of the proposed projects, including AFTA,

have  been very slow to take off and, in any event,  have

yet to prove the result that we can all cheer about.  The

issues  look set to continue.  Yet, now more  than  ever,

there is great urgency for the countries of ASEAN to  all

pull together in the same direction, particularly in  the

area  of  economic cooperation, as we see  new  economies

emerging  in  China and India that are sucking  away  all

potential direct investments from the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless ASEAN member countries can come together to

speed   up  its  economic  cooperation  and  deepen   its

integration,  ASEAN, as a regional group, could  well  be

marginalised.   I would like to ask the Minister  whether

the  belief still exists that ASEAN is relevant and  what

further measures the governments in the regional grouping

are  taking  to speed up this cooperation and integration

to deal with the challenges ahead.



<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Madam, ASEAN's role and importance

in  the  eyes of the world appear to be changing, as  has

been   eloquently  put  by  my  fellow  MPs.   The   vast

differences that exist within ASEAN also appear to impede

further  progress,  especially in the  field  of  perhaps

political opinion.  Singapore has seconded the very  able

Mr Ong Keng Yong to be ASEAN's new Secretary-General.  We

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



also   continued  to  promote  cultural  and  educational

exchanges within ASEAN.  How successful have we  been  so

far  in  promoting  the ideals of ASEAN  and  Singapore's

interests within the context of ASEAN in the areas  where

ASEAN  is  still  able to move?  How can we  ensure  that

ASEAN  will  continue to be one of the preferred  baskets

when major economic powers and players feel that they  do

not want to put all their eggs in the North Asian basket?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee in his Budget Speech has

spoken  of  the  need to deepen our economic  integration

with  our ASEAN neighbours and make ASEAN more attractive

to  foreign investors.  May I ask the Minister how we are

progressing in the ASEAN-China and ASEAN-India FTAs,  and

how  successful have we been in promoting tourism  within

ASEAN?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Madam, in the light of what my

colleagues  have already asked about ASEAN, I would  just

come to the crux of the issue.  I would just like to  ask

the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to what really is the

state of affairs in ASEAN today.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, the raison d'etre of

ASEAN  was to build a region of stability and peace.   It

took  a  united stand against the communist threats  from

the northern Indo-Chinese countries.  It adopted a common

response  during  the Cambodian conflict  and  played  an

important role in isolating Vietnam at the UN.   The  end

of  the  Cold  War  and  the  Cambodian  settlement  made

possible  the enlargement of the Association  to  include

all 10 Southeast Asian countries and the establishment of

the ASEAN Regional Forum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ASEAN today is a pale reflection of its own

self  and seems almost irrelevant in tackling the  severe

challenges facing us today.  As the Foreign Minister  did

say  just  now, the world is a messier and more dangerous

place   today.    ASEAN  took  a  united  stand   against

terrorism,  but even then the emphasis was  on  bilateral

cooperation  than on a concerted regional approach.   And

now, the Southeast Asian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



cooperation against the US-led war against terrorism  may

be   undermined  as  leaders  from  the  different  ASEAN

countries  take  different positions on  the  US-led  war

against Iraq, which some in the region see as anti-Islam,

including some ASEAN leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will also find it increasingly hard to stand

against domestic public opinion as resentment against US'

unilateralist   approach  builds  up.   The   peace   and

stability in Southeast Asia will encounter some  profound

challenges  in  the decades ahead.  The core  reason  for

this, in my view, is that the prevailing relationship  of

power and influence will undergo significant change.  The

first  of this is the rise of China.  The second will  be

the  maturation  of Japan into a more normal  and  multi-faceted  player  seeking to compete on more  equal  terms

with  China.   And  the  third, but  not  least,  is  the

hegemony,  and like what the Foreign Minister  said,  the

pre-eminence of the US as the power which sees the  world

in  black  and white - either you are with us or  against

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US-China-Japan's strategic balance that has long

underpinned East Asian growth and stability  is  a  fluid

one,  and  this  has implication on the security  of  our

region.   The  competition between the major  powers  for

economic,  political and strategic influence in Southeast

Asia   has  started  already  and  can  be  expected   to

intensify.  You can see this in the FTAs that  China  and

Japan  are  pursuing  with ASEAN.   Unfortunately,  ASEAN

cohesion has taken a beating in recent years.  Historical

tensions and rivalries within the grouping have not  been

addressed  and  resolved in a substantive way.   Disputes

between neighbours continue to hit the headlines such  as

the  quarrels between Cambodia and Thailand, and  between

Malaysia and Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN is therefore not as well positioned as it

might  have been to cope with the shift in the  strategic

picture.   What  would  happen  is  that  the  heightened

uncertainty about the stability of the wider region  will

legitimise  the  continued  modernisation  of  the  Armed

Forces.   This  will  fuel  local  rivalries  even  more.

Moreover, there will also be a significant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



difference  among  ASEAN states  in  the  nature  of  the

balance  they seek in their relations with major  powers.

It is clear that ASEAN has reached a low ebb.  Whether it

will  remain  this  way depends, to a  great  extent,  on

efforts  by  political leaders of all ASEAN countries  to

sustain the strategic importance of the relations for the

region as a whole.  This would mean that they should  try

to  resolve  whatever issues they face  and  not  at  the

expense of ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, ASEAN states must also have

realistic expectations of each other.  A common complaint

that  I  hear  when  I  visit  ASEAN  countries  is  that

Singapore  is not doing enough to pour money  into  their

economies  to help them.  They continue to see  Singapore

as  a  selfish rich kid, which should open up its  purse-strings  to  invest in their countries,  never  mind  the

investment  risk  is high, because of  their  social  and

economic  problems.   Such  high  expectations  from  our

neighbours  can  fuel  tensions  when  they   feel   that

Singapore  is  not being helpful.  But, Madam,  Singapore

too  is  undergoing great economic uncertainties and,  as

you  have  heard  in the recent Budget  debate,  our  own

Singaporeans  are  also  clamouring  for  more  from  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister's views on how

ASEAN can be strengthened, given the circumstances.  And,

at  the  same  time,  I would like to  ask  the  Minister

whether  he  feels that the expectations  of  Singapore's

neighbours have moderated in these difficult times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Madam, I too would like to join

my  colleagues in expressing my concerns about the  state

of affairs in ASEAN and its future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, ASEAN has been perceived by

many as an organisation that appears to have lost some of

its earlier momentum and directions.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the Asian financial crisis, ASEAN had been

an organisation that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



allowed its members much political and social contact and

played  a  pivotal role in forging regional  cooperation.

Many  of  ASEAN's economies were regarded as amongst  the

most  dynamic  in  the world and full  of  promise.   The

ability  of  its  member states to  engage  in  dialogue,

consultation  and confidence building in a  peaceful  and

amicable manner was seen as its most positive point.  Its

efforts  to  lay  the  foundation for  regional  economic

cooperation offered much hope for its 500 million people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the economic crisis that engulfed the

region  following the onset of the Asian financial crisis

in  1997 changed all that.  ASEAN's inability to come  up

with  a  coordinated or concerted response to tackle  the

crisis  only  served to show its weakness at  a  time  of

great crisis.  Instead of working out a unified course of

action, many ASEAN member countries went about their  own

way  in dealing with the crisis.  Indonesia and Thailand,

for  example, turned to IMF, and Malaysia instituted  its

own  capital  controls as the way  of  dealing  with  the

financial  crisis.  Now this had the effect  of  reducing

the region's appeal to outsiders, particularly, coming at

a  time  when China was becoming more and more attractive

to foreign investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the much touted ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)

was  met  with some scepticism.  While intra-ASEAN  trade

has  increased, there remains significant  bugbears  like

Malaysia's  refusal  to bring down  tariffs  on  imported

vehicles  for  a  few  more years  and  the  Philippines'

reluctance to lower tariffs on petrochemicals.  There has

also  been  difficulty  in  drawing  up  procedures   and

standards for imports into the various countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the man-in-the-street, ASEAN remains much a

mystery.   They do not even know what ASEAN means.   Many

cannot  even name all the 10 member countries.  To  them,

ASEAN is, at most, a talk shop for political leaders  and

some  businessmen  that they hear about  or  see  in  the

newspapers from time to time.  Many do not even bother to

read  articles on ASEAN.  And this, to me,  Madam,  is  a

pity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the man-in-the-street too, ASEAN is far from

being a united force.  All they see is the negative side,

which is reported in the newspapers, like the quarrelling

neighbours,  for  example,  the  regular  spats   between

Singapore and Malaysia and the border skirmishes  between

Thailand and Myanmar.  A few weeks ago, when a Thai movie

actress  allegedly  made  some  sensitive  remarks  about

Angkor  Wat belonging to the Thais, this led to  days  of

riots  in  Phnom  Penh  as  the  Thai  Embassy  and  Thai

businesses'  premises were attacked  by  Cambodian  mobs.

At  a  time when the whole world was worried sick  as  to

whether  war  would  break out in Iraq,  there  was  this

sudden  danger  of actually a war occurring  between  two

member  countries of ASEAN.  Nobody would  have  imagined

that the Thai airforce was already on the alert and ready

to send its planes into Cambodian territory.  So much for

regional peace and cooperation.  Fortunately, good  sense

has  prevailed.  The matter is now being resolved, to put

it very diplomatically, through diplomatic channels.  But

this   is   an   incident  that  will  leave   scars   on

relationship.  And it is not helpful to ASEAN's image.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, last year when I spoke on this topic, I

mentioned  that ASEAN was fast being lost  on  the  radar

screen of outsiders.  Many perceived the member countries

as  simply not trusting one another enough to the  extent

that  ASEAN was incapable of negotiating collective deals

with  outsiders.   Even Rodolfo Severino,  the  Secretary

General of ASEAN who stepped down last year, had this  to

say, and I quote him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People in the region, including those from the

business  sector,  don't recognise  their  stake  in  the

destiny and cohesion of ASEAN."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, ASEAN, if properly managed again, holds so much

potential for its people.  ASEAN solidarity is central to

its  success.  We need to speed up the pace  of  economic

integration and trade liberalisation, make sure that  all

member states are fully committed to the success of  AFTA

and to pursue more intra-ASEAN trade.  The possibility of

a China-ASEAN free trade area excites me.  According to a

report I read in The Economist ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan, can you please wrap up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Yes. --- trade between China and

ASEAN  has grown three-fold in the past decade and  helps

us to lessen our dependence on America, Europe and Japan,

countries which are anyway in the doldrums.  Can you  now

imagine  the prospects of a China-ASEAN free trade  area,

of  a  market of more than 1.7 billion people with  goods

moving  about  freely?  ASEAN has been rudderless  for  a

while.  And I would like to hear the Minister's views  on

how   Singapore   can  contribute  to   closer   regional

cooperation  and  economic integration and  to  show  the

world that ASEAN is back in business.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, the only

multilateral  security institution in East  Asia  is  the

ASEAN  Regional  Forum, set up in 1994.  It  provided  an

important forum for dialogue and for confidence  building

between  states.  One critical characteristic of the  ARF

was  that  it  was launched by ASEAN for the purposes  of

engaging  and  influencing the postures  that  the  major

powers adopted towards Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's participation in the ARF provided the

opportunity  for difficult issues, such  as  the  dispute

over  the  Spratlys, to be broached.  In the  year  2000,

North   Korea  joined  the  ARF,  allowing  the   Foreign

Ministers  of the US and North Korea to have  a  dialogue

for  the first time under the Bush administration in July

2000.  Notwithstanding these pluses, the ARF has not  met

up  with promise.  It has been nothing more than a  forum

for  dialogue.  It did not contribute meaningfully to the

resolution of the East Timor conflict.  It does not  have

any influence on the current escalating nuclear crisis in

North Korea, nor has it contributed to the present debate

over  a  war against Iraq.  Indeed, it is not clear  that

the  Bush  administration views the ARF as essential,  or

even important, in its own security calculations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key challenge of the ARF is to persuade the US not

to continue with its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



unilateralist approach to international relations but  to

offer support to multilateral cooperation in its security

approaches in the region.  We need to strengthen the  ARF

to  take  on the challenges of living in a dangerous  and

unpredictable world.  After all, the middle  and  smaller

powers of the region are arguably the most vulnerable  to

any   serious  deterioration  in  the  regional  security

environment that results from major power rivalry and the

free  movement  of  strategic powers.  These  middle  and

smaller  powers have the most to gain from some  capacity

to  shape and influence the security environment and they

should  put  deliberate effort to put this capacity  into

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether Singapore,

on  its part, is working towards a stronger ARF and if he

thinks  that ASEAN, in its weakened state, can remain  in

the driver's seat in this process.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Second Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Madam, Dr Ong Chit Chung and other Members have

noted  the  perceived decline of ASEAN  post-Suharto  and

asked  about ASEAN's continued relevance and measures  to

strengthen ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof. Jayakumar has said, post-September 11, the

major  powers  have  rediscovered ASEAN's  importance  in

maintaining  stability in Southeast Asia  and  countering

terrorism.   The  US,  China, Japan and  India  are  also

seeking closer economic cooperation, including free trade

arrangements  with ASEAN.  They recognise  the  strategic

and  economic  importance of ASEAN as a  stable  regional

grouping  and  a  growing market of  500  million  people

astride the trade route between Europe and East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the

fall  of Suharto in 1998, it is true that ASEAN has  lost

much  of its lustre as one of the fastest growing regions

in the world.  In 1997, as short-term portfolio investors

fled  the  region  and regional currencies  fell  sharply

against the US dollar, Thailand and Indonesia had to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



turn  to  IMF  and  the World Bank for financial  rescue.

Malaysia  had to introduce capital controls to  stabilise

its financial and stock markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region went through a period of economic

contraction and political instability in 1998  and  1999.

In year 2000, as signs of recovery emerged, unfortunately

the  IT  bubble  burst,  hurting  investors  and  denting

consumers'  confidence  in  the  major  export   markets.

Meanwhile, the rise of China has sucked away much foreign

direct investment.  Then came September 11 and the  shock

of global terrorism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these setbacks, ASEAN has gradually regained

its  footing.   Political stability has improved.   There

has  been some economic growth, partly driven by domestic

demand  and  by increased revenue from oil exports,  even

though  the  global  economic  environment  has  remained

unfavourable.   However,  the  outlook  has  become  more

uncertain with the Iraq crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with severe challenges, it is vital that ASEAN

remains  united  and outward-looking.  During  the  Asian

financial  crisis,  ASEAN  strove  to  regain  investors'

interest  and  confidence  by accelerating  the  pace  of

economic liberalisation through the ASEAN Free Trade Area

(AFTA) and the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1st January 2003, the original six members of

ASEAN  have  lowered  the tariffs  on  all  the  products

committed under AFTA to between 0% and 5%.  This includes

more  than  98%  of all tariff lines that  exist  in  the

original six ASEAN countries.  What remains is to  reduce

non-tariff   barriers,  prevent   backsliding   in   some

sensitive  products  such  as automative  components  and

eliminate tariffs further across the board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2002, at the 8th ASEAN Summit in Phnom

Penh,  PM  Goh proposed the vision of the ASEAN  Economic

Community.  It will provide a tangible end-point  to  the

various  economic initiatives within ASEAN, such  as  the

AFTA, the AIA and the Roadmap for Integration of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



ASEAN  (RIA).  In many ways, the ASEAN Economic Community

(AEC)  could  be  regarded as the economic  component  of

ASEAN  Vision 2020.  It envisages the free flow of goods,

services, technology and skilled manpower within ASEAN as

an integrated economic grouping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN officials are studying and defining the AEC

concept  for  report  to  the ASEAN  Economic  Ministers'

Meeting in September.  It would then be presented to  the

ASEAN Leaders' Meeting in Bali in October.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AEC embraces both economic integration and

economic  competitiveness aspects.  While much  has  been

achieved  to free up the flow of goods and,  to  a  lower

extent, services within ASEAN, further liberalisation and

integration   are   necessary  for   ASEAN   to   compete

effectively with China as a single market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help ensure that the newer members of ASEAN are

not  left  behind,  PM  Goh proposed  in  year  2000  the

Initiatives for ASEAN Integration (IAI).  Its emphasis is

on  training and capacity building.  It helps to mobilise

resources  from  within and outside ASEAN  to  close  the

development gap among ASEAN members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides enhancing internal cooperation, ASEAN must

remain   outward-looking.   ASEAN's  combined   strategic

weight  has  enabled  it to play a  significant  role  in

regional  initiatives, such as the ASEAN  Regional  Forum

(ARF),   the  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)

Forum,  the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and the Forum  for

East   Asia   and  Latin  America  Cooperation  (FEALAC).

Through these forums, as well as the dialogue process  of

ASEAN+3   and   ASEAN-Plus,   ASEAN   has   engaged   and

strengthened  ties  with  powers  outside   the   region,

including the US, EU, Japan, China, the Republic of Korea

and India.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-September 11, ASEAN's strategic importance has

increased.   ASEAN  members  are  cooperating  with   one

another and with other countries to combat the global



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



threat  of  terrorism.  Security and stability are  vital

for   investor  confidence  in  ASEAN,  which  has   good

potential as an alternative business location to China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware of ASEAN's strategic importance and economic

potential, the US, China, Japan and India are seeking  to

strengthen  economic  ties with  ASEAN  through  FTAs  or

closer  economic partnerships.  The ASEAN-China Framework

Agreement  on  Comprehensive  Economic  Cooperation   was

signed  at the 8th ASEAN Summit last year.  The objective

is  to  create an ASEAN-China Free Trade Area  within  10

years.   Not to be outdone, Japan has proposed the ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership.  The US came up

with its Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative, starting with a

series   of  bilateral  trade  and  investment  framework

agreements.   India, Australia and New Zealand  are  also

seeking to enhance economic cooperation with ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN continues to provide the framework under which

peace   has  prevailed  in  the  region.   Despite   some

bilateral  problems,  such  as  the  Thai-Myanmar  border

disputes,   recent  Thai-Cambodian  tensions,   and   our

problems  with Malaysia, ASEAN has continued to focus  on

common objectives to enhance cooperation, both internally

and  with  external  powers.   This  is  one  of  ASEAN's

strengths.  ASEAN Ministers and officials meet  regularly

on  a  wide  range of issues and responsibilities.   They

build  up  friendship and understanding in  the  process.

There  is  a  conscious  effort to  put  aside  bilateral

problems  and move ahead with cooperation for the  common

good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore continues to place strong emphasis on

enhancing  our  ties  with other  ASEAN  countries,  both

bilaterally   and   as  a  group.    Our   fortunes   are

inextricably linked with those of the region.  Except for

our  current  difficulties with Malaysia,  our  relations

with  ASEAN are excellent.  As a small but more developed

member  of ASEAN, we have to manage expectations  of  us.

Within  our  capabilities,  we  have  contributed  ideas,

vision and training resources to help build up ASEAN  and

maintain its relevance and focus.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



More than 50% of our technical assistance funds have gone

to  our  ASEAN  neighbours.  We are one  of  the  biggest

investors in their economies.  We strive to be a reliable

partner and the business hub of the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked whether ASEAN has expanded

too   fast  in  terms  of  membership.   To  answer  this

question,  we  need  to remind ourselves  why  ASEAN  was

formed.   Founded  in 1967, its primary objectives  were,

and  still are, firstly, peace and stability in Southeast

Asia   and,  secondly,  economic  growth  and  prosperity

through mutual cooperation.  With the end of the Cold War

and  the  resolution of the Cambodian  issue,  the  Indo-Chinese  states of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were  eager

to  join  ASEAN to enhance their stability and  catch  up

with economic development.  Myanmar had opened up and was

also  keen  on  ASEAN  membership.   With  the  four  new

members, ASEAN fulfilled the founding vision of ASEAN-10,

a  community of 10 Southeast Asian countries  living  and

growing together in peace, harmony and stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other regional organisations, the expansion of

ASEAN  presents  problems of disparity  and  integration.

The  newer and less developed members need assistance  to

close  the development gap and more time to open up their

markets    to   foreign   investment   and   competition.

Nevertheless, they have been very positive in wanting  to

catch   up  and  integrate  with  ASEAN  and  the  global

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An expanded ASEAN has its advantages. Banding

together  the Southeast Asian countries into a  community

of  500 million people has provided the critical mass for

ASEAN   to   better  stand  up  to  global  and  regional

competition.  ASEAN-10 also contributes to increasing our

influence and bargaining power vis-a-vis other states and

regional groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I will now turn to the questions on the ASEAN

Regional Forum (ARF) raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung  and  Ms

Irene Ng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formed in 1994, the ARF was intended to be a forum

to  build  confidence  and trust in  the  region  through

confidence-building measures.  It was never meant to be a

formal decision-making or problem-solving organisation on

security  issues.  This is to encourage member countries,

including the major powers, to engage each other  frankly

and  constructively.  Over the years, the ARF has allowed

sensitive  issues, such as the South China  Sea  and  the

situation  in  East  Timor, to be  discussed  in  a  non-threatening environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, the ARF has initiated discussions on

the  implications  of terrorism and considered  practical

ways  in  which the ARF can support international efforts

to  counter terrorism.  A series of ARF counter-terrorism

workshops  have been conducted.  The ARF  itself  can  be

considered a confidence-building measure.  Today, the ARF

remains the only multi-lateral security forum in the Asia

Pacific.   It  has  helped create a more predictable  and

stable  pattern of relationships among the major  powers,

and between the major powers and Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the ARF, ASEAN has played the role of

bringing   together  all  the  diverse   members   in   a

comfortable environment.  ASEAN will continue to play its

role.  However, we remain aware that the ARF cannot  move

too  fast.  It is important that members feel comfortable

with the pace of development.  This will ensure that  the

ARF remains practical and relevant to its members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other aspect about the ARF is that it enables

quiet   bilateral  discussions  without  the   glare   of

publicity.   For example, in 1995, the ARF  provided  the

occasion   for   then-US  Secretary  of   State,   Warren

Christopher,  and  then-Chinese  Foreign  Minister   Qian

Qichen  to  meet,  following  the  downturn  in  US-China

relations  over  the visit of then-Taiwan  President  Lee

Tenghui to Cornell University.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that

we  are  running slightly behind time and  to  keep  your

speeches



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



short.  Dr Ong Chit Chung, can you move your next cut?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, Singapore-Malaysia

relationship  is like a yo-yo.  It has its  ups  and  its

downs.   It  is  also filled with thrill and  excitement,

like  a  roller-coaster ride.  But we have  to  take  all

these in our stride.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there are prospects for a change for

the  better.  We must not lose heart, but have confidence

that  things  will work out.  I am glad, therefore,  that

Singapore  and Malaysia have committed the  Pedra  Branca

issue to the International Court of Justice.  This  is  a

step in the right direction.  This is an objective way, a

peaceful way, to deal with an outstanding problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask whether both nations have ratified the

Special  Agreement to commit the issue to  ICJ.   I  also

wish to ask the Minister what are the next few steps both

nations have to take to present their case to the ICJ and

when the ICJ is likely to make a ruling on Pedra Branca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the total package approach has been

abandoned  by  Malaysia,  what is  the  latest  stage  of

negotiations  on water and other issues.   How  does  the

Minister see our relations with Malaysia evolving in  the

next  few  years?  Will both countries evolve  a  win-win

formula to the mutual benefit of both?  What will be  the

impact  of  Islamic  influence  and  ascent  of  PAS   on

Singapore-Malaysia  relations?   I  believe   that   with

goodwill  on  both sides of the causeway,  Singapore  and

Malaysia  can work together for the common  good  of  our

people,  in  a win-win situation or prosper-thy-neighbour

policy.   We should also deepen our bilateral  ties  with

emphasis  on  people-to-people relationship.   We  should

have    more   cultural   exchanges,   student-to-student

contacts, and visits by officials and parliamentarians.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> The outstanding bilateral

issues between the two countries have yet to be resolved.

They include the price of water and its continued supply,

the  location  of  Malaysia's  Customs,  Immigration  and

Quarantine facilities, among other issues.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



twists  and  turns  of the negotiation process  over  the

issues  as a package highlight the lack of trust  between

the two countries in each other's intentions and actions.

The  experience  also highlights how  different  the  two

countries   are   in  their  approach  to   international

diplomacy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as this deep mistrust stays, it is hard to

move forward and improve our bilateral relationship in  a

meaningful  way.  It is like a plane trying to  take  off

with  a broken wing.  It is not much good loading up  the

plane with good stuff when it cannot get very far on  the

runway.   The question is how to build the trust  needed.

I  would say, slowly.  But there must be an attempt  made

in  this  direction.  And perhaps we can start  with  the

smallest problem that can be resolved first, or embark on

bilateral   cooperation  projects  that  can  be   easily

implemented,  and that will reap real benefits  for  both

sides.   For example, both countries could jointly embark

on  road  shows  to woo tourists to both countries  as  a

package.  With a series of small win-win successes  under

their  belt,  perhaps both countries can then  feel  more

confident  of tackling the more complicated  issues  that

require good faith and trust from both sides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahead of the general elections in Malaysia,

bilateral relations are expected to take another beating,

as  politicians tend to resort to the well-worn tactic of

using  Singapore  as  a bogeyman to whip  up  nationalist

sentiments.    Whilst   such   swings   complicate    the

relationship with Malaysia, Singapore has made  it  clear

that it values its relations with Malaysia.  Indeed, even

at  the  height of the dispute between the two  countries

over  the outstanding issues in January this year, amidst

talk  of  war  in the Malaysian media, our  Minister  for

Foreign  Affairs took pains to stress that  their  common

bilateral interests exceed their differences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I ask the Minister how he sees cooperation

between  the  two countries being stepped up  for  mutual

benefit?



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Madam,

Singapore-Malaysia relations are so mired  with  problems

that sometimes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



one  wonders whether it is worth all the trouble to  keep

it   afloat   or  to  believe  that  a  win-win   working

relationship  is at all possible.  One can understand  if

that  kind  of  feeling  crops up  every  now  and  then,

especially lately, but one cannot forget the fact that we

will  continue to be neighbours and we need to  make  the

best of that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our post-independence history is short, but we have

witnessed  many  rounds of acrimony, in fact,  Singapore-bashing.   Singapore took all that in her  stride,  until

recently,  when Singapore decided to lay bare  the  facts

once  and  for  all  to  clear the  air  about  the  many

accusations  that  were thrown at Singapore  over  water,

Pedra  Branca and the bridge issues, among others.   Even

talk  about  war was bandied about irresponsibly.   Well,

that was how we saw it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia saw things differently. In fact, the

Malaysian  media  had  carried  out  their  campaign   so

successfully that many, if not most, Malaysians swallowed

their  story hook, line and sinker, much to the detriment

of people-to-people relationship.  There were exceptions.

For example, there were Malaysians who practically called

on  the  Malaysian government to stop the wayang  and  to

stick  to the facts and principles of the issues at hand,

like what Singapore did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions are: what are the lessons Singapore

should learn from this?  How would the recent spat colour

the  way  we  handle bilateral relations?   We  have  our

perspectives,  and they theirs.  Where  shall  the  twain

meet?   Recognising  the  importance  of  the  Singapore-Malaysia  relations,  beyond  water  and  Pedra   Branca,

especially  in  the  context of the global  and  regional

fight  against terrorism, how would MFA go about  mending

fences and bridging bilateral relations and bringing them

to an even keel again?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, with President Megawati

in  Jakarta, Singapore-Indonesia relations have  improved

over time.  However, we should ask what will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



be   the  impact  of  rising  Islamic  assertiveness   on

Singapore-Indonesia relationship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, Indonesia received a boost when its

government successfully sold a 42% stake in the country's

second  largest telecommunications company,  Indosat,  to

Singapore  Technologies Telemedia (STT) in December  last

year.  This was an important move by a Singapore company,

emphasising  the  commitment to assist  Indonesia  during

these  troubled times.  STT won the bid by paying a hefty

50%  premium  over the market price.  Yet, anti-Singapore

sentiment was strong.  Compare this with the situation  a

month  later,  when Indonesia lost the  ICJ  judgment  to

Malaysia,  resulting  in  the  loss  of  sovereignty  and

control of Sipadan and Ligitan islands.  Considering  the

strong sense of Indonesian nationalism, it was surprising

that there was a no big adverse reaction to Malaysia.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should mull over this. First, a review

should  be  made  of  the  current  state  of  Singapore-Indonesia relations.  Second, such a review should  focus

on  specific  policies that would advance both  Singapore

and  Indonesian  interests.  And third, while  the  Civil

Service  Exchange  Programme is an excellent  initiative,

more  should  be  done  to broaden the  linkages  between

Singapore and Indonesia, particularly in the NGO  sector.

Much  of  Singapore's interaction with Indonesia revolves

around  investment relations.  Yet, the over-emphasis  on

this  area  may  inadvertently  bring  with  it  unwanted

perception   of   Singapore  as  being   overly   profit-orientated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore needs to consider balancing the strong

economic emphasis in the relationship with equal emphasis

on building institution and institutional linkages. It is

through  institution, both government and  non-government

organisations,  that  the next generation  of  Indonesian

leaders   will   emerge   and  engage   their   Singapore

counterparts.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, I would like to echo

what my GPC Chairman said that we need to engage a wider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



range  of  new  players  in  Indonesia  beyond  the   top

leadership in politics and military sectors in Indonesia.

Singapore's   perceived  obsession  today  with   picking

winners  to  nurture  makes  little  sense  in  a   fluid

political   environment  where  the  absence  of   strong

leadership  would be normal in the short to medium  term.

So  we  have to put more emphasis on conducting dialogues

and  building greater ties with its emerging  leaders  in

both NGOs and academia as well as in political parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken part in some dialogues in Jakarta

involving  civil  society  activists,  academics,   young

politicians  and the media.  I find it useful  because  I

have found that their perceptions of Singapore tend to be

less  than flattering, and most of their perceptions  are

based on stereotypes which can be corrected if you engage

them   in  dialogue.  Of  course,  they  might  use   the

opportunity to score some points.  But, I think,  at  the

end  of  the day, if the exchange is frank and we  depart

with a greater understanding of each other's position, it

is a dialogue worth pursuing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rise of new social and political forces

emerging in the democratic post-Suharto era, I would like

to  ask the Minister what efforts has the Government made

to  build ties with the range of new players and have our

efforts been useful in establishing greater understanding

between the two countries.



<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Madam, in 1995, Prime Minister Goh

Chok  Tong,  in a speech to the leaders of  some  African

nations said that Singapore had learnt a great deal  from

other  countries  in the course of our development.   Not

only  did  we  learn real skills, we also  avoided  their

mistakes.   And  if  they  thought  our  experience   was

relevant, we were happy to share with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has had a Singapore Cooperation Programme

since  1992,  in  order to share our technical  expertise

with  others and institutions of higher learning, as well

as   the  Singapore  Port  Institute  and  the  Singapore

Aviation Academy.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



teaching our neighbours how to fish, we are doing good to

the  world.   In doing so, however, are we  also  perhaps

sowing the seeds of future competition for our own  goods

and  services?   Or  are we sowing the  seeds  of  future

cooperation and mutual economic interest?  If the latter,

how  can these programmes be further enhanced?  Could  we

have   more   initiatives   that   will   help   ordinary

Singaporeans  give  foreigners a positive  impression  of

Singapore? Can these programmes also be opportunities for

Singaporeans to become more aware of economic and  social

opportunities abroad?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister could address some of these

issues.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Madam, first on Malaysia-Singapore

relations.   I would like to thank the Members  who  have

spoken.   I  do not intend to go into a great explanation

of  our relations because only on 25th January, I gave  a

comprehensive  statement  of bilateral  relations.   This

sets  out  the facts of the various issues, the published

documents, and also set out the steps forward. So  may  I

just   confine  myself  in  responding  through   general

remarks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Ong Chit Chung when he said that

Malaysia-Singapore relations are like a yo-yo.   They  go

up  and  down.  I think differences are bound  to  emerge

between close neighbours.  But while that may be so,  the

fact  remains that our countries are closely intertwined.

The  areas  of  our  common interests  have  always  been

greater  than that of our disagreements. It is  for  that

reason  that I believe that Malaysia and Singapore should

not  allow  specific disagreements to affect the  overall

tenor  of bilateral relations.  We should try to  address

disagreements   in   a  calm  and   mature   way,   using

negotiations  where possible, and if it is  not  possible

through  negotiations,  and  if  negotiations  have  been

exhausted,  then  we should have recourse  to  the  legal

process.   And  we  should continue to cooperate  in  the

areas which lend themselves to cooperation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this vein, I want to draw attention of Members to

the recent comments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



by  Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah  Badawi  and

Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar.  Deputy Prime Minister

Abdullah Badawi was quoted to say on 3rd March that there

was  "an  inextricable relationship between Malaysia  and

Singapore. There will be differences of opinion  on  many

things.  There will perhaps be periods of tension because

we  do  not see things from the same perspective.  But  I

believe that the relationship with Malaysia and Singapore

will  not deteriorate to the extent that it will  involve

us in any kind of conflict".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar vein on 7th March 2003, Foreign

Minister Syed Hamid Albar was quoted in Dubai as  saying,

"Both countries value peace and stability and that is why

we  have  agreed to refer the issue (he was referring  to

Pedra  Branca)  to  the  ICJ.   The  dispute  should  not

interfere  with the long-term relations between  Malaysia

and Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome these sentiments. Differences no doubt

remain in the bilateral relationship, but so do our inter-linkages  and  the  tremendous  potential  for  bilateral

cooperation. I think it is a sound approach to try to get

beyond  our  disagreements  and  to  focus  on  long-term

relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we are already doing that to some

extent.    Both  countries  cooperate  in   the   various

international  foras.   In the domestic  security  field,

there  is  close  cooperation between  both  sides,  both

police forces.  In defence, there are bilateral exchanges

and  common  exercises.   Our two economies  are  closely

intertwined.   Malaysia  was  Singapore's   top   trading

partner  in  2002, while Singapore has always been  among

Malaysia's  top trading partners.  There are also  strong

ties  between the people of our two countries.  Not  just

political  and official contacts, but cultural,  business

and  social ones.  These contacts are important  as  they

nurture  familiarity and mutual understanding.  I believe

this  helps  to preserve positive elements  in  bilateral

ties   by  fostering  institutional  and  personal  links

between the two countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked specific questions as to the

state   of  the  ratification  process  of  the   Special

Agreement  that was signed on 6th February.  Let  me  say

that on 17th February 2003, we informed Malaysia that the

Singapore  Government has ratified the Special  Agreement

and  that  we  are  ready  to  exchange  instruments   of

ratification  at  a  mutually convenient  date.   We  are

awaiting  a notification from Malaysia on when  they  are

ready to exchange instruments of ratification.  I am sure

this will be done very soon.  And when that is done, that

will  be one more step in the process.  I cannot give  an

exact  date. After ratification, both sides could have  a

joint letter to the Court (ICJ), and then the Court  will

get  seized  with  the matter.  Then  there  are  certain

timeframes for filing memorials, replies, rejoinders, and

so  on.  And as to when the Court will actually hand down

its  decision,  this depends on the workload  before  the

Court.  But I must say that I do not see a decision being

handed  down earlier than two-and-a-half to three  years'

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to sum up, I hope Members will understand when I

do  not  go into great detail but just confine myself  to

saying  that  we  seek  a cooperative  relationship  with

Malaysia based on mutual benefit and mutual respect.   If

we  can  put our disagreements aside, and manage them  in

accordance with internationally recognised conventions on

dispute  settlements,  I think we can  move  forward  for

mutual  benefit.   Dr Ong Chit Chung asked  what  is  the

latest  state  of affairs on negotiations. There  are  no

negotiations at the moment for the reasons  that  I  have

explained in my 25th January statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Indonesia, I thank the Members who have spoken.

Let me say that we have good relations with the Indonesia

leadership.  There have been many exchanges between  both

the  countries.  Prime Minister Goh visited  in  December

2002 and met with President Megawati and other Indonesian

leaders and influential policy-makers. As I said earlier,

our  Prime Minister was the first foreign leader to visit

Jakarta after the Bali bombings.  This was to demonstrate

our confidence in Indonesia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Members who have spoken that

relations  between  Singapore  and  Indonesia  should  be

broadened.   In  other  words,  it  should  not  be  just

Government-to-Government at the top level. That has never

been   our  approach.   Various  Ministers  have  visited

Indonesia  and  vice-versa.  And we are  also  broadening

contacts with people in other sectors. Whenever we go  to

Indonesia,  for  example,  we  meet  a  cross-section  of

influential people, whether they are journalists or think-tank  people.  At the last occasion, we have met  with  a

cross-section of leaders in the Muslim organisations.  We

also  have  contacts between officials at  the  MFA-DEPLU

Exchange, which is an annual event.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister went to Indonesia, he

proposed  the Indonesia-Singapore Civil Service  Exchange

Programme  (CSEP).   I  think that will  further  enhance

another  dimension of our cooperation.  I agree  with  Dr

Warren Lee and others who have stressed that we must have

people-to-people level relations.  And  in  this  regard,

when  Dr  Warren  Lee asked how we can  involve  ordinary

Singaporeans, I should say that they may want to  contact

organisations like the Singapore International Foundation

(SIF).  They  have  despatched volunteer  specialists  to

Indonesia  on  many  community  projects,  including  the

training  of  doctors in hospitals in  various  parts  of

Indonesia.   Singaporeans  can  get  involved   in   such

projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Ong Chit Chung and Ms Irene Ng. Ms

Irene  Ng  had  noted  that the  Indonesian  society  has

become  increasingly complex.  It is really going through

a   difficult   transitional  period.   The   change   of

government in 1998 has ushered in a new Indonesia  and  a

far  more  complicated political equation  and  dynamics.

Here  Dr  Ong Chit Chung had mentioned about the role  of

religion and Islamic groups.  It is part of the equation.

There  are  now  more power centres which have  influence

over  overall Indonesian policies.  This change has  made

the  conduct of our bilateral relations more complex  and

the  challenge for us is to find ways and means to manage

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



relationship  and  to  maintain  the  good  relations  we

currently enjoy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure Dr Ong and other Members that the

points  they have made are uppermost in our minds  as  we

seek to maintain good relations with an Indonesia that is

changing and will continue to change in the years ahead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Singapore became a member of the

Security  Council at the time of great change  and  great

tragedy  in the world.  Madam, now that Singapore  is  no

longer a member of the Security Council, should we  allow

ourselves  to just fade away from the world stage  or  is

there still a role for us?  I think that Singapore has  a

good  opportunity to show to the world that small  states

can make significant contributions to the UN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister what

steps  his  Ministry is taking to ensure  that  Singapore

remains involved in the UN. Are we likely to send more of

our  men to peace-keeping missions around the world?  Are

we  willing to offer aid, be it economic or financial, to

developing countries around the world?  Will  we  play  a

substantial role in United Nations institutions  such  as

the UNESCO and UNICEF?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these efforts would signal our maturity as a

country and allow us to continue to play a useful role in

the  world stage.  Just because Singapore is no longer  a

member  of  the Security Council does not  mean  that  we

should let our efforts and our attention slide.



<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Madam, I would say that Mr Sin Boon

Ann  has  actually brought up the majority of the  points

that  I  was  thinking of.  I am glad we share  the  same

viewpoint.   But I would just like to add two points  ie,

whether Singapore can continue to play a role with regard

to  international laws in the areas of civil aviation and

the  settlement  of  territorial disputes  at  sea.   Our

interests  are quite evident, but I am wondering  whether

we can be a part of the multilateral process, overall.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Madam, what I wanted to

say on the question of Iraq has actually been answered by

Prof.  Jayakumar quite eloquently.  But I just wanted  to

say  that  there  is  more to life than  after  Iraq  and

Palestine.  Because Singapore has played a very important

role   in  terms  of its contributions and  influence  in

matters pertaining to the United Nations, Law of the  Sea

Conference and the World Environment Summit.   What  will

MFA do to ensure that our credibility and standing in the

eyes  of the world remain, especially when we face issues

like Palestine and Iraq?



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Madam, because of our

position, I think, increasingly, Singapore will be  asked

to  perform  a  wider role in the community  of  nations.

Increasingly, I think we will be called upon  to  provide

financial  aid  or  other forms  of  assistance  to  less

developed   countries.   Indeed,   for   many   developed

countries,  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  has

become a strategic tool in order to generate goodwill and

build  allies   -   important  bridges  in  international

diplomacy.  But we are not in the league of the big  OECD

countries when it comes to foreign aid, and our resources

are finite.  We should, first and foremost, be focused on

developing   our  own  resources  for  our  own   people.

However,  having a clear idea of our stand on this  issue

and where we are heading is, I believe, useful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, I would like to ask the Minister

the following questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what is our foreign aid policy and how

effective  have we been?  I define "foreign aid"  broadly

to  include both direct and indirect aid, such as medical

supplies, technical expertise, resources general to civic

organisations, as well as programmes which are  sponsored

and  run  in  Singapore to help other  countries  develop

their expertise or manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how much aid have we provided in the past,

to which countries and for what purposes?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether

there are any plans to provide aid to the Iraqi people in

the  event that a war breaks out.  We will pray very hard

that this does not happen but, if it does, then I believe

that  we  can help to lessen the sufferings of the  Iraqi

people  by  joining  the  UN or other  international  aid

agencies in their humanitarian efforts to help the people

and to rebuild Iraq.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Raymond Lim, you have seven

minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Madam, I shall be brief, not

because brevity is necessarily the soul of wit, but  when

you  are  the  tail-end speaker for your  Ministry,  time

tends to be compressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me take the questions of Mr Sin and Dr

Lee.  The answer is yes.  There is indeed life after  the

Security Council.  The Security Council, arguably, is the

most  important body in the UN, but many issues that  are

of  interest to member states are actually taken  outside

the  UN  Security  Council, in the General  Assembly  and

other specialised bodies of the United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has always actively participated in the

UN,  even before we were in the Security Council, and  we

intend  to continue to do so.  We do not intend  to  fade

away.   In the last four years, for instance, even before

we   entered  the  UN  Security  Council,  Singapore  had

participated  in  a  series  of  UN  summits  and   world

conferences on many different issues - issues as  diverse

as  women,  children, HIV, AIDS and, more recently,  last

year, on sustainable development.  We will continue to do

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee asked about our engagement with other

international organisations, like the International Civil

Aviation  Organisation (ICAO).  In the case of  ICAO,  we

have sought to be elected to its governing council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On how do we support the peaceful settlement of

disputes, I think the best way to do that is by  example.

A good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



example  is  on  the question of Pedra Branca.   We  have

taken   the  initiative  to  refer  the  matter  to   the

International Court of Justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked how do we maintain credibility in

the international community.  I think we will continue to

do  what we have always done, and that is, we have always

taken  the approach where we are guided by principles  of

international law, by compliance with the United  Nations

Charter   and  the  United  Nations  Security   Council's

resolutions.   I  think  it  is  perhaps  reflecting  our

consistent  and  principled approach  that  Singapore  is

taken  seriously in the international community.   It  is

really out of proportion to our size.  And perhaps  again

reflecting   this,   Singapore  is   increasingly   being

represented in international bodies.  In the UN, we  have

Under  Secretary  Dilip Nair who heads  the  UN  Internal

Audit  Office and Miss Noeleen Heyzer, the well-respected

Head of the UN Development Fund for Women.  We now have a

candidate,  Mrs  Anamah Tan, for  the  Committee  on  the

Elimination of Discrimination Against Women,  the  treaty

body that oversees compliance with the Convention on  the

Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,

to  which  Singapore is a party.  This is  a  prestigious

body  and seats are hotly contested.  If we win, it  will

boost our standing at the United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked three questions. First, what is

our  policy on foreign aid?  Like her, I share  the  view

that  Singapore  should play an active  part  in  helping

developing countries.  She will be pleased to  know  that

we have done so under the Singapore Cooperation Programme

(SCP), which Dr Warren Lee mentioned earlier.  But unlike

traditional donor aid programmes, Singapore believes that

it  can  best contribute by helping developing  countries

build up its human resource and organisational capacities

that are critical to sustain growth.  Since its inception

in 1992, over 23,000 participants from 150 countries have

participated  in  short-term training courses  and  study

visits  under  the SCP.  While the main beneficiaries  of

the  SCP  have  been  ASEAN countries,  our  geographical

outreach has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



extended   to  developing  countries  in  Africa,   Latin

America, Middle East, South Pacific and the Caribbean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked what is the figure that we have

contributed.   Just  to  give a sense  of  it,  in  2001,

Singapore  contributed $260 million towards international

development assistance.  If we use certain benchmark, for

instance,  the  median  official  development  assistance

(ODA), for the OECD countries, is 0.31% of gross national

income.   Singapore's figure comes up  to  0.17%  of  our

gross national income.  This compares favourably with the

United States, which is 0.11%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her last question: would we provide humanitarian aid

to Iraq if there is a war?  The answer is yes.  Singapore

is  likely  to contribute in the same way as we  did  for

Afghanistan  in  the  form  of technical  assistance  and

humanitarian aid.  I think what is important here is how,

as  a community, Government and the people, we respond to

sufferings  elsewhere.  And I think Singapore  has  shown

through  our  spontaneous help in the case of Afghanistan

and  Bali that we have a heart.  I am sure that if  there

is  a  war  in Iraq, the same humanitarian hand  will  be

extended.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, I want to thank the

Ministers  for  their very comprehensive and  interesting

answers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I was told that the North-East Line was built

at a cost of $5 billion, and it is supposed to be a state-of-the-art driverless train system.  Its opening has been

anxiously  expected by many residents in the North  East,

who  will be likely users of the line.  However, they are

quite  anxious  about the cost of  the  fares.   Can  the

Minister  explain  why the fare structure  has  not  been

announced up to now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary indications are that the fares will be

higher  than the SMRT lines.   The rationale  for  having

such  a  different fare structure is that the North  East

Line,   supposedly,   has   a  higher   operating   cost.

Naturally, as the line is new and the traffic build-up is

not fully completed, there will be a higher per passenger

operational  cost.  On the contrary, the  SMRT  lines   - East  West  and North South lines  -  have  already  been

running  for 14 years, and traffic and development  build

up  along  the  lines have been stabilised.   The  strong

argument,  I  believe, for having a uniform structure  of

fares, even though there are two operators, is that  both

lines feed into each other and form an integrated system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original investor of the system is the

Government,  serving the people's needs.  It  is  not  as

though the lines are owned by different investors looking

to  maximise their own different returns.  The North East

Line is as  much a part of the integrated existing lines,

just  as the North South Line is integrated with the East

West Line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a uniform fare structure does not yield the

needed  rates of return in spite of efficiency  criteria,

then  some  way of compensation, through feeder  rebates,

can  be  devised.   If  we do not do  this,  then  it  is

patently unfair to the residents of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



North East region to pay for the operation of the line  - efficient and built at a huge cost by the Government with

the state-of-the-art equipment, which perhaps they do not

need, if given a choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to raise is with regard to

the  safety  features of the North East Line  system.   I

raised this point last year and I want to raise it again.

Could  the Minister assure the House that safety features

for this driverless train system will be quite thoroughly

looked  into, especially with the supplier of the control

system  as  well  as the rolling stock?  Given  the  fact

that, in recent months, there have been quite a number of

accidents,  we  would like to assure the members  of  the

public  that  such  a  driverless train  system  will  be

thoroughly safe.



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Madam, some people say that an

MRT  station is an MRT station.  But when I  was  at  the

Hougang  MRT North East Line station last month  for  the

official opening of the civil defence shelter, I  saw  an

MRT station with a difference.  There was a huge art work

by  our  Singapore artists, decorating the walls and  the

open  space  of  the station.  I told  myself,  "This  is

really  arts  everywhere",  and  it  is  wonderful.   LTA

deserves  to be congratulated for doing such an excellent

job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that similar specially presented art

works  are found at every station at the North East Line.

This  is  great.  By doing so, LTA is not only   able  to

create  the  right  ambience  for  the  station,  project

distinct identity for each station, it also showcases the

works   of   our  local  artists.   What  is  even   more

interesting  is  that  the  art works  were  incorporated

during the construction stage.  And by doing so, the  LTA

managed  to  do it at a much lower cost.  I am  sure  the

public would appreciate it, provided that it would not be

charged to their fare, as emphasised by Mr Chay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that such art works would have

therapeutic value to the tired bodies and stressed  minds

of  commuters  taking  our trains  when  they  reach  the

station to return home.  My question is: will this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



also  be a new feature for the Circle Line stations which

are  still  under  construction?   I  ask  this  question

because  with the budget reduction exercise  carried  out

now,  many would think that the Circle Line does not have

to  have what the North East Line has.  The arts and  the

aesthetics  aspect of the Circle Line may be  sacrificed.

If  this happens, it is really sad because if it  is  not

incorporated at the construction stage, it would be  very

costly to have it later.



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Madam, the 2002 Labour Market

Report  released on Friday showed that for the  whole  of

2002,  overall  unemployment rate in  Singapore  averaged

4.4%.   Translated into numbers, almost 90,000  residents

were  unemployed.   Yet, when we  tried  to  match  these

unemployed  workers  to  jobs, one  of  the  most  common

reasons cited by them is "too far".  So, are they  fussy?

Or do workers really face transportation problems getting

to work?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that companies in inaccessible industrial

estates, such as Tuas, have difficulties finding workers.

Madam, it takes almost one hour for a worker who stays in

the  nearest housing estate to Tuas, ie, Jurong East,  to

get  to  the Tuas Industrial Park.  So, you will see  how

difficult  it  is.   Another  example  is  the  shipyard.

Hence, these companies have resorted to providing private

buses  for  their workers.  This adds to business  costs.

Even  in the instances where the workers bear the  costs,

the  private  bus  fares are generally  higher  than  the

public transport options.  This will reduce the take-home

pay for the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I would like to make some

suggestions for the Minister to consider:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I hope the Ministry consider extending and

expanding the MRT network into industrial estates such as

Tuas.  This will shorten the travelling time for workers,

which  will  make them more willing to take  up  jobs  in

these areas.  This will also give companies there a boost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



and help address the issue of our unemployment situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, would the Ministry also consider building

additional stations along the existing MRT network  where

it  passes by industrial estates?  This was proven to  be

doable  with the Dover station added on to the East  West

Line or Singapore Polytechnic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Madam, I have three

points regarding the public bus system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Public Transport Council (PTC), in

releasing  its  Bus  Service  Audit  in  September  2002,

acknowledged  that there were bus services with  problems

of overloading and long headways.  The PTC said that this

was    unsatisfactory   and   reflected    the    general

dissatisfaction of commuters in these performance aspects

and  recognised the need to reduce overcrowding and  long

waiting times on some services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may quote from the report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We recognise that some existing standards are based

on figures averaged over the survey period, which may not

accurately  reflect the performance of bus services  from

the passengers' viewpoint. Some standards also tend to be

over prescriptive.  For this reason, the PTC is currently

reviewing  the  standards with a view  to  ensuring  that

service  standards are relevant and closely  reflect  the

public's    expectation   for   service    quality    and

affordability."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That report and its acknowledgement of the

shortcomings  are an encouraging start.  May  I  ask  the

Minister,  since  the  publication of  the  report,  what

progress has been made in reviewing the standards?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to a report in the Straits

Times of 28th February 2003 that LTA had decided to  drop

a  $40.3  million  plan  to provide  commuters  with  bus

arrival  times  via information panels at bus  stops  and

interchanges  and over the Internet, just  months  before

the project was to have been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister why the project was

aborted at such a late stage and how much had been  spent

on the project before it was aborted?  Why was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



the feasibility study on the software and integration not

conducted  fully  before embarking on such  a  high  cost

project?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to feeder bus services. The

PTC's  rules  on door width and platform height  make  it

very capital expensive for bus companies, other than  SBS

Transit and TIBS, to offer feeder bus services.  Now with

the  merger of Comfort bus and SBS Transit, in the medium

term,  I  do not think there is any other bus company  in

Singapore that is able or prepared to offer comprehensive

commuter feeder bus services for a housing estate.  Other

rules,  like  not  allowing pick-up  of  passengers  from

public  bus stops, serve to protect the incumbent  public

bus operator.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being the case, if the incumbent operator is

not  willing  to  improve its services for  a  particular

area, the alternative would be to consider niche services

dedicated  to  meet  a particular need  of  residents  to

travel   from  one  area  to  another  not  directly   or

adequately served by the existing services.  For example,

instead  of  taking  public buses and  having  to  change

buses,  residents in a certain precinct may need  and  be

willing  to pay for a direct service to a particular  wet

market.    Operators   and   the  supporting   grassroots

organisations will have to be creative to  come  up  with

various service schemes to meet residents' demand.  And I

hope  the  Ministry  of Transport and  the  PTC  will  be

understanding  and  allow  such  niche  solutions  to  be

implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> Madam, can I take the two cuts

together?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> The cost of transportation is

never  far  from  the forefront of many  people's  minds.

While there is widespread appreciation of the quality  of

our   system  and  widespread  acknowledgement  that  the

investments in public transportation infrastructure, like

roads and rail, have made travelling about for both  work

and play so much more pleasurable,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



we  must,  however, continue to focus on cost.   Bus  and

rail  operators are contracted by the authorities to  run

the  services.   The  learning on the frontlines  by  the

operators  would no doubt reveal more efficient  ways  to

provide the quality service that we all so desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister to consider having regular

reviews between the authorities and operators so that the

licensed  operation  conditions  have  the  fora  to   be

continuously adjusted to reflect changing conditions, and

incorporate  such learning experience.  Stipulations  and

conditions  that  are  proven  over  time  to  be  overly

stringent  -  kiasu  would be another characterisation  - must  be  gradually relaxed, finding a  new  balance  and

equilibrium  among  the  factors  of  quality,  cost  and

safety.   Such  a partnership between the  authority  and

transport operators would, I think, lead to an even  more

cost-effective transport system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the issue of fare transfer

rebates.  It is my understanding that we have adopted  an

administratively efficient system of fare rebates between

the  bus and rail operations with a transfer rebate  paid

from  the operator of the first mode of transport to  the

operator  of  the  follow-on  mode.   This  transfer   is

transparent to the travelling public.  Now that there are

multiple  rail and bus operators, it may be  timely  that

the transfer rebate mechanism be re-examined to assess if

it  still  provides  adequate equity; and,  secondly,  to

address the transfer pricing so that people plying solely

on the shorter feeder services do not end up paying more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I ask the Minister to consider that in fare

pricing,  adequate attention be given such  that  pricing

should not only consider full cost recovery but it should

also  be  complemented  with measures  to  drive  maximum

utilisation of the system, especially with new  additions

like  the  North  East  Line.  This  may  accelerate  the

development  of  the  new  towns  and  give  a  boost  to

businesses there.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia is not here. Mr Chay

Wai Chuen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Madam, people waiting for taxis

at  taxi  stands outside shopping centres in the city  on

rainy  days  or during holiday seasons are understandably

unhappy  about  the availability of taxis when  they  are

needed.   During  those  times,  rainy  days  or  holiday

seasons,   the   demand  for  taxis  far  outstrips   the

availability  by a factor of perhaps two to three  times.

Is  it  any  surprise that the customers are disappointed

and  that they write about it in the press and berate the

quality of our taxi service here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem has nothing to do, I believe, with the

quality of taxi service or the cost of taxi fares  -  too

cheap  or too expensive, as some argued.  It has  nothing

to  do  with what some people have argued that taxi fares

in  Singapore are too cheap compared to other  countries.

Therefore,  it  is argued, by making it higher,  it  will

solve  the  problem.  I think it has to do with  devising

micro-management tools to incentivise delivery of  output

at  those  windows of demand.  It has to do with tweaking

the system presently to generate relativity of return  by

price  and by routes to incentivise the drivers of  taxis

to position themselves to get better relative returns, in

order  to  answer  to  those  special  local  demands  at

shopping  malls or during those special times like  rainy

days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the current system as it is and monitoring

the  performance of taxis as it is, based on a high level

or  macro  level  approach, as under the present  system,

will  not deliver the results.  Only the LTA can  provide

the  regulatory  tweaks to produce the desired  outcomes.

My  question  is: why does the LTA not  want  to  do  it?

Because  of our unique CBD with ERP toll system,  traffic

within the city limit is quite unique and has its own set

of  fees and charges.  The rules which the LTA should set

must   overcome  the  current  price  barriers  and   yet

incentivise the delivery.  Leaving it as it is or raising

taxi  fares  without incentivising relativity  of  return

will not serve the problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Madam, I have three cuts on taxi

service.   Since I do not think I have time to cover  all

three, I shall just cover the first one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first cut relates to the quality of our taxi

services.    Recently,  under  the  new  taxi   licensing

framework,  the  Land Transport Authority introduced  the

quality  of  service (or QOS) standards for  taxis.   The

first five of a total of eight service qualities touch on

phone  booking.  I am puzzled as to why phone booking  is

so  crucial  that  all  taxi  companies  must  have  this

facility.   Is  this  so  basic a  service  that  a  taxi

operator  cannot  offer a good taxi service  without  it?

Using  an  analogy  from  the  airline  industry,  it  is

tantamount to requiring all new players wanting to set up

a  new  airline to offer in-flight services of  the  same

quality as Singapore Airlines with video-on-demand on all

classes,   wonderful   meal   choices,   on-line   ticket

reservation  and  all.   In the US,  some  airlines  have

recently introduced low cost services catering to  budget

conscious travellers, where one has to pay for  meals  on

board,  refreshments and the audio headset.  At the  same

time,  there  may be other airlines that  want  to  offer

premium service to distinguish themselves and cater to  a

different segment of the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why should we not allow someone to set up a no-frills taxi service without having to invest in costly

call  centre and despatch facilities to manage  telephone

booking?   After  all, a key objective of  the  licensing

framework  must  be to meet the needs  of  the  commuting

public.   Competition  is supposed to  bring  about  more

choices and cut cost.  If someone sees the long queues at

taxi stands, and the dissatisfied commuters waiting along

the roadsides, and thinks there is a commuter demand, why

can  he  not  be allowed to set up a taxi operation  just

catering to this demand, without having to set up a  call

centre to manage phone booking?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official answer seems to be that to allow

someone  to  come  in without such requirements  will  be

unfair  to  the incumbent who has invested  in  all  this

expensive  equipment.   But why  must  all  newcomers  be

locked in to a less than ideal business model?  The rules

should be more flexible.  The phone booking qualities  of

service should only apply to the taxi operator who offers

phone booking service as part of its overall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



business  strategy.  The rules should be flexible  enough

to  provide the taxi operator with the option of deciding

whether to provide such a facility for its customers.  If

an  operator  believes that he can provide the  essential

taxi  service  to  meet  the demands  of  our  commuters,

notwithstanding not having phone booking, why not let the

commuters  decide?   Essentially,  competition  is  about

letting the market decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, may I move on to my next cut relating to taxi

fares and pricing mechanism?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is almost 6.30 pm.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Okay. I will take that tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 6.30 pm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon, Madam Deputy Speaker left the Chair of

the Committee and took the Chair of the House.

<div align="center"><b>DIRECTORSHIPS HELD BY WOMEN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Prime Minister, in the

last  few  years  what (i) has been the increase  in  the

number  of  women  appointed to be members  of  Statutory

Boards and boards of Government linked companies and (ii)

the number of men and women on these boards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b>



Statutory Boards



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March 2003, out of a total of 630

directorships  on all Statutory Boards, 566  (89.8%)  are

held by men and 64 (10.2%) by women.



Major GLCs



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March 2003, out of the 593 directorships on

major  Temasek-linked companies, 534 (90.1%) are held  by

men,  while  59 (9.9%) by women.  Last year, out  of  582

directorships,  526  (90.4%) were held  by  men,  and  56

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD UPGRADING PROGRAMME</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a) what is the total number  of  HDB  units

that  (i)  have  already  completed  the  Main  Upgrading

Programme  and  (ii) do not have lift landings  on  every

floor;  and  (b)  what has been the  percentage  of   (i)

uptake  for  the  Lift  Upgrading  Programme,  and   (ii)

rejections citing unaffordability as a reason.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at February 2003, some 65,000 units have

completed  the  upgrading works under the Main  Upgrading

Programme (MUP).  Of these, about 11,000 units are  still

without  lift landings on every floor.  These flats  were

selected  for the MUP before the Lift Upgrading Programme

(LUP) was introduced in 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92% of blocks which have been polled for the LUP so

far  have  voted  in favour of the programme.   Very  few

residents have cited unaffordability as a reason for  not

being  in  favour of LUP.  This is because the Government

subsidises  between 75% and 90% of the cost of  the  LUP,

and  the  remainder is co-shared by the resident and  the

Town  Council.  The share per household ranges from  $600

to  $3,000, with most households paying $1,000  or  less.

In  addition,  HDB extends financial assistance  measures

such  as extension of the repayment period, to households

who may have difficulty in paying for the LUP costs.
