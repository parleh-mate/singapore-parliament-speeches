<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>ELECTION OF SPEAKER</b></div>





<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr E. W. Barker)</b> stood up, and addressing himself to the Clerk of Parliament

said: Mr Lopez, I propose,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng do take the Chair of this

Parliament as Speaker.





<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang)</b> stood up, and

addressing himself to the Clerk of Parliament said: Mr Lopez. I support the proposal.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no other proposal, the Clerk then

declared Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng to have been elected as

Speaker of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, standing at the Table, made an Affirmation of Allegiance.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker went to the Chair and sat down.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Mace (which before lay below the Table) was

placed on the Table.



<br><br>2.32 p.m.





<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it is with respect that we  again  bow

before  you in the Chair. The business in this  House

will  continue  to be conducted under your  guidance,

and  we  will continue to abide by your rulings.  But

may  I  say,  without any disrespect.  Sir,  that  it

would  be  less painful to be ruled out of  order  in

this  House  than to lie prostrate on your  operating

table,  whilst  your gloved hands  reach  out  for  a

scalpel.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your fame as a surgeon is well known in Singapore

and  has spread throughout the region. You could, with

ease  and distinction, occupy one of the front benches

on this side





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



of the House. But then I am not the Prime Minister and

I  cannot  read his mind. But our gain will  mean  the

loss for those whose lives may depend on the skill  of

your steady hands.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members, old and new join me in

congratulating  you. Sir, on your  reelection  to  the

Chair.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again this House will have to manage with

Members all from one party. This is the choice of  the

people. This position has not changed since 1965  when

we  gained sovereignty and independence and  the  then

Members  of  the Opposition walked out of  this  House

abandoning  their faith in Parliamentary democracy  to

take  to  the  streets. They have  regretted  it  ever

since. As a result we have all members from one party.

Debates  in  this  House  have become.  perhaps,  less

interesting and certainly less heated. But the  burden

on the Opposition within the Party has increased.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back-Benchers should let their conscience be their

guide   and   speak  freely  with  open  minds.   Even

Parliamentary Secretaries can do so provided  they  do

not  criticise their own Ministries. I am not inciting

them to mount a united offensive against the Executive

but  merely exhorting them to speak without inhibition

and without constraint.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant that the Parliament (Privileges,

Immunities and Powers) Act. provides. inter alia, that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There shall be freedom of speech and debate and

proceedings in Parliament. and such freedom of speech

and debate and proceedings shall not be liable to be

impeached or questioned in any court, commission of

inquiry. tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of

Parliament'.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Member is liable to any civil or criminal

proceedings. arrest. imprisonment or damages for  what

he  says in this House or in Committee. This privilege

is  absolute, but Members should not take advantage of

it  by  making  defamatory  statements  about  persons

outside  this  House under the cloak of  Parliamentary

immunity.  To say the least that would not be  playing

"cricket".  Our Judges also should not be  criticised,

because the independence of the Judiciary is inviolate

and has been enshrined in our Constitution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is supreme. And because all our Members

come from one Party, it will be our responsibility and

our  duty to scrutinize, criticise, where appropriate,

and  debate all major pieces of legislation. Ministers

would welcome questions not only during Question  Time

but  after  making statements on Government  policies.

All  controversial  Bills will, as  in  the  past,  be

referred    to   a   Select   Committee   where    the

representations  of  members  of  the  public  can  be

received and will be given due consideration.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That having been said, Sir, it is my pleasure on

behalf of the old Members, to extend a warm welcome to

the  new  Members  of this House. We look  forward  to

their   maiden   speeches  and  to  their   continuous

contributions thereafter.





<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Leader, Mr Prime Minister, hon.

Ministers  and hon. Members, I thank you,  Mr  Leader,

for your very kind remarks about me and your very wise

advice to hon. Members. Maybe it was a good thing that

my  tongue has never been honed to be as sharp as  the

scalpels  I am accustomed to. If it has, I am  sure  I

would not be taking the Chair again.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel very privileged to be re-elected to the Chair

and  I  express my sincere gratitude to the House  for

the great honour it has done me.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those hon. Members who were with me in the last

Parliament.  I wish to express my sincere  thanks  for

the  tolerance and cooperation which they had extended

to  me  and  which had helped to make my task  in  the

Chair a lot easier.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the new hon. Members to the House. Like

them,   I   was   once  raw  and  I   appreciate   the

difficulties,  or  perhaps I should say  frustrations,

which  they will face in the coming years.  Come  what

may.  they,  as also the old hon. Members should  look

upon the Speaker as their friend and should not regard

him  as  a  bogey-man. My advice to them is that  they

familiarise   themselves  with  and   understand   the

Standing  Orders  because, in spite of  the  mellowing

effect  the  years may have had on me. I  am  still  a

stickler for the rules of procedure in this House.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude. I wish to touch briefly on

debates in the House. Not everyone is cut out to be  a

great  orator or an expert debater but this  does  not

mean  that only the good debaters should be  heard  in

this  House. Hon. Members have the right,  subject  to

the Standing Orders. to speak in a debate and I assure

hon.  Members  that every Member. who seeks  to.  will

catch my eye.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion. I would like to assure hon. Members

that  I  would do my best to uphold the rules, dignity

and decorum of the House.
