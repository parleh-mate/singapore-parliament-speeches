Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B>&nbsp; Sir, to encourage recycling among Singaporeans, the National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the National Recycling Programme in 2001 to provide households with easy access to recycling facilities. Under this programme, residents are given recycling bags or bins to store their recyclables which are then collected fortnightly. In addition, NEA is in the process of placing 1,600 centralised recycling bins in the common areas of all HDB estates. With these bins, residents can now deposit their recyclables conveniently at any time. These are further complemented by a network of public recycling bins in various shopping centres, commercial buildings, food courts, as well as in public areas with high human traffic such as along Orchard Road.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the workplace, NEA has worked with JTC to install recycling facilities in all their 21 flatted factories and 9 industrial terraced workshop estates.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the schools, students learn about Singapore's waste situation in their curricula.&nbsp; NEA has also been working with schools to install recycling bins under the School Recycling Corner Programme. To date, 90% of our schools have recycling corners and recycling bins.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA promotes development of the recycling industry in various ways. The Sarimbun Recycling Park was set up to make land available to start up recycling companies.&nbsp; NEA administers the Innovation for Environmental Sustainability <p align=left>Column: 1301<p>Fund whereby companies can apply for funding to help defray part of the cost for pilot-testing of new technologies including recycling technologies that would help contribute to environmental sustainability in Singapore.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA also works with grassroots organisations, Community Development Councils and Non-Governmental Organisations such as the Singapore Environment Council and the Environmental Challenge Organisation to organise recycling events in the heartlands, including the annual Recycling Day to drive home the recycling message.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my Ministry promotes the minimisation of wastage of petroleum-based products such as plastic water bottles and plastic bags, which will continue to serve a purpose in a modern society like ours. Plastic bottles facilitate the portable consumption of water and plastic bags facilitate the transportation of goods.&nbsp; Many people reuse such items for other uses such as bagging of refuse in plastic bags.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to plastic bags, the National Environment Agency launched the "Why waste plastic bags? Choose reusable bags!" campaign in February 2006 to promote the use of reusable bags and reduce the wastage of plastic bags.&nbsp; More recently in April 2007, the "Bring Your Own Bag Day" campaign was also launched in partnership with the Singapore Environment Council and major supermarkets and retailers.&nbsp; Under this campaign, on the first Wednesday of the month, shoppers who do not bring their own shopping bags are requested gently to donate 10 cents for each plastic bag taken at the checkout counters. The response to the campaign has been encouraging so far. In a survey conducted during the August "Bring Your Own Bag" Day at 36 outlets, it was observed that <p align=left>Column: 1302<p>20% of shoppers brought their reusable bags and another 5% bought reusable bags on the spot.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to plastic water bottles, the bottled water consumption in Singapore currently constitutes only a very small proportion of the total domestic water consumption in Singapore. Nevertheless, we still encourage Singaporeans to recycle their plastic water bottles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast):&nbsp;</B> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for the comprehensive answer to the Questions.&nbsp; With regard to the bins or bin sites, can more be done in terms of the actual structure and in making them more user-friendly?&nbsp; If you look into some of these bins today, many of them are not sorted even though there is labelling for sorting.&nbsp; In terms of public education, can more be done to what is recyclable, even for&nbsp;plastic bottles, as not all of them are recyclable?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

The economy has grown at above 6% for the past three years, and is projected to grow by 7-8% for the current year. In addition, growth is broad-based across both the manufacturing and services sectors. As a <p align=left>Column: 1305<p>result of continued efforts in restructuring, we are also well positioned to ride on the new growth trends and favourable economic conditions ahead.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite our sustained strong growth in the recent years, we have been operating in an overall low-inflation environment. In the past three years, our Consumer Price Index increased at an average annual rate of 1.0% while Overall Unit Labour Cost actually declined at an annual average rate of 2.2%. However, in recent quarters, we have seen increases in property prices and rentals, as well as wages. We have to maintain vigilance over our costs, as excessive cost increases would dampen our growth prospects.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have taken a proactive approach so far.&nbsp; To address immediate space constraints, we have introduced some interim office space supply, and HDB flats for rent.&nbsp; The Ministry of National Development has also released additional information on property prices and rents to allow the public and businesses to make more informed decisions on property purchases or rentals. This will increase awareness that attractive housing options remain available for foreign talent beyond the central districts. For longer-term demand, MND has been putting out ample supply of land, with more than 42,000 private residential units and 640,000 square metres of office space to be completed by 2010.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the manpower front, with a near full employment trend, we are looking into ways to help more Singaporeans, such as older workers and women, take advantage of the strong employment market and rejoin the workforce.&nbsp; Reskilling efforts will also continue to allow Singaporeans to obtain better-paying jobs, while we supplement our workforce with foreign workers.&nbsp; Our <p align=left>Column: 1306<p>focus is to create better jobs for Singaporeans and better opportunities to attract global talent.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we take concrete steps to alleviate short term tightness in the resource markets, we should distinguish facts from impressions given by media reports of sky-high rentals in selected locations or transactions. For instance, the median prime&nbsp;office rent in the second quarter of 2007 (2Q07) was $9.50 per square foot per month (psf pm). However, median rent in other locations, which account for about 80% of office space in Singapore, was less than half of&nbsp;that, at $4.50 psf pm.&nbsp; Similarly, residential rents are also highly location dependent.&nbsp; In 2Q07, the median rents in 156 private condominium developments across the country published by URA ranged from $1.40 psf pm to $6.30 psf pm. In this regard, MND's recent release of additional information on property prices and rents will facilitate more informed decisions on property purchases or rentals.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Overall Unit Labour Cost has increased by 5.8% year-on-year in the first half of 2007, although it is still at a level which is 13% lower than 2001. Similarly, Unit Business Cost for Manufacturing has increased by 2.6% year-on-year in the first half of 2007, but remains at a level which is 11% lower than in 2001.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore remains cheaper compared to other global cities in the region. According to ECA International's&nbsp;comparison of 2006 monthly rentals for 3-bedroom apartments in areas equivalent to Singapore's districts 9, 10, 11 and East Coast, Singapore's rental was less than half that of Hong Kong and Tokyo. &nbsp;In a comparison of global office market rentals by CB Richard Ellis in May 2007, Singapore's office rental was found to be 30% lower than that of Hong Kong and 50%-60% lower than that of Tokyo.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1307<p>More importantly, competitiveness is more than offering lower costs alone.&nbsp; It is about value creation.&nbsp; London, Tokyo and New York are high cost locations, but they are thriving global hubs because they offer good value for businesses.&nbsp; Singapore has many attributes that enhance our value proposition to investors, which are not easily replicated by other regional cities.&nbsp; We have a pool of highly skilled talents that enable us to engage in high value-add activities.&nbsp; We are renowned for our liveability, clean environment, security and, increasingly, vibrancy as well.&nbsp; In June this year, <I>Monocle</I> (European lifestyle magazine) rated Singapore as the most liveable city in Asia outside Japan, and cited Singapore as being "extremely affordable" despite our "first world living standards".</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite increased costs, the World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Singapore as the second-most competitive economy overall among 55 countries, second only to the US, in May this year.&nbsp; Beyond the multi-billion investment projects such as the two integrated resorts that are being developed, our project pipelines for 2007 remain strong. For example, Mitsui Chemicals has recently announced that it will invest $240 million to expand its elastomer plant in Singapore. Qimonda will be building its first fully-owned 300 millimetre wafer fabrication facility in Singapore, and estimates that it will invest approximately $4 billion over the next five years.&nbsp; Singapore's tourism industry also hit record highs in the first half of 2007, achieving an estimated $6.4 billion in tourism receipts and welcoming 4.9 million visitor arrivals.&nbsp; These suggest that Singapore is still an attractive location for economic activities for investors, talents and tourists.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said this, we cannot afford to be complacent. The Government will continue to keep a tight watch on business costs and, most importantly, <p align=left>Column: 1308<p>strengthen our competitive advantage and value creation to investors, for Singapore to remain on its growth path.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They engage actively with the prospective investors to make sure that they understand the situation&nbsp;in Singapore and we take proactive action to mitigate these cost increases.&nbsp; Let me give you an example.&nbsp; We must see these cost increases in the context of what has happened in the last five years.&nbsp; For the last five years, the&nbsp;property rentals and&nbsp;prices and, in fact, cost in general had been&nbsp;kept very low in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the construction sector, for example, there has been a shake-out for contractors.&nbsp; As a result, there is a shortage of capacity.&nbsp; So when the economy takes off and there&nbsp;are a lot of construction activities -&nbsp;in part, also because of the global shortage of resources and higher steel prices and other commodity prices, plus the smaller contractor capacity that we have in Singapore -&nbsp;all this adds to the construction cost. &nbsp;So we are very conscious of this and the various agencies and&nbsp;Ministries try to take proactive action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investments also come in cycles.&nbsp; For example, in recent years, we&nbsp;have been&nbsp;watching a very strong interest in the petrochemical sector and,&nbsp;together with the reduced capacity in the construction sector, it&nbsp;results in the process industry facing higher costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways we try to mitigate this is to liberalise some of the labour constraints by allowing bigger allocation of foreign worker quota so that the contractors can take that into account and knowing that they can expand the construction capacity, they are then prepared to bid at a&nbsp;more competitive price.&nbsp; These are some of the dialogues that we have with the&nbsp;prospective investors and some of the proactive actions that we take.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And how would this affect Singapore and Singaporeans as a whole if this should continue?&nbsp; Are there measures that he would plan to take to contain this increase in the inflation rate?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; If you ask me candidly, I would say we have been enjoying practically 16 quarters of growth and, in fact, I am surprised that our inflation numbers are as low as they are.&nbsp; This partly reflects the more benign global inflation rates - Singapore is of course enjoying this -&nbsp;and partly&nbsp;our low inflation in the past was also because of the economic conditions in 2001 up to 2003.&nbsp; But, as I said, in the last 16 quarters, we have been enjoying highly robust growth, the higher end of our potential growth.&nbsp; So one would expect inflation in fact to pick up.&nbsp; And, indeed, it may well pick up.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the&nbsp;first half of this year, our inflation rates&nbsp;were very low, between 0.5%&nbsp;and 1%.&nbsp; I think Dr Lily Neo probably refers to the July numbers which show a blip of&nbsp;2.6% for the month of July.&nbsp; We are of course watching this closely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do expect inflation for the second half of this year to go up, partly reflecting the global inflationary trends.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you watch the inflation trends in US and&nbsp;Europe, you will notice that there is a lot of strong pressures on cost, and China recently has also reflected&nbsp;higher inflation numbers.&nbsp; So we expect, generally,&nbsp;cost to go up higher than the first half.&nbsp; Then, of course, we also have the one-off impact of the GST.&nbsp; But our experience shows that in the past when we had similar increases of GST&nbsp;this&nbsp;was a short-term impact and that, over time, the impact on cost would be mitigated.&nbsp; So, overall, we still look at an inflation forecast of between 1%&nbsp;and 2% this year, which is a little higher than our<p align=left>Column: 1311<p> previous years, but definitely still&nbsp;very reasonable considering that this is already more than 16 quarters of growth.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM--><p align=left>Column: 1311<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM:::1313--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There was a frank exchange of views on key regional and international issues, in particular progress in the Six-Party Talks. We issued two ARF statements on the Promotion of Inter-civilisation Dialogue; and on Supporting National Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1540 which deals with the issue of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp; We also adopted a set of ARF Guidelines for Disaster Relief Cooperation.&nbsp; In addition, we agreed on the Terms of Reference of a new advisory body to be called Friends of the Chair.&nbsp; This body will comprise the incoming and previous ARF Chairs and a non-ASEAN ARF country, to be convened in times of emergency to assist the ARF Chair in decision making.&nbsp; More importantly, the Ministers also agreed on the need to move forward on more concrete cooperation projects.&nbsp; They approved a list of ARF activities to be carried out in the next 12 months. Singapore and the EU will be co-chairing an ARF Seminar on Energy Security in the<p align=left>Column: 1312<p> first half of 2008; and we will partner New Zealand to hold the Second ARF Peacekeeping Experts' Meeting in March 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Singapore also proposed that the ARF undertake a comprehensive review to make it a more effective body.&nbsp; We will work with our ARF partners to prepare a report for consideration at the next ARF.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US is and remains a key partner of ASEAN.&nbsp; Without the stabilising influence of the US in our region, ASEAN members would not have achieved the sustained growth that we have enjoyed over the past few decades. But we must also acknowledge the reality that the US is a global power with global responsibilities and Southeast Asia will not always be among its top priorities.&nbsp; At present, developments in the Middle East, particularly the very difficult situation in Iraq, demands most attention in Washington DC and understandably so. Of course, it was disappointing&nbsp; that the US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice could not make it for the ARF in Manila this year; and that the ASEAN-US Commemorative Summit originally scheduled for September 2007 had to be postponed, both because of pressing developments in the Middle East. But we should take this in our stride. The relationship is strong enough to take these hiccups and we should not forget that if the situation in the Middle East were to get out of hand, Southeast Asia will not escape unscathed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, despite its global preoccupations, the US has been doing what it can to enhance its engagement of ASEAN. In 2002, it started the Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative which seeks to advance mutual interests in areas such as trade promotion as well as an ASEAN Cooperation Plan which focuses on developmental cooperation.&nbsp; In 2005, President Bush and ASEAN Leaders launched the ASEAN-US Enhanced Partnership. This was followed by a Plan of Action to implement this<p align=left>Column: 1313<p> partnership as well as an ASEAN-US Trade and Investment Framework&nbsp;Arrangement (TIFA). As this year marks the 30th year of ASEAN-US relations, the US is looking to appoint a US Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs, initiate a Fulbright Programme for ASEAN scholars, and conclude a landmark Science&nbsp;and Technology Agreement that will promote research and development collaboration between the research communities in ASEAN and the US. Clearly, within the unavoidable constraints imposed by its many other responsibilities, the US is committed to ASEAN. On our part, ASEAN will do what we can to continue to foster closer engagement with the US.&nbsp;</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:SETTING UP OF ASEAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION--><p align=left>Column: 1313<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SETTING UP OF ASEAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION:::1315--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister of State for National Development (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien) (for the Minister for National Development)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, from January 2004 to June 2007, HDB offered for sale more than 31,000 new HDB flats under various sales exercises.&nbsp; HDB plans to offer another 5,000-6,000 new flats in the second half of 2007.&nbsp; In total, that will bring the number of new flats offered in 2007 to 10,000 units.&nbsp; It will also continue to monitor the market closely, and make appropriate adjustments to the new flat supply, if necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam asked whether there is enough supply of new HDB flats for newlyweds so that they do not have to buy a resale flat.&nbsp; I would like to clarify that the demand for housing from first-timers is&nbsp; met through new flats as well as resale flats.&nbsp; There are three reasons for that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, new and resale flats have different attributes and&nbsp;their own<p align=left>Column: 1320<p> attractions to flat buyers.&nbsp; While new flats come with more modern designs, they tend to be in newer towns which are less centrally located and may not be ready for immediate occupation.&nbsp; On the other hand, resale flats, whilst older, tend to be situated in more established towns with a wider range of facilities and are ready for immediate occupation.&nbsp; Resale flats are a good option for newlyweds who wish to live near their parents or are planning to get married soon.&nbsp; With the large stock of more than 800,000 flats in Singapore, resale flats come in a wide variety of sizes, locations and prices to meet different housing needs and budgets.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a large number of first-timers are really asking for new flats in mature estates.&nbsp; Some of them wish to stay near their parents, while others like the location and seemingly better resale value.&nbsp; Much as we empathise with young couples, especially those who want to be located near their parents, there is simply not enough land in the mature towns to meet every need.&nbsp; From time to time, HDB identifies a site in a mature estate for redevelopment, and is able to offer a small number of new HDB flats for sale to the public after re-housing SERS residents.&nbsp; Dawson Estate, which was mentioned by PM in his National Day Rally speech, is one such example of HDB's effort to rejuvenate the mature estates.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this supply is small.&nbsp; It takes time for HDB to collect sufficient land parcels, and it is not enough to meet all the demand for new flats in mature towns.&nbsp; Where possible, HDB will do what it can to rejuvenate old estates, intensify the use of land, and introduce new HDB flats for sale to the public.&nbsp; However, given the land constraints, the majority of new flat supply will be located in the newer towns.&nbsp; It is not possible for HDB to provide a new flat to every young couple who wishes to stay near their parents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1321<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, first-timers who wish to buy a flat in a mature estate should consider the option of buying a resale flat.&nbsp; First-timers who buy resale flats can enjoy a HDB Housing Grant of $30,000, while those who live near their parents enjoy a higher tier grant of $40,000.&nbsp; To help the lower income group in buying their first flat, the Additional Housing Grant has been enhanced recently.&nbsp; For those whose monthly household income is below $4,000, they will also enjoy an Additional Housing Grant of up to $30,000. Therefore, first-timers can enjoy up to $70,000 in housing grant or about 40% of the price of a three-room resale flat.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the building of new flats must be in line with the net household formation rate, which takes into account the number of new households formed as well as the disbanding of households due to deaths, changes in marital&nbsp;status and other factors.&nbsp; If HDB were to provide every young couple with a new flat, while we will make the young couples happy today, we are creating a big problem for the same young couples in their later years.&nbsp; The same couples, in their perhaps not-so-young days, will have difficulties selling their flats later when they need to.&nbsp; We must not forget that a flat buyer today may be a flat seller later.&nbsp; In other words, if we over-provide for the young couples, we will inevitably affect the older couples who are thinking of monetising their HDB flats, or the couples who aspire to upgrade to a private property.&nbsp; HDB, therefore, needs to calibrate the supply of new flats to ensure a healthy resale market where both buyers and sellers can meet their needs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member has also asked MND/HDB to consider granting newlyweds priority under HDB's bi-monthly sales exercises for unsold flats.&nbsp; I wish to clarify that HDB has already been giving priority to first-timers (which includes newlyweds and<p align=left>Column: 1322<p> those applying under the Fiance-Fiancee scheme) when they apply for new HDB flats under the Build-to-Order and Balloting Exercises.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is in recognition of the more urgent needs of this group of flat buyers who are seeking a home to settle down and start a family.&nbsp; In the HDB Heartware Forum project which I have recently completed, we have taken note of the desire of the young couples to stay near their parents and have made recommendation to HDB to improve the priority scheme accordingly.&nbsp; HDB has announced on 14th August 2007 that the priority framework will safeguard for first-timers at least 90% of the flat supply under the Build-to-Order and balloting exercises.&nbsp; Under the revised system, first-timers will also enjoy double the chances over second-timers; and first-timers applying to live near their parents will be given four times the chances compared to regular applicants.&nbsp; First-timers who have applied unsuccessfully for four or more times will also be given additional chances, starting from their fifth attempt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As to the Member's question on whether MND will consider holding a dialogue with newly-wed couples, I would<p align=left>Column: 1323<p> like to inform the Member that HDB regularly carries out surveys and gathers feedback from potential flat buyers.&nbsp; Most recently, the Forum on HDB Heartware has also conducted extensive focus group discussion, public consultation, and email feedback on enhancing HDB community.&nbsp; Young participants in the age band of 25-34 years from all races and both genders formed one such focus group.&nbsp; Arising from the Forum's recommendations, HDB has increased the priority for first-timers and those buying flats to live near their parents.&nbsp; HDB has no plans to conduct another dialogue session with the newly-weds in the near future.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:RECRUITMENT OF TEACHERS AND RELIEF TEACHERS--><p align=left>Column: 1323<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:RECRUITMENT OF TEACHERS AND RELIEF TEACHERS:::1326--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask the MOS what are the typical reasons for rejecting these 90 or so applicants every year. My second question is with regard to this specific application of Mr Alfian Sa'at, and I take the MOS' point that it is not appropriate to discuss specific applications in this House. Having said that, I understand from Mr Alfian Sa'at that&nbsp;the&nbsp;reason for the rejection of his application was not really explained to him. So I would like to ask the MOS whether it is the Ministry's position that it is appropriate to reject this sort of application without going to specific reasons, if only to let the applicant know how he or she&nbsp;may improve himself or herself, so that he or she may take up a teaching position in future.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew</B>:&nbsp; The Member is correct in that we have&nbsp;a<p align=left>Column: 1326<p> rejection rate of about 3%, rounding up to about 100 cases that are rejected annually.&nbsp; The reasons vary.&nbsp; Some of them are because the applicants do not meet the minimum educational criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, sometimes, it is really because of a variety of reasons like, for&nbsp;example, their past records, disciplinary cases, and so on.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law)</B>:&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;the Community Court was set up in June 2006.&nbsp; Up to&nbsp;December 2006, it had dealt with about 650 accused persons, with slightly more than half being youthful offenders between 16 and 18 years old. Offenders with varying degrees of mental disabilities formed the next group numbering about 150.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Court has been widely hailed as an initiative of the Judiciary that<p align=left>Column: 1329<p> has enriched our criminal justice process, whereby punishments take into account the particular circumstances of the offence and offender, or what some have described as "creative sentencing".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Government recognises the need to continually review our sentencing options so as to better support the work of the Community Court. &nbsp;Towards this end, the Inter-Ministry Committee on Community-Based Sentences, which I chair,&nbsp;reconvened earlier this year to explore how to strengthen and add to currently available sentencing options so as to better facilitate the rehabilitation and re-integration of offenders into society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some initiatives we are studying are, firstly, introducing Mandatory Treatment Orders and setting up a Mental Facility. &nbsp;The Mandatory Treatment Order is an option to empower the Courts to require suitable offenders to undergo a stipulated course of treatment.&nbsp; It will be the most appropriate for offenders who are not sentenced to imprisonment but will benefit from undergoing medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment, or treatment for problems such as alcoholism or uncontrollable anger.&nbsp; In addition, the Prisons Department is exploring the possibility of setting up a small facility, either within Changi Prison itself or outside it, to house a limited number of prisoners with mental disabilities who are sentenced to imprisonment but are considered unsuitable for the rigours of an imprisonment regime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we are looking at strengthening our conditional discharge regime by injecting greater flexibility in the nature of the conditions that may be imposed when an offender is given a conditional discharge, for example, requiring him to perform community service or to pursue a course of study or vocational training. &nbsp;Thirdly, we are <p align=left>Column: 1330<p>exploring the possibility of introducing Short-Term Detention to deal with offenders deemed suitable for probation but who, in the Court's view, would benefit from an initial short period of detention.&nbsp; This sentencing option can also apply to probationers who breach their probation orders, who can then be sent for a short period of detention to reflect on their wrongdoing and to receive counselling and other rehabilitative treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, besides the above key initiatives which will principally benefit young offenders and offenders with mental disabilities, the Committee is also exploring the possibility of expanding the scope of Community Service Orders or CSOs.&nbsp; Currently, Community Service Orders are imposed as part of probation, mainly on youthful offenders. The Committee is considering an expanded use of CSOs for adults as a standalone option, and this is just to name an example, for example, those who commit traffic offences can be required to perform CSOs as school traffic wardens and those who commit offences involving cruelty to animals can be required to work at the SPCA.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should add that these are proposals that we need to study further and examine with other parties, not only with the Police, Prisons and the Attorney-General's Chambers, but with medical experts, psychologists, social workers and counsellors as well as the wider community. This is because, for them to succeed, we need to muster adequate community support and professional resources.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, if they are adopted, their implementation will take time as additional resources and expertise will have to be built up, as well as amendments made to relevant legislation such as the Criminal Procedure Code and the Probation of Offenders Act.</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">        	      		<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B></span></B></div><BR>							<p align=left>Column: 1331<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):&nbsp;</B> Sir, will the Ministry consider widening the powers conferred on the courts, pursuant to the Probation of Offenders Act and the Criminal Procedure Code, to pass sentences that will give effect to the restorative justice rationale of sentencing available in jurisdictions such as New Zealand?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

A police report was made and I believe that person has now been charged and&nbsp;the court hearing is&nbsp;due later this&nbsp;month.&nbsp; A team of experienced social workers from my Ministry&nbsp;then met with all the residents&nbsp;of that&nbsp;Home and provided them with necessary counselling and emotional support.&nbsp; My Ministry views the ill-treatment of children very seriously, and we will not hesitate to take tough enforcement actions against anyone found guilty of mistreating children and young persons.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The incident in the Darul Ihsan Orphanage is a reminder of the important role and heavy responsibility that the&nbsp;Home Management Committee members have.&nbsp; They have to ensure that the Homes that they supervise are safe.&nbsp; In this particular case, my Ministry had to reproach the Management Committee&nbsp;for not disclosing the incidents more promptly to us, and we also warned them to comply strictly with all&nbsp;the regulations&nbsp;under the Children and Young Persons Act as well as the&nbsp;MCYS' specified Standards of Care.&nbsp; The Home has since worked hard to ensure that the proper systems are in place so that the Home is safe for children.&nbsp; They have consequently reviewed and improved their SOPs.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry has also implemented some additional measures to protect the welfare of residents in these Homes.&nbsp; For instance, I have instructed&nbsp;the Board of Visitors to extend their visits to the&nbsp;10 non-gazetted Homes.&nbsp; Let me explain a little bit more on this point.&nbsp; We have 20 Homes which look after children in such circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten of these 20 Homes<p align=left>Column: 1333<p> are what we call "gazetted Homes" - in other words, they have&nbsp;statutory functions under the Children and Young Persons Act.&nbsp; Under this Act,&nbsp;I appoint a Board of Visitors who will&nbsp;visit and inspect the Homes and check on the conditions which the residents are living under.&nbsp; I have now decided to extend the Board of Visitors' role to also cover the children's Homes&nbsp;which today&nbsp;are not gazetted with statutory functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for instance, a Home like the Darul Ihsan Orphanage is not a gazetted Home but, from now on, will&nbsp;receive visits from the Board of Visitors once every two months.&nbsp; These will be random visits so that they can go in and check on the conditions which are prevailing.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board of Visitors, after their visit,&nbsp;will report&nbsp;their observations&nbsp;directly to the Director of Social Welfare of my Ministry.&nbsp; And then from there on, we can take any necessary investigations or enforcement actions.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, my Ministry has also set up a Post Office Box address for the Board of Visitors, so that the residents can write directly to the Board of Visitors.&nbsp; These inputs will be forwarded to the members of the Board and these inputs can be sent to us anonymously&nbsp; - in other words, a kind of whistle-blowing mechanism within the Home itself.&nbsp; We have to do this because some of the young boys or girls there may feel shy or intimidated from making a specific complaint under their own name against a staff member.&nbsp; So this system provides another alternative channel. The&nbsp;Board of Visitors will then investigate any complaints or feedback given by these residents and then raise it&nbsp;with the Ministry or with the Home Management Committees.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third thing we have done is to instruct that all children's Homes must display&nbsp;a national toll-free Child Protection<p align=left>Column: 1334<p> helpline&nbsp;number.&nbsp; The Management Committees have been instructed to also educate the residents on the various channels of seeking help if they are abused or if they wish to report an incident of abuse, either involving themselves or one of their friends in the same Home.&nbsp; The residents&nbsp;have also&nbsp;been reminded&nbsp;that they&nbsp;have a right and that they should approach trusted adults&nbsp;- their relatives,&nbsp;friends, school teachers or indeed other&nbsp;volunteers in the Home if they face any such problems.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would end by emphasising again that no child residing in any of our Homes should be subjected to any form of abuse. When it comes to protecting children, everyone has a role to play.&nbsp; And my Ministry will continue to look into what more we can do to ensure that this protection extends uniformly and effectively to each and every single child.&nbsp; We will work with the Police and our community partners to prevent a recurrence of such incidents in the Homes.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> Sir,&nbsp;how often does the Board of Visitors actually make visits to these Homes&nbsp;to investigate the conditions under which these Homes are operating?&nbsp; My second question relates to the extent of awareness that residents of these Homes have.&nbsp; Sometimes they do not know that they are being abused unless they are told in advance the kind of treatment to&nbsp;expect, what kind of punishment conditions they should expect if they breach the rules, and where does one cross the line of abuse.&nbsp; How much of this has the Ministry done to educate the residents?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B>&nbsp;Sir, the Board of Visitors should visit each Home at least once in two months.&nbsp; Under the Children and Young Persons Act, the Board has the right to enter a Home at all reasonable times&nbsp;-&nbsp;in other words, they do not have to pre-inform and get everything&nbsp;in the <p align=left>Column: 1335<p>Home arranged&nbsp;spick and span so that what they see is not a realistic picture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On awareness, the Member is absolutely right.&nbsp; There is no point in having all the systems if the residents in the Home do not know how to use these avenues.&nbsp; That is why we have to, first, make sure that avenues are possible, for instance, the Post Office box address, make sure that the Board of Visitors goes in.&nbsp; And when they go in, they can also, at random,&nbsp;select residents to speak to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we have also reminded the Homes to put up a notice board to say that this is the national helpline number&nbsp;the residents can call.&nbsp; And also, as the Member has suggested, when any child comes in to have a standard briefing, this is a Home, these are the rules which apply to the boys or girls there, as well as the rules which the staff need to comply with, so that people are, in a sense, aware of their rights and the avenues for redress.&nbsp; But the most important thing is to understand that these are vulnerable children, and that staff, volunteers and management committee members are in a position of trust and that everyone really has to do&nbsp;his part.&nbsp; And it&nbsp;requires, in that sense, an entire village to bring up these children.&nbsp; So&nbsp;any one who is involved in these Homes needs to view himself as a member of the village.&nbsp; And if we can get that done, restore trust, then focus on restoring these children to the rightful trajectories which their life should take.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:CHILD CARE SUBSIDY--><p align=left>Column: 1335<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:CHILD CARE SUBSIDY:::1337--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>CHILD CARE SUBSIDY</span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Increase--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Increase)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B> asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports whether the Government will consider increasing the $150 child care subsidy which was last revised in 1995 and which is no longer adequate in view of the rising cost of child care fees.</p></div></span>					<p align=left>Column: 1336<p><!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon) (for the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the hon.

When the school becomes operational and if there are indeed traffic concerns raised, LTA will work with the school, Traffic Police and other agencies, such as HDB or Town Council, to identify necessary improvements or modifications to the traffic scheme around the school. Measures taken could include engineering solutions, such as railings to prevent jay-walking or cars stopping, allowing parents to drive into the school to drop off or pick up students, or encouraging parents to make use of nearby HDB carparks and service roads as waiting areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these measures, LTA recognises that there may be instances where the impact of the traffic cannot be mitigated fully, and congestion may still build up when school is about to start or end.

The aim of the study is to assess whether pedestrians and cyclists are prepared to share a common footway.&nbsp; The study started in late May and will last a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard the safety of pedestrians and cyclists during the trial, the organisers undertook a series of public education programmes to promote safe riding on footways.&nbsp; These include the dissemination of a set of guidelines for cyclists and pedestrians developed in consultation with organisations such as the National Safety Council of Singapore (NSCS), the Singapore Action Group for the Elders (SAGE), the Singapore Amateur Cycling Association (SACA) and the Safe Cycling Task Force (SCTF).&nbsp; Cycling wardens have also been deployed along the footways in Tampines to advise <p align=left>Column: 1344<p>pedestrians and cyclists on sharing the footways in a safe and gracious manner.&nbsp; The Police will continue to take action against cyclists who ride on the footpaths recklessly, or in a disorderly manner that endangers pedestrians or other footpath users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the outcome of the study, the Tampines community may have the option of making the scheme permanent.&nbsp; Where there is community support for such a scheme in other neighbourhoods, LTA and the Traffic Police may also consider allowing cyclists to share the footpaths in their respective towns after taking into account characteristics such as road infrastructure, density of pedestrians and cyclists on footways and environmental factors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides reviewing the feasibility of allowing cyclists and pedestrians to share the use of footways, the LTA has also been working with NParks to build on its Park Connector Network which cyclists can use for both recreational and commuting purposes.&nbsp; LTA will identify and incorporate crossing points for cyclists at locations where the park connector interfaces with the road network.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, footways can be shared safely if users are civic-minded and exercise responsibility for their own safety and that of other road users.&nbsp; We can facilitate, but, ultimately, every pedestrian and cyclist has a part to play in making footways safe for all.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo:</B>&nbsp; Thank you for the comprehensive reply.

These measures, together with&nbsp; the broad range of changes to the CPF system announced by PM at the National Day Rally, will further increase retirement savings for members.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Their timely reports of any suspicious activity can bring about expeditious action by law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; At the same time, they are an additional resource in our response to security incidents.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me cite an example.&nbsp; About&nbsp;two months back, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) received an anonymous call before noon, informing them that a bomb was going to explode at Raffles Place.&nbsp; Together with the security officers deployed in the vicinity, Police immediately checked the vicinity of Clifford Centre where the call was traced to.&nbsp; A security officer deployed at Clifford Centre assisted the Police in reviewing the CCTV recording and provided information that helped to identify the likely culprit.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That same afternoon, there was a second call to the SCDF informing them that bombs had been planted at Orchard Road and Tanjong Pagar.&nbsp; This time, the call was traced to International Plaza.&nbsp; Police responded immediately.&nbsp; Security officers deployed at the location again assisted Police in reviewing the CCTV recording.&nbsp; The likely culprit of the morning episode was again identified in this set of CCTV recording.&nbsp; A quick search was done in the vicinity and the culprit was arrested following his admission to making both the bomb hoax calls.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This example shows the value of well-trained and vigilant security officers who can complement our security forces.&nbsp; We are therefore introducing an enhanced regulatory regime, where all security officers, and private investigators as well, will be licensed personally, so that (a) it will enable the licensing authority to conduct the necessary background checks and prevent undesirable elements from operating as security officers or private investigators; and (b) it will enable the<p align=left>Column: 1352<p> licensing authority to specify the requisite skills and qualifications that private investigators and security officers should have.&nbsp; In time to come, the licensing authority may also require security officers who work at more sensitive installations, where the security threat is higher, to possess higher level qualifications and skills.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The net result is that better training and conduct will raise standards and&nbsp;give the security officers a greater sense of pride and professionalism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a private investigator or security officer be charged with or convicted of a prescribed offence which makes his continued employment as a private investigator or security officer undesirable, his licence can be suspended with immediate effect.&nbsp; This power is provided in clause 24(5) of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the licensing schemes for security officers and private investigators, more than 500 private investigators and 30,000 security officers will need to apply for a licence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware that some security officers and private investigators are unable to attain a licence, despite their best efforts.&nbsp; If they work in places where the security threat is lower, we will consider exempting them from the licensing requirement under the Act.&nbsp; This will ease the level of displacement from the industry when the Act comes into force.&nbsp; But I foresee that many of them would be able to make the grade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1353<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5(2) of the Bill currently provides that certain persons are not to be regarded as private investigators, such as in-house investigators employed by insurance companies, and those working as investigators in other business sectors, for example, those who obtain or give information on the financial standing of another person, or public accountants, which pose little threat to national security, and are of no concern to the police.&nbsp; The Act also allows the Minister to further exempt other categories of private investigators from licensing under the Act, should their work be of little security concern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Approval for private investigators to take on certain security assignments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for those private investigators who need to be licensed, police will tighten up the regulatory regime to ensure that they do not conduct private investigation activities which may be prejudicial to the public interest or our national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill, therefore, states that a private investigator has to seek the licensing officer's approval before accepting any assignment from a foreign government or its proxy agency.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, a private investigator has to seek the licensing officer's approval before he carries out any surveillance or activities which involve the gathering of information on certain persons or places of security concern.&nbsp; The licensing officer may subsequently revoke this approval if it is not in the public interest or if it poses a threat to national security.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, key Government leaders and sensitive places are known to be targets of terrorists.&nbsp; Having such provisions in our laws will mark out clearly to the industry the boundaries they have to work within.&nbsp; At the same time, such a law<p align=left>Column: 1354<p> serves to alert the licensing authority to any activities of security concern, giving the licensing authority advance information, as well as the opportunity to investigate further if necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Record-keeping of identities of private investigator's clients</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other measures to strengthen the regulatory framework over the private investigation industry include clause 10, which requires a private investigation agency to obtain and verify the identity and address of the person engaging its services, before it can accept any assignment from such a person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement this requirement, clause 12 of the Bill specifies the various records, including the identity of the clients, where a private investigation agency or employer of a private investigator has to keep and submit to the licensing authority.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Expansion of regulatory scope to include other activities in the private security industry</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also cover security service providers, other than private investigators and security officers.&nbsp; As defined in clause 18, those providing security surveillance services, and those installing security equipment like audio devices used for overhearing and recording a conversation in any premises, will be regulated under the new Act.&nbsp; This will allow controls to be imposed on other security service providers, to ensure that they meet certain standards of professionalism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, clause 20 allows the licensing officer to levy a charge on a prescribed security service provider, being a Central Alarm Monitoring Station (CAMS) provider, if it indiscriminately alerts the police whenever an alarm is activated at premises that it is monitoring, <p align=left>Column: 1355<p>without first taking reasonable measures to verify whether it is a false alarm.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule of the Bill contains a list of security equipment that will fall under the ambit of the new Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Increase in fine quantum</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current Act was enacted in 1973, more than 30 years ago.&nbsp; The highest penalty provided for in the Act is a $10,000 fine or a two-year imprisonment term, or both.&nbsp; In the current context, where revenues of industry players are considerably higher, such penalties are no longer adequate, particularly the fines.&nbsp; If the fines are not increased, the Act will pose no deterrence and this will have adverse consequences for our security.&nbsp; Hence, to keep pace with the changes in the business environment and to ensure that there is adequate deterrence in today's context, the Bill will provide for a five-fold increase in the maximum quantum of fines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Past initiatives to upgrade industry</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me put into context the current amendments in terms of what we are doing to upgrade the private security industry.&nbsp; At the end of 2004, police set up the Security Industry Regulatory Department (SIRD) to look into the regulation of the private security industry.&nbsp; A set of skills standards under the National Skills Recognition System or NSRS was introduced in 2005 for all private security officers employed by the security agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of last year, a buyer awareness exhibition and seminar was also held to allow major buyers in the business community to be more discerning in their engagement of security service providers.&nbsp; Last month, I launched the Security Workforce Skills Qualifications or Security WSQ.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1356<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the effort to upgrade the quality of the security services, a pilot exercise was also conducted last year to grade all licensed security agencies according to prescribed professional standards.&nbsp; Part of the objectives of the exercise was also to provide an objective and authoritative assessment of existing security agencies and motivate them to raise their service standards and improve their operational processes.&nbsp; Police has recently completed the formal grading exercise for this year, after refining the criteria following last year's pilot exercise, and will be publishing the results on the Internet very soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much work has been done over the last few years to develop the private security industry into the effective partner of our security forces.&nbsp; Today's amendment to the law is part of this greater transformation of the industry which MHA is helping to facilitate.&nbsp; In the current security environment, this Act will be a key component in our efforts to enhance the capabilities of the private security industry, so that the Government and private sector partnership can work together to keep Singapore safe and secure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.24 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the 11th September terrorist attack in the United States has changed the security landscape and security industry in many countries.&nbsp; The governments of many countries have implemented various security measures and systems to further enhance the safety and security of their installations.&nbsp; In Singapore, our Home Team and various Government agencies have also developed security measures to safeguard strategic <p align=left>Column: 1357<p>installations, such as our airports, MRT system, Government buildings and certain public places.&nbsp; But we cannot solely depend on our Government agencies to provide security.&nbsp; There is a need to engage the private security industry to further enhance our safety and security.&nbsp; As such, the Bill is indeed timely in providing a comprehensive framework to regulate and enhance the professionalism of our private security industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at present, the private security industry lacks supervision and enforcement to ensure that they provide professional security services to their clients.&nbsp; Some security agencies do not provide much training to their security officers, while some employ ad hoc or temporary security guards to fulfill their contractual obligations.&nbsp; This has resulted in unethical business practices and unprofessional practices in the industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The private security industry also suffers from an image problem, as the majority of people who are keen to join the industry are senior citizens.&nbsp; Many regard these jobs as their retirement jobs, and do not have much motivation to upgrade their skills and knowledge.&nbsp; Furthermore, due to the intense business competition, some security agencies are tendering at prices which they cannot provide quality and professional services.&nbsp; Today, private security firms are faced with three key challenges:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Intense competition due to low entry barrier into the industry;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Shortage of qualified and well-trained security officers; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Relatively high turnover of staff and low staff morale.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the present situation in the industry is indeed unhealthy and will not <p align=left>Column: 1358<p>enhance our safety and security.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to highlight four areas of the Bill which I hope the Minister will provide clarifications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Impact on existing security officers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill will affect the jobs and livelihoods of many security officers/guards, especially inhouse security guards.&nbsp; Many of these security guards are old and may not meet the new licensing requirements or pass the screening or training.&nbsp; The Bill will cause much displacement of jobs and retrenchment.&nbsp; How can we protect or help those affected by the new licensing requirements?&nbsp; Many of these old security guards will encounter difficulty in finding another job.&nbsp; I have received industry feedback that about 20%-30% of these inhouse security guards may not pass the security screening or Security Workforce Skills Qualifications (Security WSQ) training course.&nbsp; Thus, a few thousand security guards may lose their jobs.&nbsp; Some of these guards are relatives or trusted employees of building owners and have been working for many years as security guards.&nbsp; Sir, may I ask the Minister what are the plans of the Ministry to help these affected security guards?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as the number of existing inhouse security guards who will be affected by the Bill is about 5,000, I would propose to the Ministry to consider phasing the compliance of licensing of security officers in accordance with the different levels of security needs of clients or installations.&nbsp; We can instead issue personal licences for security officers who are trained in different levels of skills and knowledge, such as Class-1 Security Licence for low-security installations, Class-2 for medium security installations and Class-3 for high security installations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A three-tier personal security licence scheme will facilitate the employment of security officers with the appropriate skills<p align=left>Column: 1359<p> and knowledge relevant to the security needs of the installations.&nbsp; It will also provide a career path for security officers who are keen to upgrade themselves to manage complex installations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government is encouraging Singaporeans to work longer.&nbsp; The private security industry provides many job opportunities for older workers, and certain segments of our population would prefer such jobs.&nbsp; I fully agree that we must raise professional standards for the private security industry, but we must also strike a balance between providing job opportunities for older Singaporeans and ensuring safety and security.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Impact on private security industry</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the implementation of the Private Security Industry Bill will also affect the security industry in a number of ways.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, the stringent licensing requirements for security officers will result in a severe shortage of qualified security officers.&nbsp; At present, the security industry is unable to attract many good workers.&nbsp; Many security officers must work on a 12-hour rotating shift.&nbsp; The salary of security officers is not very attractive.&nbsp; It is between $1,000-$1,200.&nbsp; As such, not many job-seekers are keen to pursue a career in the industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the buoyant&nbsp;property development market will further increase the demand for security officers of many new buildings, such as shopping centres, offices and integrated resorts.&nbsp; This will result in the poaching of qualified security guards amongst security service providers, thus causing more disruption to the security services of many buildings.&nbsp; The impact will be more severe in buildings managed by small or medium-sized security firms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the new requirements of the Bill will add on much administrative burden on security and private<p align=left>Column: 1360<p> investigation firms.&nbsp; Many of these are small business outfits or one-man-operations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, what is the manpower forecast for security officers in the next three years?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, do we have adequate WDA-accredited training service providers for security officer courses?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, what are the measures in place to help small and medium security firms cope&nbsp;with the new compliances of the Bill?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Professional framework for security officers and private investigators</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, licensing alone will not enhance the professionalism of security officers and private investigators. We need to develop a comprehensive framework to set professional standards and key desired outcomes of our security services.&nbsp; This would entail&nbsp;quality and professional training by accredited training establishments, and close supervision by the Ministry to ensure professional standards.&nbsp; Due to the complexity of the private security industry and the importance of security, we cannot assume compliance of the Act automatically. Although the increased penalty will act as a deterrent for non-compliances, it is necessary for the Ministry to adopt a more proactive approach in conducting spot checks to ensure professional standards and achieve the desired outcomes of the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with regard to enhancing professional standards, I wish to seek the Minister's clarifications on the following. First, is there a professional framework by the Ministry to raise professional standards of the private security industry <p align=left>Column: 1361<p>such as a Singapore Standards for security services or&nbsp;Code of Practice (CP) for security services?&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what are the key desired outcomes of professional standards?&nbsp;And third, is there any enforcement team in the Ministry to ensure compliance of the Act?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Cost of business</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the new requirements of the Bill will pose a cost burden to businesses, especially small and medium enterprises. Clauses 8, 9, 16 and 17 of the Bill require the licensed private investigation agency or licensed security agency to inform the licensing officer within 14 days after the employment or termination of their employees. This is indeed a very stringent administrative requirement to comply with, especially for smaller security firms.&nbsp; I propose that the Ministry should consider liaising with the CPF Board which now requires all employers to submit the employer's statement of account (CPF Form 92) to indicate the status of their employees.&nbsp; The information provided by the CPF's Form 92 should be adequate for the licensing officers to conduct the necessary checks on the suitability of the candidates for employment in this security industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the cost of training for security officers is&nbsp;high (about $550 for training and $150 for assessment tests) and does increase the business cost of security firms.&nbsp; WDA only subsidises 80% to 90% of the course fee. The high turnover of security officers also serves as a disincentive for many firms to send their officers for training.&nbsp; To ensure that there is an adequate supply of trained security officers, we should consider lowering the cost of training for security officers, especially the basic security course.&nbsp; We should also provide more flexibility for individuals who are keen to join the security industry. Course subsidy could be <p align=left>Column: 1362<p>given directly to the individuals attending security courses.&nbsp; The Ministry should also consider granting personal security licences to individuals directly as in the case of driving licence. In this way, we will be able to encourage more personal accountability of individuals wanting to join the security industry and develop a more stable and committed workforce in the security industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the raising of professional standards as stipulated by the Bill will further complement the Government's efforts in making Singapore a safe and secure place.&nbsp; But we need both the Ministry and industry stakeholders to show commitment to achieve the desired outcomes of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.36 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill in general and I also appreciate the rationale for professionalising the industry.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, one provision which I believe is of considerable concern is clause 11 of the Bill. Clause 11 provides that no person may accept a security assignment unless the licensing officer has given prior written approval. What amounts to a security assignment is defined in that clause to encompass various situations.&nbsp; Although the Minister has explained that the concern is public interest and national security, my view is that the provision is too wide.&nbsp; The most politically sensitive aspect is that the security assignment includes any brief requiring the gathering of information or surveillance of a "political figure". A "political figure" is itself defined in clause 2 to mean four categories of office-holders - the President, the Prime Minister, a Minister or a Minister of State.&nbsp; In other words, the effect of this clause is that it will be illegal for any person to <p align=left>Column: 1363<p>accept a brief to conduct surveillance or to gather information on the President, Prime Minister, any Minister or Minister of State unless he applies to the licensing officer and gets prior written approval.&nbsp; Further, Sir, clause 11(2)(b)(v) makes it clear that the need to get prior approval extends to gathering information or doing surveillance on&nbsp;the&nbsp;political figure's household member as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me elaborate on why I believe the provision is too wide. Singaporeans may have legitimate reasons to want to gather information or ask for surveillance on political figures or their families.&nbsp; To illustrate, let me play devil's advocate.&nbsp; For instance, a person may have reasons to suspect that a political figure is in a relationship with that person's spouse which will give grounds for divorce.&nbsp; That person will need a private investigator to gather evidence to see if there are grounds to start divorce proceedings.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with national security. Why should that person be required to seek Police's permission to monitor the political figure's movements?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example could be&nbsp;a case where a member of&nbsp; a political figure's family attempts to use his political connections for business gain, a case of suspected corruption. Due to the sensitivity of the case, the complainant may want to get a private investigator to produce a preliminary report before reporting the matter to the authorities.&nbsp; In this situation, some would in fact argue that it is in the public interest to allow the private investigation to carry on undisclosed.&nbsp;Sir, no matter what standards of personal integrity are imposed by any organisation, there will be some who fall short. History has taught us that even in Singapore, by enacting this clause, are we inadvertently erecting a firewall around our political office-holders?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The requirement for prior written approval will also generate doubts in<p align=left>Column: 1364<p> people's minds about the effectiveness of subsequent investigations, for example, (1),&nbsp;the issue of time.&nbsp; How long will the Police take to consider the application? Will it be a few days or a few weeks?&nbsp; What if a transaction is on-going and it is over by the time the approval comes?&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of approval channels. When the Police are considering the application for approval, who should they inform or seek advice from? Would the Minister for Home Affairs be consulted? Who else will know about the application and is there any guarantee that the political figure will not come to know of it?&nbsp; Would leaks botch&nbsp;up the investigations?&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of how much disclosure is required to get Police approval. Under clause 11(7), the applicant may be required to disclose to the licensing officer what evidence and information he already has in hand.&nbsp; Who would come to know of these details?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, besides the issue of political office-holders, there are other categories of people which need prior approval to investigate but seem to have little to do with public interest or national security, for example, under clause 11(2)(c), it covers any person working in&nbsp;a Government building, or any person working in a private school which has mainly foreign students.&nbsp; This would&nbsp;seem to mean that we will need Police approval to tail even a cashier working in a food court in a Government building or a local security guard working at&nbsp;an international school.&nbsp; Is&nbsp;this not too wide?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are already laws in place&nbsp;prohibiting&nbsp;intrusions into protected places, laws against trespassing and so on. Why add this blanket requirement to inform the Police of such security assignments?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly,&nbsp;Sir, clause 42 of the Bill amends the Miscellaneous Offences Act to include a new section 22(A). Section 22(A)(4) permits the licensing officer to allow certain private investigators or <p align=left>Column: 1365<p>private security personnel to carry truncheons and even handcuffs. Given that private security personnel do not have Police powers under the law and they do not have similar training requirements, are we not running&nbsp;a risk of excessive force being used by these private security personnel?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.41 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, I am&nbsp;the advisor to the Union of Security Employees (USE) and I would like to just raise two points.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I welcome the Bill as it is another significant move to upgrade the private security industry.&nbsp; Properly licensed with proper training and a better professional image, the salaries of security officers should also increase.&nbsp; Security officers who are members of the USE have seen their pay go up as their jobs get recreated and their skills upgraded and certified.&nbsp; On average, they now earn $1,300 to $1,500 per month, depending on assignments, compared to about $800 to $1,000 a few years ago.&nbsp; But not all security officers have enjoyed this improvement in wages and career prospects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nationally, the medium gross wages of private security guards have fallen from $1,403 a month in 2001 to $1,257 last year, according to the report on wages in Singapore which was recently released. Sir, some security agencies are still cutting corners and not paying their security officers decent wages or CPF.&nbsp; Other than professional criteria, can I ask the Minister if the Ministry will also look into upgrading security officers and&nbsp;also on their compliance in paying CPF to the security officers?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point is to urge the Ministry to also focus on education of<p align=left>Column: 1366<p> security agencies and not only on enforcement.&nbsp; We know that many low-skilled workers, especially older ones, as has been pointed out by my hon. colleague, Dr Teo Ho Pin, they have switched to working as security guards after they have been retrenched and some of them cannot find another job in the market. There is a worry that some will lose their jobs as a result of this Bill. As long as they are fit and able, they should be given the opportunity to be trained and licensed without compromising on professional standards. Sir, I understand that the image of the security industry needs to be upgraded but I hope that in the process, we will not discriminate against older workers who are fit and able, and are motivated to do the job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister if the Ministry will also educate security agencies on the value of training such workers and to work with relevant agencies, such as NTUC and WDA, to upgrade their skills to license them so that they have prospects in this industry?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point I would like to make finally is to urge the Ministry to work with security agencies to see how they can pool their resources together, work on economies of scale, rather than work as different individual agencies with different competing interests and get stuck at a certain level of professionalism.&nbsp; If we can lift the entire industry up through education and enforcement as well as through grants, I think we will give better prospects to our workers for a job as security guards.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Let me assure the House that the existing security officers who have already qualified under the NSRS scheme -&nbsp;there are about 24,900-plus of them -&nbsp;do not need to retake the test.&nbsp; They have already qualified for licensing as they have passed the NSRS.&nbsp; The group that is currently left out and not yet covered and&nbsp;who will be covered under the new Act will be the in-house guards.&nbsp; The in-house guards are the ones that could be employed by hotels, building owners or condominiums.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also say that some of these buildings and condominiums&nbsp;also employ guards from the private security agencies.&nbsp; For these building managements, they should have no problems retaining the guards.&nbsp; But for other forms of in-house guards, they will have to undergo training.&nbsp; The basic training they need is not&nbsp;a security WSQ.&nbsp; This is of a different standard altogether.&nbsp; In fact, the WSQ training, whether it is&nbsp;certificate, advanced certificate or&nbsp;diploma in WSQ is for career advancement, for supervisory leadership&nbsp;and managerial positions.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;security officers&nbsp;wish to move up their career, then they should consider taking the WSQ.&nbsp; But for the rest, they only need to undergo the NSRS training,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is not difficult.&nbsp; From what I have seen in the last few years since we started the scheme, practically all of them&nbsp;passed.&nbsp; If they do not pass, they will be given opportunities to pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the existing in-house guards who are&nbsp;now not licensed, they will also be given time to pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think they need to worry about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there may be some who do not pass the security screening.&nbsp; All those in-house guards do not undergo security screening.&nbsp;&nbsp;Security officers employed by the security agencies will undergo&nbsp;security screening.&nbsp; For these guards who do not pass security screening, we will give them <p align=left>Column: 1368<p>time&nbsp;to find other jobs.&nbsp; They will have to look for other things to do since they should not remain as security officers or guards in the buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the manpower forecast for the security officers, I would say that there would be an increase in demand in the light of the new buildings and the IRs that are being set up.&nbsp; There will be adequate training facilities available.&nbsp; Right now, there are 36 training centres training people for NSRS qualification.&nbsp; I believe these 36 centres will be able to cope with the demand of the industry's needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those which require higher levels of skills like the WSQ, the Temasek Polytechnic is running courses, and they also run parts of these courses together with 10 other training centres for WSQ qualification.&nbsp; I believe there ought to be adequate places for anyone who wants to be a security officer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the small and medium firms, I would say that they should have no problem complying with the new licensing requirement.&nbsp; But if they have, they will be given time to adjust.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The standards of professionalism and the skills required are set by the Police.&nbsp; The NSRS standard is also set by the Police.&nbsp; The WSQ standard is also set by the Police working with the industry.&nbsp; So there is already a professional framework required of the kind of skills that are needed to perform certain types of security services.&nbsp; Of course, for more sensitive installations and&nbsp;for higher profile types of establishments, then different skill sets may be required.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these, the Police will also set the standards.&nbsp; Most of the companies will be able to send their employees to undergo the training courses conducted by the respective agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo also asked that we give personalised licences.&nbsp; I have already<p align=left>Column: 1369<p> mentioned that we will do so.&nbsp; That&nbsp;will actually give the security officers&nbsp;a greater scope for&nbsp;mobility.&nbsp; Right now, whenever they change companies, the new company will apply for approval to hire them.&nbsp; Under the new licensing regime, the individual&nbsp;officer can just move along to another employer who can offer him better terms and better wages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in terms of wages, from the information given to me by the Union of Security Employees, the wages have actually gone up.&nbsp; The gross salary has gone up between $880-$1,000 in 2003, to about $1,300-$1,800 in 2006.&nbsp; This is partly because of the increasing standards and training required of our security officers.&nbsp; I suppose when we talk of the average salary of the security officers and if we take into account also those who are not under the present NSRS scheme type of officers, then it could be dragged down by other kinds of unlicensed guards currently employed by other&nbsp;establishments, like condominiums and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now come to Ms Sylvia Lim's question on clause 11.&nbsp; The main rationale for this is to ensure that certain types of people - our key Government leaders, the foreign missions' officials, Ambassadors, Counsellors and officers who are targets for terrorists - are not easily put under surveillance by those who want to do harm to them.&nbsp; And that is the reason why we have this particular clause.&nbsp; It is not to go and track a contractor or a canteen operator going into a particular building.&nbsp; That is not of interest to the Police.&nbsp; And if there is indeed a reason to go and find out about the personal conduct of a person, then by all means do so, so long as there is no security implication for this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no difficulty to get approval, because all&nbsp;one needs to do is to seek <p align=left>Column: 1370<p>approval from&nbsp;the licensing officer.&nbsp; The licensing officer will give the permission as quickly as possible, if there is a legitimate interest to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;The licensing officer will therefore have cognisance of it and that if there is going to be any trip up, then the&nbsp;case is already known to the licensing officer and the Police.&nbsp; Otherwise, there could be a lot of problems.&nbsp; I have known of cases,&nbsp;not of a Government leader or whatever, but some other establishments engaging private investigators doing surveillance on others, and that has come to the Police's notice because some members of the public reported it to the Police who&nbsp;have to spend resources&nbsp;to look into the matter.&nbsp; Then we found that there was a reason why that particular surveillance was done.&nbsp; That is the main reason why this is done.&nbsp; It is not to&nbsp;screen off the political leaders from surveillance by people.&nbsp; Singapore Ministers are all open and they go to the constituencies and&nbsp;attend functions.&nbsp; Of course, people do observe.&nbsp; But if&nbsp;one has a&nbsp;specific assignment to go and "case" a Minister, then there must be a reason why&nbsp;he wants to do that.&nbsp; And if the reason is legitimate, there is no reason why the approval will not be given.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will come back to Dr Teo Ho Pin's point about ensuring compliance.&nbsp; Indeed, the licensing officer, the SIRD, will have audit checks on the security guard agencies to ensure that they do the job well.&nbsp; And if they do not do the job well, then there is a demerit point system where they will be graded.&nbsp; If they do not pay CPF, for example -&nbsp;and this is also Ms Irene Ng's question -&nbsp;that will also count towards the grading system.&nbsp; And if the breach is serious, then the licence may be withdrawn.&nbsp; So there is indeed a serious business implication for companies that do not comply with the licensing conditions or the provisions in the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have dealt with most of the issues.</p></span></div>							<p align=left>Column: 1371<p>		<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

One point which he did not touch on is my point concerning the approval channels that the Police would need to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will they be consulting people outside the police organisation as such?&nbsp; Secondly, there was also the point on the amendment to the Miscellaneous Offences Act, which appears to now envisage&nbsp;that certain private security personnel will be allowed to carry truncheons and handcuffs.&nbsp; I have some concerns there because they only have citizen's powers and they are not as well trained as the police or auxiliary police.&nbsp; Are we running the risk of excessive force being used on the public?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Because it is not just security guards or private investigators or whichever category who are currently licensed to do so under this particular Act.&nbsp; There could be others who were given permission&nbsp;under other legislation.&nbsp; And that is why that particular provision is moved to the Miscellaneous Offences Act.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day, every month, we do see people bringing in such items from overseas, and it keeps our ICA very busy because as part of the security screening, ICA has&nbsp;to make sure that contrabands such as these are not brought in by unlicensed people.&nbsp; So, anyone who is caught carrying such items will be committing an offence and, therefore, he will be dealt with under the Miscellaneous Offences Act, rather than&nbsp;under the Private Security Industry Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On approval channels, the <p align=left>Column: 1372<p>licensing officer will have to decide on his own.&nbsp; He does not have to tell me.&nbsp; Why do I need to know what particular jobs individual investigators are being assigned?&nbsp; The licensing officer will decide on his own.&nbsp; It is only when the licensing officer decides that approval is not given to a particular agency or guard, then an appeal&nbsp;comes up.&nbsp; And the person being denied a permit or a licence can make an appeal to the Minister, and only then will the Ministry be informed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It <p align=left>Column: 1373<p>also advises&nbsp;the Ministry of Finance&nbsp;on corporate governance issues pertaining to listed companies.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CCDG has served its purpose well. In the area of corporate governance, it has laid down the foundation of a strong and robust corporate governance framework for listed companies. It is now timely for this function to be taken over by MAS and SGX, given the synergies with their role as market regulators of listed companies.&nbsp; This would help to ensure a consistent approach in prescribing mandatory requirements and best practices for listed companies.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in the area of accounting standards, the CCDG has done much to improve the efficiency and rigour of the accounting standards setting process for companies.&nbsp; The CCDG, however, has no authority to issue accounting standards for non-corporate entities such as societies and co-operatives, as it derives its authority from the Companies Act. These non-corporate entities have often been adopting the SFRS, even though they are not legally required to do so.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is not surprising as their auditors need to audit them against an acceptable accounting standards framework, which, by default, is the SFRS. This is not always satisfactory for these non-corporate entities as they find themselves having to comply with accounting standards that may not be suitable for their purposes since the SFRS were drawn up primarily for companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Consolidated accounting framework for private and people sector entities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, to address this gap, the Accounting Standards Bill provides for the creation of a well-represented council, which would be known as the Accounting Standards Council, or ASC for short.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1374<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts I and II of the Bill establish the ASC and set out its functions, constitution, as well as the procedures for its meetings and proceedings.&nbsp; Clause 3 establishes the functions of the ASC, namely, to prescribe accounting standards for companies and for any other entities like societies, charities and co-operatives. With its functions on corporate governance issues and company accounting standards taken over by the SGX/MAS and the ASC respectively, the CCDG will be dissolved. I would like to, at this moment,&nbsp;thank&nbsp;the Chairman and members of the CCDG for their significant achievements and contributions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill allows the Minister for Finance to appoint a Chairman and up to 15 members to the ASC.&nbsp; The ASC will comprise senior accounting professionals, regulators, preparers and users of financial information, among other stakeholders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III sets out the manner the ASC would go about setting accounting standards. Clause 9 of the Bill provides the objectives behind the accounting standards formulated by the ASC. The ASC would ensure that the accounting standards set are relevant to the entities they are applicable to, are readily understandable by both the preparers and users of financial information and can facilitate comparability.&nbsp; In addition, to ensure that stakeholders are fully aware of the accounting standards issued, the ASC is required, under clause 10 of the Bill, to publish a notice of the making of that accounting standard. It will also have to make available copies of it, and with all prior amendments, for inspection by members of the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In formulating the accounting standards for non-corporate sector entities, the ASC will consider the suitability of the proposed accounting standard to the entities concerned and will, if necessary, apply different <p align=left>Column: 1375<p>accounting requirements to different types of entities.&nbsp; The ASC is empowered to propose suitable modifications to existing SFRS to make them more appropriate and relevant for these entities, but&nbsp;without compromising the quality of the standards. In areas where there is presently no&nbsp;SFRS, the ASC may consider either issuing its own standards or adopting an alternative set of standards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This framework which consolidates the accounting standards setting authority for both corporate and non-corporate entities under one roof will ensure consistency in standards, facilitate comparison of accounts between different entities, and enhance the credibility and transparency of reporting. The ASC is responsible only for the formulation and promulgation of accounting standards.&nbsp; The monitoring and enforcement of compliance with accounting standards will remain the prerogative of the respective regulators, namely, ACRA for companies, Commissioner of Charities for charities, Registrar of Co-operatives for co-operatives and Registrar of Societies for societies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Accounting standards for charities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a charitable organisation may be set up as a company, a society or a trust, before registering with the Commissioner of Charities as a charity. While charities incorporated as companies are required by the Companies Act to comply with the SFRS, there is no such requirement for charities that are registered as societies or trusts. This inconsistent treatment creates an uneven situation where certain charities are subject to a more stringent disclosure regime owing to the legal vehicle they have adopted. This also makes it difficult to compare the financial health of, say, two charities which may be pursuing the same charitable objects, but are set up using different legal vehicles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1376<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this, the consequential amendments to the Companies Act and the Societies Act provide that once the accounting standards for charities have been formulated and promulgated, they will take precedence over accounting standards for companies and for societies. This means that in future, a charity, regardless of the legal vehicle it uses, will have to comply exclusively with the accounting standards for charities. This is in line with the policy objective of having accounting standards that are more appropriate and relevant to the purpose the entity is set up to pursue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This practice of having a separate set of accounting standards for charities is consistent with the practice in the UK. Under the ASC, the accounting standards for charities would continue to take reference from the SFRS and would be supplemented with specific requirements to meet the special accounting needs of charities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ASC would need some time to formulate the accounting standards for charities, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports would, in the meantime, conduct a holistic review of the Charities Act.&nbsp; Hence, the necessary consequential amendments to the Charities Act to make it mandatory for all charities to comply with the charities' accounting standards would be moved in Parliament at a later date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Accounting standards for statutory boards</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me move on to the accounting standards for statutory boards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill empowers the Accountant-General (AG) to establish accounting standards for statutory boards. This is, in effect,&nbsp;a formalisation of the current arrangement whereby MOF, through the Accountant-General's Department, would issue finance circulars to prescribe the accounting standards to be complied with by statutory boards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1377<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While statutory boards may share certain characteristics of corporations, there is a fundamental difference, which is that statutory boards do not have public shareholders and are directly accountable to Parliament.&nbsp; Hence, standards that are formulated based on the&nbsp;profit motive, which&nbsp;is of paramount concern to shareholders and creditors or donors, may not always be appropriate for statutory boards. Instead, the accounting standards for statutory boards would be driven by the three objectives of enhancing statutory boards' accountability to Parliament, strengthening transparency, and ensuring a better and more efficient stewardship of public assets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that this will not lead to a "cherry-picking" of accounting standards for statutory boards.&nbsp; Clause 11(2) of the Bill provides that the Accountant-General, in establishing the accounting standards, shall first take reference from the standards and interpretations issued by the ASC. The Accountant-General would modify or introduce new standards or guidelines only in areas where the SFRS is lacking or where the SFRS is providing insufficient guidance to statutory boards. An example of an area currently not clearly addressed by the SFRS, which might necessitate the intervention of the Accountant-General, is how assets of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) should be accounted for in the books of public sector agencies.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the creation of the ASC is a positive step towards ensuring that local accounting standards are of a consistent high quality. More importantly, the ASC will draw up standards that are customised to the circumstances of non-corporate entities, which would help them to provide a clearer link between their<p align=left>Column: 1378<p> objectives, activities and results to their stakeholders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.09 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment on the Accounting Standards Bill.&nbsp; I would like to declare my interest upfront.&nbsp; I am both a practising public accountant and also serve as a board member of a statutory body where I am presently the Chairman of the Audit Committee.&nbsp; Hence, my keen interest in the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to begin by applauding the Government for seeking to establish through this Bill an Accounting Standards Council, or ASC, whose main function will be to formulate accounting standards for companies and non-profit making entities. This is an improvement on the present arrangement as the role of the current standard setting body, the Council on Corporate Disclosure and Governance, or CCDG, does not extend to non-profit making entities such as charities and co-operative societies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Bill also has the objective of requiring statutory bodies to prepare their accounts and financial statements in accordance with accounting standards set, not by the proposed ASC but by the Accountant-General.&nbsp; I have several reservations about this proposal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, an accounting standard setting body must have some elements of independence, appropriate representation of different stakeholders' interests and be seen to follow due process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the office of the Accountant-General, no matter how conscientious and competent, meet these exacting criteria for a standard setting body?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1379<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the proposed ASC, which is likely to be made up of representatives from the private and public sectors, the accounting profession, academia and other stakeholder representatives, the Accountant-General is an arm of the Executive and would generally not be perceived as independent of statutory bodies.&nbsp; Indeed, some people would liken the Accountant-General to be the Government's CFO.&nbsp; Businesses do not set their own accounting rules for financial reporting to shareholders. Of course, their views are taken into consideration in the due process of issuance of new or amended accounting standards.&nbsp; However, they are never able to set their own rules.&nbsp; The governance and segregation of duties&nbsp;are paramount to public confidence and trust.&nbsp; So why should the practice in the public sector be any different?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason given in the explanatory statement to the Bill is that, unlike companies and other corporations, statutory bodies are accountable to Parliament, whose priorities and interests in the matter are distinctly different from ordinary stakeholders.&nbsp; While that may be so, when it comes to the adoption of appropriate accounting standards for statutory bodies, most MPs would, I am sure, be happy to rely on the judgment of an independent body of competent individuals following due process.&nbsp; A related point that I would like to make is that while statutory bodies are accountable to Parliament, they do have a number of other stakeholders such as their employees, customers, creditors and, in some cases, where they have tapped the financial markets, financial institutions. So, wherever possible, laws and regulations relating to statutory bodies should be&nbsp;transparent and consistent with the private sector.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I would like to deal with the issue of comparability.&nbsp; How do the proposals in this Bill compare with the practice in other countries?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1380<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in Australia and New Zealand, the same bodies set the accounting standards for both the private and public sectors.&nbsp; In the UK, it is different.&nbsp; The central government departments, agencies and other bodies prepare financial statements that are made available publicly in accordance with the Government Financial Reporting Manual issued by the Treasury.&nbsp; Although the standards are issued by the Treasury, which is part of the financial control function of the government, by law, the Financial Reporting Advisory Board, or FRAB, led by an independent Chairman, has a statutory role to ensure that any adaptations of, or departures from, the UK accounting standards for businesses and companies in the government accounting manual are justified and properly explained.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of FRAB consist of preparers, auditors, academia, accounting standard board members and economists.&nbsp; The FRAB issues yearly reports on its activities and recommended departures from the UK accounting standards.&nbsp; These reports are read at Parliament hearings and are available publicly.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be noted that the UK government will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards(IFRS) for its public sector entities from financial year 2008-2009, including publicly-funded initiatives and public-private partnerships.&nbsp; They took the time just to make sure that they were comfortable with it but they would now adopt it&nbsp;for PPPs.&nbsp; The FRAB is in the process of evaluating the adaptations from IFRS that are required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the international practice is very clear. Substantively, the same rules and due process apply to both the private and the public sectors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming back to Singapore, if the Government entrusts accounting standards setting for statutory bodies to fall<p align=left>Column: 1381<p> outside the jurisdiction of the proposed ASC, then like in the UK, an independent and robust process should be put in place to approve changes to accounting standards, specifically for statutory bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the UK, for example, although the Treasury has the power to issue its own accounting standards, it cannot depart from the established framework without endorsement from the FRAB, which is independent of the Treasury.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure that, as Members of Parliament, we would feel more comfortable knowing that the accounts of our public entities are being prepared based on Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the ASC and, if and when there is a departure,&nbsp;they have&nbsp;been reviewed and approved by an independent body, not just another group within the Ministry of Finance.&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, when it comes to governance, independence and due process must not only exist but also be seen to exist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, I would like to deal with the issue of due process and cost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain to all of you the due process of setting&nbsp;IFRS, which I appreciate many non-accountants among you may not be familiar with.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The use of IFRS as the basis of Singapore Financial Reporting Standards allows our companies to be benchmarked against international companies easily and, among other benefits, gives them better access to key capital markets.&nbsp; In fact, more than 100 countries, including Hong Kong, Australia and those in the European Union, are in the same position as Singapore.&nbsp; In the near future, the Asian powerhouse economies, China and India, will also do the same.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1382<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The due process of setting accounting standards by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, is fairly elaborate and requires considerable resources.&nbsp; The board members of the IASB have decorated financial reporting backgrounds, 12 out of 14 are full-time members.&nbsp; They are supported by a team of technical directors and managers.&nbsp; Before the issuance of a new or revised standard or interpretation, accounting issues are often discussed by the Board, their comments and decisions are recorded and reported publicly.&nbsp; Discussion papers and proposed draft standards are issued to all stakeholders for comments, roundtable discussions are held and, sometimes, field tests of the standards are conducted, all in the interest that the standards issued are of high quality and capable of practical implementation.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point, Sir, is that the due process, which is necessary, is also costly.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed ASC and its predecessor, the CCDG, in the past, had a form of due process in place for the adoption of IFRS as Singapore Financial Reporting Standards.&nbsp; Similarly, it is not unreasonable to expect some elements of independence and due process for setting accounting standards for statutory bodies if this is to be done by the Accountant-General and not the ASC.&nbsp; But how will the Accountant-General achieve this without considerable duplication and cost?&nbsp; Would it not be better to entrust all accounting standards setting to the ASC?</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, to recap, I have raised three main points regarding this Bill: the issue of governance and independence, comparability with other countries and cost.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would now ask the Government to consider two proposals to address these issues within the parameters set out in this Bill. Firstly,<p align=left>Column: 1383<p> accounting standards for statutory bodies should be based on those issued by the ASC with any departures clearly explained.&nbsp; The ASC's views on these departures should be obtained and submitted to the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament.&nbsp; This proposal would help to address the governance and independence issue as well as bring us closer to the international best practice.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, in the longer term, I would propose that the ASC be responsible for the issuance of accounting standards for all entities, including statutory bodies, as I can see this achieving better confidence, consistency and cost efficiency.&nbsp; This would also be in line with best practice elsewhere.&nbsp; I am proposing this to be in the longer term to allow the ASC more time to develop its role for the not-for-profit sector.&nbsp; Let the ASC start with charities and societies and move to statutory bodies in the next phase.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with these proposals in mind, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to thank Mr Gautam Banerjee for his support of the Bill and for his very well-argued comments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now respond specifically to his suggestions relating to the setting of accounting standards for the statutory boards.&nbsp; The Member has actually asked that departures from IFRS be clearly explained and submitted to the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament.&nbsp; This may not actually be appropriate as the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament is non-executive in nature and it does not actually have executive powers vested in it.&nbsp; Currently, the Public Accounts Committee has its remit revolving around the observations that are contained in the <p align=left>Column: 1384<p>Auditor-General's Report.&nbsp; But having said that, it does not stop the Public Accounts Committee from raising any issues or questions that they may have regarding accounting standards if it wants to or when it needs to.&nbsp; It is free to do so, to seek clarification on how an accounting standard is applied or why there is a deviation from international accounting standards.&nbsp; And for that matter, it does not stop any Member of Parliament in this House to raise any questions that he or she may have pertaining to not just accounting standards but also on any matter of statutory boards because that represents the greatest extent of the kind of check and balance that we have for the statutory boards.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his suggestion and reservation about whether the ASC should be responsible for the issuance of accounting standards for all entities, including the statutory boards, let me just provide the following points by way of providing assurance regarding the need to benchmark against international standards as well as the due process.&nbsp; Firstly, if I may reiterate, clause 11(2) has very specifically stated that the Accountant-General will take reference from or have regard for the accounting standards that are established by the ASC.&nbsp; So, as a default, that will be the starting point.&nbsp; The IFRS will be the starting point.&nbsp; In other words, there will be no cherry picking.&nbsp; They begin with that set of accounting standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wish to inform the Member that the Accountant-General will be assisted and advised by a committee with independent members, with representatives from the Auditor-General's Office, the statutory boards, the academic community and the public accounting firms.&nbsp; So there is a broad representation of membership.&nbsp; This is actually in substance not very different from what the UK is practising where the Treasury<p align=left>Column: 1385<p> prepares the standards and submits it to the Advisory Committee for consultation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third point is that there are areas, as I have mentioned in my Second Reading speech, where the SFRS does not provide sufficient guidance for statutory boards, for example, how the assets of PPPs should be accounted for, and that is why there should be this special purview accorded to the Accountant-General.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if I may just summarise, in reference to the other comments that Mr Banerjee has also made. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance accountability, therefore, adopting standards that are appropriate to our circumstances, in a sustainable manner, is most crucial.&nbsp; The Government will continue to emphasise substance over form.&nbsp; We would have to choose the form that is appropriate to us, but the substance remains the same as that being practised in most of the other jurisdictions.&nbsp; Currently, we are also very much guided by the type of resources that we have for the ASC to carry out its mission.&nbsp; It is not appropriate to enlarge the ASC's ambit at this juncture to include statutory boards or other entities not specifically mentioned in clause 3.&nbsp; The Council, as it is, with 16 members, including the Chairman, is already quite big, and enlarging its ambit would require the inclusion of even more members.&nbsp; It will also cause the Council to lose its focus and, worse still, slow down the accounting setting process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, the Government will review this arrangement two years down the road to see whether there are benefits to widening the ASC's mandate to include statutory boards and other entities as well as whether the ASC should be composed differently.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, the Bill before this House seeks to amend the CPF Act.&nbsp; There are four large groupings.&nbsp; Let me take the House through each of these broad categories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, amendments are introduced to strengthen the administration of the Act to clarify certain existing policies, basically, housekeeping and tidying up various aspects.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Bill expands the CPF Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme.&nbsp; This will provide more ways for family members to support one another financially.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1387<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the&nbsp;amendments will facilitate a smooth and equitable distribution of CPF monies pursuant to a Court Order division of matrimonial assets in a divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, amendments are introduced to deter manipulative transactions under the CPF Investment Scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Measures to strengthen the administration of the Act and to clarify certain existing policies</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 extends the powers of CPF inspectors to inspect and to take possession of documents in all mediums, including digital and electronic forms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 4 gives the Board the exclusive right to use any symbol or representation device by the Board and makes it an offence for any person to use the symbol or representation that resembles the CPF symbol or representation in a manner that is likely to be deceptive or cause confusion.&nbsp; It provides for a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 makes clear that transfers from a member's savings in the Ordinary Account (OA) and Savings Account (SA) to the Medisave account, and deductions for Home Protection Scheme (HPS) premiums are permitted withdrawals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 7(c)(d) and (e) extends the pledging of HDB flats in lieu of retaining the full Minimum Sum to properties sold by approved developers which include Design, Build and Sell Scheme flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 10 makes clear that the amount of Ordinary Account&nbsp;savings that a member can transfer to his Special Account&nbsp;is the difference between the prescribed amount and the sum of the cash amount in his Special Account and any amount he may have withdrawn under the CPF Investment Scheme - SA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1388<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 17 empowers the Board to make rules regarding nominations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Expansion of Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as our Prime Minister has said, our population is fast ageing. &nbsp;The proportion of Singaporeans aged 65 and above is expected to grow from 8% in 2005 to 19% in 2030.&nbsp; Correspondingly, retirement and healthcare needs will also increase. &nbsp;As the family unit remains the primary social support structure for Singaporeans, the amendments to expand the Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme will provide more ways for family members to take care of and help one another financially.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate this, firstly, we will increase the top-up limit to the prevailing Minimum Sum.&nbsp; At present, under the current Act, top-ups are limited to the Minimum Sum specific to the cohort of the recipient. &nbsp;For example, if the member had turned 55 in 1987, this would only be $30,000.&nbsp; If someone wanted to top up his account, he could only top up to $30,000.&nbsp; What we are doing now is to change&nbsp;that so that the top-up can be to the&nbsp;prevailing Minimum Sum which is&nbsp;$99,600 today.&nbsp; Thus, members can increase top-ups to recipients so that their family members will receive a regular income over a longer period.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will expand the list of recipients.&nbsp; Currently, members can only top up their grandparents' Retirement Accounts using cash but not CPF funds.&nbsp; We will now allow grandchildren to transfer funds from their CPF Ordinary Account to their grandparents' Retirement Accounts, subject to both meeting the top-up criteria.&nbsp; There are instances, because people are growing older, where the grandchildren are financially well-off and they can help support their grandparents.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help those who are single and who do not have children to build up their<p align=left>Column: 1389<p> retirement savings, we will also now allow, as a new initiative, members to top up their siblings' Retirement Accounts with savings from their own CPF accounts, or in cash.&nbsp; As announced by the Ministry of Finance previously, a tax relief for cash top-ups of up to $7,000 a year will be given if the sibling receiving the top-up earns not more than $2,000 a year and is 55 years old or above.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we will allow top-ups to spouses and siblings below the age of 55 using CPF or cash.&nbsp; Previously, it was only above 55.&nbsp; We are now allowing below the age of 55.&nbsp; The top-ups can be made into members' Special Accounts (SA). &nbsp;In keeping with the intent of the scheme to build up the CPF of recipients for long term needs, the top-up monies can only be used to provide a steady income stream during the recipients' retirement, and cannot be withdrawn as a lump sum.&nbsp; In other words, since we allow them to top-up below 55, at 55, they may be able to withdraw some.&nbsp; But because this is meant to provide a steady stream of income, you cannot remove it or take it out at age 55 as a lump sum.&nbsp; In the event of the recipient's demise, any remaining balance from the top-up sum will revert to the donor.&nbsp; This is an existing clause and I am just reiterating it as an existing practice so that it actually goes back to the donor rather than to the estate.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 in the Bill will enable the topping-up for grandparents using CPF funds as well as the expansion of the list of recipients to siblings above and below age 55, and spouses below age 55.&nbsp; The increase in the top-up limit from the cohort Minimum Sum to the prevailing Minimum Sum will be done by way of an amendment to the CPF regulations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6, 7, 9, 11 and 12 make consequential amendments to the Act<p align=left>Column: 1390<p> arising from this policy.&nbsp; Clause 6 of the Bill sets the limit of cash top-ups to a recipient's SA at the recipient's Voluntary Contribution (VC) limit.&nbsp; Consistent with top-up limits for family members, clause 9 makes it possible to allow members to top up their own Retirement Account with their Ordinary Account or Special Account monies up to the prevailing Minimum Sum.&nbsp; As in the current Act, clauses 7, 11 and 12 enable the transfer of the balance of any unused top-up monies to the donor's CPF account on the death of the recipient.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other related amendments are clauses 2, 5 and 25.&nbsp; Clause 2 makes technical amendments to the definitions of "minimum sum" and "retirement account", while clause 5 facilitates the transfer of top-ups received before age 55 from the recipient's Special Account to his Retirement Account when he reaches 55.&nbsp; Clause 25 of the Bill enables the making of Regulations for top-ups to the SA for siblings and spouses who are below the age of 55.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes to the top-up scheme will take effect from 1st October 2007, except for top-ups to members below the age of 55, which will take effect from 1st January 2008.&nbsp; These are just some technical adjustments and software changes that we have to make.</p><p><br><I>Smooth and equitable division of CPF monies in matrimonial proceedings</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this&nbsp;set of amendments&nbsp;is intended to help divorcing couples achieve a smooth and equitable division of CPF assets acquired during a marriage.&nbsp; Subsequent changes that I have&nbsp;described will be&nbsp;effected in terms of a male CPF member and a female ex-spouse.&nbsp; But the law is quite gender-neutral and the laws also&nbsp;equally apply&nbsp;to a female CPF member and if the male was an&nbsp;ex-spouse.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1391<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF savings form part of matrimonial assets that are governed by the Women's Charter which provides powers to the courts to divide matrimonial assets.&nbsp; But under the existing laws, the current CPF Act, a court order to divide a member's CPF money between him and his ex-spouse is enforced only when the member is eligible to withdraw his CPF and has set aside his Minimum Sum (MS) and Medisave Minimum Sum (MMS).&nbsp; So there are two conditions under the current Act.&nbsp; You can only withdraw when you are allowed to withdraw and only after you have set aside the Minimum Sum and Medisave Minimum Sum.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">4.55 pm</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current practice may be inequitable to the ex-spouse for two reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the ex-spouse's access to these monies is delayed till the member is eligible to withdraw his CPF.&nbsp; In other words, even if the court makes a division and the member is, say, 40 years old, the ex-spouse can only take the money when that member reaches&nbsp;55.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the member's retirement needs take priority over that of the ex-spouse, as only the balance of funds after the member has set aside the prevailing CPF Minimum Sum and the Medisave Minimum Sum when he turns 55 is available for distribution to the ex-spouse.&nbsp; The Minimum Sum and Medisave Minimum Sum at the point of withdrawal in the future may also be substantially different from that when the court order was made.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the new principle underlying these amendments is that the CPF Act should facilitate the division of <p align=left>Column: 1392<p>matrimonial assets under the Women's Charter, provided there is no leakage from the CPF system.&nbsp; But between members, if both members are within the CPF system, I consider it no leakage, and we can facilitate the rules under the Women's Charter.&nbsp; Hence, amendments will be made to, firstly, allow an immediate transfer of CPF monies to the ex-spouse's CPF account, if the ex-spouse is a citizen or Permanent Resident (PR).&nbsp; This shall be done without the Minimum Sum or Medisave Minimum Sum first having to be set aside once the court has ordered a distribution of CPF monies in a divorce.&nbsp; The CPF money to be distributed will be channelled to the ex-spouses' CPF accounts according to the accounts they originally resided in.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ex-spouse is not a citizen or a PR, immediate transfer of CPF monies is not allowed. &nbsp;Instead, the court can order the Board to pay the spouse when the member becomes eligible to withdraw his CPF monies.&nbsp; The member will not be required to set aside the Minimum Sum and Medisave Minimum Sum before the ex-spouse can receive her entitled share.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the amendments will also facilitate the immediate transfer of immovable property to the ex-spouse, if the ex-spouse is a citizen or a PR.&nbsp; Transfer in this context would refer to a transaction where there is no cash consideration at fair market value other than the refund of CPF monies withdrawn for the purchase of the property.&nbsp; In such an instance, the CPF Act currently requires the requisite CPF refunds to be made to the member's CPF account before the transfer can take place so that there is no leakage of CPF monies.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, with these amendments, the court will have the option of ordering the member to transfer the property to the ex-spouse without all or even any of the refunds being made to the CPF member's CPF account first,<p align=left>Column: 1393<p> provided that a charge is placed to secure the refund of such CPF monies into the ex-spouse's CPF account should she sell the property later.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;even if the member who is a male now wants the property to be transferred to the ex-spouse, the current CPF Act does not allow that.&nbsp; The court does not have the ability.&nbsp; It says, "You will have to refund all the money that you have used to buy this house even if you have agreed to."&nbsp; What we are doing now is to amend it to say you can transfer&nbsp;the house, but we place a charge on the amount that was used to buy that house so that when she sells it later, that&nbsp;money is refunded back into the member's account.&nbsp; In effect, the CPF used by the member, and the accrued interest on that CPF, will be refunded to the ex-spouse's account in the event the property is sold.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the amendments will also enable the member's CPF investments to be transferred to or be liquidated to allow the ex-spouse immediate access to CPF assets which she is entitled to.&nbsp; The transfer of CPF investments is only allowed for an ex-spouse who is a citizen or a PR.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 of the Bill inserts new sections 27A to 27I to facilitate the smooth and equitable distribution of CPF monies arising from the division of matrimonial assets.&nbsp; In particular, section 27B provides for the immediate transfer of CPF monies to the CPF account of the ex-spouse. &nbsp;Sections 27C to 27F provide for the immediate transfer of property to the ex-spouse.&nbsp; Section 27G provides for the immediate transfer of CPF investments to the ex-spouse.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other related amendments are clauses 5, 6, 16 and 19.&nbsp; Clause 5 facilitates the transfers made under section 27B.&nbsp; Clause 6 exempts contributions to the ex-spouse's CPF account made under <p align=left>Column: 1394<p>sections 27B to 27H as a result of division of matrimonial assets from counting towards the Voluntary Contribution limit. Clause 16 amends section 24, which provides for the protection of CPF monies and investments from member's creditors, to make it subject to sections 27B to 27H.&nbsp; Clause 19 makes consequential amendments to give priority to transfers of CPF monies in relation to matrimonial division under section 27B over the deduction of Home Protection Scheme&nbsp;premium from the member's CPF account.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes that I have announced pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets will apply to court orders made on and after 1st October 2007.&nbsp; It is not retrospective.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Deter manipulative transactions under CPF Investment Scheme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The last set of amendments, Sir, is to deter manipulative transactions under the CPF Investment Scheme. The intent of the CPF Investment Scheme is to provide members investment options to enhance their&nbsp;savings for retirement.&nbsp; But, sometimes, manipulative transactions that lead to the leakage of CPF savings have been reported and indeed should be prohibited.&nbsp; So these amendments will strengthen the CPF Act to deter such manipulative transactions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 20 of the Bill creates a new offence for any person to manipulate any CPF Investment Scheme transactions. Clause 21 enables the courts, upon a member's conviction&nbsp;in connection with the investment, to order the refund or transfer of any shortfall to the member's CPF account caused by manipulated trades.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These changes will take effect from 1st October 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1395<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.01 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, any amendment to the CPF Act which seeks to help Singaporeans increase their retirement savings is timely and should be supported.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when we are facing challenges from an ageing society, increased life expectancy and rising cost of living, ensuring that Singaporeans have adequate savings for retirement is a critical challenge that we must overcome.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment&nbsp;in this Bill that will, amongst others, allow more Singaporeans to top up the CPF accounts of their family members, is therefore particularly welcome.&nbsp; This area will be the focus of my speech.&nbsp; I will leave the proposed amendments relating to matrimonial assets to Mdm Halimah and other female counterparts to respond.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; While I support the amendments, I have some concerns to raise. Sir, statistics have shown that many Singaporeans are facing problems&nbsp;accumulating the&nbsp;Minimum Sum in their CPF accounts.&nbsp; While the expansion of the CPF topping-up scheme will open the doors for more family members to make contributions to the CPF accounts of their loved ones, I am especially concerned about low-income elderly workers who are destitute or are being taken care of by people who are or may not be their immediate family members.&nbsp; While I agree that the family unit is the primary social support structure for Singaporeans, I feel that the definition of "family" should be broadened to include caretakers of the elderly member as this may,&nbsp;at times, not be someone from the member's immediate family.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As healthcare costs continue to rise, I would also like to suggest that the top-up<p align=left>Column: 1396<p> scheme be extended to the Medisave accounts of parents, grandparents and siblings of the contributor. This will ensure that CPF members have sufficient amounts in their Medisave accounts for hospitalisation and healthcare needs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to broader issues related to the CPF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Prime Minister recently announced some initiatives to help Singaporeans save more and stretch their retirement savings longer. These changes are welcome as they will help boost Singaporeans' CPF savings.&nbsp; We have to move quickly and introduce changes that will help our society face the challenges of an ageing population before it is too late. I feel that there is a general understanding on the need for these changes but, at the same time, there is a feeling of an overcast&nbsp;sky as many are worried that they will have to work longer and, yet, at the end of the day, not have a high quality of life towards the end of their lives.&nbsp; Gone are the romantic illusions of the golden years of retirement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation is even bleaker&nbsp;for lower-income families who may be living hand-to-mouth and may be so caught up in making ends meet day-to-day that thinking about the future and planning for retirement is something that is totally beyond them. There is therefore an urgent need to think of more ways of helping Singaporeans&nbsp;boost their CPF savings. A <I>Straits Times'</I> survey recently reported that seven out of 10 Singaporeans feel that they will not have enough retirement savings.&nbsp; With half of those who are still working, having $45,000 or less in their CPF accounts, I still feel that the changes are not enough to ensure that Singaporeans will have sufficient savings for their retirement needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bigger changes must be thought through and made and new ways have to be explored to help Singaporeans build<p align=left>Column: 1397<p> stronger retirement nests. The 1%&nbsp;increase in CPF rates announced by the Prime Minister brings much cheer to Singaporeans but, at the same time, many are worried that pegging the interest rates to bonds may mean volatility as it follows the economic cycles, even though the risks are lower compared to the stock market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we should find ways to help Singaporeans make more informed choices when they invest their CPF savings. Statistics tell us that about 45% of members who sold their&nbsp;investments or&nbsp;CPFIS made losses.&nbsp; 32% made equal to or less than the 2.5% returns for the Ordinary Account and only 23% made gains.&nbsp; Perhaps, the CPF Board could team up with appropriate partners to have public education campaigns to educate Singaporeans on investing an investment judiciously or, at least, to make better calculated risks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving on,&nbsp;some Singaporeans have suggested that the CPF Board buy shares of Temasek Holdings which will fetch higher returns for CPF members.&nbsp; I believe this suggestion is worth looking into, considering that Temasek Holdings is after all not only a Government investment arm, but has also proven to bring about attractive returns on its diversified investments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other way of boosting Singaporeans' savings is to enhance the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS).&nbsp; This is an area that I have proposed several times to be looked into but, so far, the Government has been non-committal in reviewing the current Scheme.&nbsp; In addition to proposals&nbsp;I had made in past speeches, I would like to also propose the following changes to make the SRS more attractive to CPF members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently, members can make contributions to the SRS only up to age <p align=left>Column: 1398<p>62.&nbsp; But with policy changes to make more Singaporeans remain employable beyond 62, this age cap should be reviewed.&nbsp; This review can, in fact, be done without having to have legislative changes for the retirement age to be pushed further beyond 62 years old. Apart from this, the CPF Board should also consider reducing the tax on 50% of the withdrawn amount of savings upon retirement, especially if the withdrawn sums are used for critical needs, such as medical expenditure.&nbsp;At the same time, the contribution cap of 15% could also be increased to encourage more Singaporeans to save and accumulate higher retirement savings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond making SRS attractive to CPF members, employers could also be given an option to contribute to their workers' SRS accounts, like what is being done in the United States for the US individual retirement arrangement, or the IRA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage employers to do so, corporate tax benefits could be offered based on the amount they contribute.&nbsp; The CPF Board should have joint efforts with financial institutions to educate the public on the SRS to generate greater public awareness of this Scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of annuities, increasing life expectancy makes it necessary for Singaporeans to look beyond their CPF pay-outs which can only last 20 years. While there is a general understanding on the need of having lifelong funds due to an increase in life expectancy, there is this worry at the back of some people's minds that if they die young, the money invested in the tail-end annuity will not be returned to the family. Sir, rather than making buying annuities compulsory, the CPF Board could consider offering another option to those who prefer to extend their CPF pay-out period from 20 to, perhaps,&nbsp;30 years.&nbsp; This will cater to Singaporeans who do not mind getting less after spreading their savings over a longer<p align=left>Column: 1399<p> period of time, but wish to have the balance returned to their accounts or families upon death.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another factor to consider is to extend an opt-out scheme for people with serious illnesses from having to take up an annuity as they may need the higher regular monthly pay-outs for their immediate needs and may not live beyond 85.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I believe there is still a lack of understanding amongst Singaporeans on how critical it is for them to have adequate savings for retirement.&nbsp; Some may not understand the rationale for delaying the drawdown period and many more may not be able to appreciate the need of annuities.&nbsp; There is a critical and urgent need to step up public education efforts and outreach has to be done in different languages to ensure that no one gets left out.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.11 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. &nbsp;I would like to single out two particular amendments, which are pro-family and which also strengthen support for our ageing population, for mention.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first set of amendments, CPF members can now use their CPF funds to top up not only the retirement accounts of their parents and spouses, but also that of their grandparents and siblings. The old law is restrictive as it allows a member to transfer money from his account only if he is topping up the retirement accounts of his parents or spouse but not if he is topping up the retirement account of a grandparent or sibling.&nbsp; To top up the retirement account of a grandparent, he has to use cash which is rather prohibitive.&nbsp; The old law also does not allow a CPF member&nbsp;to top up the retirement account of a sibling.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1400<p> This had made it difficult for those who want to provide for the needs of older siblings, particularly women who have little retirement savings of their own and who may not have any family or children to support them. So, I applaud this change which is pro-family and which will help to enhance the retirement security of older Singaporeans who are unable to provide for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also applaud the change under Part IIIA on division of fund-related assets in matrimonial proceedings. This amendment is progressive and will provide better protection for our women and children in divorce proceedings. This amendment was the result of a court decision in the 1995 case of <I>CPF Board v Lau Eng Mui</I> where the court ruled that CPF forms part of the matrimonial assets that&nbsp;are available for distribution in divorce proceedings. But there was no provision in the CPF Act which allows the Board to allow for an immediate transfer of the CPF funds of the&nbsp;CPF member to the&nbsp;CPF account of his ex-wife and&nbsp;she has to wait until he reaches 55 years old and even then, she will only get the amount ordered by the court after the Board has set aside the Minimum Sums for retirement and Medisave accounts of the member. In the end, there may be very little that the ex-wife receives despite the court order and the ex-wife and her children suffer grave hardship. In the event that the court orders the transfer of the matrimonial property to the ex-wife, there is also a problem. The ex-wife has to refund the ex-husband's CPF monies first before the property can be transferred to her as the Board has no powers to allow a transfer if this is not done. Again, this causes hardship, as the ex-wife usually does not have the means to reimburse her ex-husband's CPF monies. Hence, the amendment to the Act will allow the CPF Board, upon the order of the court, to transfer the funds immediately and the ex-wife does not have to refund the member's CPF monies <p align=left>Column: 1401<p>before the flat can be transferred to her, provided that if she sells the flat, then she has to transfer the amount to her own CPF account. Again, this is a pro-family policy and will help to alleviate the hardship caused to many women and children in divorces who would otherwise be deprived of a roof over their heads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, I have three issues to raise and seek the Minister's response&nbsp;to them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, currently, a member is not allowed to transfer his CPF savings to top up the Medisave account of his family members. This is a point referred to by Dr Ahmad Magad.&nbsp; In view of the greater flexibility allowed to CPF members to top up the retirement accounts of their family members such as the grandparents, parents, spouse or siblings, allowing them to also top up the Medisave accounts of their family members should be a logical and necessary extension.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many older Singaporeans, especially women, do not have sufficient Medisave savings to last them for life, which is even more critical now since our life expectancy is about 80 years old.&nbsp; So, I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry could consider allowing CPF members to top up the Medisave accounts of their grandparents, parents, spouses and siblings.&nbsp; This is also one way for us to address the problem of many Singaporeans who are not covered under MediShield, a large number of whom are women.&nbsp; If there&nbsp;are no Medisave savings for them, then they will not have MediShield coverage, because MediShield coverage is automatic so long as there is Medisave savings.&nbsp; So there are compelling reasons why we should allow CPF members to use their CPF funds to top up the Medisave accounts of their family members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point is on the current age restriction for coverage under the Home<p align=left>Column: 1402<p> Protection Insurance Scheme.&nbsp; Only those who are below 65 years of age are covered under the Home Protection Insurance Scheme, which discharges a member from liability to pay for his housing loan upon the death or incapacity of the member during the insured period.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an important scheme that protects the homes of CPF members in the event of the death of a breadwinner or major contributor to the family income.&nbsp; But the protection accorded only to those below 65 years of age is unrealistic, as people are now marrying later and living longer and therefore take a longer time to pay off their housing loan.&nbsp; I have seen residents who are in their 50s with young children, and if the coverage stops at 65, their family would suffer if they are incapacitated or die and they do not have a roof over their heads, especially if they are the sole breadwinners.&nbsp; As the Prime Minister had pointed out in his National Day Rally speech, we can now expect to live up to 80 years old and therefore need to provide for all our needs longer.&nbsp; It is opportune, in my view, in&nbsp;view of the current discussion of raising the CPF Minimum Sum draw-down age and the need to work longer to remove this restriction.&nbsp; The 65 years age limit was set when our retirement age was 62 years.&nbsp; Now that we are setting a higher retirement age, the Ministry should seriously consider raising this age limit, and I urge the Minister to look into this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point is on the need to educate CPF members on the intricate details of the CPF Act and the various schemes available to them.&nbsp; For example, with this amendment, CPF members can now top up the retirement accounts of their family members.&nbsp; If there is no campaign to educate them and raise their awareness, I fear that the take up rate for this scheme will be very low and we will not achieve our objective, which is to enhance the retirement security of those who are unable to provide for themselves.&nbsp; I would therefore like to suggest that the <p align=left>Column: 1403<p>CPF Board launch a campaign to educate CPF members on the various schemes that are now available and how they or their family can benefit from them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, although this is not the subject of the amendments that we are discussing today, I agree that the recent changes announced by the Prime Minister at the National Day Rally will, to some extent, address the concerns of Singaporeans.&nbsp; The 1% increase in the CPF return is greatly welcomed.&nbsp; But most Singaporeans also feel that the most important consideration is whether or not they are able to continue working, particularly for those who have reached the age of 62 years.&nbsp; If they can continue to work, the 1% increase is certainly a great boost, and the higher Minimum Sum draw-down age is not a major concern.&nbsp; Hence, I think we need to work together very closely to address this concern of Singaporeans, particularly those of 62 years and above, over availability and access to jobs.&nbsp; In the NTUC, we have been working very closely with our social partners and we have worked with more than 200 companies to place 3,080 workers above the age of 62 in jobs.&nbsp; But we certainly need to do a lot more, as we can see that the numbers of those who are reaching this age is rapidly increasing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Bill and I look forward to the debate in September on the other amendments.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

First, I applaud the amendment to section 18.&nbsp; This amendment will add greater flexibility to CPF members who wish to support their aged parents, <p align=left>Column: 1404<p>grandparents and siblings, and provide greater voluntary support for the aged.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as mentioned by the Minister, our population is fast greying.&nbsp; In fact, according to a <I>Straits Times'</I> report last Friday, the dependency ratio will grow from&nbsp;nine economically active persons supporting one older person over 65 years old today to 3:1 by 2030.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this amendment will help Singaporeans take personal responsibility for caring for their loved ones in their sunset years.&nbsp; It is not unnecessarily onerous, as the member will have any outstanding funds credited back to his account upon the death of those loved ones to whom he has made contributions.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also provides greater flexibility for CPF members to transfer part of their savings to the Special Accounts of those who have not yet reached 55 years of age.&nbsp; Like my colleague, Mdm Halimah, before me, I would also like to ask whether top-ups for Medisave account of family members&nbsp;are included.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government has always championed the development of the family as our basic social unit. This amendment will go a long way towards strengthening of the institution of the family.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also applaud amendments to sections 18A and 18B, which allow a member to transfer funds from his Ordinary Account to his retirement account. These new provisions will enable a CPF member to plan and manage his retirement financing needs more proactively and at an earlier stage.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with reference to Part IIIA, section 27B, on order of court for transfer or payment of money standing to the credit of a member, I applaud the amendment to facilitate transfer of property to the ex-spouse.&nbsp; At the meet-the-people sessions,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1405<p>MPs often have to grapple with the plight of ex-spouses who have no immediate means to take over or sell the property because of the need to refund the CPF used for the purchase of&nbsp;common property before the divorce.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am informed through the briefing notes from the Ministry of Manpower relating to these amendments that the new amendments will allow a court order to effect an immediate transfer of a member's CPF monies to the CPF account of his or her ex-spouse.&nbsp; This, according to the notes, will be done without the Minimum Sum and Medisave Minimum Sum first having to be set aside.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I cannot find mention of this in the amendments tabled.&nbsp; I therefore seek confirmation that this is indeed the intent of the new Part IIIA of this Bill.&nbsp; If this were so, then I fear we are getting into dangerous waters.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first reiterate that I am all in support of the Women's Charter, and for the protection of the rights of all parties in divorce proceedings.&nbsp; By all means, we must give ex-spouses what is due to them from the members' Ordinary Accounts.&nbsp; However, we must constantly remind ourselves of the intent of the CPF Act. The CPF is intended as a form of savings for its members, and especially to create a nest egg to sustain members through their retirement years. As the Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech underlines, retirement and ageing will become major issues in the years to come.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPF Act has relentlessly protected this right all these years, some would say more aggressively than is necessary. &nbsp;But such protection of the Minimum Sum and Medisave Minimum Sum will become all the more critical as members reach retirement age.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore caution against any attempt, even by a court of law, to have <p align=left>Column: 1406<p>funds in these accounts touched for purposes other than which they were designed for.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with reference to section 58A on offences relating to investment, the inclusion of this new section will give the CPF Board more teeth to prosecute any member and/or third parties who willfully defraud the Board into releasing members' funds through the manipulation of the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS).</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see this amendment as both proactive and preventive.&nbsp; Given the tight conditions on the use of CPF funds today, and the extended withdrawal age and withdrawal limits to come, there will no doubt be creative attempts to effect premature withdrawals illegally.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPF Investment Scheme&nbsp;is a convenient conduit for such attempts.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether there are&nbsp;comprehensive measures in place to ensure we plug any loopholes and provide punitive measures against any attempt to defraud the Board.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, like my colleague before me, I am also in agreement that CPF can be very complex for the layman to understand.&nbsp; Even the CPF website does not provide easy access to the basics of CPF.&nbsp; The concern is how are the less educated and those who are unable to read be able to understand the intricacies of CPF.&nbsp; Perhaps, we could organise&nbsp;more roadshows in the heartlands to educate the people, at least, inform them about the exact workings of the CPF and their benefits and rights, especially with regard to situations where they can withdraw their CPF savings and what CPF can be used for.&nbsp; In fact, most complaints relate to having money being locked up in the CPF, making it tough to make ends meet in times of severe illnesses or not being able to access the money despite having a terminal illness.&nbsp; But we know that this is not true.&nbsp; The current CPF Act provides <p align=left>Column: 1407<p>for withdrawal in such circumstances.&nbsp; Therefore, more support for CPF policies can be garnered if people truly understand what CPF is about and how it benefits them.&nbsp; How can the Minister look into ways to better reach out to the general public?</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I support the amendments&nbsp;in the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.25 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa:</B> Sir, I rise to support the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I would like to address the issue of expanding the Minimum Sum topping-up scheme.&nbsp; I support the idea of allowing CPF members to top up the accounts of their grandparents and siblings.&nbsp; This is consistent with the value system that we have been promoting where family is the next line of support.&nbsp; This amendment is also timely, as the CPF Minimum Sum will be increased from $99,600 in 2007 to $120,000 in 2013.&nbsp; This is clearly a significant increase, especially for members from the lower income group.&nbsp; But truth be told, how many CPF members or their families will do that?&nbsp; Most of us help our family members by giving them cash outright.&nbsp; Neither the giver nor the recipient would be keen to put that money away in a CPF account.&nbsp; It is far more convenient and accessible in a bank account.&nbsp; For those who plan ahead, they will purchase insurance policies for their loved ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while the revised CPF rates are looking more attractive for some amounts and still unsure for the balance, I think we need to offer greater incentives, either in the form of tax benefits or higher interest returns, for this scheme to be utilised more widely.&nbsp; I have a few suggestions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the tax benefit for cash top-ups.&nbsp; Like it or not, tax can be the most <p align=left>Column: 1408<p>direct and effective way to shape behaviour.&nbsp; Currently, members making cash top-ups under the CPF Minimum Sum topping-up scheme will enjoy tax relief of up to $7,000 per calendar year.&nbsp; In view of the increase in the Minimum Sum as well as to further encourage such cash top-ups, may I suggest to the Minister to not only extend this tax relief to the expanded scheme but also increase the tax relief beyond the $7,000 cap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way the Ministry can look at is to use the contribution cap for the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) as a reference.&nbsp; The SRS contributions cap is determined by multiplying the appropriate SRS contribution rate and the absolute income base.&nbsp; For members who have not made contributions to SRS and hence have not yet enjoyed the tax relief, we should extend this full quantum of tax benefit to them as well when they top up their family member's Retirement Account or Special Account.&nbsp; These top-ups are in line with SRS' objective, which is to encourage Singaporeans to save more for their old age by means of voluntary contribution, even though it is not for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the number of such CPF top-ups&nbsp;is low.&nbsp; Perhaps, the current tax reliefs are just not attractive enough to get members to use the CPF as a vehicle to render support to one another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I also urge the Ministry to explore additional forms of benefits or incentives for members to use funds from their CPF accounts to top up their family members' Retirement Accounts or Special Accounts.&nbsp; I understand that members</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

However, to get members to take the next step of topping up their family members' accounts so as to strengthen their financial security during retirement, we not only need education but also direct incentives. I like the D-bonus and V-bonus<p align=left>Column: 1409<p> announced by PM during the National Day Rally.&nbsp; Perhaps, we could consider a&nbsp;T-bonus, which is a Top-Up bonus, to encourage family members to help their less well-off relatives to enhance their retirement savings.&nbsp; It may work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, I hope that the Ministry can also look at lowering the 1.5 times prevailing Minimum Sum amount before such top-ups are allowed. Currently, to top up your family members' CPF Minimum Sum using CPF, your net balances in both the Ordinary and Special Accounts must be more than 1.5 times the prevailing Minimum Sum. The balance above that can then be used for the top-ups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This could also be another reason why the numbers of top-ups are low. Often, members would have a significant portion of their CPF amount used for the purchase of their property. As such, to have another net balance in the CPF account of more than the 1.5 times the prevailing Minimum Sum may be a challenge to most members. May I also suggest that CPF takes into account the amount of CPF funds used for the purchase of property in computing the amounts that are available for the top-ups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do have&nbsp;one comment on the&nbsp;amendments concerning the division of CPF assets in matrimonial proceedings. I welcome the amendments.&nbsp; Presently, a court order to divide a member's CPF money between the member and the ex-spouse, in most cases, the woman, is enforced only when he is eligible to withdraw his CPF when he turns 55, and has set aside both his Minimum Sums.&nbsp; However, not every case of matrimonial asset division involves the distribution of CPF monies. So far, in most cases, the courts would order such distribution only when the CPF forms the main bulk of the matrimonial assets.&nbsp; We may deduce in<p align=left>Column: 1410<p> such circumstances that the parties are not wealthy people.&nbsp; With the divorce, the ex-spouse's financial situation is usually worsened.&nbsp; The delay in the distribution of CPF monies to the ex-wife may have a negative impact on her financial security and, in addition, prolongs her suffering, preventing a clean break.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I applaud this improvement to our current legislation.&nbsp; The amended Act makes the distribution of assets between two former spouses more equitable and timely, particularly in the many cases where the ex-spouse is the party who makes greater non-monetary contributions to the household.&nbsp; In most cases, they are the women&nbsp;- the wives and the mothers&nbsp;- who have given up their career and financial opportunities in the prime of their lives to take care of the young and the elderly.&nbsp; How do we evaluate their contributions in monetary terms?&nbsp; If we try, I suspect many families may not be able to afford the dedicated services diligently performed by our women.&nbsp; Their work is crucial to our family units and our nation.&nbsp; This amendment is another step in the right direction to acknowledge their contributions, and to support and protect them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would like to voice my concern over the caveat that there is to be no leakage of CPF even as the CPF Act is amended so as not to obstruct the operation of the Women's Charter. Like the saying goes, "All happy families resemble one another, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."&nbsp; Likewise, each court-ordered division of matrimonial assets in a divorce is different in its own way.&nbsp; The cases that&nbsp;I have encountered in my meet-the-people sessions have shown how complicated and unique each divorce case can be.&nbsp; There is the possibility of divorce cases which involve some leakage of CPF monies if the division is to be fair to the ex-spouse, for example, in cases where the ex-spouse requires immediate cash to <p align=left>Column: 1411<p>manage the transition period.&nbsp; In my opinion, it is far more important to be equitable than for the CPF Board to be hung up on a technicality.&nbsp; I hope that provisions can be made to provide for some flexibility.&nbsp; We should not be overly concerned with plugging every possible fund leakage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.34 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support&nbsp;the amendments to the CPF Act.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two areas&nbsp;that I would like to touch on: first, on the division of fund-related assets in cases of divorce.&nbsp; I note that last year, there were a record number of divorces and annulments, numbering over 7,000 in Singapore, and that would be about 2% divorce rate.&nbsp; This compares to the 3% divorce rate in Hong Kong, 4% in Japan, and 8% in Britain.&nbsp; So, I think, as our society progresses, despite best efforts, it is not inconceivable for the upward trend for divorces to continue.&nbsp; At the same time, I note also that in the years 2003-2004, there were over 4,500 applications each year for the enforcement of maintenance orders.&nbsp; In other words, where spouses have been ordered to pay&nbsp;maintenance on a monthly basis to the families that they have since left, there were still many cases who were not able to fulfil their financial obligations.&nbsp; But, I think, in some of these cases, there were at least CPF monies that could be tapped and the amendments make this possible to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With reference to the hon. Member, Mdm Ho Geok Choo's point that CPF is primarily for&nbsp;each member to accumulate savings for his own retirement, I do agree with her point, but I think that, at the same time, fulfilling financial obligations to upkeep of the ex-spouse and their <p align=left>Column: 1412<p>children is also very important.&nbsp; So, in that regard, I think the amendments are a great help to divorcees who have been granted child custody because it makes possible for the immediate transfer of the CPF monies without the need for the Minimum Sum or the Medisave Minimum Sum to be first set aside.&nbsp; Because so much of our assets could be tied to the marital property, it is also a great help that we are removing the need to refund the CPF money used for the property purchase when the property is transferred by a member to his ex-spouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;I support these amendments because they ensure that there is more equitable distribution of matrimonial assets in the case of a divorce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the point of the transfer of the marital property, I note, however, that when the property is sold, the CPF for that property plus accrued interest has to be refunded to the ex-spouse's account from the proceeds of the sale of the property.&nbsp; I support this as it helps the ex-spouse to better plan for retirement through accumulation of the CPF savings.&nbsp; However, I think this point has to be made very clear to the ex-spouse who continues to live in the marital property.&nbsp; This is to ensure that in the event of&nbsp;a sale, the ex-spouse is not caught by surprise by the larger sum of money to be refunded to the CPF.&nbsp; In fact, when I shared this amendment with a union leader, he was very astute and he immediately said to me that if something like that were to happen and the marital property resides with the lady, it makes the lady very "marriageable", and that many men would find her very attractive because of the property she now owns.&nbsp; So, his point to me, which I would like to share with the House, was that immediately after a divorce, it is often true that women could find themselves in a very vulnerable state and, therefore, be open to such forms of perhaps being taken advantage of.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1413<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I hope that the CPF and the HDB can work together to ensure that the obligations of the ex-spouses who get to keep the marital property fully understand their obligations and fully understand that in the event of a sale, they do have to refund the monies back to the CPF, and this would be a larger sum than when they originally contributed towards the purchase of the property.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that regard, I do want to thank the Minister for the changes which, as Mdm Halimah has correctly pointed out, are pro-family, and I think it would help single parents and their children to move on in life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point that I would like to make is on the expansion of the Minimum Sum topping-up scheme.&nbsp; The Minister had earlier during Question Time, in response to a question that I had raised, pointed out that up to 40% of the active members at age 62, still do not have the Minimum Sum.&nbsp; In fact, the median shortfall is about $34,500, if I remember it correctly.&nbsp; So, what it means is that, in fact, quite a lot of people do not have what they need to prepare for retirement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noting that the key objective of the CPF is to save for our own old age, I therefore support the idea that the eligibility criterion for topping-up is maintained at 1.5 times the prevailing Minimum Sum.&nbsp; This is in reference to the point that hon. Member Mr Liang had raised, where he asked whether the scheme could be made more flexible to allow members who do not necessarily have 1.5 times the prevailing Minimum Sum in his Ordinary Account and Special Account to be able to top up the Minimum Sums for their family members.&nbsp; Unlike Mr Liang, I do think that it is important to maintain this eligibility criterion simply because the key objective of the CPF is to save for our own old age.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1414<p>However, notwithstanding that I believe we should maintain the eligibility criterion, I do think that there are cases where the members are no longer actively contributing to the CPF, and that is because they have left Singapore either because of marriage or because they have migrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come across cases where there are family members who have moved overseas and they do not mind helping their siblings, parents or grandparents through the CPF monies that they still have. However, under the current regulations, they still have to meet the eligibility criterion of 1.5 times the Minimum Sum, which they do not have.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, they have maybe about $50,000 in their CPF accounts and they would like to be able to top up the accounts of their family members.&nbsp; I wonder if, in such cases, the Ministry could consider allowing partial transfers on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I would like to thank the Minister for the amendments.&nbsp; I eagerly await the Ministerial Statement on future changes to the CPF.&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.41 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, let me thank Members for their support.&nbsp; Many of them have said that they look forward to the Ministerial Statement on September 17th -&nbsp;I look forward to it too -&nbsp;and I will answer Dr Ahmad Magad's and other questions related to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is a more appropriate occasion.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Magad&nbsp;asked whether we should allow those with serious illnesses to opt out of whatever longevity insurance schemes.&nbsp; Let me say that already is in existence.&nbsp; In other words, currently, if a person has terminal cancer or serious illness which the doctor certifies that he has truncated life expectancy, he is&nbsp;already allowed to withdraw his CPF or part of his CPF monies.&nbsp; So, that already<p align=left>Column: 1415<p> exists and, in that sense, there is no need for that to be confused with what we are doing next.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me address&nbsp;some points that Members have brought up. Firstly, on broadening the list of recipients.&nbsp; As Dr Magad pointed out, can we also include caretakers?&nbsp; We have expanded the list of recipients quite substantially in this review.&nbsp; We have now included&nbsp;siblings, not only of the donors but of the recipients.&nbsp; So, for the donors, we have said, siblings, and the recipients, if you are below 55, we increase the amounts.&nbsp; I think that is an extension, and let us see what happens after this.&nbsp; Should we now include caretakers?&nbsp; It is a little bit trickier because then I will need&nbsp;to have&nbsp;a legal definition.&nbsp; But there may be instances where someone says, "Look, I am willing to do so.&nbsp; Can I, indeed, be allowed to?"&nbsp; I think we can consider that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Magad and Mdm Halimah also asked why is it that we do not allow people to top up Medisave accounts.&nbsp; The reason is that we already allow members to use their Medisave accounts to pay for the healthcare needs of other family members.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;the CPF already allows a family member to use his CPF Medisave savings to pay for the hospital bills of&nbsp;his immediate family members -&nbsp;in other words, spouse, children, parents and grandparents.&nbsp; If your family member goes to hospital, you can already use it.&nbsp; In addition, we also allow the use of Medisave savings of a member to pay for the MediShield insurance premiums of family members, as well as non-immediate family members, ie,&nbsp;siblings, cousins, aunts, etc, but on the condition that the person whom you are paying for does not have enough Medisave savings to pay for his premiums, and that is logical.&nbsp; But the point is that we already allow Medisave savings to be used for hospitalisation and to pay for premiums.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose some would say, "What happens if the person who can help me<p align=left>Column: 1416<p> conks first?&nbsp; He can't help me."&nbsp; That is something we can consider.&nbsp; But the reason why we have looked at Special Account or Retirement Account</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>is because most members have more Medisave savings than their Retirement or Special Accounts.&nbsp; So let us focus on this.&nbsp; In principle, I&nbsp;do not object to this.&nbsp; But this does not seem to be an area of focus for me at this point of time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Mdm Ho Geok Choo, and I think Mrs Josephine Teo, also mentioned that our CPF schemes are complex, and I agree with them.&nbsp; Even as the Minister, I have to, sometimes,&nbsp;take time over the minutiae.&nbsp; I have challenged the CPF Board, and they are getting better at it.&nbsp; I said, "Look, you understand it. I understand it after some time.&nbsp; Can you make it simple so that everybody understands it and there is something easy&nbsp;that they can click on?"&nbsp; So they are using cartoons.&nbsp; We are going on roadshows, and&nbsp;I have launched a roadshow recently&nbsp;in&nbsp;a shopping centre.&nbsp; When we go to the schools, they&nbsp;tailor it to the students.&nbsp; So we are getting better,&nbsp;but I think we need to ramp it up.&nbsp;We need to step up our communications.&nbsp; And we have now launched "My Retirement Account". I welcome Members to go on the website.&nbsp; It is a bit jazzy, it has a tropical island theme.&nbsp; It tells you how to go to the spa, the gymnasium -&nbsp;these are retirement equivalents of spa, gymnasium -&nbsp;how to plan.&nbsp; And I think we need to do more about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah made a good point.&nbsp; She said even after all this change, well and good, but people do not even understand it.&nbsp; They do not know how to do it.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;have challenged&nbsp;the CPF Board instead&nbsp;and said, "Instead of waiting for people to come to your website for information, can you push?&nbsp;&nbsp;And if that person has met the eligibility criteria, can you send a targeted letter to him or her and say, "Look, you've crossed 1.5, we think you have settled your own retirement needs.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1417<p> Do you want to transfer some of your funds to your family members?"."&nbsp; That is more targeted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo asked how many.&nbsp; About one in four, aged 40 to 55, are potential donors, and that is a substantial number.&nbsp; Certainly, we can do that, and I agree with Members&nbsp;that that is something that we want to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked some other points about the Home Protection Scheme.&nbsp; The Home Protection Scheme, capping at 65, is not pegged to the draw-down age.&nbsp; It is pegged to the HDB loan scheme, that is the liability,&nbsp;because,&nbsp;currently, the term of the HDB scheme is up to the age of 65, or whichever is earlier.&nbsp; So we are pegging our liabilities to that.&nbsp;If the HDB loan&nbsp;moves, we are quite willing to follow it, but we are pegged to that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa made some points and asked why there was a low take-up.&nbsp; I think there are some reasons.&nbsp; First of all, people do not know.&nbsp; And I think the second limiting factor was the fact that there was a cohort Minimum Sum limit which until this new Bill was in operation.&nbsp; Because even if you want to top up the account of somebody who was&nbsp;55 years old in 1987, who is older now, you can only top up to that amount.&nbsp; Because of these amendments, if the House passes the Bill, it will be raised to the prevailing Minimum Sum.&nbsp; So that is one reason.&nbsp; The other reason is the fact that you can top up only specific members and, as I said, I have expanded the list of recipients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang asked why do we not make it less restrictive, and allow some leakage.&nbsp; I think, on that score, I would be a bit careful.&nbsp; I want to make sure that there is an&nbsp;equitable distribution of matrimonial assets but, at the same time, I want to preserve retirement adequacy of both members.&nbsp; In the current Act, it was <p align=left>Column: 1418<p>skewed against the spouse.&nbsp; So even if the court decided on the division of matrimonial assets, and here, I move on to matrimonial assets, the court did not have, as Mdm Halimah explained it clearly, the power.&nbsp; I know that division of matrimonial assets in themselves can be very tricky, and I do not intend to&nbsp;let the CPF&nbsp;distort that or to even prescribe how it should be divided.&nbsp; What basically we are trying to do is to say that, within the CPF system, you have the liberty to decide who gets what in a divorce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, there were some questions asked about how much must be put aside by the member before you can transfer.&nbsp; Mdm Ho was saying,&nbsp;and she actually believes, that the spouse or the member should still be required to set aside&nbsp;his own Medisave and Minimum Medisave amount.&nbsp; What we are now saying is that the courts can decide who gets what.&nbsp; And the courts can decide actually that the member puts in X amount, but they are not hamstrung by the CPF Act.&nbsp;When the ex-wife sells the house, how much the&nbsp;ex-wife must put back into the member's&nbsp;account is again for the courts to decide.&nbsp; The courts can decide, for example, in division of matrimonial assets that no refund needs to be made.&nbsp; Again, that is up to the courts.&nbsp; Basically, we are saying that as long as it is impact within the CPF system, it is okay by us, because I am neutral as to which party is more or less protected.&nbsp; I just want to make sure that your retirement sums are protected. And I think that is the most sensible way to approach it, and that it protects both members.&nbsp; Previously, the Act was skewed against the spouse or it was preferentially enacted to favour the member.&nbsp; What I am doing now is making it more equitable for both members because, to me, they are both CPF members.&nbsp; I should not be made to decide who gets what more and leave it to the courts to decide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1419<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked for a pointed clarification whether this was so, that, indeed, the member does not need to set aside the Medisave and Medisave Minimum Sum, and that is indeed so.&nbsp; This is under section 27B(6) which allows the transfer, and that&nbsp;particular section allows for this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been some suggestions made on the SRS.&nbsp; I take the point that Dr Magad has been pushing for this.&nbsp; But this is under the Ministry of Finance and, in terms of tax reliefs, as some other Members have also said, I take that the current tax relief for $7,000 is the limit that is set by MOF.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;is an annual limit.&nbsp; It is not a lifetime limit.&nbsp; So, technically, you can do $7,000 every year.&nbsp; Honestly, I do not think that is a restrictive clause.&nbsp; I do not think that is the reason why people are not topping up.&nbsp; I take it that there are other measures.&nbsp; Basically, I take that these liberalisations are adequate.&nbsp; But even apart from this, there will be the great satisfaction that you would have provided and&nbsp;sustained another family member's retirement adequacy.&nbsp; But,&nbsp;notwithstanding that, I will pass&nbsp;his&nbsp;comments to the Ministry of Finance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ng Eng Hen].</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></span></div>									<!--TITLE_NAME:CARRIAGE BY AIR (MONTREAL CONVENTION, 1999) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 1419<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:CARRIAGE BY AIR (MONTREAL CONVENTION, 1999) BILL:::1425--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>CARRIAGE BY AIR (MONTREAL CONVENTION, 1999) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>											 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">5.55 pm</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Order for Second Reading read.</span></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I <p align=left>Column: 1420<p>beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore intends to accede to the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, which was signed at Montreal on 28th May 1999, commonly referred to as the Montreal Convention 1999.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Montreal Convention 1999 is intended to consolidate, update and eventually replace all previous international air agreements on air carrier liability, including the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, signed at Warsaw on 12th October 1929, commonly referred to as the Warsaw Convention 1929.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when the Warsaw Convention 1929 was first negotiated, its provisions were aligned with the commercial practices of that time. It was intended to provide protection to passengers and cargo shippers and also the airline industry, which was then in its infancy. Even when subsequently amended by protocols, the fundamental basis of the Warsaw Convention 1929 still maintained its 1930s premises and it has been long contended that the passenger compensation limits have been unreasonably low.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Efforts to modernise the Warsaw Convention 1929 have resulted in a number of amending instruments (including the two that Singapore is party to - the Hague Protocol 1955 and the Montreal Protocol No. 4, 1975), which are collectively known as the Warsaw Convention regime.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the efforts to amend and update the Warsaw Convention regime did not bring about the intended results of better compensation across the board. Nor did it achieve a unified regime that could answer the increased demands of a<p align=left>Column: 1421<p> globalised world. As a consequence, some airlines entered into private arrangements while some countries required their airlines to increase their limits, to enhance compensation limits. Without a substantial overhaul, compensation amounts will remain relatively low and the aviation industry will continue to face a complex web of international arrangements.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Montreal Convention has updated and now provides a system for regular review of the compensation quantum for death of or injury to passengers, and damage to baggage and cargo during international carriage. It recognises that globalisation and the increased use of information technology have ushered in new and more efficient ways of doing business and allows for the use of electronic documents for passenger tickets and cargo movements.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me highlight the key features of the Montreal Convention 1999:&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; First, removal of the cap on the quantum of compensation. There is no cap on the amount of compensation which an aircraft accident victim may recover from the airline.

Sir, on 20th July 2004, Parliament resolved in accordance with section 3(1) of the Local Treasury Bills Act (Chapter 167 of the 2002 Revised Edition) that the Minister for Finance be authorised to borrow, by the issue of Treasury Bills in Singapore an outstanding sum not&nbsp;exceeding thirty thousand million&nbsp;dollars ($30,000,000,000).&nbsp; As at 1st August 2007, the outstanding amount of Treasury Bills issued is thirty thousand million&nbsp;dollars ($30,000,000,000).&nbsp; The<p align=left>Column: 1426<p>proposed increase in the borrowing limit is not to cover any Government fiscal shortfall.&nbsp; Rather, it is for the Monetary Authority of Singapore's monetary management operations and market development purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the development of the Singapore Government Securities Market, Treasury Bills are increasingly traded and held by financial market participants.&nbsp; Treasury Bills are negotiable and cost-effective instruments and the Monetary Authority of Singapore can use Treasury Bills to supplement its other monetary management instruments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issuing more Treasury Bills will also help to increase the liquidity in the short end of the SGS yield curve, which will support further development and diversification of the investor base for the SGS and corporate bond markets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose, therefore, that the current ceiling for borrowing by Treasury Bills of thirty thousand million dollars (S$30,000,000,000), be raised by another thirty thousand million dollars (S$30,000,000,000), to a total of sixty thousand million dollars (S$60,000,000,000), in other words, $60 billion.&nbsp; This ceiling will apply to the outstanding amount of Treasury Bills.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to enable the Government to issue Treasury Bills up to a total amount not exceeding sixty thousand million dollars (S$60,000,000,000).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Goh Chok Tong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Palmer asked about the relaxation in the minimum annual income for credit card applicants, and about the launch of payment instruments with a credit limit of not more than $500 without a minimum income requirement.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me clarify that the minimum annual income requirement to qualify for a credit card has not been relaxed, and remains at $30,000.&nbsp; There are no plans to change this.&nbsp; When Mr Palmer mentioned the relaxation in the minimum annual income for credit cards, I presume he was referring directly to payment instruments with a maximum credit limit of $500.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS has exempted payment instruments with a credit limit of less than $500 from&nbsp; MAS' rules to provide some leeway to the market to innovate and develop convenient payment instruments. For example, there have been initiatives in Europe to develop systems for processing payment for small-ticket items using handphones. Whether it is cards or other instruments used for payment for goods or services, MAS has set the maximum credit limit at $500.&nbsp; This allows flexibility in payments for small-ticket items without raising substantial concerns about Singaporeans spending beyond their means.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Palmer expressed concern about cards targeted at students aged 18 and above.&nbsp; I agree with his view that card issuers should be responsible when targeting at students. We note that some industry practices include requiring parental consent when issuing cards to individuals aged below 21 years, suspending the card once there is a missed payment as well as contributing customer credit data to the credit bureau.&nbsp; These practices, together with the modest credit limit of $500, will help avoid situations where young cardholders take on unsustainably high debt.&nbsp;&nbsp; As more industry players offer $500 payment instruments, we would encourage the industry to come up with a common Code of Conduct to bolster responsible lending practices in this segment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help young Singaporeans acquire the skills and knowledge to better manage their finances, we have been working through MoneySENSE, the national financial education programme, with schools to teach youths basic money management skills. Ultimately, Singaporeans have to take personal responsibility for their finances, and ensure that they do not incur excessive debt.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:GST PROFITEERING--><p align=left>Column: 1431<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:GST PROFITEERING:::1434--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>GST PROFITEERING</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Measures to protect consumers' interests--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Measures to protect consumers' interests)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong </B>asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in light of the reported increase in GST profiteering cases (a) whether the current measures against GST profiteering are adequate; and (b) if not, will his Ministry consider introducing tougher preventive and punitive measures to protect consumers' interests from such profiteering.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government takes a serious view of profiteering using the GST increase as an excuse.&nbsp; This is why we set up the Committee Against GST Profiteering (or CAP) in 1994 when GST (0% to 3%) was introduced. CAP brings together Government and community resources to look into complaints of GST-related profiteering. It has ensured the smooth implementation of GST increases in 2003 (to 4%) and 2004 (to 5%) and minimised instances of GST profiteering.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAP works closely with grassroots organisations and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) to investigate every complaint on GST profiteering. In the case of complaints on stand-alone stalls, the grassroots leaders visit with the stall owners and work with them to resolve the issue. This is a nationwide effort. As at 24th August, we received 115 alleged profiteering cases involving over 35 constituencies. For chain stores, CASE has helped to investigate the 116 complaints we have received. In some cases, CAP wrote directly to the businesses asking them to explain their actions of price increases. We also kept the respective grassroots advisers informed of the cases in their areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to investigating complaints, CAP undertakes outreach efforts to urge businesses to be responsible and fair, and to encourage consumers to exercise care when making purchases. Over the past few months, we have visited hawker and commercial centres in different parts of Singapore to raise public awareness about GST profiteering. At the same time, CAP has worked with the Department of Statistics (DOS) to release price information on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and hawker food prices to consumers, while CASE has been publishing the prices of common household items.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAP's message of responsible behaviour has garnered support from major supermarket chains</p><p>&nbsp;and stores. More than 10 businesses and industry associations have also pledged to maintain price stability during the transition of the GST increase. For example, all the major supermarket chains* have absorbed the GST increase for basic items for a period of time to help consumers in transition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAP is not against price increases per se, nor is it its job to interfere with the functioning of a free market and to institute price control.&nbsp; Our role is to ensure that businesses do not use the GST increase as an excuse to raise prices indiscriminately and unreasonably. Not all price increases are due to profiteering. In fact, price movements, both up and down, are important signals in a free market to tell producers how resources should be re-allocated to meet changing market demands. Price movements are happening all the time following local and worldwide supply and demand patterns. Since Singapore imports most of our consumption goods and raw materials, we are usually price takers rather than price setters. Of course, local factors of production, such as manpower costs <p align=left>Column: 1433<p>and rental, will also have a bearing on the final price of the goods and services produced or delivered here.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at the example of condensed milk, which for a while was a concern for many consumers. According to DOS, the price of condensed milk increased by 11% between April and June this year because of the drought in Australia. CAP has highlighted to consumers that they could minimise the impact of price increases by exercising choice. Between house brands and the so-called premium brands, the price of condensed milk can range from $1.00 to $1.90 per can. Consumers can save by switching to cheaper brands. The same is also true for rice and many other consumer goods. CASE has supplemented these efforts by releasing a survey of milk product prices to enable consumers to shop wisely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, free and intense competition and&nbsp;well-informed consumers are the best deterrence against unreasonable price increases. If price increases are unreasonable, whether linked to the GST increase or otherwise, consumers can exercise their choice to switch to cheaper alternatives. In fact, we know that many businesses have refrained from raising prices for fear of losing customers to competition. Indeed, the CPI has increased by 1.98% between December 2006 (after the GST increase announcement) and July 2007. We have also found that more than 90% of the 1,300 hawkers surveyed by DOS have maintained their prices since June. This implies that by and large, our prices are stable. Most businesses have not used GST as an excuse to raise their prices beyond the 2% adjustments on 1st July.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sam Tan asked whether there is a need for tougher preventive and punitive measures. We do not think that legislation against GST profiteering is necessary at this point in time. Our study of other countries' experience shows that legislation against profiteering is difficult and expensive to implement and the effectiveness inconclusive. We believe therefore that the best way to bring about price stability is to remove impediments to competition, and encourage free competition. When there are many sellers and many buyers, prices will find their own equilibrium. Many countries share this view. This is why few countries have such legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAP's duty does not end with the GST increase on 1st July. We will remain vigilant against GST profiteering, and will continue to take action against those who profiteer from GST.</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr><p class="MsoFootnoteText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">* <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">NTUC Fairprice, Sheng Shiong, Shop 'n Save, Cold Storage, and Prime Supermarket.</span></p><BR></div></P></div>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

A re-constituted family comprising a second-timer divorcee who re-marries a first-timer can also apply for a half CPF Housing Grant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not advisable for unemployed divorced women with children to buy a HDB flat, as they will not have an income to service their mortgage loan.&nbsp; Such households should only consider buying a flat when they are financially ready.&nbsp; In the interim, they should turn to their families, such as staying with relatives for mutual care and support.&nbsp; They can also consider renting a room from the open market as this will involve a smaller financial outlay than buying a flat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in cases where the divorced spouse has no family to turn to and is unable to find accommodation on her own, HDB can consider their appeals to rent a subsidised flat, taking into account the merits of the case.<br></p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

He had similarly raised a query on financial literacy in February 2007. Prudence and care in the use of credit facilities, including credit cards, is part of financial literacy. Let me share some of the key actions taken by MOE.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since January 2004, financial education messages have been delivered through appropriate subjects in the formal curriculum such as Civics and Moral Education and Social Studies at the primary and secondary levels.&nbsp; At secondary level, students are taught why we must exercise caution when we borrow and the dangers when we rely on credit facilities excessively under a module on basic money management. By working with external partners, schools supplement these lessons on financial education with financial literacy board games, workshops and inter-school competitions for their students.&nbsp; A financial literacy enrichment activity entitled 'SAVING - the Sensible Habit' has been made available to all primary schools.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our young should learn the importance of responsible decision-making and develop good habits in financial matters from an early age. As they progress to post-secondary institutions such as the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), polytechnics and universities, this is reinforced through various means like mentoring, peer sharing, talks and seminars.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts have helped our students improve their financial literacy and this topic will continue to receive the attention it deserves in our institutions.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:DIVORCES--><p align=left>Column: 1439<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:DIVORCES:::1442--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>DIVORCES</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Measures to reduce--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Measures to reduce)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong </B>asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (a) what measures are being taken to reduce the divorce rates, especially of those aged 20 to 24; and (b) whether there is a correlation between earlier marriages and earlier divorces.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><I>Divorce trends</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of divorces in Singapore has been increasing over the years.&nbsp; In 2006, there were 1.96 divorces for every 1,000 residents, an increase of 0.01 from 1.95 in 2005.&nbsp; The corresponding figure for Japan in 2005 was 2.1.&nbsp; That for the US was 3.6, while Hong Kong was 2.1**.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data from the Department of Statistics showed that younger married persons aged 20-24 registered the highest divorce rate(#).&nbsp; This suggests a positive correlation between earlier marriages and earlier divorces, since those who divorced young would have married young.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1441<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all divorcees under 25 years of age in 2006, there were 127 Women's Charter divorcees, compared to 384 divorcees under AMLA.&nbsp; The number of divorcees under 25 years of age for both Women's Charter and AMLA has stabilised since 2004.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Strengthening marriages</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognising the need to strengthen marriages, my Ministry works with key stakeholders such as the National Family Council, family service providers and educators as well as religious groups to support couples at different stages of their married life.&nbsp; For example, to promote and strengthen the institution of marriage, the National Family Council has proposed to set up Marriage Central.&nbsp; This one-stop access point will provide information on marriage preparation and enrichment programmes, and counselling services.&nbsp; Deputy Registrars of Marriages and most religious organisations encourage couples to attend marriage preparation programmes.&nbsp; Soon-to-wed couples can also access the on-line marriage preparation programme on the popular wedding portal, www.singaporebrides.com. Married couples are encouraged to attend marriage enrichment programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Women's Charter, underaged applicants applying for a Special Marriage Licence(^)<sup>&nbsp;</sup>are interviewed and must attend counselling sessions with their parents.&nbsp; Those aged above 18 but below 21 years must obtain their parents' or legal guardian's consent.&nbsp; Currently, the Registry of Marriages distributes brochures containing information on marriage preparation and enrichment courses to all couples, including those aged between 18 and 21 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13 mosques and 2 community centres offer marriage preparation courses for Muslim couples to impart necessary life-skills in dealing with marital responsibilities.&nbsp; In addition, there are specially-designed marriage preparation courses for minor Muslim couples where at least one partner is aged below 21.&nbsp; To step up capacity and capability to help couples whose marriages are at risk, religious teachers and vice-kadhis, or vice-solemnisers, have been specially trained to provide marriage counselling and mentoring services.&nbsp; The Syariah Court also has in place mediation and marriage counselling programmes to help save marriages.<br>&nbsp;<br><I>&nbsp;Individual responsibility and many helping hands</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government alone cannot mandate strong marriages nor prevent divorces if individuals themselves are not committed to stay married.&nbsp; Strong marriages, however, need support from the people, private and public sectors, or an integrated 3P approach.&nbsp; For example, employers can play their part by creating a pro-family workplace environment to help couples and families manage their work and home responsibilities.&nbsp; Relatives and friends, religious groups and voluntary welfare organisations could counsel and support couples facing marital difficulties.&nbsp; And couples should put in effort to always communicate and grow their relationship.&nbsp; If they face difficulties in their relationship, they should seek help early.&nbsp; With the 3P approach, I am confident that we can build strong marriages in Singapore.</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drug addiction situation in Singapore is under control, even though 999 drug abusers were arrested in the first half of this year, compared to 446 over the same period last year.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the total number of abusers arrested, Buprenorphine abusers formed the majority, at 41%, with heroin abusers at 30% and synthetic drug abusers at 25%.&nbsp; One reason for the increase of 553 abusers is that the Central Narcotics Bureau gazetted Buprenorphine as a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act in August last year. As with any drug that is newly-gazetted, arrests are likely to be high in the initial period. With sustained enforcement, we can expect the number of Buprenorphine abusers to stabilise and taper off.&nbsp; Another reason for the increase in drug arrests is that some ex-Buprenorphine users had turned to heroin abuse after Buprenorphine was made a controlled drug.&nbsp; Around half of the heroin abusers arrested in the first half of this year, or 145 offenders, were ex-Buprenorphine users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important indicator of the drug addiction trend is the number of new abusers arrested.&nbsp; This fell from 278 in the first half of 2006 to 204 over the same period this year. Among repeat abusers arrested, more than 60% were prosecuted under the long-term imprisonment (LT) regime. They will be kept away for between 5 and 13 years, thus preventing them from abusing drugs further or contaminating others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Relapse rate is another important indicator of the drug abuse trend. The LT regime has been effective in deterring recalcitrant abusers from relapsing again into drug abuse. Over the five-and-a-half year period since the first batch of offenders were released from the LT regime at end 2001, the proportion of persons who underwent LT and relapsed was less than 10%, or in absolute numbers, 336 persons.&nbsp; The relapse rate in 2006 for those who were released from LT in 2004 and relapsed within two years was very low at 1%. This low relapse has contributed favourably to the overall 2-year relapse rate of drug abusers arrested, which has dropped from over 60% prior to the introduction of the LT regime, to less than 5% in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's integrated multi-pronged anti-drug strategy comprising strict laws, vigorous enforcement, preventive education, rehabilitation and aftercare, as well as the active involvement of the community, has ensured that the local drug situation remains under control. This approach has achieved positive results and our drug abuse situation compares very well against any other country in the world.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:SUICIDE RATES--><p align=left>Column: 1445<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SUICIDE RATES:::1448--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>SUICIDE RATES</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Trend--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Trend)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mr Low Thia Khiang </B>asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports from 2003 to 2006, whether there is a trend of increasing suicide rates for men in their 40s and women in their 50s and, if so, what are the reasons for the suicides and what preventive measures can be taken.<br></P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><I>Suicide trends among men in 40s and women in 50s</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suicide rate has been increasing for both men in their 40s and women in their 50s since 2003.&nbsp; In 2003, there were 14 suicides per 100,000 men in their 40s.

IMH, for example, has implemented various community-based programmes to detect severe mental health problems early, to support patients within the community, and to help prevent relapses. Help is also given to family members and loved ones affected by a suicide. SOS runs the Local Outreach to Suicide Survivors (LOSS) programme to reach out to family members of suicide victims, who may experience trauma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a key preventive strategy, the Government, together with various voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs), has been actively promoting public awareness on mental health issues for the past few years.&nbsp; The Health Promotion Board (HPB) and various VWOs such as the SAMH and SOS organise regular outreach programmes that include talks, discussion forums and workshops, to raise public awareness on issues related to mental health or suicide.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;More resources will be invested on mental health promotion and treatment.

The Council is chaired by Member of Parliament for Bukit Panjang and Honorary Advisory to the Singapore Life Saving Society, Dr Teo Ho Pin, and comprises members from the people, private and public sectors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Council has on 29th May 2007 announced its water safety promotion plans for 2007-2008.&nbsp; It intends to adopt a three-pronged strategy to cultivate a water safety culture among Singaporeans: - namely, Embarking on Water Safety Education, Increasing Proficiency in Water Safety Skills Training, and Improving the Safety of our Swimming Pools and Water Bodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Council has also announced a "Water Safety Code" to encourage all Singaporeans to understand the importance of water safety and prevent drowning. The "Water Safety Code" entails the following water safety messages: (i) Learn swimming and water survival skills, (ii) Understand the dangers of the water, (iii) Follow safety rules and signs, (iv) Swim in safe areas, (v) Never swim alone, and (vi) Supervise children and weak swimmers at all times. It is important that all Singaporeans take heed of these water safety messages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other specific programmes and initiatives to be undertaken by the Council would include organising campaigns and community programmes to promote water safety, encouraging all school children to participate in the Learn To Swim programme, as well as reviewing existing building codes and best practices for swimming pools and water bodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry will support the Council's work to improve all aspects of water safety. But I would like to emphasise that the Council cannot do it alone. Water safety is a collective responsibility and we all have a part to play. For instance, parents can enrol their children in swimming programmes and exercise constant vigilance when their children are in or near water bodies. Swimmers should also take personal responsibility for their own safety and not overestimate their abilities, even if they are experienced swimmers. Members of the public can also be on the alert to look out for persons in distress when they are around water bodies.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

One of our key efforts is to inculcate a road safety mindset among motorcyclists.&nbsp; For example, learner motorcyclists are taught not to ride in between lanes or weave through traffic.&nbsp; They are also given lessons on carrying pillion riders, night riding and emergency braking on wet road surfaces, to ensure their competence in handling their motorcycles on the roads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Traffic Police has an ongoing educational programme for motorcyclists.&nbsp; Working closely with motorcycle clubs associated with the Singapore Bikers Forum, road safety talks are given to motorcyclists who are studying in ITEs and polytechnics under the "road safety education for motorcyclists by motorcyclists" programme.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, during the Global Road Safety Week in April 2007, Traffic Police launched a new Road Safety talk package for riders, developed in collaboration with motorcycle clubs.&nbsp; A new poster featuring the consequences of motorcycle accidents has also been designed and displayed at motorcycle shops where many young riders shop for accessories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traffic Police is working closely with the Bukit Batok Driving Centre (BBDC) to jointly organise a road safety programme designed specifically for motorcyclists in September 2007 where motorcyclists from various motorcycle clubs will pick up advanced riding tips from senior instructors at Bukit Batok Driving Centre.&nbsp; Traffic Police also engages motorcycle clubs, tertiary institutions and companies employing delivery riders to disseminate road safety messages that emphasise the importance of wearing&nbsp;helmets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Motorcycle Task Force at Traffic Police</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traffic Police has also set up a Motorcycle Task Force to study the causes of the high accident rates involving motorcyclists and recommend measures to enhance motorcyclist safety and lower the accident rate among motorcyclists.&nbsp; For example, motorcyclists who are not properly attired (eg, those wearing shorts and slippers) are regularly pulled over and advised by Traffic Police officers on the importance of wearing proper attire (eg, gloves, jackets, etc), so as to reduce the severity of injuries in the event of accidents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Ensuring riders use proper helmets</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Traffic Police also works closely with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to identify road engineering hazards and the appropriate remedial measures at various motorcyclist fatal accident locations.&nbsp;

On vehicle standards, the Land Transport Authority has in place legislation to require all motor vehicles to meet vehicle technical requirements and international safety standards before they can be registered for use on our roads.&nbsp; Motorcycles are also subjected to mandatory vehicle inspections annually when they are more than three years old.&nbsp; In between the periodic vehicle inspections, Land Transport Authority enforcement officers and Traffic Police conduct regular blitzes against modified motorcycles or motorcycles that are not roadworthy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Motorcyclists and other motorists need to play their part</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Traffic Police and other authorities continue to run programmes to raise the level of safety for motorcyclists, riders should recognise their own vulnerability and be alert and cautious on the roads at all times.&nbsp; Other motorists also need to play their part in ensuring a safer road environment for all.&nbsp; They can do this by keeping a lookout and paying special attention to vulnerable groups of road users such as motorcyclists.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;There are 3 strategic thrusts under this review. We are reviewing how we can (1) make public transport a choice mode, (2) manage road use, and (3) be responsive to the diverse needs of the public.</p><p>&nbsp;In the course of this review, we have sought or received inputs from many diverse sources - submissions from key stakeholders as well as from members of the public, focus group discussions, overseas study visits, and expert views from academics and transport planners.&nbsp; The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has also engaged consultants Booz Allen Hamilton (Australia) Limited to provide specific inputs and recommendations on one aspect of this on-going land transport review, viz. the public transport industry structure and the regulatory framework to fulfil our aim of making public transport a choice mode of travel. We expect the consultants to complete their study by October 2007. LTA will have to study all the feedback received and the consultant's findings carefully as part of the inputs to the land transport review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry is aiming to complete the land transport review by the end of this year, and will release a report on the review in early 2008. The consultant's report will be released as part of the report on the land transport review.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">	<div align=center>		  			        		<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">	<div align=center>		  			        		<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">	<div align=center>
