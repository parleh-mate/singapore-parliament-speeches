<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>LEGAL AID AND ADVICE ORDINANCE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Extension of provisions to cover criminal matters before High Court)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Health

and  Law  whether  he  will consider  extending  the

provisions of the Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance  to

criminal matters before the High Court, and what  is

the estimated cost of such extension.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the view of the

Government  is  that the present  structure  of  the

legal  aid  system in Singapore is not suitable  for

extension to criminal cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal aid system in England as administered by

the Law Society is not concerned with criminal legal

aid. The system of criminal legal aid in England  is

administered  through  the  Courts  themselves.  The

Chairman  of Quarter Sessions himself considers  all

applications for legal aid in his court  and  grants

or  rejects  applications in  his  sole  discretion.

Likewise do the Magistrates. So also does the  Judge

or Commissioner in the Old Bailey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a legal aid scheme for criminal cases is

introduced,  it  must,  if  it  is  to   be   fairly

administered, apply to all cases whether before  the

High Court or before the subordinate Courts. This is

the  practice  in  England.  There  is  already   in

existence  a scheme whereby lawyers are assigned  to

accused  persons charged with capital offences.  All

provisions  in  the Legal Aid and  Advice  Ordinance

envisage recourse to the English system. This  would

mean  the  Courts administering criminal legal  aid,

considering all such applications and assigning  all

cases  which they think should be granted legal  aid

to members of the profession. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



profession therefore would have to play an even more

active  role  in participating in such a  legal  aid

scheme  if  legal aid is to be extended to  criminal

cases.  Such  an extension of the legal  aid  system

must  apply to all criminal cases, not only the High

Court cases, and the members of the profession  must

be  prepared  to participate on the  basis  that  no

assigned  brief can be refused at the  rates  to  be

prescribed even though members of the profession can

command higher fees on other work in respect of  the

time employed on such assigned cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would prefer legal aid to be given

in  criminal  cases by the Bench with the  full  co-operation  of  the  Bar as it  is  the  practice  in

England,  rather than legal aid to  be  provided  by

lawyers in full-time Government employment. It  does

seem  odd  that the State should prosecute offenders

and,  at  the same time, engage lawyers in full-time

employment to defend these offenders. I know this is

the practice in certain States in Australia, but  we

have  been  used to the practice here  of  assigning

counsel for the defence in capital charges, and this

system  could very well be extended by adopting  the

English practice in regard to the grant of legal aid

in criminal cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One great advantage of the English system of legal

aid  in  criminal cases, which is completely outside

the  English legal aid service operated by  the  Law

Society  in  civil cases, is that it is operated  by

the Judiciary and the Bar. Judges can be depended on

to  look  fairly into the legal points  of  criminal

cases  which are before them for trial  and  can  be

depended on to reject applications for legal aid  in

criminal  cases where no points of legal  difficulty

are  likely to arise. It is not the intention of the

scheme of legal aid in criminal cases in England  or

here  to  grant legal aid to all and sundry  but  to

grant it in criminal cases involving fine points  of

the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to estimate accurately the cost

of  extending  the legal aid scheme to all  criminal

matters  before  the  High  Court.  There  were  152

criminal cases tried in the High Court in 1961



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



and 1962, and if the costs per case are estimated at

$1,000,  the  cost to Government of extending  legal

aid to all criminal cases in the High Court will  be

around $76,000 a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the administration of justice will be a Federal

matter, estimates for such a scheme will have to  be

approved   by  the  Central  Government,   and   the

Singapore Government is in no position to accept any

such commitment on its own responsibility.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Is the Minister aware that

the  Bar  Committee fully support the suggestion  of

the  extension  of free legal aid  to  all  criminal

cases  in  the High Court, whether the appellate  or

original  jurisdiction? If he is, would he  consider

negotiating  with  them with a view  to  evolving  a

scheme satisfactory to that end?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have already

explained,  the  administration  of  justice  is   a

Federal  responsibility. We cannot as  a  Government

enter    into   any   commitments   on    our    own

responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bar Committee had been really keen on the

extension of legal aid to criminal cases, they would

have  taken  steps  to see that such  a  system  was

introduced.  But so far, they have only  voiced  the

opinion  that the legal aid system is acceptable  to

them.  But  they have done nothing to further  their

demand for the extension of legal aid.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Does the Minister not

consider that the provision of legal and is a social

amenity  and not in the course of the administration

of justice?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You have to run the legal aid system in

a  proper way. I have just pointed out to Members of

the  House that in England it is administered by the

Bar in co-operation with the Judiciary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention to give legal aid to

everybody  who  makes  a  claim  for  legal  aid  in

criminal  cases. It is only granted in  cases  where

there are points of law involved and it is only  the

Judge who can decide what case is fit and proper for

the grant of legal aid.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I will not take much of the time of

the  Minister. I have just one more question to ask.

Is  he  not conscious that throughout Australia  and

the  United States free legal aid is granted in  all

criminal  cases? I am sure he is conscious  that  in

Singapore, where the vast majority of our population

do  not speak the language of the administration  of

justice,  it  is  particularly important  that  they

should have legal assistance not merely where points

of  law  arise  but for the proper  presentation  of

their  cases.  In  these  circumstances,  would   he

reconsider the position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said all that

needs  to  be  said  on  this  matter.  If  the  Bar

Committee in Singapore really want the extension  of

legal  aid to criminal matters, it is up to them  to

press  this  demand more vigorously than  they  have

done in the past.

<div align="center"><b>UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number of students and Government grants in 1962/63)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Education  to  state  (a)   the  number  of  students

studying in the University of Singapore in (i)  1962,

and  (ii)   1963;  (b)  the amount of  the  Government

grants  to  the University in 1962/63; and  (c)   the

basis on which such grants are made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The number of students studying

in the University of Singapore in 1962 was 2,149 and

in 1963 is 2,431.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of Government grants to the University

in  1962  was  $8.5  million of which  $400,000  was

subject  to Treasury sanction. For 1963,  which  was

passed  by the Legislative Assembly on the  14th  of

last  month,  the sum voted was $8,754,550  of  which

$254,550 is subject to Treasury sanction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants are made on the basis of estimates of income

and  expenditure of the University submitted by  the

University  authorities to the  Government  for  its

consideration. On the basis of past experience,  the

Government  then decides on the annual grant  to  be

made to the University.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> From the figures indicated by the

Minister,  there seems to be a 14 per cent  increase

in  enrolment  but not a proportionate  increase  in

grant, is the Minister satisfied that the grant  is

adequate  for  the needs of the University  for  the

year in question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I should like to say to the

Member for Anson that it is not quite necessary  for

the  annual  grant to the University to be  kept  in

proportion  to the number of students. In  fact,  as

the  number of students increases, the cost to  tile

University per student should decrease. I  will  say

this,   that  for  1962,  on  an  estimated  student

enrolment of 2,120, the University requested a grant

of  $9.91 million. Of this, $680,000 was to  be  for

research  and post-graduate education. Although  the

Government  grant  was  $1.4 million  short  of  the

University's expectation, it is reliably  understood

that despite an increased enrolment of 2,149 instead

of  2,120 as estimated by the University, there will

still be a surplus.

<div align="center"><b>WORK BRIGADE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up of Commission)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

National   Development  whether  he  will   consider

setting   up  a  Commission  to  inquire  into   the

functioning  of  the  Work  Brigade  and   to   make

recommendation for its future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the Work Brigade was set up

in March 1960 with the following objects:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to keep in useful and gainful occupation

youths  between  the ages of 16  and  30  who  would

otherwise he swelling the ranks of the unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to place them in permanent employment in

Government  and  other organisations  in  the  State

after  a  period of training designed to  turn  them

into useful citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the years since March 1960, thousands of

youths   have  been  kept  in  useful  and   gainful

occupation   and  over  2,000  youths   have   found

employment through the Work Brigade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Work Brigade has been

functioning satisfactorily and I see no  reason  for

setting   up  a  Commission  to  inquire  into   the

functioning of the Work Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he is

not  aware  that it is generally believed  that  the

Work   Brigade   is   being   used   for   political

demonstrations  and some of the  members  are  being

coerced thereto and paid public monies therefor? And

would  he  not  consider it helpful  in  the  public

interest that these rumours - whether true or untrue - should  be  nailed down by a public  inquiry  which

would also assist in considering the future of these

people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I can imagine all sorts of rumours

about the Work Brigade because the election for  the

15  seats to the Federal Parliament is drawing  very

near.  Rumours  will  fly  round  anyway.  For   the

Member's  information, other than doing the  routine

work  of  the Work Brigade, Work Brigade members  do

crowd control work. For instance, on National Day or

during   Singapore  Air  Show  Day  or  during   the

Singapore  or  Malaysian Grand  Prix,  Work  Brigade

members  are used to prepare the site,  to  help  in

crowd  control and many other things. These are  the

duties which the Work Brigade have performed to  our

satisfaction   and   we  are  satisfied   with   the

functioning  of the Work Brigade. As  I  have  said,

there  is no necessity to set up this Commission  of

Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the Minister  for  National

Development  aware that members of the Work  Brigade

have  been selling P.A.P. party organs during  their

working  hours? I would like to ask him  whether  he

intends to set up a Commission to inquire into  this

matter  and to see that members of the Work  Brigade

should be employed in their proper functions and not

do  something else for the benefit of the  Party  in

power.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, during the days when the

Member  for  Choa Chu Kang and the  Member  for  Toa

Payoh  were with us on this side of the Assembly,  I

also heard that they were using Work Brigade members

for their own purpose.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



At  that time, of course, it was for P.A.P. purpose,

and  there  was  no necessity for  a  Commission  of

Inquiry  because  these were mere  rumours.  If  the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang can substantiate  what  he

has  said  just  now, I will set up a Commission  of

Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, after

having  run the Work Brigade for nearly three years,

would  the Government not consider that a Commission

of  Inquiry  would  be able to inquire  whether  the

present  $1.50  per day allowance is sufficient  for

their  purpose and whether we should increase it  to

$3 per day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the idea of admitting

unemployed youths into the Work Brigade is  to  give

them a period of training and find proper employment

for  them outside the Work Brigade. We do not intend

to  keep  them  in  the  Work Brigade  forever.  The

allowance of $1.50 a day is to tide them over  their

weekend, the days when they are free to go  out  and

enjoy a bit. This sum of $1.50 is not intended as  a

salary for them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

a   little  while  ago  the  Minister  for  National

Development  said  that  if  I  could  produce   the

evidence,  then  he  would  consider  setting  up  a

Commission of Inquiry. Now I ask the Minister to set

it  up  to  look  into the whole task  of  the  Work

Brigade and then we will get evidence as to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is now entering into

a  debate. He has been asked to substantiate what he

has  to  say, and if he can do so, then the Minister

has  undertaken to make an inquiry. That is the  end

of it. He must not enter into a debate now. Is it  a

question, he wishes to ask?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, my

question is very simple. If the Minister would  like

to  set up a Commission of Inquiry, then we would be

prepared to give evidence to this Commission.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister indicate what is

the average period that a member of the Work Brigade

remains  in the organisation, if he is in possession

of that information at the moment?

[24th  July,  1963], "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, when the House adjourned yesterday,  I  was

touching on the arrogant attitude of the Member  for

Cairnhill,  who claimed to be the representative  of

the  Alliance  which  opposed  the  Bill  now  under

discussion.  In  passing,  I  also  replied  to  his

charges  that the object of this Bill was to  ensure

safe  seats for P.A.P. Ministers and strong  men  in

the  P.A.P.  In point of fact, as I said  yesterday,

the  Member  for Cairnhill did practise this  tactic

for his own benefit, and now he is throwing the same

charges  at others. I know how efficient the  Member

for  Cairnhill is in protecting himself or in saving

himself from extinction. In the first election  when

he  contested the Keppel Ward, he stood in the  name

of  the  Labour Party. In 1955 he contested  in  the

name  of the Labour Front, and in 1959 again on  the

S.P.A. ticket, and maybe the next year in the  name

of  the  Alliance. He reminds me of  the  proverbial

hermit-crab, whose anterior is similar to that of  a

crab  but  whose posterior is that of a  snail.  The

body  of  this hermit-crab is weak. This hermit-crab

has  no shell for its lodging. He has only another's

shell to ensure his safety. Now it is clear that the

lodging  where  this hermit-crab is sheltering  will

not  be  safe for the creature. This is the type  of

tactic  that will be employed by people like Members

who are afraid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



of  being defeated in elections; leaving the  Labour

Party  and later on the Labour Front and S.P.A.  Now

he makes the charge against the Government that this

Bill  is  designed to ensure safe seats  for  P.A.P.

Ministers. The Prime Minister will not run away from

Tanjong Pagar; likewise each and every Member of the

P.A.P. will return to his constituency to face  the

people.  We are prepared to face the people  at  the

appropriate time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we saw the behaviour of the Member for Cairnhill yesterday when he heat his chest as though to claim that only the Alliance represents the people of Singapore. But he forgets that the Alliance Headquarters is in Kuala Lumpur. In spite of all his boast, the Alliance has not been able to find a suitable Chairman from one of its colleagues

in  Singapore. They have to run to Kuala  Lumpur  to

find the Chairman. If -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the Hon.

Parliamentary Secretary that we are not debating the

Alliance'?  He  is  in order up  till  now.  He  has

attacked the Member for Cairnhill. That is in order.

When  he goes further and starts debating about  the

Alliance, and who the Chairman of the Alliance is, I

think  he is going a hit too far, and going  further

and further away from the Bill itself.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, we know that

the  object  of  this  Bill is to  provide  for  the

election of 15 representatives to the Federal  House

of  Representatives. But the Member for Cairnhill is

so  scared  to  face the people that in  his  speech

yesterday he said that the 15 elected Members should

be  nominated  from  among  the  51  Assemblymen  in

Singapore. This is clear proof that he wants to save

himself.  The 15 representatives must be elected  by

the  people.  Where then is the logic that  we  must

nominate   them  - not  elected  by  the  people   to

represent   them   - to   the   Federal   House    of

Representatives?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Cairnhill also said that the forthcoming Federal elections, if this Bill is passed, mean nothing more than a waste of public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



funds.  Every  five years there is this  opportunity

for  the  people to pass judgment on  their  elected

representatives whether in the Legislative  Assembly

or  in  the future Federal House of Representatives.

We  must  give  this opportunity to  the  people  to

choose their representatives. Does he consider  that

such  expenses are a misuse of public funds, if they

claim  to  be champions of democracy'?  Now  we  are

going  to expend money to enable the people to elect

their representatives. He considers this a waste  of

money! I do not see the logic, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, although you have pulled me up just now, I should like to say a little more. The real motive behind the Member for Cairnhill's opposition to this Bill is I his, and it is a coincidence that this appeared in today's Utusan Melayu in an article headed "Federal House of Representatives Elections". It says that the UMNO-MCA-MIC will each get four

seats,  and  the  balance will  be  for  the  S.P.A.

Because the S.P.A. get a less number of seats,  they

have  shown opposition and they are not prepared  to

contest  the  elections. It may  be  that  when  the

elections  take place, we might see a lot of  S.P.A.

and Independent candidates contesting.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   wonder  whether  the  Hon.  Parliamentary

Secretary  can tell us where he got that information

from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yaacob continued speaking in Malay.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, I suppose the answer is "from

the  newspaper". Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary

will tell us which newspaper and of which date.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I did say I

was  quoting  from today's Utusan Melayu  under  the

heading "Federal Elections - UMNO-MCA-MIC each to get

4  seats." This means that the S.P.A. will get three

seats.  This is what they fear. This will result  in

many   Independent  candidates   from   the   S.P.A.

contesting  against  their  own  Singapore  Alliance

candidates, as happened in the previous City Council

and Legislative Assembly elections when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



they   fought   against  UMNO  candidates   in   the

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the Member for Cairnhill strongly

opposes this Bill is due to party interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday a representative of the Barisan Sosialis

sang  the same old song; the same gramophone record.

There  were  nothing  but  the  oft-repeated  terms,

"dictatorship",  "undemocratic", and,  at  the  same

time,  they  accused the Government of  adopting  an

attitude  that is nothing short of dictatorship.  We

are  going to face the people now. Because Singapore

held its first referendum, she was able to solve the

merger problem. Now where is her self-respect if  we

cannot  send elected representatives to the  Federal

Parliament? If the Opposition Members claim to  have

the support of the people, then they should have  no

fear.  Let  them go back to the people and  let  the

people  judge. That is democracy. We pass this  Bill

and  we then face the people. We do not want to  see

Singapore sending nominated representatives  to  the

Federal Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Member for Punggol, in prefacing his

speech,  apologised and said that his speech  should

have  been delivered by his Party leader, the Member

for  Hong Lim, who was then indisposed. I sympathise

with the Member for Hong Lim. My friend informed  me

yesterday  that  a Chinese newspaper  reported  that

committee  members of the U.P.P. Branch in  Havelock

had  resigned  en bloc. I feel very  sorry  for  the

Member  for  Hong Lim. The Member for  Punggol  said

yesterday that this Bill deprives the right  of  the

Assembly,  because  all  election  Bills   must   be

approved  by the Assembly. We are now debating  this

election Bill and this Assembly will have to approve

this  Bill to make it law in order to enable  us  to

face  the  people  in  the elections.  There  is  no

meaning  in shouting out that the people are  behind

them  when, in asking the Opposition to approve this

Bill, they turn around and charge us by saying  that

the Bill is dictatorial, undemocratic and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the delineation of the constituencies, Members opposite have said that there should be an All-Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



conference. My colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister,

emphasised yesterday that the door is still open. We

are  prepared  to meet the Opposition  on  an  equal

basis,  i.e. four to four. If they really  represent

the  people of Singapore, there is nothing for  them

to   be  afraid  of  about  the  boundaries  of  the

constituency. We must be prepared to  stand  in  any

constituency, whether it be Bukit Timah  or  Tanjong

Pagar,  if we are sure of the support of the masses.

This  is  only  their manoeuvre to  cover  up  their

faults and weaknesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Mr Speaker, this Bill provides for the

election of 15 representatives from Singapore to sit

in    the    Federal   Parliament,   and   not    of

representatives to be nominated by this Assembly.



<br><br>3.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Singapore  (Elections  to  the  Federal   House   of

Representatives)  Bill  is  a  real  menace  to  the

democratic  system.  It is a  shame  of  the  P.A.P.

Government,   and  provides  a  fitting   concluding

chapter to the P.A.P. reign of four years which,  in

the  beginning, came in like a crest of wave but  is

reduced to nothing, like the foam which we see after

the wave has rolled out into the ocean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this sitting is the most vital in the history of this Assembly in the past four years. As far as the P.A.P.'s fate is concerned, this Bill is the most vital one. To the P.A.P. it outweighs in importance the debates on the Malaysia Agreement and other motions. It will provide the Minister with all

the powers necessary to run the coming Parliamentary

election  of 15 seats as he likes. The rule  of  law

has  given way to the rule of decree. Just  remember

the  days  of the Japanese occupation when  whatever

the Japanese Kempeitai said either by imperial edict

or by decree, had the force of law. Even a chop by a

Kempeitai  officer on a piece of scrap  paper  could

mean  life or death to thousands of people. Although

we have not approached that state, we are seeing the

beginnings  of such a state. In the past few  months

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



have  seen  more and more the Government's intention

to  introduce  government by decree,  government  by

edict,  instead of government by consent, government

by  rule  of law. So why does the P.A.P. not abolish

this  Legislature and, at the same time,  appoint  a

Japanese  type of judiciary so that tyranny  can  be

more complete?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Yes,

we will appoint you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that case

the  first person I will fix up is the Deputy  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is not that the P.A.P. Government lacks

the  intent  or the will hut the powers  behind  the

scenes could see the catastrophe if the present cat-and-mouse  type of democracy is further  allowed  to

deteriorate. As I myself see it, the Bill has  three

purposes.  Its  primary purpose is to avoid  Federal

elections  for Singapore's 15 representatives  being

conducted  not under the more independent Federation

Elections  Commission but under P.A.P. control.  We

can  expect  and envisage what the course  of  these

elections  would  be  like, particularly  after  our

experience in the National Referendum campaign.  The

P.A.P. hopes that by rigging the elections  it  can

win  a  few seats, and if these elections  could  be

held  before 31st August they would then still  have

control  over  the  Police  machinery  - the  Special

Branch  and the C.I.D. - which would be useful weapons

in  rigging  the elections. Further, with  all  this

paraphernalia of State control, the P.A.P. can  hope

to  win a few seats which will provide a prop in the

coming State elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, months ago in our Party paper we have already analysed what these elections would be like. We have already foreseen that there would be elections before 31st August if the P.A.P. Government had its way. We have already foreseen as far hack as May this year that there would be an

undemocratic  delineation of boundaries.  I  already

have a draft list of what the P.A.P. proposes to  do

with the boundaries. As stated in our Party organ,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



we  have  already foreseen that one of the  purposes

was to seek safe seats for the P.A.P. Ministers. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Minister for Health and Law  will

not  have a safe seat at all because he is now  not

in the good hooks of the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the P.A.P. can win a few seats, then we can expect the coming State elections to be held very soon; it might be after a few weeks.

But  if the P.A.P. faces complete calamity, then  we

can  expect the P.A.P. Prime Minister running  again

after  the  British and asking them to provide  more

time  so that he can find further ways and means  to

save the P.A.P. from complete disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second purpose of this Bill is to provide for special counting - and this we foresaw long ago - so that the results of the 51 State constituencies, although regrouped into 15 for Federal constituencies, could be known only to the P.A.P. Mr Speaker, this is the way it will be done.

Suppose Geylang West, Geylang East, Mountbatten  and

Joo   Chiat   were   regrouped  into   one   Federal

constituency;  during the counting  there  would  be

four  tables  and the tour Presiding Officers  would

know  the  actual number of P.A.P. votes  for  each

State  division. But the Opposition  candidates  and

their  counting  agents could only  know  the  total

number  of  votes cast for each of the  Parties.  In

other  words,  the P.A.P. would have the  additional

advantage of knowing their exact strength in each of

the  51 State constituencies. Let us assume that out

of  the  51 constituencies, the P.A.P. can  pick  up

five  or  six. Kreta Ayer is supposed  to  be  their

strongest  constituency. They want to  know  exactly

how  the people there vote. Tanjong Pagar, they want

to  know how the people there vote. Anson, with  the

Work Brigade, they want to know how the people there

vote.  Now,  these five or six safe seats  would  be

allotted to the most trusted Ministers of the P.A.P.

And as I have said just now, the Minister for Health

and Law is not one of the trusted Ministers -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

He seems to be a prophet, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The P.A.P. Ministers will hope,

therefore, by such an operation to pick out the safe

seats,  if  any is left, and leave the P.A.P.  Back-benchers to swim on their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third purpose of this Bill, as I see it, is to

see  that  the Prime Minister himself is elected  to

the  Malaysian Parliament. This - we knew it for  the

first  time yesterday - is for a period of six years.

We were given the impression that it would be for  a

period of nine months. But it is for a period of six

years.  So  that  he, having failed to  deceive  the

people  of Singapore and us here, could be  able  to

manipulate  and play his political pranks  with  the

Members  of  Parliament from the Sabah  territories,

from  Sarawak and from the Federation, both  on  the

Opposition and the Government benches. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, it is quite a wild venture, but if he gets  in,

I  can  assure you that he can do a lot  of  pranks.

Sir,  everything is being done to see that the Prime

Minister  is  one  of the 15 to go in.  Whether  any

other P.A.P. Minister gets in or not, whether any of

the other 14 is P.A.P. or non-P.A.P. actually is not

so  important as the Prime Minister himself  getting

in.  Because if the Prime Minister can get into  the

Federation  Parliament, he will be able to  convince

Donald  Stephens  and then the Sarawak  delegation's

all  totalling  40 votes; he will  try  to  get  the

Opposition  benches  in  the Federation  Parliament,

because,  Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody in the  Malaysian

Parliament  can  beat, as we must  acknowledge,  his

powers  of  oratory. Those who admire  him  say  his

powers  of oratory; those who do not admire him  say

his powers to twist and turn. But he will be able to

convince  the  Sabah M.P.s. the Sarawak  M.P.s.  the

Opposition   M.P.s  and  even  the   Alliance   Back

benchers.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Federal  Parliament

will  be  like  a  cauldron  where  water  would  be

boiling.  Everything is now being done in  Singapore

to see that our great Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



Minister  goes  into the Malaysian Parliament.  Last

week,  a $2 million so-called Malaysian bonus - it  is

not  a  Malaysian bonus, it is the Prime  Minister's

Federation  M.P. bonus at our expense - was  given  to

the  workers  and  they have been waiting  for  four

years.  Why not give to them earlier? They were  all

part  of  the P.A.P.'s election promises to  give  a

better  way  of life to the workers,  not  only  the

Singapore Harbour Board workers, but all the workers

of  Singapore, all the poor people of Singapore. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, months ago we forecast this  move  to

increase the pay of the Harbour Board workers, it is

in  our Party organ. There is no genuine concern for

the  workers.  Incidentally, since I  am  discussing

this Bill, I would like to ask the P.A.P. Government

how  many  Work Brigade members are in the electoral

registers  of Anson and Tanjong Pagar. Personally  I

do not think all the Work Brigade members will vote

for the Prime Minister for their $1.50 a day. But  I

just  wish  to know how many of them are living  and

have their names in the electoral registers of Anson

and  Tanjong Pagar-[Interruption]. The  Member  for

Anson is not on the electoral register of Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill, as I see it, envisages the

following undemocratic features for the purpose of

the  Federal  elections. First,  delineation  of

boundaries to be undemocratic. The whole  setup

was ready months ago. The delineation of boundaries,

as far  as  I know, was ready. The candidates were

all ready.  Everyday  we  see  the  papers  boosting

up candidates; Dr Fong Kim Heng with his programme for

bringing rain from Australia down here -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Bring what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Bringing artificial rain. Jek Yuen Thong, a

possible candidate, the Parliamentary Secretary   to  the  Prime  Minister,

a   potential candidate. Everyday we see the papers boosting  them up.

We  know.  The  election machinery  was  ready. Everything was ready.

The Secretary o our Branch  in Tanjong Pagar was detained.

This is all part of  the operation.  We knew it long ago.

Why this  farce  of inviting the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>





Opposition  Parties to send four representatives

to delineate   boundaries  which  have   already

been decided?  We  send four, the Government sends

five; first,  the  Government hopes that the four

in  the Opposition  will  give  four  different  views.

Of course,  we  will. If we ask four brothers  to  give their

views on delineation, all four will come  out with  four different

methods of delineation. And  if in case we do not fight and we agre

e among ourselves first  before  we  meet the P.A.P. representatives,

then,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, they  will  have  five  to outvote  us  four.

Mr Speaker, Sir, what democracy? We   have  seen  previously  that

there  were   two Commissions  on  the delineation of boundaries;

one was for the 32 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member should at least pay

heed to what the Deputy Prime Minister has said. Now it is not 5-4, it is 4-4.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

know whether the Chairman has got a casting vote or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Well said!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> We have seen that during the past many years,

there  were two  commissions  for  the delineation  of  boundaries,

and  in   both   these commissions, appointed by colonial and semi-colonial

governments, we had an impartial Chairman  and  each Party  sent one representative.

It only took two  or three sittings of one or two hours each to delineate those boundaries -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):

Not  impartial. Mr G. Thomson was the  Chairman

and "an MI 5 agent".



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> But, Mr Speaker, Sir, even

though  George  Thomson was the  Chairman  of  those

delineation  of boundaries commissions, even  though

George  Thomson wanted to side with the  Government,

and  commit  a  travesty of  justice,  it  would  be

impossible  with  Government's one nominee  and  the

Government  Party itself, because there  were  three

Opposition Parties. The Opposition Parties still had

a say. But this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



is unusual: 4-5, now 4-4. A deadlock, what happens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second undemocratic feature of the Bill is to provide for snap elections. We do not know when the elections for the 15 seats are coming. If the P.A.P. had its way, we expected polling day would be before 31st August, that is, when the P.A.P. still has control of the police, the

Special  Branch, the C.I.D. and all  the  organs  of

suppression. We will also expect that there might be

a  second  sweep of political opponents whereby  the

Parties would be paralysed. The organisations  would

he paralysed for a few weeks because of the reign of

terror  and fear imposed in Singapore and the P.A.P.

will rush in with a snap election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. only need to give a minimum of nine days between nomination and polling days. And we know that at any time after the sweep it takes at least a minimum of one or two months for any Party to recover from the sweep. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must watch with interest the

activities in Cameron Highlands -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sapu.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The third undemocratic feature is

that  this Bill provides for the P.A.P. Minister  to

improvise  without  the  consent  of  the  Assembly,

without the notice of the Assembly, his own by-laws,

his  own election schedules, his own forms of ballot

papers.  All this is known to us. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

like  our  Party  symbol. They  gave  us  plenty  of

trouble  over  our Party Symbol, and today  we  have

decided, because we are forced, to change our  Party

symbol  to  that  of  a key. They  thought  that  by

intimidating  us and by cancelling our Party  symbol

on nomination day, every one of our candidates would

he  given a different symbol. Mr Speaker, Sir,  let

us say the Returning Officer appointed by the P.A.P.

gives  the  first candidate we have for,  say,  Hong

Lim,  an  elephant -[Laughter] It is  their  choice,

Sir.  We have no choice. Our candidate for Havelock,

a cat -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> A cow!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Our candidate for Stamford -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> A pig!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - a pig. Then, Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  happens?  A genuine Independent  candidate  in

Hong Lim would have a pig, in Havelock it could be a

different  thing, a different animal, in Stamford  a

different  animal. It is very difficult  for  us  to

canvass and this is what the P.A.P. has done to  us.

But we know their tricks. They thought that we would

not  be  prepared at this late hour  to  change  our

Party  symbol because we have only a few more  weeks

to  go - one week, two weeks, three weeks to go. But,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, so long as we are given two weeks

we can make the people of Singapore know what is our

new symbol. The P.A.P. thought that we would not  be

prepared  to sacrifice at this late hour and  change

our symbol and that we would rather take the risk on

nomination day, when the P.A.P. appointed  Returning

Officer could refuse our candidates the use  of  our

three-ring symbol. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, we foresee

what  is  in the evil minds of the P.A.P. Government

and  we have decided to take this challenge. We have

decided  today to change this symbol of three  rings

to  a  key. We hope the P.A.P. Government  will  not

seek   a  second  excuse,  "Oh,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

everybody uses a key; everybody has a bunch of keys.

So  how  can the U.P.P. use the key? They are taking

everybody's symbol?" -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

made  his  point. Let us try and come  back  to  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, because of all

these  undemocratic features of the Bill and because

we  have no faith that this coming election  for  15

seats  to  the Federal Parliament would be conducted

in  a  clean  and  democratic  manner,  we  ask  the

Government to have the elections run by a  genuinely

independent commission, otherwise we can just expect

the result.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now about my ex-Parliamentary Secretary - the

present   Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the   Prime

Minister. I just want to clear up one point which he

has  mentioned  just  now.  It  has  never  been  my

practice to say anything against any person  whom  I

consider my junior in the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> You

are in the junior league yourself!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> That is why in the past few years

I  have refused to comment on anything about my  ex-Parliamentary Secretary. Mr Speaker, Sir, it  pains

me  to  comment on one whom I have brought  up  from

rags  to  riches;  one  who  was  disavowed  by  the

U.M.N.O.,  and having found no place and the  P.A.P.

Central  Committee having refused to accept  him,  I

fought  for his acceptance. I got him a job  in  the

City Council; got him nominated as a candidate;  and

got him appointed as my Parliamentary Secretary. And

you  know, Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I heard,  not

long after he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary,

having risen up from rags to riches, he changed.  He

ordered five suits in one day, and I knew he  was  a

hopeless case.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He ordered five what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> He ordered five suits in one day.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whether all this is

necessary  when we are debating this  Bill.  Is  all

this  necessary,  all these personalities?  It  will

never end.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he talked about

the  U.P.P.  Havelock Branch. We knew all  this  was

coming.  We  knew it long ago. We already  said  two

months  ago  in our Party organ that the P.A.P. has

spies  in our midst waiting for the chance  to  make

Press  releases when the time comes. Nineteen chaps!

We  have hundreds of members in Havelock, and out of

the  19  chaps only two are members of  the  Interim

Havelock  Committee. We know all this. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  our  organisation is even more watertight  and

better  organised  than the P.A.P. organisation.  I

helped them to draft the constitution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Better watch the Barisan!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan are

not  giving us any trouble in the Branches. The main

trouble is money, and money is being spent in a  big

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this note I must conclude:

that  we  feel  very sorry that we should  see  this

Bill,  but  we hope that it will be like yesterday's

Singapore  Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary

Provisions)  (Amendment) Bill, when  the  Government

faced  the  first  crisis in  its  life - 23  to  23.

Although  I was sick, I was waiting in the  room  to

come  in  and vote. They knew it - they saw me  there - and so, Mr Speaker, Sir, they withdrew the Bill. I

hope  today, seeing the same situation,  23-23,  and

the  Member for ion Chiat has promised to vote  with

us,  the Government will see sense and withdraw  the

Bill, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

yesterday  at 6.22 in the evening, the Minister  for

Home  Affairs introduced the Bill, which is the same

as  the  National Referendum Bill.  The  P.A.P. has

introduced  a  Bill like this in a hurry,  with  the

same intention as they had when they introduced  the

National Referendum Bill sometime ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Minister for Home Affairs moved the Second Reading of the Bill, he said at the very beginning that according to Annexure A, section 95 of the Malaysia Agreement, the relevant Bill will be presented to the Legislative Assembly. Mr Speaker, this is the first

time  the P.A.P. has introduced such a Bill  without

letting  the  House know about the contents  of  the

Malaysia Agreement. And they want the House to  pass

this Bill in a dictatorial and undemocratic way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, last year after debating the White Paper on Merger, the Government introduced the National Referendum Bill. But today, the Singapore (Elections to the Federal House of Representatives) Bill has been introduced by the Government in this House without allowing the House a debate on the Malaysia Agreement. According to the Order Paper,

the item on the Malaysia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



Agreement will be debated next Monday. This attitude

of  the  Government  is more undemocratic  and  more

dictatorial   than  that  shown  to   the   National

Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this House cannot be made a kind of blank cheque by the P.A.P. which would authorise them to fill in the amount of money on the cheque. Before we make out a blank cheque, we should know in advance the purpose of the cheque, that is, whether it is correct or whether it is for the right use.

Even up till today we do not know the purpose of the

cheque.  The Malaysia Bill is still in the  despatch

bag  of the Prime Minister. Members on this side  of

the  House are still in the dark about the  Malaysia

Agreement  and the Malaysia Bill. Yet the Government

is asking the House to pass the Singapore (Elections

to the Federal House of Representatives) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we cannot and must not be made use of by the P.A.P. for their personal interests. Mr Speaker, the Government has introduced this Bill in this way. There is a saying - counting your chickens before they are hatched. In the same way, the Government is making use of this House to pass a Bill to hold an election of 15 representatives to

the   Central   Parliament.  This   Bill   is   very

undemocratic.  We should understand the  reason  why

the   Government  introduce  a  Bill  that  is  more

undemocratic  than  the  National  Referendum  Bill.

Their  motive is to preserve their future  political

life  so  that they could have seats in the  Federal

House of Representatives, and hey have therefore put

aside anything that is democratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the P.A.P. is thinking of sending their representatives to the House of Representatives. The Deputy Prime Minister has pointed out to the House that the Singapore representatives elected under this Bill will stay in Parliament for six years. From what the Deputy Prime

Minister  and  the  Minister for Home  Affairs  have

said,  we  can  see  the  purpose  of  their  urgent

introduction  of  this Bill. We  can  also  see  the

motive behind it - that the P.A.P. Ministers are very

concerned  about  their  places  in  the  House   of

Representatives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was about three weeks ago when the Minister for

Home  Affairs, who is also the Organising  Secretary

of  the  P.A.P., held a meeting of the  Bukit  Timah

Branch  of  the P.A.P. He said that in the elections

to  the Federal Parliament, the P.A.P. would be able

to  gain 13 seats; the other two seats would perhaps

be  gained  by  U.M.N.O. He therefore  urged  P.A.P.

members  to find out their positive chances  in  the

elections.  He  also  told  the  cadres   that   the

elections  would begin in the middle of  August  and

polling  day would be around the end of  August.  We

can  also see that the P.A.P. is making full use  of

the  Work  Brigade, People's Association  and  Party

members for election purposes. The Minister for Home

Affairs  also  told the cadres that  if  the  P.A.P.

could  get 13 seats in the elections to the  Federal

House of Representatives, they would then be able to

do  propaganda  work in the Federal  Parliament.  In

this  way, they would be able to continue to control

the  State  Legislature and would also  be  able  to

influence  the  Malay voters in the  Federation  and

also a certain number of Chinese voters. Thus, after

15 years, the Prime Minister would be able to become

the  Prime  Minister of Malaysia. Mr  Speaker,  all

this  was  said  three weeks ago by  the  Organising

Secretary of the P.A.P. to Party cadres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what the Minister for Home Affairs said to the

cadres,  we can see that the P.A.P. is quite certain

of  getting  into the Federal Parliament.  But  this

self-confidence  is not due to the  support  of  the

people behind them but to their introduction of this

Bill  which  enables them to play dirty  games  like

carrying out dishonest elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if this Bill gets through its Third Reading today, then tomorrow the Yang di-Pertuan Negara will be able to give his assent and so make this Bill a law. And on Monday when this House debates the Malaysia Agreement, which is expected to end on Thursday, as said by the Deputy Prime

Minister yesterday, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  will

give  his  assent to the Malaysia Bill on  Saturday.

And  a week later the Government can hold elections.

That is the motive behind this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the P.A.P. not dare to hold elections in a

fair  and  honest  way but wants to  monopolise  the

elections? Why does it want to hold a snap election?

It  is  because  it knows very well that  under  the

White Paper merger agreement, control of the Police,

Television and Broadcasting and the Press will go to

the  Central Government after 31st August, 1963.  So

if  these elections are held after 31st August  they

will  not  have the control of these departments  as

they  do  now,  in  which case they  will  not  have

control   of  the  Work  Brigade  or  the   People's

Association.  Also  after that  date  the  Singapore

Government will be responsible only for its  day-to-day  administration. The P.A.P. know very well  that

in  future  elections  if they  want  to  hold  mass

rallies, State conferences, there will be nobody  to

attend  them; they got a very good result  from  the

National  Referendum. That is why the Government  is

now  trying  to carry out full-scale television  and

broadcasting work. The Government's intention is  to

monopolise the Federal elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. knows that its prestige is diminishing with the people. Even the Prime Minister himself is not sure of the support of the people of his own constituency. The Hong Lim and Anson by-elections have proved that the P.A.P. is now going down the drain. The Sembawang by-election has been postponed for about one year now. This all the more

shows that even in the coming Sembawang by-election,

the  P.A.P. will suffer a heavy loss. That is why  a

snap  Federal election will be the best  chance  for

the  P.A.P.  If  the  election is  held  fairly  and

democratically, then the P.A.P. oligarchy will  meet

with a disastrous defeat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Hong Lim has said that the

P.A.P. intends to test their safe seats in  the  15

divisions  to see to which constituencies  they  can

send  their representatives. It is because no  other

political Party will know the voting results in  the

51  constituencies, but the Returning  Officer  will

know  the  results. In other words, the P.A.P. will

know. Mr Speaker, the calculation of the votes  for

this Federal election will enable the P.A.P. to know

the  reaction  of  the people. The  first  time  the

P.A.P. tested



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



the  people's intention was on the 1st of September,

1962, when the National Referendum was held, so that

the   P.A.P. could  know  their  strength  in   the

respective  constituencies. Since then,  after  this

one year of propaganda by the P.A.P., the P.A.P. is

now trying to assess the opinions and the wishes  of

the  people to see whether their propaganda  in  the

past  year  has  been  successful  and  whether  the

reaction  of  the  people  is  favourable  to  them.

Therefore,  under these circumstances, the  P.A.P.'s

intention  is  to assess their strength  in  the  51

constituencies. That is the intrigue of  the  P.A.P.

behind this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance which is sufficient for us to carry out our elections in the 15 Parliament constituencies. The only difference is that these 51 constituencies will be grouped into 15 constituencies and the Electoral Registers are the

same. There is no difficulty in this. However,  this

Bill  which has been introduced by the Minister  for

Home  Affairs  is contrary to the present  Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the business of elections is a national matter. It is not a party matter. However, the Government regards the election of these 15 representatives as its own party affair. Therefore, they have now introduced a Bill which is a departure from our present Singapore Legislative Assembly

Elections Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 3 of this Bill provides that the Minister be given powers to make rules and regulations. These powers are just like powers given to an emperor and the order or edict of the Minister will become the law of the country. In the past, the first Schedule to the Elections Ordinance provides

for  23 forms. If this amending Bill is passed,  the

present  Elections Ordinance will give the  Minister

power  to  change  or amend all  the  forms  in  the

Schedule.  Does  it  mean  that  the  Minister,   in

introducing   these  amendments,  can  assure   that

parliamentary democracy can be smoothly carried  out

and can be more effective so that the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



will  have  more  confidence  in  our  parliamentary

system? On the contrary, this Bill shows clearly  to

the  people that there is no democracy in Singapore.

Mr Speaker, the 23 forms provide for Party symbols,

the  nomination  of candidates, the  appointment  of

election  agents and the counting of ballot  papers,

etc.  But  if  this  Ordinance  is  amended  by  the

Government, the Minister for Home Affairs will  have

all  the  powers to alter all the procedures adopted

in  the  past  for  election purposes.  Under  these

circumstances, to whom will this be of advantage? Of

course,  it  is  to  the  P.A.P.  This  will  be   a

disadvantage to all the Opposition Parties  and  the

people of Singapore. This has been carried on by the

P.A.P. all  along. After passing these  amendments,

the procedures for elections used in the past can be

altered  by the Minister. Under these circumstances,

how  can  other  Parties carry  out  their  election

campaigns? We know that the Government is ready with

all  their candidates and election officers. At  the

same  time,  the  staff in the Elections  Department

have  already  started writing out  election  cards.

This  work  was speeded up two weeks ago  when  they

called  in students to help in this job. The tabling

of this Bill and the acts of the Government can only

lead  us  to  this conclusion. After the passing  of

these amendments, the Opposition Parties will not be

able to carry out their election campaigns within 10

to 12 days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the printing presses in Singapore dare not print our propaganda material because of the many restrictions imposed by the Minister for Home Affairs, particularly on the Barisan Sosialis. How can we then carry out our propaganda work within 10 to 12 days? We will not be able to carry out our

election campaign within this short period.  If  the

Government  will not alter the First Schedule,  then

the  Opposition Parties will be able  to  carry  out

their  work  according  to  the  provisions  in  the

Schedule  and the law. But after these  changes  are

made,  we will not be able to follow past procedures

in carrying out our election campaigns. We will have

to wait for an announcement by the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



Home  Affairs  before we can carry out our  election

campaigns.  He  will not announce  the  changes  and

amendments  to the forms in time. We have  seen  how

the  Singapore National Referendum Bill was  debated

one  day and made law the very next day, and  within

two weeks polling was carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on the election of the future 15 seats

to  the Federal House of Representatives, the P.A.P.

will  do the same thing; that is, they will announce

the  date of polling day immediately after the  Bill

has  been  passed. Thus the Opposition  Parties  are

placed  in  a very difficult position to  carry  out

their  election  campaigns. On the other  hand,  the

P.A.P. are in control of all the media of publicity,

like television, the radio and Rediffusion. In fact,

they  have been carrying out their election campaign

for  the last few months. Under these circumstances,

they   think   they  will  be  able  to   elect   13

representatives and that U.M.N.O. will only get  two

seats. This is their line of propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the passing of this Bill will be the death knell of parliamentary democracy in Singapore. The provisions of this Bill contain various undemocratic features. In Committee, we will point out and expose the Government's motive in introducing this Bill. If the Government really want

to  carry out the election in an unfair way, then it

is  the  P.A.P. who  want to destroy  parliamentary

democracy,  and the Opposition Parties will  not  be

held responsible for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the 13 P.A.P. plutocrats will be elected to

the  Federal  House of Representatives is  merely  a

daydream, like a soap bubble which will burst  in  a

few minutes. Their dream is only a fancy.



<br><br>4.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

objectionable  features to this Bill. The  principal

one   is  the  traditional  loophole  whereby   this

Government  gives itself the power to fix  the  date

for  the  election at such time as pleases itself.

Knowing this Government, it is not unreasonable  to

assume that what it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



seek  to  do  is, under the camouflage of ostensible

expenditure for merger celebrations, to work for the

election  of  the P.A.P. candidates, and  perhaps  a

week  before Merger Day to have voting day in  order

to  garner the goodwill of public money spent in the

party interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the normal course, that is an issue which the

Opposition  could well negotiate with  a  Government

that  is  constitutional in approach, by seeking  an

amendment  which  would satisfy  the  Opposition  as

regards  the date for this election. But the  P.A.P.

has   consistently  treated  this  House   and   the

Opposition  with  contempt, as it  has  treated  the

people of Singapore with contempt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A much wider issue was raised by the Deputy Prime

Minister  yesterday and I would like your indulgence

to  call  the attention of Members of this House  to

it.  The  Deputy Prime Minister - I am  referring  to

page  61 of the Unrevised Transcript, Vol. 21 No.  1

dated 24th July, 1963 - made it quite clear that  the

Government considered this Bill a "crucial" Bill and

that  if there was a defeat on this Bill then  there

would  be elections for the 51 constituencies,  that

is  to say, the Government will resign. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  on this wider issue, there can be no question.

Now  that  one  sees on whatever orders  the  former

S.P.A. had to co-operate with the Government  until

merger  agreement was reached, those orders  are  no

longer  in force with the Alliance and they  perhaps

can  act according to their consciences. No one  can

but vote for the downfall of this Government who  is

a citizen of this country and who thinks only of the

latest  and  greatest  evil  they  have  perpetrated

without   mandate  from  the  people   and   without

consultation with this House - that is the ending  of

our  traditional economic pattern of life - the ending

of  our  free port status. I am happy to learn  that

all  Opposition Members are solidly in agreement and

that  all  are here to vote. The people of Singapore

have suffered enough. In four years, the P.A.P. has

caused  more damage than the British in  140  years.

They  have  caused more damage than any group  could

cause to a comparable mass of people except



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



in  time  of  war. It is problematic  that  we  will

survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have through the Referendum debate learned

conclusively  and publicly that this  Government  is

fundamentally  dishonest. The end of our  free  port

status  without reference to the people and to  this

House  proves  to  us that this Government  is  evil

beyond any boundary which we can conceive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to vote solidly with my colleagues, whatever

are  our  differences, on this  side  of  the  House

against the Government for the end of this reign  of

evil.  I know not what the future brings. But,  Sir,

we  must have faith that the people of Singapore are

capable    of    producing   something   worthwhile.

Meanwhile,  there can be but this one objective  - an

end  to  this evil that has laid low the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, never have the

Opposition been in a tighter spot than they  are  in

today  over  this Bill to provide 15 representatives

to the Central Government. On previous occasions, it

was  the  Barisan Sosialis who were  in  a  zugzwang

position - any move meant disaster.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> You are in a zugzwang

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Today they are in a super zugzwang

in that it involves not only the Communists who have

only  36 days before Nemesis overtakes them but also

the  Right-wing S.P.A., the wingless U.P.P. and  the

motherless Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, the Member for Anson in his

concluding speech probably summed up the attitude of

mind  of  an opportunistic, witless Barisan Sosialis

and  their  supporters. He said, "Let us bring  this

Government  down. But I do not know what the  future

will  bring."  That is the attitude.  They  are  not

interested  in  the future. They are  interested  in

bringing the Government down. Well, Sir, this is the

super zugzwang the Opposition is in, because we have

entered  a  new phase. This is the phase  after  the

battle for merger,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



and  Malaysia has been won. The position bluntly and

honestly  is  this. The Opposition is  opposing  the

Bill   not  because,  as  they  have  claimed,   the

provisions in the Bill are improper or because  they

believe  that  the  elections  will  be  dishonestly

conducted or because the provisions are so  weighted

as  to  favour  the Government in any election,  hut

because  the Opposition, ranging from the  Communist

Barisan Sosialis, the Communist confrontationists in

Singapore to the U.P.P. and the S.P.A., do not  want

to face an election.



<br><br>4.17 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all their brave and bombastic talk inside and

outside the Assembly during the past two years  that

the  P.A.P. Government was a discredited  force  and

that  the  masses were only waiting for a chance  to

show  their disapproval of the Government, the blunt

truth is that the Opposition and the Communist front

confrontationists in the Barisan Sosialis, the Right-wing  S.P.A.,  the U.P.P. and the Member  for  Anson - are  today  terrified  of  facing  the  electorate.

During  the  past  two years, the  Opposition  could

afford to fling wild challenges at the Government to

resign  or otherwise to test its strength by way  of

elections.   They   knew  they  could   make   these

challenges   safely  because  the   Government   was

determined  to see merger and Malaysia  through,  to

discharge  its election promises and to bring  about

merger  and  Malaysia.  The  S.P.A. knew  that  the

Government  was not going to jeopardise  merger  and

Malaysia by embarking upon elections or by a show of

strength  with  the  electorate  which  would   only

provide    the    anti-Malaysia   Communists    with

opportunities  to divert public attention  from  the

main issue of merger and Malaysia. Knowing this, the

S.P.A. could  safely challenge  the  Government  to

resign  or fight this or that election and thus  try

to  build up an image of a Government too scared  to

face the people in an electoral contest. For our own

part,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we put up  with  all

these  taunts, knowing full well that after we  have

seen merger and Malaysia through safely we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



could  call  the S.P.A. bluff. The Barisan  Sosialis

are  safely  in their seats. They have  not  quitted

their  seats. But they challenged the Government  to

resign,  knowing  full  well that  this  Government,

whatever its other shortcomings, is single-minded in

purpose.  We  have  said we will  get  Malaysia  and

merger  through, and we have got it. The  Communists

in  the  Barisan Sosialis and their confrontationist

allies, whose stooges they have become in Singapore,

will  find  out in 36 days - tomorrow it will  be  35

days;  the  day  after tomorrow 34 days -  that  this

Government is purposive and calculating and  is  not

going  to  be deviated from its objective of  merger

and Malaysia until it has merger and Malaysia safely

in the bag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for two years we have put up with these

taunts.  Today  we  have seen  merger  and  Malaysia

through safely, despite attempts by the Barisan,  by

some   of   the  S.P.A. leaders  pressurising   the

Government into betraying the interests of Singapore

and  handing  them over, especially in the  case  of

certain S.P.A. leaders, bound over hand and foot, to

certain M.C.A. Senators and other M.C.A. elements in

search  of  loot  and  prey in Singapore.  Now  that

Malaysia  and merger are safely in the  bag  and  on

terms  fair and just to both the people of Singapore

and  of  Malaysia, we have called the S.P.A. bluff,

and, as is to be expected, they are in a panic. This

panic  burst through all the bluster and  rhetorical

bombast  of the Member for Cairnhill yesterday.  His

thesis,  for  the best part of two years,  has  been

that the P.A.P. is a discredited force, that it dare

not  face the electorate, because the electorate  is

dying  to vote for an S.P.A. Government. I beg  your

pardon, Sir, The Singapore Alliance. It is no longer

the S.P.A. It is not S.P.A. but S.A. Sir, the P.A.P.

Government is as obliging as ever. It is giving  the

S.P.A. and the Barisan Sosialis a chance  to  prove

their thesis, that the 600,000 electors of Singapore

are   eager  to  show  their  disapproval   of   the

Government and its policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has been mourning about

the Sembawang by-election. What about the Sembawang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



by-election?  Sir, the Sembawang by-election  cannot

be  - though it would be held - a true indication of

the  feelings of the people of Singapore,  1,700,000

of  them. And, therefore, a nation-wide election for

15  seats where 600,000 electors can indicate  their

attitude  towards  the P.A.P., towards  any  of  the

other  political  Parties, a  better  indication  of

public feeling in Singapore. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen)</b>: Order.

confrontationists, people who sell out to  gentlemen

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we always

believe  in  allowing dying gentlemen to  say  their

last   words,  and  I  am  not  put   off   by   the

interjections of the Member for Queenstown.  But  if

the purpose is to determine which of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



political Parties enjoy the confidence and trust  of

the  people  of  Singapore as a  whole,  then  these

elections  for the 15 seats are more pertinent  than

the  by-election in Sembawang. In the elections  for

the  15 seats, the electorate in Sembawang too  will

get  a  chance to make known their attitudes towards

the  various  Parties  and  to  the  Government   in

particular.  Therefore, Sir,  instead  of  welcoming

this  Bill and pressing the Government to have  this

by-election as soon as possible and thus proving  to

the  Federation M.C.A. leaders that the  S.P.A. has

the backing of the people -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Alliance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I notice, Sir, that I was reading

last month's issue Volume 5. No. 2. The People.  The

symbol  in  the  organ  of  the  Singapore  People's

Alliance  is a peculiar looking wheel. In Volume  5,

No.  3,  the wheel has vanished, Sir, and we have  a

slow  boat to China. This is an indication  of  what

the  political trends are. Sir, I will come to  that

later  on.  For  the time being, as far  as  we  are

concerned,  it is the S.P.A., the S.A., or  whatever

they like to call themselves. But I am referring not

to  the  Singapore  Alliance but  to  a  constituent

member   of   the  Singapore  Alliance,  because   I

understand the Singapore Alliance consists  of  many

political Parties, of which the S.P.A. is one, if  I

am not wrong. So they have got a chance, through the

elections  for  the 15 seats, to  prove  to  certain

Federation  M.C.A. leaders who have been  trying  to

interfere in Singapore politics, trying to build  up

their  outfit  at  the expense of the  Singaporeans.

Instead of the S P.A. welcoming this chance to  show

that  the  people of Singapore reject the policy  of

the  present  Government, we  find  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  in a blue funk over the prospects  of  an

election. It is true that he tried to cover  up  his

panic  yesterday by a rhetorical bombast  about  his

readiness to go to Tanjong Pagar and take the  Prime

Minister  on. As far as I can recollect, the  Member

for  Cairnhill has never fought an election  in  the

same constituency twice nor under the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



banner  twice. Like the lightning, he never  strikes

in  the  same place twice. Like Lon Chaney, a famous

actor who is now dead, the Member for Cairnhill is a

master of political disguise. He is the Hunchback of

Notre  Dime one day, he is the Phantom of the  Opera

the  next  day. He is a man of a thousand  political

faces. So if he has decided to move out of Cairnhill - I  do  not know if it is in deference to the  Member

for  Tanglin,  because when we  start  grouping  the

constituencies there will be a deal of trouble as to

which Member should stand in which constituency  - in

search of fresh political pastures in Tanjong Pagar,

he  is  only running true to form. Of course, he  is

welcome  to go to Tanjong Pagar because I  think  he

can well afford to lose his deposit. Between now and

the  elections,  he  may have  second  thoughts,  of

course, about going to Tanjong Pagar if he discovers

(as the Member for Anson discovered last Sunday)

that  he  cannot  profitably exploit  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board  issue.  I  notice  the  Member   for

Cairnhill has suddenly become interested in the same

issue  as the Barisan - how to exploit the discontent

and  strife in the Harbour Board. In fact, long  ago

the  Member  for Cairnhill revealed his interest  in

Mr Markandu. Mr Markandu approached the Member for

Cairnhill  to  take up this issue.  The  Member  for

Anson  tried to intervene by holding a meeting  last

Sunday  in  the  hope of exploiting the  issue.  The

Barisan  Sosialis, in anticipation of  confrontation - you  can see in the newspapers today that they  are

passing  arms and troops - are going to work  up  and

start  off a strike in the Harbour Board. The Member

for  Anson,  however, decided to cash in first,  and

rushed  in. On Friday, after announcing that he  had

applied  for a meeting to be held at Anson, he  said

that  the  Government were going to  oppose  it.  In

fact, we had not the slightest intention of opposing

him,  but  he  wanted to build up an  atmosphere  of

tension.  But fortunately on that Friday  the  Prime

Minister  himself  went  to  the  Harbour  Board  to

resolve the issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen)</b>: Order. Perhaps the

Hon. Minister is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



going too much into detail. We are now debating  the

Singapore  (Elections  to  the  Federal   House   of

Representatives)  Bill  and not  the  Harbour  Board

issue, and I would ask the Minister to come back  to

the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all this

is  pertinent  to the question as to why  Opposition

Members  are opposing this Bill. It is because  they

have other ulterior motives and it is necessary,  in

the  interests  of the public, to  show  what  their

motives  are.  Therefore, Sir, I am not  going  into

details. But since the Member for Cairnhill  brought

up  this issue yesterday - that he was asked  by  Mr

Markandu who was sitting with the Prime Minister  on

the  platform  but had nothing to  say  because  the

Communists  were manipulating him - he had  shown  an

interest  in this political issue, which the  Member

for  Anson also tried to response by going there  on

Sunday  and  trying to hold a meeting;  but  it  had

fizzled  out.  He  got about 300 children,  or  that

number  with  their  parents, and  when  he  shouted

"Majulah Singapura" there was no response. He  asked

for  questions; no response. So he got into his  car

and  drove  away. Now the Member for  Cairnhill  has

decided  to step in. Sir, in the first elections  in

Singapore, I think he stood in Anson -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Keppel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Keppel, that is right. After that,

he  decided  to  move  into Havelock,  and  then  to

Cairnhill  - a  promotion from a real  working  class

area  to  a real plutocratic area, but now even  the

plutocrats have learnt to distrust him -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Next stop - Tanjong Pagar!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Back he goes, at least he claims,

to Tanjong Pagar. Sir, these are indications of what

the  Member  for Cairnhill's complete cycle  is, in

view of possible developments and despite what might

happen  in  the Harbour Board - and I can assure  the

Member  that the matter will be resolved - I hope  he

will  keep his promise of going to Tanjong Pagar.  I

am  quite sure that there he will be joined  by  the

Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



for  Hong Lim who is also anxious to fight the Prime

Minister.  I shall be very happy to see  both  these

gentlemen  in  that locality, one returning  to  the

scene  of  his  crimes and the other venturing  into

another dangerous adventure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is that the S.P.A., for all their

bombastic  talk about the people being fed  up  with

P.A.P  rule, are not prepared to put this thesis  to

the test by way of election to the 15 seats.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I would ask Ministers on that

side  to  remember that it is the Singapore Alliance

that they will have to meet, and not the S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, we are capable of

differentiating between the sheep and the goats;  we

know  which  is  the sheep and which  is  the  goat.

Whether they call themselves the S.P.A. or S.A.,  we

shall differentiate between the A. and the S.  I  am

only  interested in one thing, if I am not mistaken,

perhaps I should explain their own Party's structure

to  the Member for Cairnhill. The S.P.A. organ  used

to  be  printed  in black; now it is  n  blue.  This

emblem,  the wheel or the roda, has now  become  The

People  introducing the Singapore Alliance of  UMNO-MCA-MIC-SPA. Its price is 10 cts. and I notice, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. From what the Minister

is  saying,  it  looks  as if we  are  debating  the

formation  of  the Singapore Alliance  and  not  the

Elections Bill. I think the Minister has replied  to

the point raised by the Member for Cairnhill and has

made the Government's stand, and I would suggest  to

him to come back to the Bill we are now debating.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Thank you, Sir, but I am sure I am

not  misleading anybody by distinguishing the S.P.A.

from  the  S.A. For example, Sir, in Vol. 5,  No.  2

issue of The People - it was then still a concern  of

the  S.P.A. - there was an editorial. This issue  is

the last issue of the S.P.A. before it was caught up

by the S.A. This editorial is entitled "P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



must go". Perhaps it is pertinent for me to explain

under what circumstances the editorial was written.

It was written at a time when the M.C.A. -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> What has this S.P.A. editorial

got to do with the Bill before the House, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order.

The Member should have waited to hear what the

Minister has to say first. And if what the Minister

says has nothing to do with the Bill, then he could

rise on a point of order. Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Barisan is so perturbed at

the  wide  publicity  given to the  S.P.A.,  but  in

course  of  time  I  shall  give  equally  notorious

publicity to the Barisan too. I hope you could be  a

little bit more patient while I deal with the S.P.A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editorial is called "P.A.P. must go". Why?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This is the slogan ringing in the hearts of a vast

majority  of men and women of Singapore - the  rural

people,  the  trade unionists, taxi  drivers,  petty

traders,  businessmen,  civil servants,  housewives,

and so on.'



<br><br>Sir, if this is the slogan "ringing in the hearts of

the  people", then why is the S.P.A. opposed to this

Bill?  It  may  be  that what the  S.P.A. want  are

elections  to  the 51 seats. If that  is  what  they

want,  they  can  bring that about quite  easily  by

voting against this Bill and thus preventing us from

having  elections  first to  the  15  seats  to  the

Central  Parliament.  It  is  very  simple.  If  the

"P.A.P. must go" - that was the clarion cry  of  the

S.P.A. and not of the Singapore Alliance, because it

has  no  editorial to that effect  - they  can  bring

about  elections  to the 51 seats  first  by  voting

against this Bill. The S P.A. and the Opposition can

have whichever way they want - first the elections to

the  15  seats  in  the Central  Parliament  or  the

elections to the 51 seats. But before they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



make  up  their  minds, it is necessary  for  me  to

explain why they should very carefully consider  the

decision  they make - which elections do they  first

want? Let me make it quite clear, Sir, that a defeat

for  the Government in the elections to the 15 seats

would  in itself amount to a vote of censure on  the

Government  by  the  people of  Singapore,  and  the

holding  of  elections to the  51  seats,  including

Sembawang, would become inevitable. It is  a  matter

of  their deciding which they want first. But  there

is  one  good  and  responsible  reason  why  it  is

necessary,  in the interests of merger and  Malaysia

and  of  the people of Singapore, to hold first  the

elections to the 15 seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is necessary for me to make it quite

clear why the Government want first the elections to

the  15  seats. The Barisan knows it and  maybe  the

S.P.A. also realises it. The Barisan knows that  if

elections  to  the  15 seats were held  first,  that

would  bury them completely. The Government has  not

brought this proposal for elections to the 15  seats

first  to  frustrate the S.P.A. or anybody.  We  are

carrying  on  the fight against the Communists,  and

that  is why we have brought in this proposal.  They

know it. I will explain why by holding elections  to

the  15 seats it will frustrate the plan of the pro-Communists,   confrontationists,  and  the   Barisan

Sosialis, as a last-minute attempt, to wreck  merger

and  Malaysia. The S.P.A. may not be aware of  this,

but perhaps in their desperation and greed they have

become  oblivious to this obvious danger  to  merger

and  Malaysia from these Communist confrontationists

in  Singapore.  As far as the P.A.P. is  concerned,

these  elections  to the 15 seats are  part  of  our

strategy  to deal yet another blow at the Communists

and  crush their desperate attempt to wreck Malaysia

and     give    supporting    action    for    their

confrontationist  friends  massing  elsewhere.   The

Communists  in  the  Barisan  Sosialis  realise  the

danger  posed to them by our proposals by this  Bill

to  have elections first for the 15 seats, and  that

is  why  they too are opposing this Bill  under  one

pretext or the other. It is ironical. Sir, that this

time the Communists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



should  have  as  their  allies  in  this  fight   to

frustrate and sabotage merger and Malaysia, the Right-wing  and  opportunist group in the S.P.A.  When  the

Member  for Cairnhill yesterday appealed to  all  the

Opposition  to unite to defeat this Bill, the  bleary

eyes  of the despondent Barisan Sosialis lit up  with

fresh  hope.  They saw in the attitude of  the  S.P.A

adventurers an opportunity to stave off elections for

the 15 seats which could well mean the end of Barisan

Sosialis   hopes  of  capturing  power  in  Singapore

through  immediate general elections.  The  point  is

that  elections  for the 15 seats  do  not  suit  the

strategic  aims of the anti-Malaysia confrontationist

Communists   in   the  Barisan   Sosialis.   In   the

unlikelihood of their winning the 15 seats, then they

would  not be capturing State power. They know  that.

They  can  win  all  the  15  seats  to  the  Central

Parliament.  They  know they are  not  capturing  any

power  because in an assembly of well over 100 seats,

15  seats do not give them effective political  power

to  carry out their anti-Malaysia, anti-merger,  pro-confrontationist  policy.  Their  15  seats  in   the

Central  Parliament  could  give  them  no  power  to

sabotage  Malaysia. Even if they are not calculating,

their  masters are calculating. If in  the  event  of

their winning the majority of the 15 seats, they know

the consequences for them would be even more serious.

Because  if they should win the majority  of  the  15

seats, that would only result in a mobilising of  all

nationalist   pro-merger  forces  against   them   in

preparation  for the 51 seats. It will  result  in  a

sequence  of  events which would lead  to  the  utter

annihilation  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis.   But   the

prospects are that the Communists, provided we do not

have  any  adventurous policies on the  part  of  the

S.P.A  resulting  in confusing the  people,  will  be

decisively  defeated  in the  elections  for  the  15

seats.  In  other words, Sir, if they  win  they  get

nothing; if they lose, they lose everything  - the  15

seats.  That is part of our strategy. That is why  we

have  the elections for the 15 seats first. They know

it. They laugh, they smile, but -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> You are cheating yourself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir. We are outwitting them as

we have outwitted them in the referendum, and we will

continue  to outwit them till they go back  to  their

confrontationist friends outside of  Singapore.  That

is our objective. We are going to drive every traitor

out  of Singapore to go and tie-up with their friends

outside.  That  is  what we intend  to  do  and  will

continue  to  do.  This is the second  phase  of  our

strategy. The first phase was defeating them  in  the

referendum.  Now we will start on the  second  phase.

They know that the noose is around their necks and we

will  carry on hounding them and destroying  them  so

that  they  can never be here to play the  traitorous

role that they have assigned to themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, the real fear of the Ban-san

Sosialis is that if we have the elections for the  15

seats,  they  know they will be decisively  defeated.

Their  stocks are pretty low. A very good  indication

was  at a meeting. An indication of the low depth  to

which the morale of the Communists had sunk was  when

the  Prime  Minister had a meeting  in  Hong  Lim.  A

Barisan  Sosialis  union  put  up  lights  and  black

banners  mourning Malaysia. The Prime  Minister  just

made  a  reference and, in fact, read out this banner

condemning  Malaysia and that the Prime Minister  had

sold  out the people of Singapore. It was given  free

publicity   over  the  radio  and  television.   What

happened? The lights went off. They scooted. That was

what the Communists never did. In 1954/55 they fought

back, Today we only make fun of them and they run for

cover.  Thousands  of  people  were  watching   them.

Television cameras caught them running and  scooting.

I  understand  that  a few days later  there  was  an

inquiry  at  the same premises to find  out  why  the

Communists were scooting away before the eyes of  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our duty, in bringing this election for

the  15 seats first, not to hound the S.P.A. or  even

the U.P.P. but to carry on the real fight against the

Communists. Because we know their stocks  are  pretty

low and that is why even the Member for Hong Lim, who

all  this  while  had avoided attacking  the  Barisan

Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



directly, has now picked up enough political courage

to  attack them openly and with impunity. The Member

for  Hong Lim knows the Barisan Sosialis are on  the

way  out  and all that he is interested  in  at  the

moment  is inheriting their car-cases. He is a  very

cautious man. He is not in the habit of hitting  out

at  people who he knows may hit back at him. But now

he  knows  he  can hit back at the Barisan  Sosialis

without any fear that they can hit back, so much  so

that  even in the controversy, he, a one-man  party,

silenced  the Barisan Sosialis outfit. They  had  no

come-back and no reply. They said, "Please call  off

this  controversy." That is the state of  morale  of

the Communists, the Barisan Sosialis, today -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So what are you so afraid of?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is why they are afraid to go

to elections for the 15 seats -[Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen)</b>: Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They are afraid of that. That is

why they do not want to go and face the election for

the 15 Seats because they will be lucky if they have

their G-strings left -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They do not wear them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They know that. By having elections

to  the  15 seats first, it is the objective of  the

Government  to  crush and paralyse  politically  the

Communist confrontationists as decisively as we  did

crush  them during the referendum. And by paralysing

the  Communist confrontationists politically in  the

elections  for  the 15 seats, we  will  be  able  to

ensure  that  the  Communists  will  not  be  in   a

position,  when the elections for the 51  seats  are

held,  to  capture State power, which is  what  they

want.  They are not interested so much in  capturing

power  in the Central Government where their  forces

or their position cannot be used effectively. By the

process of having elections first for the 15  seats,

we  can ensure that they will not have the slightest

hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



of  ever  being able to capture power in  Singapore.

The    Barisan   Sosialis   and   their    Communist

confrontationists see this clearly. That is why they

are opposing this Bill to have elections for the  15

seats.  What they want now are elections for the  51

seats  first, for different reasons from the  S.P.A.

But  as far as they are concerned, they want to have

elections  for  the  51 seats first.  In  a  general

election they would have a slender chance of winning

State  power  before 31st August  if  possible,  and

repudiating the Malaysia and Merger agreement.  Then

they  can  demand an independent Singapore  and,  if

necessary,  try to implement Mr Lim  Ching  Siong's

plea  for  merger  with Indonesia in  preference  to

merger with Malaya. That is what they want. That  is

why  they are scared to death of elections first  to

the  15  seats.  The  S.P.A. in their  recklessness,

wittingly or unwittingly, helping the Communists  in

their   desperate  last-minute  effort  to  sabotage

Malaysia -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Prime Minister sleeping with

the Communists!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir. It is one thing to sleep

with  the Communists and be able to get out of  bed,

but it is another thing to sleep with the Communists

and be dead -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You will not be able to get out

of bed this time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, whether wittingly or

unwittingly, by opposing elections to the  15  seats

first,   the  S.P.A. are  indirectly  helping   and

encouraging the Communists to forget what they  want

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- elections to the 51 seats. This is what we meant

when we said that the Right-wing S.P.A. are no match

for  the Communists who can, as they have repeatedly

shown,   outwit   and  outmanoeuvered   the   S.P.A.

Therefore, Sir, these elections to the 15 seats  are

primarily  intended once again as in the  referendum

to conscribe the Communists by forcing them to fight

in  an  election  in which they will be  politically

annihilated -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Are you not trying to catch the

does not even know whether -

<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen)</b>: I have  reminded

the hon. Member for Queenstown that if he wishes  to

interjections are becoming too disorderly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Member for Queenstown has

caught  Aidit's eye because he has been  invited  to

Medan,   I   understand,   to   attend   an    anti-confrontationist  meeting at  which  the  people  of

Singapore are going to be shot up and he is going to

sing praises in the honour of the confrontationists.

That is what the Communists have been reduced to, to

being  traitors, to even extol the killing of  their

own  people. The gentlemen will probably be  sending

us wreaths -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Ha, ha! He will send you one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir. Not so long ago, a few

squeak. They always protest against injustices  here

and  there. But a few of our own people got shot up,

fishermen  got  shot up. Where were the  Communists,

the  Barisan Communists? Did they protest? Did  they

denounce? You, the Communists, have now been reduced

to  the  lowest form of treachery - conniving at  and

supporting the murder of your own people -

elections  tomorrow for the 15 seats, they  will  be

running  for cover. Because the people are ready  to

meet you. They know what you are. They know what the

Communists, the Barisan Sosialis, are. I  have  just

said  that  they  had  to run away  from  Hong  Lim,

scooting  for cover in front of about 6,000  people,

caught by the television cameras, seen by a few more

thousand  people. That is the state of  the  Barisan

Communists, confrontationists, today. This is what I

mentioned earlier when I said that this is  a  super

zugzwang. Not that zugzwang -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I believe the Minister will

take some time more?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It is better to suspend now. I

suspend the sitting until half-past five.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>5.00 until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was saying that

today  the Opposition is in the position of a  super

zugzwang.  I  was  explaining why  we  think  it  is

necessary to have elections first for the 15  seats.

The  main  objective  to  pursue  is  to  block  the

Communists last-minute effort to sabotage merger and

Malaysia.  But the S.P.A., the Member for Anson  and

the U.P.P. can help the Communists to get out of the

super  zugzwang by defeating this Bill. If what  the

Opposition  want  are elections for  the  51  seats,

well,  let the elections for the 51 seats take place

first. I understand that the Member for Anson is  in

here  for the kill, as he was telling the Press  and

everybody. Yes, Sir, there will be a kill,  and  the

toreador will be the P.A.P. exhibiting his  ears  to

the audience and to the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was wondering why we should

suddenly become so bloody!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I was just following a metaphor,

that  the  Member  for Anson is  in  for  the  kill.

Speaking metaphorically, there will be a toreador to

exhibit the ears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, obviously it is up to the Opposition to

help  or  not  help  the  Communists  out  of  their

position of super zugzwang.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> So we are all Communists, Sir!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Anson has been in

the  habit  of  running with the  Barisan  hare  and

hunting with the pro-Malaysia hounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> So has the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> One thing about the Member for

Anson  is that he never learns his lesson. He played

"hooty-hooty" with the Communists, and his Party was

lost.  Today  he  is  a motherless  orphan  prowling

around  Anson  in  the hope that  he  could  exploit

situations  created by the Barisan. As it  is,  last

Sunday  he was there ready to help put out the  fire

with  tins  of  kerosine  he  was  pouring  in.  But

unfortunately for him, there were 300 gentlemen  who

were  not  even  interested in  his  report  to  the

nation. He made one of his rare reports - it was  his

third  report  by  which he  hoped  to  exploit  the

situation in the Harbour Board. It turned out to  be

a flop. Anyway, Sir, that is his business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble with running with the hare and hunting

with  the  hounds  is  that  the  hounds  insist  on

regarding  him  as  a  hare:  the  hare  insists  on

regarding him as a hound. He gets into trouble  both

ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the point. We shall know today

whether the Right, wing and other opportunist groups

are  going to help the Communists get out  of  their

difficulty. The S.P.A. have not the slightest chance

of  winning any elections. They know it, whether  it

is  for  the  15  or  for the 51 seats.  If  in  the

unlikely  event of the P.A.P. losing any  elections,

it  would  be the Barisan who would win. They  still

say  that  the biggest force is not the  Barisan  as

such, but the powerful gentlemen behind them. I  see

in today's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



paper, "SOEKARNO THREATENING CONFRONTATION".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, Sir, that things are boiling up. So it is

not  the  Barisan that we are interested in -  these

are 14 gentlemen and gentle ladies whose time is up.

We  are not interested in them nor in the Member for

Anson -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Then, why do they not resign?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - because it is very simple. Whether

it be for 15 or 51 seats, whether in the course of a

few  days  or a few weeks, there will be  a  lot  of

absent faces from this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You will not be here either.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, when the gentleman can go to

Anson and collect 300 disinterested men, I have  not

the  slightest  doubt what his political  future  is

going to be - whether in Anson, Cairnhill, or Tanjong

Pagar.  I hope the Member for Anson will follow  the

good example of the Member for Hong Lim and possibly

the  Member  for Cairnhill by testing strength  with

the Prime Minister in Tanjong Pagar. Anyway, I would

suggest  if  the  S.P.A. have the interests  of  the

country  at heart as they claim, then the  elections

to  the  15 seats would show the correctness of  our

analysis as to the potential strength of the various

political Parties in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the S.P.A. and all those Members

of  the  Opposition who, however they  may  disagree

with  us politically, are interested in safeguarding

Malaysia,  that they should support our strategy  of

having  elections  for the 15 seats  first.  If  our

thesis  is  correct,  that  it  is  a  case  of  the

Communists - not the Barisan Sosialis, they  are  the

facade - winning if the P.A.P. loses,  then  the  pro-Malaysia  forces  would  be  able  to  adjust  their

strategy   correctly   and  accordingly   when   the

elections  for the 51 seats are held.  Because  from

the  Communist point of view, the real  struggle  is

not  for the 15 seats but for the 51 seats.  If  the

elections for the 15 seats show that only the S.P.A.

or  the  U.P.P. are the best counters to  the  anti-Malaysia  Communists,  confrontationists,  then  the

people as well as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. would  in the interests of  the  country  be

prepared  to make the necessary adjustment when  the

elections  for the 51 seats are held.  That  is  the

purpose of the 15 seats - testing strength to the  15

seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as the S.P.A. claim, that in the hearts of the

vast majority - the slogan that rings in the hearts

of the vast majority of the people is that "THE P.A.P.MUST GO!" -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Which paper is that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sorry, Sir, it is the S.P.A. organ,

Volume 5, No. 2, before it became the Singapore

Alliance organ -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not interested in that Date?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Volume 5, No. 2, dated 15th June,

1963. But if, as we believe, the best counter to the

Communists is the P.A.P., then elections to  the  15

seats  would  show whether our analysis is  correct,

and  then the other pro-Malaysia groups - whether  of

the  Right, Centre, Left - which want to prevent  the

Communists  from capturing State power in  Singapore

should  make  the necessary adjustment  for  general

elections for the 51 seats. All of us who  are  pro-Malaysia are only interested in countering the anti-Malaysia  elements.  It is no use,  saying,  as  the

Member  for Anson said, "Yes, bring down the P.A.P.,

bring  down  this," and he ended up  his  speech  by

saying,  "I do not know what the future will bring."

We  want to ensure what the future is for the people

of Singapore. The Member for Anson may not care what

the  future brings. He has been in politics;  he  is

not  interested in what the future of the people  in

Singapore is. But we are interested, Sir, and  every

pro-Malaysia element is interested in ensuring  that

Malaysia  is  safeguarded against the  anti-Malaysia

confrontationists,  the  Communists,   the   Barisan

Sosialis in Singapore. That is our objective. If the

elections for the 15 seats show that the P.A.P. is a

discredited  force, then I can assure you  that  the

P.A.P. will allow other forces, who can show to  the

electorate for the 15 seats that they are best  able

to  counter the Communists, to do so; then  we  will

adjust



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



our   policy  accordingly.  That  is  what  we   are

interested in. For two years we have fought hard  to

bring about merger and Malaysia. We are not prepared

to  jeopardise it in the interests of the Communists

or  their  stooges  who hope to  capitalise  on  any

situation that the Communist might create.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, these elections to the 15

seats would be of great help - would be an indication - to the people as well as the pro-Malaysia group to

devise  the correct strategy, an effective strategy,

to  prevent the Communists from capturing  power  in

the general elections. That is the whole purpose  of

this operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis know it.

That  is why they are bitterly opposed to this  Bill

to provide elections for the 15 seats to the Central

Parliament.  That  is why I believe  that  all  pro-Malaysia  groups  in the Opposition  should  support

this  Bill.  If they are opposing this  Bill  simply

because their election prospects are not good,  then

when  the time comes, the inevitable consequence  of

not  having  the elections for the 15 seats  is  the

Communists winning the elections for the  51  seats,

and  the  people  would  also  have  to  make  their

adjustment.  In this connection, Sir, what  are  the

grounds  on  which this Bill is being  opposed?  One

complaint  put  forward by the Member for  Cairnhill

is,  well,  why  hold elections for  the  15  seats?

Because  sometime next year there  will  be  general

elections  for the whole of the Central  Parliament.

You  will be wasting $380,000 for nothing.  But  the

Minister  for Home Affairs has made it  quite  clear

that those who are elected from Singapore for the 15

seats  would  hold  their  seats  until  the  second

dissolution  of  the  Central  Parliament;  so  that

argument falls to the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, this decision to hold elections to

the Central Parliament has the sanction and approval

of  the Federation Government. Therefore this is not

some  plot  cooked  up  by the  P.A.P.  The  Central

Federation  Government itself approves  of  this  in

principle.  What reasons have they  to  oppose  this

Bill?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason has been put forward at least by

The  People  introducing the Singapore  Alliance  of

U.M.N.O., M.C.A., M.I.C. and S.P.A. Volume 5, No. 3,

22nd  July,  1963. They suggest, why have elections,

why not nominate? I will tell you why. Again because

of our own objective to conscribe the Communists and

anti-Malaysia  forces. If we have  nominations  from

this  Chamber, what will be the result? Proportional

nomination?    Who    will    have    the    largest

representation?    The    anti-Malaysia    Communist

confrontationists to have about half - 7 or 8  seats.

So  by  nomination we are giving a free gift to  the

Communists  to get into the Central Parliament!  The

Member   for   Anson,  of  course,  is  opposed   to

nomination because he knows that after the  division

there will be only half the seats left for the other

groups. But, we feel that we should not allow  anti-Malaysia  pro-confrontationists to get  free  seats,

get in by the back door into the Central Parliament.

But,  by  having elections to the 15 seats,  we  can

deal  the Communists a crushing blow; we can  defeat

them. Therefore, the power for a comeback for the 15

seats for the Communists will be reduced to zero  in

the eyes of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Make it 51 seats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Anson  will  get a chance possibly if  he  succeeds.

Wherever he goes, I can guarantee him, that he  will

not   get  a  look-in,  because  in  the  last  1959

elections,  he  could not even contest  against  the

Member  for  Cairnhill. He nearly lost his  deposit.

Every  one  knew  that he won in  Anson  because  of

Communist  support.  [Laughter]  That  is  why  they

laugh,  Sir.  They  know. When he spoke  on  Sunday,

there were only 300 people. During the election when

the   Barisan  Sosialis  and  the  Communists  could

mobilise the crowd, the Member for Anson was  beside

himself  with joy. The whole of Singapore was  there

because they mobilised the crowd. Unless he wants to

go back to run with the hare and experience the same

humiliation that he did when the Communists  pinched

his own Party, as he himself admitted. That is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



my  business. Sir, I am only interested in  ensuring

that  what  we  have struggled for in the  last  two

years  to  get  merger and Malaysia is  safeguarded,

because  after 31st August, the battle  to  preserve

merger and Malaysia enters a new phase. We are going

to  have  other enemies, more powerful ones who  are

going  to  break up merger and Malaysia. A gentleman

has already been invited to Medan to become part  of

the  anti-Malaysia forces. The anti-Malaysia  forces

become  bigger and more powerful and it is our  duty

to see that there is no fifth column in Singapore to

sell  out their own people, to be looted by  outside

forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why we want elections to the

Central Parliament first is that it is necessary  so

that  the  15 who are in the Central Parliament  can

speak  with  authority.  They  can  say  that   they

represent  the people, that they were voted  by  the

people  and  that they are not there on  sufferance,

not  there  because they came in by the  back  door.

Therefore  we must elect these 15 Members to  ensure

that they are there, whoever they are, as people who

can  say that they represent the will of the  people

of  Singapore. It is claimed now that  obviously  we

are  trying  to hold a snap election,  sneak  in  an

election  by  bringing  this Bill.  Sir,  all  these

professions  of  surprise over  this  Bill,  of  the

possibility  of a snap election by the S.P.A. is  a

lot  of  humbug. In the Malayan Times of 24th  June,

1963, before the Prime Minister went to London,  the

Singapore  Alliance  was  preparing  to  fight   for

elections before 31st August. I refer to a news item

entitled "Singapore Alliance To Try All Seats":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The newly formed Singapore Alliance will contest

all  15  seats  allotted to  Singapore  in  the  new

Malaysia  Parliament.  This  was  disclosed  by  the

Secretary-General of U.M.N.O., Singapore, Dato  Syed

Esa Almenoar, today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U M.N.O. leader said that the inaugural meeting

of the Singapore Alliance's new Executive Council to

be  held  tomorrow  would,  amongst  other  matters,

discuss the parliamentary elections expected  to  be

held before Malaysia Day.'



<br><br>This  was  as  far  back as 24th  June,  before  the

Malaysia   Agreement  was  signed.   The   Singapore

Alliance  was working on the basis that there  would

be  elections  before  31st  August.  There  was  no

protest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



Therefore now to say that we are sneaking in a  snap

election  by  bringing  in  this  Bill  is   I   say

completely   not   in  accordance   with   Singapore

Alliance's attitude towards the whole thing prior to

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has been publishing a

series  of  articles  in his paper  saying  that  he

expects  snap  elections before  Malaysia  by  July.

Again   on  11th  July,  1963,  when  the  Singapore

Government  invited the Opposition Members  to  send

representatives  to  a  meeting  to  decide  on  the

delineation  of  51  constituencies,  the  Singapore

Alliance  was  quite prepared to participate  in  it

and, in fact, the S.P.A. Secretary-General. Mr  Lee

Kim  Chuan,  said  that Tun Lim Yew  Hock  had  been

selected  to represent the Party at the meeting  and

added,  "We  are  prepared to  meet  the  P.A.P. at

elections any time, anywhere and anyhow."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Which paper is that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Straits Times, Sir, of 11th

July, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, everybody for the last one month at least has

been  working  on  the  basis  that  there  will  be

elections for the 15 seats soon. What is it that has

made  them  suddenly change their minds: that  there

should be no elections and that it would be improper

to have elections for the Central Parliament as soon

as  possible? May I suggest that I do not know  what

the  reasons  are?  I do not know  who  gives  these

directives.  But  the people of Singapore  would  be

resentful  if  the representatives  to  the  Central

Parliament  should  be by way of  nomination.  Apart

from  other things, this will give a free  voice  to

the  Communists  in the Central Parliament,  to  add

their  voice  to  the  possible  intensification  of

confrontation after 31st August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other objection raised was, "Oh yes, we cannot

trust   this  present  `Government  to  run   honest

elections;  therefore we must oppose the  provisions

of  the  Bill which will ensure crooked  and  unfair

elections." But the Opposition line on this has been

rather  strange.  Under  this  Government,  we  have

tested the will of the electorate three times. First

in  Hong  Lim.  But they say, no,  that  was  honest

because the Government lost; so that must be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



honest.  Anson, the Government lost;  therefore,  it

must be honest. If the Government is crooked, if the

Government  wants to carry out dishonest  elections,

it   is  easy  to  fix  crooked  elections  in   one

constituency. But their argument is this, that in so

far as the Opposition can win an election that is an

honest election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we had the Referendum. The gentlemen were

there:  everybody was there. Before they  lost,  Mr

Lim  Ching Siong was quite confident that they  were

going  to win, that there would be more blank votes.

But  after they lost, when the votes were counted  - they were there till half-past five, six or nine;  I

forget now, throughout the morning - then they  said,

"No,  dishonest Referendum, crooked Referendum."  In

fact,  on one occasion, the Barisan Sosialis  leader

asked  for a recount. We wanted to recount,  but  he

ran  away. Therefore, if they lose an election or  a

cause,  it  must be dishonest. If they  win,  it  is

honest.  Therefore, by implication,  what  are  they

trying  to do now? They are trying to build  up  the

atmosphere  now that any elections held for  the  15

constituencies  will be crooked, because  they  know

that  they are going to lose. So they like to  build

up   the   atmosphere   of  a   crooked   Government

manipulating  and  fixing elections.  Unfortunately,

Sir,  the Member for Cairnhill yesterday echoed  the

Barisan Sosialis propaganda that the referendum  was

fixed  and  dishonest. In his speech,  at  first  he

said, "We cannot trust the Government. It interferes

with the Election Supervisor, and so on." He is also

helping to build up such an atmosphere knowing  full

well what the outcome of the next elections will be.

Therefore, he feels it would be better to  build  up

now  the  image of a dishonest government  which  is

going to fix up the elections. But none of them have

produced any such evidence in the Bill. Is there any

clause  in  the  Bill  which is improper  and  which

suggests  that  the  elections have  been  fixed  in

favour  of  the Government? There have been  general

allegations of possible dishonesty, but no  one  has

said  that  there is anything in the Bill  which  is

improper  and  dishonest. But they  are  not  really

interested in the Bill or in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



provisions of the Bill. What they are afraid  of  is

that  outside  of the Bill the conditions  are  such

that  the  Government  has a  very  good  chance  of

winning an election. That is what they are afraid of - not  of  the provisions of the Bill; we can  change

them  in  any  way we like. They know  that  in  any

elections the Government will win. That is what they

object to  - that the Government should be foolish and

dishonest enough to fight the elections to win. That

is the substance of their charge: this Government is

dishonest  because it is going to an election  at  a

time  when  it knows it will win. What  they  really

want is for the Government to go into an election at

a time when it knows that it will lose. That is what

they  want.  Surely,  Sir,  that  is  nothing.   Any

Government,  whether it is the P.A.P. Government  or

the  S.P.A. government, would like to win at a  time

when it thinks its chances of winning are good. That

is  the purpose of any democratic government, first,

to  do things to ensure that it will win and to have

elections  at  a  time when it  thinks  it  is  most

favourable  to it. That happens in every  democratic

country. Snap elections are held everywhere. We  are

surely  not fools enough to fight an election  at  a

time  when we know we are going to lose, just  like,

say,  two  years ago when the Barisan  deserted  us.

Probably  our  stocks were low then. Probably  there

would  have been great cheers from the Barisan  side

and  the  Communists  if we had gone  for  elections

then.  But during the last two years, thanks to  the

fact  that  these Gentlemen left, we  were  able  to

consolidate  our position, fight and  come  back  to

hound them out of the political arena of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, none of the Opposition Members have

yet  dealt  with the provisions of the Bill  to  say

that  anything  in  it  is irregular,  improper  and

undemocratic. They have complained in the  past  and

said, "Yes, the P.A.P. are using propaganda." It  is

our  business  to use propaganda to ensure  that  we

win, especially against the Communists. In fact, the

main part of the fight has been to circumscribe to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



defeat the Communists. We will continue to do it, to

use   every   opportunity,  if  necessary  political

strategy,  to  outmanoeuvre and conscribe  them.  We

have done that for the last two years and we will do

it  for  the next 20 years. The Communists  will  be

here  for 20 years, 30 years, 50 years. The  Barisan

may be out, the Member for Anson may be out, but the

Communists will be here, and it is our duty to fight

them  and  keep  them under control.  Therefore,  to

claim that this Bill is dishonest, that by this Bill

we  are  going  to have snap elections,  definitely,

Sir,  we will have elections at a time when we think

we   are  going  to  win.  Just  as  if  the  S.P.A.

government  were  on  this  side  they  would   have

elections  at  a time they think they are  going  to

win.  If the Barisan were here, there would probably

be  no  elections  at all; so the problem  does  not

arise.  But  I  would suggest to the  Opposition  to

disabuse  their  minds  that  this  Bill   to   have

elections first for 15 seats is directed against the

S.P.A. or  anybody  else, but  I  say  that  it  is

primarily  directed against the Communists.  We  ask

them  to  consider carefully whether  they  want  to

allow the Communists to achieve what they want - that

is, to have an election first for 51 seats. Sir,  if

there  is  an election for 51 seats as far  as  this

Government  is  concerned, we will still  fight  the

Communists  and we are confident that  we  can  beat

them and crush them, as we think we can. To make  it

more  difficult,  more  tricky,  might  confuse  the

situation. But the other way, we guarantee  that  we

will  contain  and  conscribe the Communists  before

31st August, or not long after that. Politically, we

will  contain them. And that is the object  of  this

Bill.  If  the S.P.A. wants to play party  politics,

that  is  a different thing; we also can play  party

politics  up to a point. They have been  doing  that

for  the last four years. But during the referendum,

the  S.P.A.,  all the pro-Malaysia elements  and  we

contained  ourselves; we curbed our party  political

rivalry  and we were able to contain and  drive  out

the   Communists.  And  I  say,  Sir,  whatever  our

objectives, we should try and do the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



same  because  in about 36 days Malaysia  will  come

about,  our gentlemen the Communists will be hopping

around.  I saw in the paper today that confrontation

is  back in circulation. It is our duty to keep  the

fifth columnists under check.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill for elections to the 15 seats will allow

us  to  expose  the Communists in the  eyes  of  the

people,  to get the people to repudiate them openly,

publicly,  so that any confrontationist  who  thinks

that  there  is  a  fifth  column  here  politically

effective  will have the biggest shock of his  life.

That  is what we want to do. Have the elections  for

the 15 seats so that the confrontationists will say,

"Our allies have been repudiated by the people," and

we are quite confident that we can get the people to

repudiate them in an election for 15 seats. That  is

what we want to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, if it is to be 51 seats first, the

Government  is  ready, though there  are  a  lot  of

risks;  15 seats first, we are quite convinced  that

we can not only crush the Communists but we can also

annihilate their agents, finish them off politically

and  then after that, if the S.P.A. or anybody wants

to play party politics, at least the ground is safe.

Even  the Member for Anson can join in, but at least

when  we  join in the fray, there will  not  be  the

slightest threat to Malaysia and merger from  inside

Singapore,   from  the  traitors  who  have   become

stooges,  puppets of foreign forces.  This  Bill  is

their political death warrant, and that is why, Sir,

we have brought it to this Assembly today.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

appear  before  you today in a very serious  moment,

with  a  very heavy load upon my shoulders.  All  my

life, I have read about and studied democracy and  I

have  always believed that the government must be  a

government   of  many  people,  that  decisions   of

Parliaments must be the decisions come  to  by  many

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now that the Ban, san Sosialis have committed themselves on this Bill and the Alliance have committed themselves on this Bill, so have the U.P.P. and my friend from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



Anson, it looks as if the whole turning point rests

upon my narrow shoulders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not narrow shoulders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Thank you very much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have remained patiently

silent  in  the  Assembly for a long  time,  perhaps

because  I have become too elderly, but I did  think

that  the Government should be allowed some time  to

carry  out  what they want to carry out.  I  do  not

belong  to any Party, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  I  will

say this: they have built many houses for the masses

and  we  are glad of it, and they have done probably

many good things. And, therefore, I have a bit of  a

headache. I do not know what attitude I should  take

except  that I have for my background the spirit  of

democracy. It is not fair, Mr Speaker, to  rest  an

important  matter  like this - the  survival  or  the

downfall  of the P.A.P. Government - on my shoulders.

Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have decided to break

my  so-called silence. I have spoken once before  if

you  will remember, and in this division,  as  I  am

sure  there will be a division, I shall vote against

the  Government, because I feel that I should follow

the  rule  of  the  majority.  I  should  follow  my

colleagues  on  the same side that I am  sitting.  I

hope  I  have  made my position clear, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of order. Under

Standing Order 51(1) , Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Closure? I will not accept a closure

motion. Any other Member wishing to speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  every Member in this  House  clearly

understands that the Opposition Members  today  have

made  speeches  to carry out their  propaganda.  The

tactic of the Member for Hong Lim is to stand on two

boats. The Opposition do not care whether this  Bill

is passed or not. They only want to use a deceitful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



method  to  cheat  the  people  in  this  House  and

outside. Their aim has been to get more votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, just now the Member for Hong Lim said that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister was groomed by him and that had it not been for him and for his charity the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister would not be where he is today. As far as I can remember, when the Member for Hong Lim joined the P.A.P., he was

introduced by our present Minister for Culture. When

he  was about to be expelled from the P.A.P. in  the

Cultural Centre, he openly confessed to us that  his

political  education was influenced by the  ideology

of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister

and   the  Minister  for  Culture.  He  learned  his

political  theory  from our Prime Minister  and  his

Parliamentary Secretary. Today he turned  round  and

said  that  our Parliamentary Secretary was  groomed

and nurtured by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we all know that when one joins a political Party, one must undergo many stages of political education before one can advance, before one can become an Assemblyman. We are not like the Member for Hong Lim who used to boast about his own achievements when he was the Mayor of the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I allowed the Parliamentary

Secretary to continue up to now. Perhaps it  was  in

reply  to what the Member for Hong Lim had  to  say.

But  I do not think he need go any further. That has

nothing at all to do with the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  was only mentioning a few things to rebut certain

nonsensical utterances by the Member for Hong Lim. I

do not intend to drag on with my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know the P.A.P. have all along been

in  favour of merger. At that time the Members of  the Barisan

Sosialis and the Member for Hong Lim and his colleague were also in favour of this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the introduction of this Bill is also due to

the   fact  of  our  support  for  merger.  But  the

Opposition Members have now forgotten their promises

made  in the past to the people. Now whatever  Bills

are  introduced by the P.A.P. Government  they  will

oppose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the Barisan Members, they are also

people  who have been nurtured by the P.A.P. Because

of the fact that they have left the P.A.P. so early,

they  do not understand the major policies, measures

and  actions taken by the P.A.P. The people nowadays

can see clearly that the Barisan Sosialis are rather

infantile  and their position is very  poor  indeed.

They are in a zugzwang, just as what we Chinese say,

they  are  like ants in a hot pot, because in  their

Party  they  do not have political leaders  of  good

quality to lead. I remember a Cantonese saying  that

if  there  are no fish in the pond, then  the  small

prawns  will  become generals there. In the  Barisan

Sosialis, there are no big fish, only small fry, and

not even a cock in the Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is it

relevant to the Bill on which we are debating?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The answer is no, and I think the

Member should now come back to the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

only  rebutting the attacks by these Members  during

these  past few days. Of course, they feel the pinch

of what I am saying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know that the Bill introduced today is, in fact, quite a simple Bill, because it points out that before the establishment of the Central Government, Singapore, as a component part of Malaysia, should elect its representatives to enter the House of Representatives in the Federation. Because the Bill is drafted according to the needs

of  the nation, that is why it is introduced in this

House today. Where have we been wrong in introducing

this  Bill? Of course, the Barisan Sosialis Members,

who  have  all  along been opposed to  Malaysia  and

merger,  will say whatever we do is wrong.  One  day

when they are no longer in a position, perhaps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



their leaders will be opposing any measure. Today, I

am  of the opinion that their attitude is not linked

up   with  the  question  whether  there  should  be

election of representatives to the Federal House  of

Representatives.  They are not concerned  with  this

matter  of  elections. What is  uppermost  in  their

minds is the fact that if they support this Bill, it

means  they  will  be supporting Malaysia.  That  is

their  fear. If the 15 representatives are  elected,

then, before this happens, the Barisan Sosialis will

be  exposed. Their past actions and intrigue will be

exposed.  Of  course,  at the time  of  their  death

throes they will have to oppose this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, talking about the Member for Cairnhill,

whenever people touch on his S.P.A., he feels rather

abashed  and  would  like  people  to  call  it  the

Singapore  Alliance. In actual fact,  there  is  not

much difference between the S.P.A. and the Singapore

Alliance, because to a politician like him,  who  is

changing party names all the time, there is no  true

party  to him. This sort of people every day  change

their label in the same way as they can change their

stand every day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members on this side of the House have the

impression  that whenever the Member  for  Cairnhill

speaks,  there are gold dollar trade  marks  on  his

face, reflecting his political conception. From this

you can see that his political ideology is based  on

gold  dollars. I would not like to say further about

him.  I am just touching on him because he has  been

attacking  our stand. I remember that in the  P.A.P.

organ sometime ago -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

speech   of  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for  Home Affairs is not relevant  to  the

Bill on the Order Paper.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is quite correct. I think about

three-quarters   of   his   speech   is   completely

irrelevant. What he is trying to do, of  course,  is

to  reply to certain allegations made, but  he  must

cut that short.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

today,  in  this  House  we are  talking  about  our

individual stands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



on  this Bill. When the Opposition Members feel  the

pinch,  of  course, they will say that my speech  is

irrelevant, whereas their speeches were rather -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Hon. Parliamentary

Secretary  did not hear what the Speaker  said.  The

Speaker has also said that his speech is irrelevant.

Therefore,  I  would  suggest to  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  that  he get on with the  debate  on  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

would like to ask what the Member for Hong Lim meant

when  he  said that our Prime Minister  bought  five

shirts  a day, and whether this was relevant to  the

Bill before us today.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Parliamentary Secretary tries

to  question  the authority of the Speaker,  then  I

must ask him to stop speaking. I have permitted  him

to   be   completely   irrelevant   simply   because

irrelevant remarks were passed on the other side  of

the  House,  but those irrelevant remarks  were  not

half  as lengthy as the irrelevant remarks that have

now been passed by the Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

accept  your  ruling. My opinion is that  this  Bill

before  us today reflects the attitude of the P.A.P.

in  regard to the question of Malaysia. It has  been

introduced because of our sense of duty in regard to

Malaysia. Therefore, this Bill is a good Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move under

Standing Order 51, "That the Question be now put".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Cairnhill tried that

and I said no. The answer is still no.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, Members of the Opposition are objecting to  the

Singapore  (Elections  to  the  Federal   House   of

Representatives) Bill, and it seems to me  that  the

Opposition Members are afraid to face the verdict of

the  people. The constituencies are regrouped,  they

say,  in  order  to  benefit the  Ministers  and  to

provide safe seats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



for  them. But, however the constituencies  may  be

regrouped,  how  can  they  be  in  favour  of   the

Ministers  or,  on  the  other  hand,  against   the

Opposition  Members?  The  public  will   not   vote

differently  because the same voters  are  going  to

vote  for all the people. So, to say that some seats

are  safe  or  unsafe for Ministers  does  not  make

sense. There is no meaning in it. Moreover, we  have

invited  the Opposition Members to have talks  about

the  regrouping  of constituencies,  but  they  have

rejected the invitation by giving some lame excuses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Sir, is it necessary for the Back-benchers to repeat what the Leader of the House or

the Front-benchers have said?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> My answer is that, as far as the

necessity is concerned, it depends entirely  on  the

Assemblyman   who  is  speaking.  The  Speaker   who

controls the debate can only intervene when he feels

that  repetition has become tedious. I have  not  as

yet  felt that, but I am close to beginning to  feel

that. Mr Ramaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, all the 13 Members of the Barisan Sosialis have repeated the

same  story many times. We have listened to them.  I

have so far not repeated what the Ministers and  the

Front-benchers have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just saying that when we invited the

Opposition   Members  to  have   talks   about   the

regrouping of constituencies, they gave lame excuses

and rejected the invitation. It is very easy for  us

to find out the reasons for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance, in its election pamphlet, has said

that there should be direct representation from this

Assembly  to  the  Federal  Parliament  during   the

interim period. From this we can find out -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of order, Sir. The

same  argument has been repeated three times by  the

Government Benchers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have noticed that. I have indicated

that  the  Speaker will intervene whenever he  feels

that these arguments are becoming tedious.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): The Alliance are afraid

that their true colours will be shown when all these

things  are repeated. That is why they are  stopping

me  from repeating all these things. They are afraid

that  if they stand for the elections, they will  be

defeated. Another reason stated by them is  that  if

the elections are held before 31st August, the Party

in  power may not conduct the elections in a  proper

way,  but that if the elections are held after  31st

August,  an  independent Elections  Commission  will

conduct the elections. This is what they think. They

cannot  cheat all the people by saying such  things.

Five  years  ago, when the Labour Front  was  ruling

Singapore, there was a City Council by-election  for

the  Kallang constituency. They used some  gangsters

in  that by-election, and all the people knew  this.

The gangsters attacked the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is completely irrelevant.

I  will ask the Parliamentary Secretary now to  turn

his mind to the Bill and debate on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

prepared to obey your ruling. But what I am going to

say will show why the Alliance want the elections to

be  held  after 31st August. I am leading  to  that.

That  is why I explained the incident at the Kallang

by-election. I have two or three sentences  more  to

add.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. supporters were attacked by the

gangsters. After attacking them, they -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary

can  assist  the Chair by saying what  point  he  is

leading up to. Then the Chair will be able to decide

whether that is relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): First, I will tell you

what  I  intend to say and then you will  understand

it. What the Alliance say now is that they go to the

hawkers along the streets -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker,

Sir, I think this is P.A.P. filibustering to save -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Parliamentary Secretary has persisted -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> It is irrelevant and repetitious.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am perfectly aware that it is

irrelevant and repetitious and I have said that the

Chair is watching it very closely. Mr Ramaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if you

will be a bit patient, then you will understand what

I am leading up to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the elections are held after Merger Day, then

the  administration of the Police will be under  the

Central Government. Then they might think under  the

influence of people like Khaw Kai Boh and S. H. Tan,

the gangsters can be released, and with the help  of

the gangsters the Alliance can win the elections.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Parliamentary Secretary is

making very serious allegations against two Senators

of  the  Federal Parliament. He must be very careful

when he makes these allegations, because he might be

guilty of dishonourable conduct in this Assembly and

abuse of privilege. Mr Ramaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): They think they can win

the  elections  with the help of gangsters,  and  so

they  want to hold them after 31st August.  This  is

what they prefer. There might be another reason too.

If the elections are held here, the Alliance may not

win  because  during the merger  talks  the  Malayan

Chinese Association did not behave in a way liked by

the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All these attacks, I think,

must  be stopped. They are completely irrelevant  to

the Bill. We are now debating this Bill. We have had

enough of personalities and enough of irrelevancies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): In that case, I will

finish my speech by saying a few words.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday that there was no

possibility of nominating 15 Members directly from   this

Assembly.  He  said  that   this   was undemocratic  and

that the power  was  not  in  our hands.   The  Members  to

the  Federal   House   of Representatives  must  be  elected

by  the   people directly.  That is important and that is

democracy. And knowing that, I am supporting this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since  the  Government has no more  ammunition

from  what we have heard, and since they have  found

fit  to challenge the Alliance on its stand on  this

Bill, it is proper for them to put the issue to  the

vote right now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I call the Member for Delta,

can  I sound a little warning? I must hear some  new

arguments.  If  there are no new arguments,  then  I

will intervene. Madam Chan, in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  today we have seen that the Opposition Members

are  trying  very hard to say things  at  random  in

order  to  bring out from their minds the  different

types  of  ideologies in order to  find  a  way  for

concerted action against this Bill of the P.A.P. But

although  they are trying very hard to get together,

I  am  going to tell them now that in spite  of  all

their  efforts, it is impossible. Although they  are

on  the  same bed, they are having different dreams.

Why do I say this? Well, although in this House they

seem  to  have common .arguments to the effect  that

the P.A.P. is undemocratic and that it has tried  to

destroy  the  parliamentary  democratic  system   in

Singapore,  I  want to ask them, is  there  anything

undemocratic in our Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are unable to answer this question. So I am

going  to deal with their arguments point by  point,

to  disclose the fact that though they  are  on  the

same bed, they are having different dreams. All



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



along  we have been saying that the Barisan Sosialis

are  getting  worried about this Bill and  they  are

trying  their  best  to oppose  it.  Every  thinking

person  will understand the simple reason -that  is,

from   the  very  outset,  they  have  been  against

Malaysia. Although they are against Malaysia and  in

spite of what they do to oppose it, it will come  on

the  31st of August, 1953. Malaysia will be born  by

then.  At  the present juncture, their  leaders  are

taking their instructions from foreign sources as to

how to deal a final blow at the possible creation of

Malaysia. That is their aim.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If my recollection is correct, that is

the  exact  argument  put up  by  the  Minister  for

Culture. May we therefore have something new?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But there is

another  part  which  is quite  different  from  the

Minister for Culture's speech. And that is,  because

of  this  the Barisan Sosialis try to have  a  final

showdown  so that before Malaysia is born the  whole

of   Singapore   and  the  whole  of  the   Malaysia

territories will have confusion, so that there  will

be  a riot in Singapore before Malaysia, in order to

destroy  Malaysia  entirely. That is  the  intention

behind their opposition to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To follow up the speech of the leader of the United

People's Party. I will say that he is today opposing

this  Bill for this reason. Originally in their  own

Party  organ, the Party have said that  the  Central

Parliament elections are just around the corner. But

why  should  they  oppose this  Bill?  Well,  it  is

because they know that if Malaysia is established on

the 31st of August this year, the Central Government

will  have  some  control over  every  State  within

Malaysia, and in their minds, they hone that by then

the  Barisan  Sosialis will have  to  put  up  their

shutters,  because  they will be controlled  by  the

Central  Government. By then they  hope  the  U.P.P.

will  be  able to have something without any effort.

They  can shout the slogans of the Barisan Sosialis,

wear  their  gloves, and then try to get  something.

And   so   they  want  this  election   of   Federal

representatives to be held after Malaysia,  so  that

they may have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



chance  of  being returned to the Central Parliament

to curry out their party propaganda therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to analyse the arguments of

the  Singapore Alliance. Everybody is clear  in  his

mind  that  the Lim Yew Hock Government had  made  a

very bad impression on the people of Singapore. From

the  young to the old, I believe everybody will  not

forget  what impression the Lim Yew Hock  Government

has left in the minds of the people of Singapore. So

do  they  really have the guts to compete  with  the

P.A.P. in this election? Although Mr Lim Yew  Hock

himself  has challenged the P.A.P. and said that  he

is  prepared to fight the P.A.P. at any time and  in

any  place,  and  he  has pointed  out  that  he  is

particularly  interested  in  fighting   the   Prime

Minister in the Tanjong Pagar constituency, why does

he then want to oppose this Bill? The reason is very

simple.  It  is  because he himself  has  said  very

clearly  that according to procedures, this election

of  Federal  representatives should  be  held  after

Malaysia. And so the Bill should be introduced  only

after  Malaysia.  That is his  argument.  But  after

Malaysia,   his   elder  brother,   the   Federation

Government,  and his own colleagues will  give  them

all  sorts  of  facilities and afford  them  special

conveniences.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Lady has not

started  to  touch on the Bill. We  are  debating  a

Bill.  All  this  debate about the reasons  why  the

Opposition is opposing must be disposed of in just a

couple  of sentences. We cannot debate the  reasons.

It is in order, of course, to say quite shortly what

the Member thinks are the reasons, but she cannot go

on and on and on giving lengthy reasons, or what she

thinks are the reasons.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir I bow to your ruling. But as I have said earlier

on, I am now trying to analyse the reasons for their

opposition to this Bill, and that is why I must  try

to  explain  away their arguments. Otherwise,  there

will  not be sufficient exposure of their opposition

to this Bill and the motives behind it. Mr Speaker,

at any rate. I will say that the fact that they have

come  out  and  opposed  this  Bill  is  inevitable,

because they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



know  that  once it is passed in this  Assembly,  it

amounts to saying that their political life will  be

ended, because they know that once it is passed, the

People's Action Panty, though in their eyes a  Party

without  the  confidence and support of the  people,

but in their own hearts -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> When I called upon the hon. Lady, she

did indicate she had something new to say. So far  I

have not heard anything really new in support of the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  shall  be  concluding my speech  very  soon

because  you seem to think that whatever  I  say  is

mainly irrelevant to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will let them know that they are trying

to  wait  for  the last moment to vote  against  our

Bill,  but  we are of the opinion that whether  this

Bill  is passed or rejected in this House, we  shall

not  be  ashamed  of  ourselves. Our  conscience  is

clear.  Whether this Bill is passed or not does  not

really matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I move under Standing Order

51(1) , "That the Question be now put," because since

the Member for Cairnhill -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is no debate. I think I

had better read Standing Order 51(1) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`After a question has been proposed a Member

rising  in  his place may claim to move,  "That  the

question be now put", and, unless it appears to  the

Speaker or Chairman that such motion is an abuse  of

the rules of the Assembly, or an infringement of the

rights  of  the  minority, the question.  "That  the

question  be  now put", shall be put  forthwith  and

decided without amendment or debate, notwithstanding

that  the  mover has had no opportunity to make  his

reply.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty with which the Speaker is faced is

that he does not know who is in the minority at  the

moment. I would say that I am prepared to accept the

motion  for  the  closure. That  would  prevent  the

Minister for Home Affairs from replying. If he cares

to  reply, he can do so now. That would stop Members

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



the Back-benches from speaking. But if Members on

the Back-benches stand up now and try to catch my

eye, then I will accept the motion for the closure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will now accept the motion for the

closure. The Minister cannot reply if it is carried.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for River Valley sits down

again. Mr Ong Pang Boon, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be

brief  and to the point. From the speeches  made  by

the  Opposition Members yesterday and today,  it  is

clear  that their objection is not against the  Bill

as  such. What they really object to is the  holding

of  an election of 15 seats to the Federal House  of

Representatives  now  or in  the  immediate  future.

Although  the  United People's  Party,  the  Barisan

Sosialis   and   the  Singapore  People's   Alliance

declared  publicly that they were ready to  take  on

any   election  at  any  time,  they  were  in  fact

horrified  at the prospect of an impending election.

Otherwise,  why should they oppose this  Bill  which

only provides for the machinery to hold an election?

Although the Opposition Parties are opposed  to  one

another  ideologically,  yet  on  this  question  of

opposition  to  elections to the  Federal  House  of

Representatives, they are on common ground. And what

better  means of preventing elections to the Federal

House  of  Representatives than  opposition  to  the

passage  of this Bill in this Assembly? Mr Speaker,

Sir,  to enable an election to the Federal House  of

Representatives to be held, there must be this  Bill

which  provides for the machinery and the  procedure

to  organise  an  election.  Without  this  Bill  no

election  can be held. Hence, Mr Speaker, Sir,  all

the  opposition to this Bill is nothing but a  cloak

to  hide  their  real  intention  of  preventing  an

election  to  the  Federal House of  Representatives

from being held. Once this real issue is understood,

it is not difficult to understand why they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



oppose  this  Bill so strenuously by  advancing  all

kinds  of  lame excuses and adopting an  obstructive

attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take one instance - the problem of delineating

boundaries  of Federal Divisions. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

on  the  26th June I sent a letter to all  political

Parties  represented in the Assembly, including  the

two  Independents, calling for suggestions as to how

the existing 51 electoral divisions could be grouped

together in threes and fours to form the 15  Federal

Electoral  Divisions,  in this  matter  of  boundary

delineation, the Government would like  to  consider

the  views and suggestions of the Opposition Parties

so  that  a fair proposition could be drawn  up  for

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the various political Parties and the two

Independents in their deliberations, a  list  of  51

constituencies and the number of voters in each  was

attached  to the letter. There was no response  from

the  various political Parties. In the case  of  the

Barisan Sosialis, I only received a printed copy  of

a  Press  statement in the form of a letter  on  the

very  same day of its publication in the Press.  The

statement contains nothing constructive except  some

hollow  and worn-out remarks and a series of puerile

questions.  As  it  is desirable that  as  broad  an

agreement  as possible should be arrived at  on  the

question of electoral boundaries, a further reminder

was  sent  on the 8th July, also inviting Opposition

Parties  to  nominate  a representative  each  to  a

meeting  of all Parties represented in the Assembly.

The  U.M.N.O. replied on the 11th July that  it  did

not  wish to be represented in the meeting. From the

Barisan  Sosialis I received again  only  a  printed

copy of a Press statement in the form of a letter on

the same day as it appeared in the Press. Apart from

repeating the same diatribe, the statement  contains

no  proposal regarding delineation of the 15 Federal

Electoral Divisions. All the other Parties  did  not

reply  to my letter of 8th July. This goes  to  show

that the Barisan Sosialis, the U.P.P. and the S.P.A.

do  not  want  elections to  the  Federal  House  of

Representatives  at  this stage.  In  adopting  this

attitude they could subsequently, if they failed  to

be returned to the Parliament, blame the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



Government  of unfair delineation of boundaries  and

so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the Member for Queenstown

yesterday was rather pathetic. Gone were his  bounce

and   confidence,  even  though  they   are   rather

artificial  at  times. He accused the Government  of

wanting to hold a snap election. The Member for Hong

Lim too makes a similar complaint. Mr Speaker, Sir,

not  so  very long ago the Barisan Sosialis and  the

U.P.P. were hurling challenges after challenges  to

the  Government  to hold elections immediately.  The

Member  for Queenstown was bragging and boasting  in

this  Assembly  that the masses were with  them  and

that they were ready for elections any time. Now, if

they  were  in such a state of readiness,  why  this

fear of snap election now? Is it because the Barisan

Sosialis have suddenly realised that their stock has

gone  down?  Is  the U.P.P. having  second  thoughts

after what has happened to its Havelock Branch? Now,

what  is  wrong  with  a snap election?  It  is  the

prerogative  of the ruling Party in a  parliamentary

democracy  to decide when to hold an election.  Snap

elections  are regularly held in the United  Kingdom

where  parliamentary democracy is at its best.  Does

it  mean  that  in so doing the United  Kingdom  has

become a dictatorial State?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also complained that the

period between the issue of a Writ of Elections  and

the  date of the poll is too short for his Party  to

carry  out  an election campaign. Now, Mr  Speaker.

Sir, he is a bit late in the day to complain of this

provision.  The  minimum  period  for  an   election

campaign   was   provided  for  in   the   Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance and amended

in  1960  with his support. He did not then consider

the  period  too short. So how can he  complain  now

just  because he has crossed the Floor to the  other

side and has to fight an election against the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim alleged that one of the

purposes  of  the  Bill was to provide  for  special

counting  procedure  so that the Opposition  Parties

would  not  know  of the results  of  each  existing

Singapore Legislative Assembly Division



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



making  up a Federal Division. Unfortunately he  was

ill  yesterday, and therefore he had  not  heard  my

speech  on  this particular point. Incidentally,  it

seems   a   curious  coincidence  that  his  illness

coincided  with the collapse of the U.P.P.  Havelock

Branch and the resignation of 19 leading members  of

that Branch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said yesterday that this provision is made to

expedite the counting of ballot papers and that  the

candidate  or  his counting agents  would  know  the

result  of each component part making up the Federal

Division  although  only the total  results  of  the

Federal Division would be declared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim also asked how many Work

Brigade members have been registered as electors  in

Tanjong  Pagar and Anson. Mr Speaker, Sir,  at  the

last  sitting  of  the  Assembly,  in  answer  to  a

question from the Member for the Southern Islands, I

said  that  the Work Brigade members in the  various

camps  are  not  required to change their  addresses

because their stay in the camp is temporary and they

are  liable  to  be transferred from camp  to  camp.

Therefore,   no   Work  Brigade  member   has   been

deliberately asked to change his address in order to

have his name in the Electoral Register of Anson  or

Tanjong  Pagan. He can be rest assured of this  fact

should be desire to contest in Tanjong Pagan against

the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody has compelled the Member for Hong Lim to

change   his  party  symbol  of  three  interlinking

circles,  although it is a well-known fact that  the

interlinking  circles  was chosen  with  a  view  to

drawing  support by deception from the pro-Communist

elements  in  the Nanyang University Students  Union

and  also  from the People's Association which  have

won  public support. The U.P.P. was invited to  give

its   views   on  how  the  boundaries   should   be

delineated. It did not reply to my letter nor  offer

any   proposal  except  to  call  for  an  All-Party

conference in the Press. When the conference of  all

Panties represented in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



Assembly  was offered by the Government, the  U.P.P.

announced in the Press that it would boycott it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these obstructive attitudes of the Barisan Sosialis and the U.P.P. are not going to help the cause of democracy in any way. It only shows that they are bankrupt of ideas and therefore have no proposals to make. They are only interested in paving the way out by blaming any misfortune of

their Party in any election to the Federal House  of

Representatives on Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the first Malaysian Parliament is convened in Kuala Lumpur soon after Malaysia Day, there must be 15 representatives from Singapore. The question of nominating 15 Members from this Assembly is out. These 15 representatives have to be elected by the people. We cannot wait for

months or years for the Federal Elections Commission

to  set  up its machinery in Singapore to go through

the  process of boundary delineations and so  forth,

and   deprive  the  people  of  Singapore  of  their

representatives    in   the   Federal    House    of

Representatives in the meantime. The Bill before the

House is to set out the manner and the procedure  by

which  the  election of 15 Members to the  House  of

Representatives can be held, and nothing  more  than

that. It follows the same provision as the Singapore

Legislative  Assembly Elections  Ordinance  and  the

objections of the Opposition have very little to  do

with  the  substance of the Bill. The Bill  is  only

used as a convenient pretext to prevent elections to

the House of Representatives from being held. If the

Opposition defeat this Bill, then they are guilty of

depriving   the   people  of  Singapore   of   their

representatives in the Malaysian Parliament  in  the

first  few crucial months of its inception. Whatever

the  outcome  of this Bill, Malaysia is  inevitable.

There  are only 36 days more to go. There is nothing

that  the  combined Opposition can do to prevent  it

from being formed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The votes being equal, the Question

passes in the negative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I ought now to make the procedural position

clear, because I heard the Minister for Home Affairs

speaking  of the defeat of the Bill as a  result  of

this voting. That is not so. The procedural position

is  that the Bill, as a Bill, is still alive; it  is

not  killed.  The effect of the voting is  that  the

Assembly  has considered the Bill cannot be  read  a

Second  time  now. "Now" is the operative  word.  So

that,  as  I have indicated on a previous  occasion,

there  is nothing to prevent the Minister, if he  so

chooses, from bringing the Bill forward again  on  a

subsequent date for a Second Reading, perhaps after,

if he so chooses, consultation with the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of guidance. As the Deputy

Prime Minister has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



indicated that the Government would resign  if  this

motion was defeated, is the motion in fact defeated?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated the procedural

position.  I  do not think we should  enter  into  a

debate on that. The procedural position is as I have

indicated.  What  the Government intend  to  do,  of

course, is their own concern. And I think the Deputy

Prime  Minister would like to indicate to the  House - by  leave  of  the House, I take  it  there  is  no

objection - what the Government's stand is.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the Opposition, by

adopting this attitude towards the Bill, have  taken

upon  themselves the responsibility of blocking  the

election of the 15 representatives -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think in this particular

statement,  the Deputy Prime Minister must  not  say

anything which will excite a debate. All he need say

now is what the Government is going to do about it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the challenge by

the  Opposition to hold State elections  before  the

Federal   elections  is  accepted.   However,   this

will  meet  the  Barisan in good time  and  on  good

grounds.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> However, as I have said, this

Assembly has a responsibility to discharge. There is

the  motion relating to the Malaysia Agreement which

has been set down for debate on Monday, the 29th  of

July.  In  the  national interest we will  see  this

motion  through so that the security of Malaysia  is

not  put  in jeopardy. Let the Barisan take note  of

that.

are  running  away. On Thursday we will adjourn  the

Assembly  sine  die.  I  have  no  doubt  the  Prime

Minister  will  advise  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara

accordingly, and we will act according to the  terms

of the Constitution; that if his advice is that this

Assembly should be dissolved, then naturally we will

have  to fight for the 51 seats. The Opposition  are

falling  among themselves in their political  greed.

But -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated to the Deputy

simple  question was asked - when? - and a perfectly

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX EXEMPTION</b></div>



<br><br>7.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves, in accordance with the

provisions of subsection (2)  of section 106  of  the

Income    Tax   Ordinance   (Chapter   166),    that

notwithstanding the provisions of section 37 of  the

said  Ordinance  the assessable  income  of  persons

contributing to the Civilian Victims of the Japanese

Occupation Memorial Fund established for the purpose

of constructing the Civilian Victims of the Japanese

Occupation  Memorial in Singapore, shall be  reduced

by the amount of any such contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members may recall having agreed to a motion

to  exempt  from  income tax  contributions  to  the

national  monument  in  Kuala Lumpur  sometime  last

year.   The  present  motion  is  to  seek  Members'

agreement    to    give   similar   exemption    for

contributions  to  the  proposed  memorial  to   the

civilians of all races who died in Singapore at  the

hands  of  the  Japanese  Armed  Forces  during  the

Occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members are no doubt aware that the

Government has agreed to grant a suitable  piece  of

land  for  the  erection of  this  memorial  and  to

contribute  on  a  dollar-for-dollar  basis  a   sum

equivalent  to  that  raised  by  voluntary   public

contributions.  The  total  cost  of  erecting  this

memorial is estimated at $750,000, and the Singapore

Chamber  of  Commerce has undertaken  to  raise  the

necessary  funds through a Committee  consisting  of

leading members of the different races.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



The  Chamber intends to hand over the money  to  the

Government  as  soon as the target  of  $375,000  is

achieved.  Sir,  this is a perfectly straightforward

and simple matter. I am sure Members will agree that

exemption should be given for contributions to  this

worthy cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves, in accordance with the

provisions of subsection (2)  of section 106  of  the

Income    Tax   Ordinance   (Chapter   166),    that

notwithstanding the provisions of section 37 of  the

said  Ordinance  the assessable  income  of  persons

contributing to the Civilian Victims of the Japanese

Occupation Memorial Fund established for the purpose

of constructing the Civilian Victims of the Japanese

Occupation  Memorial in Singapore, shall be  reduced

by the amount of any such contribution.

<div align="center"><b>ISSUE OF TREASURY BILLS</b></div>



<br><br>7.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr

Speaker.  Sir, I have His Excellency  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's recommendation for this motion  to

be proceeded with. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves, in accordance with

section  2  of  the Local Treasury  Bills  Ordinance

(Chapter  69)  that the Minister  be  authorised  to

borrow, by the issue of Treasury Bills in the State,

sums  not  exceeding  Malayan $150,000,000  (Malayan

Dollars One Hundred and Fifty Millions) in amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the provisions of section 2 of the Local

Treasury  Bills Ordinance the Minister is authorised

to  borrow,  by the issue of Treasury Bills  in  the

State,  up  to  an  amount of $40  million  under  a

resolution  made by the then Legislative Council  on

13th July. 1948. That limit has now been reached and

it is sought to increase that limit to $150 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury Bills of 91 days' maturity are issued on

tap to statutory bodies as and when required and are

also  offered to the public every month  on  tender.

Tap Bills now carry four per cent interest per annum

and  Tender Bills average 4.1 per cent interest  per

annum.  The  amounts outstanding on the issues  are:

Tap  Bills $32.8 million, Tender Bills $17  million,

bringing the total to $49.8 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year the monthly tenders have been well

subscribed.  In the last three months  Tender  Bills

offered  to  the public have been $6  million  every

month.  Tap  Bills totalling about $9  million  each

time  have  been  received. Surplus funds  from  the

statutory  bodies can still absorb a large  quantity

of  Tap  Treasury  Bills. It is therefore  necessary

that a sufficiently large quantity of Treasury Bills

should  be  made  available to the  public  and  the

statutory bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Government's intention to establish a short-term money market in Singapore. There is evidence

that one or two discount houses, or short-term money

market  dealers,  are  coming  into  operation.  The

dealers  should be provided with an ample supply  of

Treasury  Bills  which will be their main  stock-in-trade.  There  is a large quantity of surplus  funds

locally which are available for investment for short

periods,  and  if  suitable  outlets  are  found  in

Singapore  to  absorb such funds, temporary  surplus

monies will be remitted overseas for investment. The

new  limit  will improve the Treasury's  ability  to

borrow  on  the local market and, at the same  time,

provide  opportunities for the investment of surplus

monies not immediately required



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  get  a  clarification on  this.  You  will

remember  that  yesterday  the  acting  Minster  for

Finance,  in, reply to a question,  indicated  five

loans  amounting to $247 million-odd, and of that  I

think  the  sum of $50 million was under this  Local

Treasury  Bills  Ordinance,  is  chat  correct,  Mr

Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Now, if the Assembly gives approval to

this 5150 million loan under this Ordinance, does it

mean that the Government - assuming that $50 million

has  already  been  approved - could,  at  all  times

throughout all the years until a resolution has been

brought  in  again,  continue  to  operate  to  $200

million under this Local Treasury Bills Ordinance?

to speak?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I too want to seek some

clarification from the Minister, Sir. We  happen  to

know that the Prime Minister has promised to give  a

loan of $150 million to the Borneo territories. I do

not know what relationship this motion has with that

loan  - whether  this money is meant to  be  borrowed

from  the public in Singapore in order to be  loaned

to  the Borneo territories or what. We want to  know

what use this money will be put to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak? Mr

Byrne, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have already

indicated  earlier, it is Government's intention  to

borrow  money  on  short-term loans - Treasury  Bills

which  have  a  maturity of 91 days. There  are  two

types  of  Bills;  Tap  Bills  in  which  the  local

authorities invest, and Tender Bills which are  open

to the public for subscription.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that since the resolution that I have referred to just now was passed on 13th July, 1948, sums amounting to $39.8 million have been raised by public subscription and it is our intention to increase that limit by this motion to a total sum of $150 million.

<div align="center"><b>DISRUPTION OF TRADE UNIONS; REGISTRATION OF S.A.T.U.; AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly condemns the People's Action

Party  Government  for its use  of  State  machinery

against  workers  and  their  organisations  in   an

attempt  to  disrupt  non-P.A.P. trade  unions  and

thereby  further P.A.P. interests; and demands  that

this abuse of State power he forthwith stopped, that

the  Singapore Association of Trade Unions be  given

immediate  registration  and  that  the  fundamental

rights  of association, assembly and publication  of

all  workers  be  recognised and  respected  by  the

Government.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The  same motion also stood in the name of Mr Chan Sun Wing.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion was filed in April and though it

is  only  being moved for debate now, the conditions

prevailing in Singapore do not alter the  fact  that

today  the  Government  still uses  State  machinery

against  trade unions which reject the  Government's

political control. The situation still is such  that

the  Government continues to deny the workers  their

legitimate  rights  of  association,  assembly   and

publication. As is known, even today, the  Singapore

Association   of  Trade  Unions  is   not   as   yet

registered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government was elected on a labour

ticket.  They came into office in 1959  on  working-class  votes. We have no doubt that it will go  down

also on working-class votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to 1959, because the P.A.P. was looked

upon by the workers and trade unions as a Party that

represented  the will and desire of the workers,  it

was  put  into office. But one of the first acts  of

the  Government  was,  in  fact,  against  organised

labour.  Sir, it will be remembered how in 1960  (as

early  as  1960), long before there was the  Barisan

Sosialis, the Government had used police in the case

of  workers of the Sassoon Company. It will also  be

remembered   how  soon  after  the  elections,   the

allowances  of  civil  servants  were  cut   without

reference to trade unions. Today, I refer  to  these

two  items, not because we are on this side  of  the

House,  but because we regarded then, as  even  now,

the issues to be fundamental.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the pay cuts, those of us in the trade unions

made our strongest protest against effecting any pay

cut  without negotiations with the unions concerned.

The Minister for Finance is not here tonight. If  he

remembers  and chooses to be honest, he  will  admit

that personal objections were made to the manner  in

which the pay cuts were introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Sassoon strike, the day the police were used

to  assault  the  strikers, the Secretariat  of  the

Singapore  Trades  Union Congress  issued  a  public

statement   denouncing  the  use  of   the   police.

Therefore,  Sir, do not let it be misconstrued  that

it  is  only now that we criticise these acts  which

were by any standard anti-union and anti-labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1961, the Government's use of State machinery

against   trade   unions  which  were   not   P.A.P.

controlled  increased and we found that  the  police

were  being  used against strikers of  unions  which

were  not  P.A.P. unions. The police  were  used  to

break  strikes. We found pressure was being  applied

on  employers  to  prevent  them  from  coming  into

agreements  with  unions which  were  non-P.A.P.  We

found the Labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



Ministry,   particularly   the   office    of    the

Commissioner   for  Labour,  was   being   used   to

discriminate  against unions which were  not  P.A.P.

controlled.  The  office of the Registrar  of  Trade

Unions  was also being used to disturb trade  unions

which were not P.A.P. controlled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on numerous occasions, we have quoted in this

House  examples of the blatant abuse of State power.

I  would like to just recall one or two examples and

I do not wish to go into many of the statements that

we have repeated here and outside the House. I would

like  to take one case first. It is the case of  the

Singapore  Plywood,  where  the  Government  clearly

attempted  to  apply  pressure on  the  employer  to

refuse  implementation of the terms of agreement.  A

collective   agreement  was   signed   between   the

Singapore  General Employees' Union and the  Plywood

management.  It was agreed that the bonus,  an  item

contained in the agreement, he implemented the  next

day,  the  day  after the signing. The Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister  for  Labour  and   the

Minister   for  Finance  intervened  and  told   the

employer not to pay the bonus, to enable the  Manual

and  Mercantile  Workers' Union to  make  propaganda

that  the Singapore General Employees' Union  was  a

useless  union, that having signed an agreement,  it

could not get the employer to implement the terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is one example I quoted. There have been

many  other  examples where Government pressure  had

been put on employers to refuse dealings with unions

that  were  non-P.A.P.,  to refuse  the  rights  and

privileges of unions which were non-P.A.P.,  and  to

refuse implementation of the terms of agreements.  I

mentioned the Plywood case in particular because  in

this  case,  we  had  conclusive evidence  that  the

Minister himself had called up certain officials  of

the  company  and  told them that if  they  did  not

follow  Government instructions, their  permits  for

staying  in  Singapore would be withdrawn  and  they

would  be sent back to where they came from. In  the

course of the Arbitration Court hearing on the  case

of Plywood, I did say that the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



had used his powers to prevent the implementation of

terms of a collective agreement that had been agreed

between the union and the employer. The Minister did

not  deny  this.  The Government  had  no  statement

issued and they did not deny it. Because if they had

denied  it  then,  that  would  have  given  us   an

opportunity  to produce evidence in the  Arbitration

Court to show how and when and who had intervened to

prevent the implementation of the terms. Sir,  that

is one example of pressure on an employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of the abuse of the powers of the

Commissioner  for Labour. Sir, in the  case  of  the

Tiger  Breweries  and  the  Anchor  Breweries,   the

Commissioner  for  Labour ordered  a  secret  ballot

which,  in  our view, was contrary to the provisions

of the Industrial Relations Ordinance. He ordered  a

secret  ballot  to  include a  certain  category  of

workers who were not involved in the claims made  by

the  `Singapore  General Employees' Union.  I  would

like to say here that this was a case similar to the

one  that  the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees

had  recently  with the Government  in  relation  to

trade  union representation. I do not know for  what

reason  they  did not proceed with the balloting  as

they  had  planned. But in the case of  the  General

Employees'  Union involving the Brewery  workers,  a

ballot  was proceeded with. Perhaps, Sir,  officials

of  the Singapore General Employees' Union were  not

P.A.P. members, unlike officials of the Amalgamated

Union of Public Employees -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> On a point of

clarification, Sir, if the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> In the case of the Amalgamated Union

of  Public  Employees, it was  not  stopped  by  the

Government on the plea of P.A.P. Members, but it was

ordered by Dr Charles Gamba, the President  of  the

Court,  not  to have the ballot opened,  counted  or

declared.  Because  any such  act  would  have  been

prejudicial to the case before the Court.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> However, Sir, in the case as I have said

of  the brewery workers, the balloting was proceeded

with.  There  have been cases where the Commissioner

for Labour had refused to conduct secret ballots -



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> On the contrary, you refused to

accept a secret ballot.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen)</b>: Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - as has been the case of C. K. Tang which

I  have  had occasion to mention earlier, where  the

Commissioner for Labour had refused to hold a secret

ballot since December 1961. And, Sir -

<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>THE "NATIONAL" ADVERTISING TOWER IN NORTH BRIDGE ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, may I raise a matter

that  I  trust  is non-political, but  which  should

interest  citizens of Singapore who  take  pride  in

this  lovely  island of ours where one of  the  most

charming  man-made  prospects  is  the  Padang  area

bounded  by  the  sea, Queen Elizabeth's  Walk,  the

Singapore  Recreation Club, the Cathedral  and  this

House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, although those buildings grew up haphazardly, there is nevertheless a dignity about them and a real charm in the composite whole of that open area and its environs, or, should I say there was, Sir, because now, as I travel daily across Merdeka Highway, the prospect I used to enjoy of our

beautiful  harbour is to some extent spoilt  by  the

concrete seaward railing, and the prospect I used to

enjoy  of that area we call the Padang is more  than

somewhat  spoilt  now  by the monstrous  advertising

billboard in North Bridge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



Road  with  the  Rising Sun of Japan dominating  the

entire  scene  from  the  sea  and  the  air.   This

monstrous "National" monument - insolent name - stares

proudly  out as a `chop' of ownership of  the  whole

island, this fair island of ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The view from the back is no less disfiguring, with

its  bare  steel ribs, and in case Members  are  not

travelling along that vicinity, Mr Mammen. Sir, may

I  table  some photographs of this area and  I  will

place some also in the Library.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of photographs handed in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see the enormity of the ugliness which has

been   perpetrated  upon  our  city  by  responsible

Government  servants who, according to the  Minister

for  National  Development, are  from  the  Planning

Department   and  the  Chief  Building   Surveyor's

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monstrous sign sited in an industrial area may

well  not be objectionable, but to site it where  it

is, Sir, leering over our major public buildings and

our  main  open space is an insult to  the  city  of

Singapore  and  its people. It is fantastic,  it  is

unbelievable, that there should be responsible civil

servants   who,   as  the  Minister   for   National

Development has informed us, come from two  separate

Government   Departments,  who  should  have   given

permission  for  the erection and  display  of  this

commercial  monument  that at night  transforms  the

lovely  Cathedral and its grounds literally  into  a

red  light  area,  amid  in the  day  and  night  it

destroys  the harmony of the very centre  of  public

buildings of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to say here that I have received

information  whose reliability I am not prepared  to

vouch  for,  but it is important that it  should  be

known  even though it may just be a rumour - that  it

is  alleged that the civil servants from  these  two

departments  refused  to give  permission  for  this

insult  to  our City, and that it was pressure  from

the  Minister  for  Finance that compelled  them  to

concede and to grant the necessary licences. Whether

that information be true or not, I consider that the

granting  of licences for so patently monstrous  and

disfiguring a commercial monument, destructive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



of the harmony of our main public centre, requires a

public  inquiry,  and  those responsible  should  be

considered    incapable   of    discharging    their

responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, I do not know if you remember, but I raised this matter at Question Time on the 11th of June. There was one interjection by the Member for Cairnhill, right at the very end, which quite startled me at the time and over which I have pondered since. It Consisted of one word, Sir, at

the   very   end   of  the  Minister  for   National

Development's reply. That one word was "A-no-ne". A-no-ne,  Sir, is a Japanese word known to  all  those

who  have  suffered during the Occupation  and  even

those  who have played footsy with them and profited

in being in their employ.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has since occurred to me, Mr Mammen, that

whereas   I   was  and  am  viewing  this  monstrous

commercial advertising monument as a leprous blot on

the  fair face of Singapore, others in Singapore are

viewing it as an act of national arrogance. At  this

juncture, I think I should make it clear that I was,

at the material time, responsible for permitting and

encouraging  re-entry  into  Singapore  of  Japanese

merchants  and  Japanese  banking  after   the   re-occupation, because I was convinced, as I am  today,

that  Japan,  being  one of the foremost  democratic

nations  in  Asia, it is important  that  we  should

extend  to  her  all our goowill and any  assistance

that in our way we can give. I think it important to

say  this, Sir, in case there is any suggestion that

there  is bias on my part, because I wish it  to  be

recognised  that conduct of the kind  epitomised  in

this  monstrous monument creates strong  resentment,

not   merely   directly  towards  those  immediately

responsible  but  spilling  into  wider   and   more

dangerous areas. This "National" monument, insulting

in  its size and situation and insolent in its name,

epitomises   Japanese  commercial   arrogance.   The

Government's interest in permitting this  insult  to

the  City of Singapore requires explanation, for  no

man  in  his  senses,  barring a  blind  man,  could

tolerate    the   creation   of   this   disfiguring

monstrosity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



in  the  very centre of our public institutions.  If

such  a  sign were erected in front of the  Imperial

Palace  in Tokyo, there would be a riot. The  people

of  Singapore are docile, fortunately. But I  think,

Sir,  that  it  is,  and  it should  be  recognised,

necessary  that this Government with its very  short

life - if it is capable of any decent act, and if  it

is   not  guilty  of  ministerial  interference   in

executive conduct and the alleged compulsion brought

to bear upon civil servants to give licences - should

appoint a Commission of Inquiry to ascertain how and

why  this monstrosity comes to disfigure this island

of  ours, and they should furthermore give notice to

the  organisation immediately responsible  for  this

commercial insult to our city that the licences  for

the display will be terminated when they rust out at

the end of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also take the liberty, Mr Mammen, Sir, to

suggest to the Japanese mercantile community that it

would  be  wiser  in  the  long  run  in  their  own

interests  to  see that a monument of ths  character

and this arrogance should not continue to insult and

antagonise our citizens. Their friendship  with  the

Minister  for Finance today will, as it  transpires,

be found to be a very fleeting asset.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot

but  express my agreement with the sentiments of the

Member  for  Anson.  This  "National"  monument   is

national, not in the sense of belonging to  us,  the

people of Singapore, but belonging to the "National"

radios,  and  commercial firms of Japan.  This  ugly

monstrosity could never have past me during the time

I  was in the City Council or during the time I  was

in charge of the Ministry of National Development.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I remember that during my time

there was another advertisement which was only  one-tenth the size of this monument. It was situated  in

People's  Park. The City Council decided that  after

the  expiry  of the lease given by the  former  City

Council, we should not extend it any longer. As  far

as I can remember, under existing policies such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



a  monument - I think "monument" is too good  a  word - such  a  structure can never get pass the  Building

Surveyor's   Department   or   the   City   Planning

Department.  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not

actually know how this disgrace to our landscape -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - this disfigurement to our city

silhouette can get through the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there might be many reasons. One of the possible reasons, as the Member for Anson has said, may be that the Minister for Finance over-ruled the decision of civil servants. That reason is possible because I always have doubt, for instance, as to why the Government dare not

press   on  with  the  claim  against  the  Japanese

Government  for  compensation. Was  it  because  the

P.A.P.  Ministers  were scared of the  Japanese  not

coming  to Singapore for further investment? Or  was

it  because some of the P.A.P. Ministers had  during

the  Japanese  occupation worked for  the  Japanese?

That  we  would not know. Anyway, I agree  with  the

Member  for  Anson  that we  must  probe  into  this

disgrace to our city, how it came to pass, and  that

the  Government should give us full details  of  how

this monument was actually approved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, the "National" advertising tower  is

a great insult to the people of Singapore. We do not

know  why  the Government approved the  erection  of

this  advertising tower. Does the erection  of  this

tower  mean  that  the  Government  approve  of  the

Japanese massacre of our people in the Second  World

War?   Civic   organisations  here   have   demanded

compensation  for the victims of the  massacre,  but

the  Government have not taken the issue  seriously,

but  instead  are adopting delaying tactics  and  so

have annoyed the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that this advertising tower has

a  red  background. Thousands of people in Singapore

were massacred by the Japanese troops, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



this debt cannot be cleared. And this tower by using

red  as  the background symbolises the blood of  the

people  of Singapore, and indirectly it insults  the

people of Singapore. Therefore, we suggest that  the

Government should order the company to pull down the

tower  and press the Japanese to compensate for  the

massacre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Sir, during his speech the Member for Anson

mentioned  certain information that he had  received - that   according  to  his  understanding   of   his

information,  the  Chief  Planner  and   the   Chief

Building Surveyor had, in fact, refused the erection

of  this  tower  but were pressured by  the  Finance

Minister  to agree to it. Sir, according to  what  I

understand,  this  is  very  far  from  true.  As  I

answered the Member for Anson sometime ago  on  this

question  of the "National" sign along North  Bridge

Road,  I  informed the Member that the  approval  of

this sky-sign was given by the Planning Authority as

well  as  the Chief Surveyor's Department.  I  would

like  to  further  inform him that  before  planning

permission  was  granted to the proposed  structure,

this  proposal was also referred to the  Development

Control  Committee, whose members include the  Chief

Planner,  the  Director of Public Works,  the  Chief

Building Surveyor, and a representative each of  the

Singapore  Institute of Architects and  the  Malayan

Society  of  Engineers.  This Committee  considered,

amongst other factors, the aspects of this proposal,

and  was able to advise approval, subject to certain

improvements  being  made  to  the  design  of   the

structure,  which were duly complied  with.  Whether

this    particular   structure   is    aesthetically

objectionable is a matter of opinion.  I  might  add

that in any big cities such as ours, advertising sky-signs  are an accepted feature of the city sky-line.

In  fact,  at  this moment, there are 121  sky-signs

erected in Singapore, and it is odd that the  Member

for  Anson,  the Member for Hong Lim  and  even  the

Member  for Pasir Panjang should object to only  one

of the -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> But not of that size, nor of that

height.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, as regards size, I would like

to inform the Member for Anson that there is also  a

Pan-American  Airlines sky-sign which is  very  much

higher  than  this  sky-sign,  but  he  has  got  no

objection to it. This is not a sky-sign erected by a

local -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification.

[Interruption] P.A.P. courtesy to the last!



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, the Pan-American

Airlines  sign  is higher, but it is infinitesimally

smaller,  if the Minister knows what that means.  It

is  an  extremely small one - at the top of the Cathay

building, not this monstrous structure going up from

the ground floor to 160 odd feet high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan</b> rose - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I gave him the courtesy but he

will  not  give  me  this  courtesy.  Although  this

"National" sky-sign is over a hundred feet high, the

lighted  area  is  not that long. Sir,  I  was  very

curious  why  the Member for Anson was  so  obsessed

with this sky-sign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He stays close by.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I was told yesterday after this

matter  was raised by the Member for Anson  that  he

lives nearby, and for curiosity's -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is not true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> - sake, I looked up the telephone

directory.  I  found under the  name  of  Mr  David

Marshall, there were two addresses. One I  think  is

No. 17, or something to that effect, Meyer Mansions.

For  your  information, Meyer  Mansions  is  just  a

stone's  throw  from this sky-sign and  I  am  told,

rightly  or  wrongly, that this sky-sign  must  have

disturbed him during his sleep.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, I think, Sir,

because this is misleading.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> May I ask the Member whether

it is a point of order or a point of clarification

first?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I think it is a point of order. You

can decide, Sir. The question is this. That he is

misleading the House in respect of an issue of fact.

Would you permit me to clarify it?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It is a point of

clarification, I think. If the Minister will give

way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You want to take over the forum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I have extended to him the

courtesy of elucidation. Sir, as I have said, in the

telephone  directory, in the name of David Marshall,

the  Member for Anson, there are two addresses: one,

Tanah  Merah Besar or something like that,  and  the

other,  Meyer  Mansions. So I was very  curious;  in

fact  I  went round to this building, and  saw  that

when the lights come on on this sky-sign they really

reflect  into  the Meyer Mansions.  Sir,  if  it  is

because of the convenience of the Member for  Anson,

I  will  definitely not do a thing about  this  sky-sign.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And I would not ask you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> But, coming from the Member for

Anson who lives, when it is convenient for him to do

so, in town, at the Meyer Mansions -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is not true. I go over there -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> But how is it in the new

telephone directory, his address is still there?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have an address in the Bank of

China.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> But this is the residence - of Mr

David  Marshall, 17 Meyer Mansions, and  then  Tanah

Merah Besar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim just now said he agreed

with  the  Member for Anson and he was also pursuing

the  line  that this is not the work  of  the  civil

servants but the work or the Finance Minister.  Sir,

Ministers have very important duties to do. They  do

not spend their time deciding whether such sky-signs

should be placed here or there. This is the work  of

civil  servants. As I have mentioned just now, there

is  a  Development Control Committee that goes  into

these  cases.  There are such things  as  prohibited

areas  where sky-signs will not be allowed, and  the

Committee   in  considering  the  applications   for

putting up this sky-sign went into all these things.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Where is their report?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson does not

allow me to continue. He keeps on interjecting. As I

have   said  just  now,  this  Development  Planning

Committee decided to approve the plan before it  was

passed  down to The Planning Department,  and  after

the  Planning  Department went through  it,  it  was

passed   down  to  the  Chief  Building   Surveyor's

Department, which is under my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this application has gone through the normal

procedure  of going through the Development  Control

Committee,  the Planning Department  and  the  Chief

Building Surveyor's Department. At no time has  this -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at Eight o'clock p.m., and the time appointed for the termination of

the  sitting (half-past Eight p.m.) having  arrived,

Mr  Deputy  Speaker adjourned the Assembly  without

Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at half-past Eight o'clock p.m.</div>
