<div align="center"><b>TRANSFER OF TEACHERS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Government policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Education

if he is aware that a considerable number of transfers

of  teachers  are being made and some at an  instant's

notice through telephone calls from the Ministry;  why

these transfers are necessary and carried out in  such

manner; and if he will state his Ministry's policy  on

the transfer of teachers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by the

Minister  to reply. In the first five months  of  this

year  509 teachers, or only 2.6 per cent of the entire

teaching  force of 19,200 teachers, were  transferred.

Of  this  number, 352 transfers, or 70 per cent,  were

effected  during the first two months as a  result  of

transfers  of  pupils at the request of parents.  Such

transfers  are  unavoidable because my Ministry  makes

every  effort to satisfy the wishes of parents in  the

choice  of school for pupils who are entering  primary

or  secondary school for the first time. Consequently,

the number of classes authorised and the corresponding

number of teachers assigned to each school at the  end

of  the  previous  year have to  be  adjusted  at  the

beginning of each school year. Moreover, the choice of

a  second  language and the number and type of  second

language  teachers needed for a particular school  can

only  be ascertained when the pupils have settled down

after the transfer exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these unavoidable transfers at the

beginning  of the year, there are other reasons  which

account for transfers on a small scale throughout  the

year.  These  include the secondment  of  teachers  to

other  Ministries and statutory boards; adjustment  in

the  staffing quota as a result of trainees  qualified

as  trained  teachers and, consequently, taking  in  a

full teaching load; changes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



in  the  curriculum  resulting in  different  staffing

needs; and requests from the teachers themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers at an instant's notice by telephone calls

are made only when the situation warrants such action,

as  when  a  vacancy is created by death or unexpected

retirement, or when teachers are rendered redundant in

one school while classes in another school are without

teachers as a result of a mass transfer of pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of my Ministry is to keep transfers of

teachers  down to a minimum consistent with the  needs

of  the  schools  and the interest of the  pupils.  To

minimise   the  number  of  transfers,   my   Ministry

introduced  a  new  scheme last year  whereby  primary

teachers with at least five years' teaching experience

could  opt for a transfer to a school of their  choice

on  the  understanding  that the  Ministry  would  not

transfer  them  out for the next five years,  and  the

teachers  themselves  would not  ask  for  a  transfer

during these five years unless the circumstances  were

altogether exceptional.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 257 teachers who applied, 200 were accepted

under this five-year no transfer scheme. However, with

the  greater  emphasis  on  technical  and  vocational

education, the consequential transfer of students from

the  academic to the technical stream and the proposed

conversion   of  vocational  schools  into  industrial

training  centres, more transfers of teachers  in  the

next two or three years will be inevitable.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOOL PRINCIPALS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Duties)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Education

(a)  if  he is aware that during the first five months

of  this  year  heads  of schools  have  already  been

required  to submit an unduly large number of  returns

to the Ministry; and why such a considerable number of

returns  have been called for; (b) whether he is  also

aware  that certain heads of schools have been put  in

charge of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



defined areas and have been required to telephone  all

the  schools  in the area to secure any data  for  the

Ministry as and when the Ministry calls for such  data

by  telephone; and why such a system is necessary; and

(c)  whether  an efficient system of data registration

and  maintenance can be devised so as  to  allow  more

time for heads of schools to devote their attention to

improving the quality of teaching in their schools.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my Minister to

reply.  During  the first five months  of  this  year,

schools  were  requested  to  submit  a  total  of  82

returns. This cannot by any stretch of the imagination

be  regarded as an unduly large number in view of  the

fact  that  my  Ministry administers 593 schools  with

19,160  teachers, 2,550 non-teaching staff and 530,000

students. The majority of the returns are of an annual

recurrent nature, such as those relating to staff  and

student   data  for  the  purpose  of  compiling   the

Ministry's  statistical bulletins, nominal  rolls  for

the  four  streams  for  15  school  examinations   at

different   levels  -  the  Primary   School   Leaving

Examination, the School Certificate, the Higher School

Certificate,    the   Secondary   Vocational    School

Certificate,   the   National   Language   Certificate

examinations;   returns  in  respect   of   bursaries,

scholarships and training awards; and returns  seeking

the   schools'  proposals  for  special  or  recurrent

expenditure  for  the preparation of the  next  year's

budget  estimates. Other circulars seeking information

on  an  ad  hoc  basis are sent to schools  only  when

strictly  necessary.  In  all  cases,  information  is

sought  from schools only when such information cannot

be obtained from any other source.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of the question, Sir,

a  system  of relaying urgent messages or instructions

to  schools  by telephone was first introduced  during

confrontation.  Under this system, my  Ministry  would

telephone  a number of designated schools which  would

in  turn  relay the message to schools in their  area.

The  aim of this system was to get the message through

to all the schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



as  quickly as possible and to avoid overloading a few

telephone  lines. Now that confrontation is  over  and

security  is no longer a major problem, the system  of

relaying messages by telephone is only resorted to  in

emergencies,  such as the evacuation of students  when

schools in certain areas are flooded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the last part of the question, Sir, an

efficient  system of data registration and maintenance

is  being devised. All teachers have completed  a  pro

forma in which their personal particulars, details  of

qualifications, teaching experience, service  matters,

extracurricular  activities,  community  service,  in-service  courses  attended, etc, are  entered.  These

returns  are  currently being processed  for  computer

programming so that essential information may be  made

available   at  short  notice  for  the   purpose   of

educational  planning, and it  is  expected  that  the

frequency  of having to submit returns of this  nature

will diminish.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  will the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Education state that as and when this  system  of

registration of data is set up, the number of  returns

that are sent out to the schools will be minimised?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> if we consider the types of

returns we look for, by and large, the largest  number

of  returns sent out related to examination divisions,

of  which  no  less than 31 were sent out  during  the

first  half  of  this  year.  These  are  unlikely  to

diminish  because we still have to know  who  will  be

taking  what  examinations. But others of a  recurrent

nature  pertaining to personal data will be  minimised

in the future.

<div align="center"><b>TEACHERS' COMPLAINTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AGAINST PRINCIPALS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether  complaints  made by  teachers  against  their

principals are investigated; and what action is  taken

against  the  teachers concerned if, on investigation,

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



complaints are found to be unfounded and unfair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my Minister to

reply.  Complaints made by teachers against principals

are  investigated. Disciplinary action would be  taken

against  the  teachers concerned if  such  complaints,

after  investigation, are found to be malicious. There

are,   however,  not  many  known  cases  of  teachers

complaining openly against their principals. This  may

be   due  to  the  fact  that  correspondence  between

teachers  and  the Ministry is conducted  through  the

principal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 1967 there have been four such cases.

In  one  case,  the  principal was dismissed.  In  the

second,  the  allegation  was  unfounded  but  as  the

complainants  were anonymous, no further action  could

be  taken.  In the third case, some of the allegations

were  partly true and the principal was sent  for  and

advised.  In  the  fourth  case,  the  allegation  was

unsubstantiated and the teacher, a temporary  officer,

was reprimanded. He has since left the service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>TEACHERS OF ENGLISH IN CHINESE SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Education

if   he  is  aware  (a)  that  some  Cambridge  School

Certificate   holders  teach  English  not   only   in

secondary  classes but also in Pre-University  classes

in Chinese schools; and (b) that some English teachers

regard  posting to Chinese schools as a  drudgery  and

try  their best to be transferred away; and what steps

he proposes to take in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my Minister to

reply.  It is true that some of the teachers  teaching

English in Pre-University classes in Chinese secondary

schools    possess   only   the   School   Certificate

qualification. However, this situation has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



to be viewed in the light of the following factors:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The standard of English in the non-English

medium  school is generally pitched at a  level

two  years below that of a corresponding  class

in  the  English school. That is to  say,  Pre-University  I  students in non-English  schools

are doing Secondary III English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Since 1965 special in-service courses in the

teaching  of English as a second language  have

been  conducted for teachers of English in non-English  schools. Of the 1,292 English teachers

in   Chinese  schools,  794  have  successfully

completed  the  course  and  another  402   are

currently undergoing training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Of the 212 teachers of English currently

teaching  in 21 Chinese secondary schools  with

Pre-University classes, 26 are graduates;  five

have   had  special  training  abroad  in   the

teaching  of English as a second language,  and 14

possess  the Higher School Certificate.  As

and  when  more  graduates are available,  they

will be posted to Chinese secondary schools  to

teach English in the Pre-University classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the second part of the question, Sir,

some teachers of English in Chinese schools prefer  to

be  posted  back  to English schools  for  three  main

reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Being used to the environment of an English

school,  they find it difficult to  adapt  them

selves  to  the  situation in a Chinese  school

where  the  main  language of  instruction  and

school administration is Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As teachers of English, they teach no other

subjects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, they find their work somewhat

monotonous   and  the  amount  of   corrections

excessive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Very often teachers of English are called upon

to  help  with  translations and  other  chores

because of their fluency in English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has taken steps to ascertain the number

of  such  teachers who wish to be transferred back  to

English schools. At the same time, a circular has been

issued   inviting   applicants   from   English-medium

teachers  who  are  genuinely interested  in  teaching

English as a second language. Those who apply will  be

given special training in the teaching of English as a

second  language  and  posted to  Chinese  schools  as

replacements  for those who opt to be posted  back  to

English   schools.  The  question  of   monotony   and

excessive  work will also be ameliorated when  science

and  technical  subjects are  taught  in  the  English

medium in the next few years.

<div align="center"><b>(Flushing of drains)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Minister for Health

if  he  will  inform  the House of  the  measures  his

Ministry  has taken or proposes to take to ensure  the

adequate  flushing  of  all drains,  including  outlet

drains,  in  the  Joo  Chiat Constituency,  as  choked

drains  and stagnant waters are not conducive  to  the

health of the residents in the area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, where there are regular obstructions to

the  flow  of  water  in drains due  to  refuse  being

thoughtlessly  thrown into them causing stagnation  of

water,   smell,  and  the  breeding   of   flies   and

mosquitoes, especially where such drains are small and

narrow,  structurally defective,  or  are  covered  by

slabs   or   hawkers'  paraphernalia,  thus   actually

hindering   and  physically  preventing   the   proper

cleansing  of  and  the removal of  refuse  from  such

drains, then, as a public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



health measure, the flushing of such drains is carried

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flushing of a drain so as to remove obstruction

caused  by refuse and to provide some measure of  flow

of  water  through it, is, therefore, only a temporary

palliative  measure  which is resorted  to  only  when

there is no access or there are obstructions over  the

drain  preventing physical entry into  the  drain  for

cleansing  work. Accordingly, the small drains  around

congested  hawker areas in Joo Chiat  and  Katong  are

flushed every day, while in some less congested  shop-houses  and residential areas, flushing of the  drains

once or twice a week is carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storm water drains receiving no sullage water do not

require  any  flushing, while in  big  outlet  drains,

flushing is not effective, as the small jets of  water

from the flushing hoses cannot move the refuse in  big

drains, let alone dislodge obstructions in them.  This

is because the combined inertia of the great volume of

water  and  the big mass of refuse in such big  outlet

drains  rapidly  dissipates the energy  of  the  small

water jets of the flushing hoses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that only about 10 per cent of all

drains  in  built-up  areas  in  Singapore  are  being

flushed  as  proper  cleansing  work  cannot  be  done

because of obstructions or hindrances on or over these

drains, using about 350,000 gallons of water per  day.

If  all  drains, including outlet drains, in Singapore

were  to  he flushed, as suggested by the hon.  Member

for Joo Chiat, this would require at least 3.5 million

gallons of water every day going down the drain.  This

would  cost the Government $3,500 in water  bills  per

day; an expenditure which is not only unnecessary, but

completely unjustifiable as the precious water in  our

island  republic should never be allowed to be  wasted

in this way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flushing of drains, accordingly, is not the

answer.  The  solution, therefore,  is  not  to  allow

drains   to   be   choked   with   ref   use,   thrown

indiscriminately   and   thoughtlessly   by   hawkers,

shopkeepers and householders alike. Refuse  should  he

placed in properly covered dust-bins for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



removal by public cleansing workmen. Drains should not

be  slabbed and covered over so that there will be  no

obstructions or hindrances to public cleansing workers

cleaning and removing refuse from drains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new Conservancy Regulations which came into

force  on  1st  July, 1968 - I hope hon.  Members  are

quite   familiar   with   the   provisions   -   every

householder, hawker and stall-holder will be  required

to have a dustbin or be provided with a dustbin by the

Cleansing Department, and the cost recovered from them

through the P.U.B. Consolidated Accounts. Heavy  fines

of  up  to  $150 for the first offence, $500  for  the

second   offence,  and  $1,000  for  the   third   and

subsequent   offences  will  be  imposed   on   anyone

depositing  refuse  on  to the  roadsides,  backlanes,

vacant  grounds,  or into drains. With  these  revised

public health regulations, there should be very little

need  for  drain flushing, and there should be  a  new

consciousness among the public cleansing  workers  and

the  members  of  the public alike to  make  and  keep

Singapore the cleanest city in Southeast Asia.

<div align="center"><b>DUST-BINS IN PUBLIC PLACES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Increased provision)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether he will consider increasing the number of dust-bins  provided  in public places and placing  them  at

closer  intervals as a means to reduce  indiscriminate

throwing of litter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the indiscriminate throwing

of  refuse and littering are usually the result  of  a

lack of civic pride or a sense of civic consciousness.

However, it has been realised that an insufficiency of

suitable   refuse  bins  or  containers   may   be   a

contributory factor to such indiscriminate  littering.

Accordingly,  in 1967 the Public Health Division  took

steps  to  design  and to provide a  large  number  of

proper litter bins so as to reduce the tendency  among

the public to throw refuse about indiscriminately. Due

to the large numbers of such litter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



bins  that must be bought and fixed, the provision  of

such litter bins is being done in phases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was decided to give priority to the fixing of

litter  bins  at bus stops. The fixing of such  litter

bins  to  all the bus stops in the city area has  been

completed,  and similarly all bus stops  in  the  main

thoroughfares  in  the  rural  areas  have  also  been

provided with such litter bins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the next phase of the operation is

under  way,  in which litter bins are being  fixed  at

road  junctions and along busy streets  especially  in

the  shopping  areas and near and around  cinemas  and

picture  halls. To date, a total of 1,660 litter  bins

have been installed in such places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being aware that a lot of littering is taking place

in  areas  where hawkers congregate, hawkers  are  now

required  to provide refuse bins; collection bins  for

such   refuse   exist   at   all   authorised   hawker

congregations.  In the city area, 63 congested  hawker

sites  have been so provided and 300 refuse  bins  are

now in use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Public Health Division has placed

orders  for  another 2,000 litter bins which  will  be

fixed  at closer intervals along all busy streets  and

shopping areas. But it is to be appreciated that while

the  Government  can provide refuse  bins  and  litter

bins, the provision of such facilities alone would not

prevent  littering if the public were not to make  use

of  them,  in order that Singapore can be the cleanest

city  in South-east Asia, such indiscriminate throwing

of  litter  should he actively discouraged,  and  more

effective use would have to be made of the litter bins

that have been provided by the Public Health Division.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Low Guan Onn</b> asked the Minister for Health if

a dumping ground



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



for  bulk  refuse can be provided near to  the  Jurong

Industrial  Estate,  as great expense  is  at  present

being  caused to Jurong factory owners on  haulage  of

bulk  refuse to the nearest dumping ground at Tampines

which is about 25 miles from Jurong Town, and as  more

and  more  industries  are being  established  in  the

Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the need for

the  sanitary  disposal of both  domestic  refuse  and

trade  waste from the Jurong New Town and  the  Jurong

Industrial  Estate has been envisaged  in  the  health

planning requirements of the Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is realised that the long haulage for disposal at

the  Tampines  Dumping Ground for refuse collected  in

the  Jurong Industrial Estate has caused inconvenience

and  extra  expense to the Jurong factory owners.  The

problem of distance has been aggravated by the closure

of  the former dumping ground at Clementi Road in 1966

by  an  important  Government  development  near  this

Clementi Road site. Planning approval has already been

obtained   from  the  Planning  Department   for   the

development  of a refuse dumping ground,  conveniently

located for the Jurong Industrial Estate, off  16  ms.

Chua  Chu Kang Road. Necessary steps for revoking  the

temporary occupation licences of this site and for the

re-settlement of persons affected are being  taken  by

the Commissioner of Lands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of supporting facilities at the dumping

ground   is  being  processed.  Among  these  is   the

provision of a bulldozer, for which approval  for  the

purchase  has only just been approved by the  Ministry

of  Finance.  Complementary  facilities  like  a  site

office and stores are also required. The provision  of

a  vehicle weighbridge for the purpose of work control

will  be included in the development of this site.  It

is  expected that before the end of the year this  new

dumping ground will be in operation.

he  will  consider a relaxation of the policy  not  to

issue  hawkers' licences to non-citizens, in the  case

of the British military bases and who may wish to take

hawkers  still unlicensed in the Republic, and  it  is

not   possible   at  the  moment  to  determine   what

proportions  of these are non-citizens. Owing  to  the

serious situation in regard to employment, the  policy

of  this  Ministry is to register and license our  own

citizens  who want to take up hawking as  a  means  of

livelihood  and  to accommodate them  in  the  limited

sites which are available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, it is not possible to relax

<div align="center"><b>(Legislation to set up independent commission to supervise operation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if  he will consider introducing legislation to set up

an  independent commission to supervise the  operation

of the Singapore Stock Exchange.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my

Minister  to  reply  to  this  question  and  also  to

questions  Nos.  10 to 13 inclusive appearing  in  the

Order Paper today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this question is no. The Government is

prepared  to allow the Stock Exchange of Malaysia  and

Singapore to continue to function as a self-regulating

body  in  co-operation with the Ministry  of  Finance.

Agreement  has been reached between the  Committee  of

the Stock Exchange and officials of my Ministry on the

procedure  to  be  followed  by  the  Committee   when

considering applications for admission to the Official

List in respect of Singapore registered companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in the case of a new floatation or the

sale  to  the public of existing shares,  it  will  no

longer  be  sufficient to file with the  Registrar  of

Companies   a  prospectus  which  meets  the   minimum

requirements of the Companies Act. The promoters  will

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



future  be  required to make a detailed disclosure  of

all material facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is alive to the important role the

Stock  Exchange can play in fostering the  development

of  a  strong capital market in Singapore.  The  Stock

Exchange will fail in this purpose unless it maintains

high  ethical standards and exercises sound  judgment.

Only  then  will  it  command the  confidence  of  the

investing   public.  At  present,  a  good  investment

proposal  will  be  readily  over-subscribed.  But  if

standards are relaxed and unsound ventures are foisted

upon  the public, this readiness to subscribe  to  new

issues will no longer prevail. It has happened to  the

Stock  Exchange of some developing countries. It  must

not be allowed to happen here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the existing arrangements for co-operation

between  the  Stock  Exchange  and  my  Ministry  work

satisfactorily  and  help  to  maintain  high  ethical

standards, the Government does not propose to  set  up

any   formal  machinery  for  regulating   the   Stock

Exchange, especially since the Exchange is still quite

small.

<div align="center"><b>TOURISM POTENTIAL OF BALI</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if  he  will make a statement on the progress made  by

the technical fact-finding mission to Indonesia on the

tourism potential of Bali.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> The

technical  mission returned to Singapore on  8th  May,

1968,  and  its  members are preparing  a  report  for

submission   to  the  Governments  of  Indonesia   and

Singapore.  The report is now in the course  of  being

printed and will soon be laid before Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I can say at this stage is that the prospects of

successful  development of Bali  as  an  international

tourist  centre  are much better than  had  previously

been  thought possible. The preparation of the  runway

to  cope  with international jet airliners  is  in  an

advanced   stage.  Another  welcome  factor   is   the

willingness of the Indonesian Government to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



offer  favourable  terms  to  foreign  investment   in

hotels.  But,  most of all, we are encouraged  by  the

high  quality  of Indonesian engineers and  architects

now planning the Bali project. Professional members of

the   Singapore  mission  were  impressed   by   their

qualifications, experience and dedication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, a number of problems to be solved

and  no  doubt the report will go into these  at  some

length.  This  project  offers  much  scope  for   co-operation  between the Governments  of  Indonesia  and

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to eliminate fleecing of tourists)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether he is aware of any measures now being taken or

proposed to be taken by the Tourist Promotion Board to

eliminate   any  possible  fleecing  of  tourists   by

unscrupulous  taxi-drivers,  shop-keepers,  etc.;  and

whether he will inform the House of such measures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, through the combined efforts of the

Tourist   Promotion  Board,  the  relevant  Government

departments, the taxi-drivers' associations,  the  bus

operators and the Singapore Tourist Association,  many

of  the evils which beset the tourist industry in  the

past have been corrected to some extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first deal with taxi transport. The Airport

taxi service racket, whereby taxis did not use meters,

has  been  stopped. Since late last year  the  Airport

Police and a representative of the Taxi Association at

the Airport have undertaken supervision to ensure that

meters are used. Those taxi drivers who did not comply

have  had  their  permits to operate  at  the  Airport

withdrawn.  At  the Port of Singapore  Authority,  the

transport  service  is  also  satisfactory.   Adequate

numbers  of  taxis are allowed into the  harbour  area

when  a  passenger vessel is in port  and  the  police

ensure that meters are used.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourists are also given alternative transport

facilities  such  as a bus service direct  to  Raffles

Place.  But once outside the Airport or harbour  area,

there  is little control on unscrupulous taxi drivers.

However,  the  Registrar  of Vehicles  has  powers  to

revoke or suspend licences issued to taxi drivers  who

are  found guilty of malpractices or improper conduct.

Educating  the taxi drivers is important. The  Tourist

Promotion Board will in future he working closely with

representatives  of the various taxi  associations  to

minimise cheating and discourtesy to tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the taxi drivers, there are the shop-keepers who can be equally unscrupulous, if not more

so.   The   Tourist  Promotion  Board,   through   its

counterpart  in  the  private  sector,  the  Singapore

Tourist  Association, has taken steps to  ensure  that

some  130 of its members in the retail trade follow  a

code  of ethics. These shops display conspicuous price

tags  and issue receipts for purchases made,  so  that

complaints  of  cheating  could  be  investigated  and

redressed, if possible. My Ministry intends to ask the

Tourist Promotion Board to take steps to ensure  wider

acceptance of the code of ethics by a larger number of

retailers who are not members of the Singapore Tourist

Association  and  to  consider  instituting  sanctions

against those found guilty of unscrupulous fleecing of

tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides transport and shopping, the Tourist Promotion

Board  is  now  looking into all  aspects  of  service

facilities  provided  by the  private  sector  to  the

tourists. These services will have to be up-graded  in

terms of quality and honesty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tourist Promotion Board will soon be setting up a

complaints   bureau  to  attend  to  complaints   from

tourists  as  well as those involved  in  the  tourist

trade. This will ensure that we will be able to  focus

a proper image as a first-class tourist centre.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to enable all women

officers who have joined the Government service on  or

after the 1st of July, 1956, to retire at the optional

age of 50 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st March, 1962, the P.A.P. Government took the

revolutionary  step of accepting the policy  of  equal

pay  for women. We are the first Government to do this

in  South-east  Asia, possibly in the whole  of  Asia.

Women officers have been accorded terms and conditions

of   service  similar  to  those  applicable  to  male

officers  in  Government service.  These  include  the

condition  relating  to age of retirement.  Under  the

provisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Pensions Ordinance, which came into force  on

1st  July, 1956, the normal age of retirement for male

officers  recruited before that date is 55  years  and

for  those recruited after that date, 60 years.  Women

officers, in the light of the equal treatment  policy,

are  therefore allowed to opt to accept the men's  age

of  retirement, that is, 55 or 60 years, especially in

the case of those women officers who were appointed to

the  service before 1st March, 1962, or who  were  re-appointed after resignation on account of marriage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add that under the Pensions Ordinance there is

also  provision  for those women officers  in  service

before  1st  July, 1956, to retire on their  attaining

the  age of 45 years if they have so elected, but  the

number  of such women officers has dwindled to  a  few

now, with the passage of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience has shown that women officers are

generally  not in favour of remaining in  the  service

until the same retirement age as men. The majority  of

them prefer to retire at an earlier age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Bill seek to accommodate the

wishes  of  the majority of Government women  officers

who  thus have the best of both worlds. They  are  not

only  equal  with  men; they are, in  fact,  now  more

equal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, section 12 of the Civil Law

Ordinance (Chapter 24) provides for compensation to be

paid to the family of a person for loss occasioned  by

his  death  caused  by the wrongful  act,  neglect  or

default of another. Notwithstanding the death  of  the

person  injured, an action can be brought in court  by

his  executor  for the benefit of his  wife,  husband,

parent  and child, and in every such action the  court

may give such damages as it thinks fit proportionately

to   the  loss  resulting  from  such  death  to   the

dependants respectively for whom and for whose benefit

such  action was brought. In the present state of  the

law, however, any damages awarded by a court would  be

reduced  by  the  amount of any  pension  or  gratuity

payable  on  the death of the deceased. The  court  in

reducing an award follows well-established common  law

rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the operation of these rules often

gives rise to hardship. The dependants of the deceased

who are entitled to receive the pension or gratuity on

his  death  are,  in  fact, placed at  a  disadvantage

compared to the dependants of a deceased who  are  not

so  entitled.  This is not difficult to appreciate  if

one  recalls  that the person entitled  to  receive  a

pension  normally  earns a reduced salary  during  his

working  life  to  compensate for the pension  element

payable  when  lie  ceases to work,  and  it  is  this

reduced  salary  that the court uses as  a  basis  for

assessing damages for the loss of future earnings. The

dependants  are  further penalised because  the  court

deducts from the total amount of damages to be awarded

the  amount  of  pension that is to  be  paid  to  the

dependants.  You will appreciate, Sir, that  in  cases

involving  the  award  of  substantial  damages,   the

dependants  could,  therefore, suffer  a  considerable

loss by the operation of these common law rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is, therefore, designed to remedy

this state of affairs and to give statutory relief  in

the manner described in clause 2 to the dependants  of

deceased persons whose death is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



caused in the circumstances contemplated by section 12

of   the   Ordinance.  The  effect  of  the   amending

legislation will accordingly be that the court will be

debarred   from  taking  into  account  any   pension,

gratuity  or  other payment which may  be  payable  on

death  when  making an award under the above-mentioned

section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill does not introduce a

novel  principle  into  the law.  Section  12  of  the

Ordinance already provides that the court, when making

an  award, shall not take into account any sum payable

to  dependants  of  the deceased under  any  insurance

policy. In this context, there is little difference in

principle between the payment of insurance monies  and

the  payment of a pension or gratuity as a  result  of

death. The Government, therefore, considers that as  a

measure  of  relief  to  dependants,  pension   monies

payable as a result of death should be treated in  the

same  way  as insurance monies and not, therefore,  be

taken  into  account by the court  when  an  award  of

damages  is made under that section of the  Civil  Law

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>

authorised to borrow by the issue of Treasury Bills in

the  Republic from $150 million to sums not  exceeding

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for Treasury Bills is increasing and the

approval  of  this House is, therefore,  requested  to

raise  the  limit  to  $1,000  million.  There  is   a

sufficiently large quantity of surplus funds which are

available  for  investment for short  periods.  It  is

essential  that  banks,  as well  as  other  financial

institutions,  including Government statutory  bodies,

should be provided with a secure short-term investment

outlet for such funds. The authority of Parliament  is

requested  to enable the Government to issue  Treasury

Bills up to an amount not exceeding $1,000 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go into the wider political and

economic  problems this Bill is designed to  meet  and

overcome,  I  would like, first of all, to  deal  with

significant details of the Bill itself. Since the Bill

was  introduced  on  15th May. 1968,  there  has  been

considerable discussion on it. Some of this  has  been

constructive and pertinent but, unfortunately, a great

deal,  too, has been no more than excited gossip based

not  on  what  the Bill really contains and  seeks  to

accomplish but on rumours of what the Bill is supposed

to  contain.  Even allegedly progressive intellectuals

and  defenders  of  workers' rights have  been  making

indignant  pronouncements without, I  suspect,  having

read  the Bill itself. These criticisms have been very

much  like those of the highly emotional advocate  who

concluded his case by saying, "This then, gentlemen of

the  jury, are the opinions on which I have  based  my

facts."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may, therefore, be helpful for debate inside and

outside  Parliament  were we to first  get  right  our

facts about this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be some misapprehension that the

Employment  Bill,  as  a whole,  is  a  new  piece  of

legislation  designed radically to  alter  our  labour

laws.  This  is not true. The bulk of the Bill  merely

brings  together  in a convenient and systematic  form

the  existing Employment Ordinances which  have  grown

piecemeal  year by year. Mr Speaker, Sir, a reference

to  the  comparative  table will  show  that  only  10

clauses or, roughly, six per cent of the total  number

of clauses in the Bill are new. It follows, therefore,

that  some  94  per cent of the clauses  in  the  Bill

merely re-enact existing labour legislation. A few  of

the  old clauses have been modified or refined to meet

the   objectives  of  increased  productivity  or   to

generate new employment or to iron out anomalies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet some enthusiastic critics, unaware of this fact,

have attacked some of these re-enacted clauses in  the

belief  that these were innovations to deprive workers

of their hard-earned rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the overall impact of the new provisions in

the Bill, it will cut into some of the fringe benefits

enjoyed  by a minority of the total working population

in  Singapore  - the organised sections of  the  white

collar   workers.   Even  here,   as   a   result   of

representations   made   by  N.T.U.C. leaders,   the

Government    has    agreed   to   consider    certain

modifications  to  the  Bill  as  it  was   originally

presented. This is in order to enable these workers to

adjust  themselves to the fact that  labour  laws  and

practices should aid and not restrict rapid industrial

growth and economic expansion. Let me state here  that

we   are  not  restricting  certain  types  of  fringe

benefits either because we want to make life miserable

for  workers or because, as it is alleged, we want  to

enrich the rich at the expense of the poor. We in  the

Government  are not going to get a cent for  ourselves

by enriching the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



capitalists.  On the contrary, if, as politicians,  we

had  wanted to ensure the popularity of our party  and

thus  assure ourselves of a longer political life,  it

would  have been in our interests to have presented  a

Bill  the opposite of what is now under consideration.

In  many newly independent countries, politicians  out

to  be popular with the people, and particularly  with

the workers because they happen to be in the majority,

have   invariably  persecuted  and  impoverished   the

capitalists  in  the belief that as  the  rich  become

poorer, the poor would become richer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have studied these examples with great interest

and in every case the result has been contrary to what

was  expected:  the capitalists certainly  have  grown

poorer  but the poor have grown poorer still. We  need

only  look  around  us  for  evidence  of  this.   The

economies  of  all these countries are in  ruins;  the

rich   maintain   their  wealth  and  profit   through

corruption, loot and reckless exploitation of the poor

which  yearly grow in size and in the measure of their

desperation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because we have learnt from the bitter

experiences  of those who promised prosperity  without

tears  and  without  effort that we  have  decided  to

promise  prosperity the only practical  and  effective

way - the hard way. It is not a popular way - that  is

popular with a weak and effete people. But we  do  not

believe that our people are weak or effete. We  belief

that  if  they  can  be told the hard  facts  of  life

honestly  and  bluntly,  they  will  respond  to   the

challenges ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the people will respond provided they are

convinced  that  the effort and difficult  adjustments

demanded   are  really  directed  towards   eventually

promoting the well-being of the people as a whole  and

not  merely  to enrich a privileged few - whether  gay

and  fun-loving political leaders or the  racketeering

ruffians with whom they are allied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have brought this Bill because we believe that

though  it  will prevent the misuse of certain  fringe

benefits enjoyed by some categories of workers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



it  will  nevertheless ensure the  long-term  economic

well-being  of  all  the workers  and  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with specific clauses in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I discuss the provisions of the Bill, I would

like to state here that consultations have taken place

between  the  Government, the Employers' organisations

and    the    N.T.U.C.,   following   which    certain

modifications  and  refinements  have  been  made   by

Government to some provisions in the Bill with which I

shall deal in detail later on. The Member for Bukit Ho

Swee  has  also tabled notice of amendments  which  he

proposes to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill abolishes the current statutory definition

between clerks, industrial clerks, shop assistants and

workmen.  It  brings within its scope all persons  who

are  employed under a contract of service, other  than

those   employed   in  a  managerial,   executive   or

confidential  position,  all  of  whom   would   enjoy

standardised  working conditions. Further,  Government

employees will not be affected unless declared by  the

President to be employees for the purposes of the Act.

The  provisions of the Bill will not apply to domestic

servants   unless   the  Minister   so   declares   by

notification in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 on notice of termination of contract has

been the subject of criticism by certain quarters. The

point   has  been  missed  that  the  notice   periods

prescribed apply only in the absence of any  provision

for  notice  in the contract of service.  It  is  also

worthwhile  to point out that the notice  periods  are

similar  to those provided in the British Contract  of

Employment   Act,  1963,  and  if  such  periods   are

considered  fair and reasonable by the United  Kingdom

workers,  then there seems to be no reason  why  these

periods  should  be  considered a retrograde  step  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 of the Bill prohibiting the employment of a

person  after the age of 55 years was made  to  ensure

that  the unproductive and inefficient do not continue

in  employment  at the expense of more productive  and

able youngsters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



in  the  labour  market. However, this  provision  has

evoked  fears  amongst  older workers  and  a  certain

amount  of  misgivings from employers  in  respect  of

older   workers   whom  they  consider   skilled   and

experienced and essential to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these apprehensions, the Government will

give  consideration  to the amendment  which  will  be

formally  moved by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee  at  a

later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill on rest days, hours of work,

holidays and other conditions of service apply only to

workmen  and other employees who are in receipt  of  a

salary not exceeding $750 a month or such other amount

as may be fixed from time to time by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 stipulates that the weekly rest day shall

be  Sunday  or  any  other day as  determined  by  the

employer  by  way  of  a monthly roster.  However,  to

enable  flexibility in the arrangement  of  shifts,  a

rest  day  of a continuous period of 30 hours  may  be

substituted  for the usual rest day of 24 hours  which

is  normally from midnight to midnight. Work  on  rest

days  has  two other facets: one is where an  employee

works  on  a rest day at the request of his  employer,

and  the  other where the employee works  at  his  own

request on a rest day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38 seeks to ensure that where an employer

requires  work  of an employee on a rest  day,  he  is

obliged  to pay an extra day's salary at the  ordinary

rate  of  pay  for the day's work in addition  to  the

ordinary rate of pay for that day, which means that an

employee  would  receive  not  more  than  double  his

ordinary rate of pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is no justification for a

worker  to demand double pay for work performed  on  a

rest  day  if  he works for his employer  at  his  own

request. We have had instances of this in the past and

it is necessary that there must not be a recurrence of

such undesirable practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also provided that where an employee employed

by  the  Government or a statutory body in any of  the

essential services as defined under Part V



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



of  the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,

1955, works on a rest day or part of a rest day at the

request  of his employer, the worker shall be given  a

day off in substitution for such rest day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government will be making amendments to

this  clause to ensure that where an employee  of  the

Government  or a statutory board is required  to  work

for part of a rest day he shall only be entitled to  a

part  of a day off in substitution. This provision  is

to  ensure  that  work essential to the  community  is

carried  on  every day of the week, but  the  employee

does not lose his right to a weekly rest day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to add in this context that the

provisions   of  section  35  of  the  existing   Shop

Assistants  Employment Ordinance  requiring  shops  to

close completely on either Friday or Sunday is not re-enacted.  The  basic  idea underlying  this  provision

stemmed first from the Weekly Holidays Ordinance (Cap.

156)  enacted in 1950, to ensure that a shop assistant

enjoyed a weekly rest day. In the circumstances, there

is  no reason why a provision requiring shops to close

should  continue  to remain if the  law  ensures  shop

assistants a weekly rest day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 on hours of work standardises the hours of

work  for  all  classes of employees. In standardising

working  hours  and other conditions of employment  of

both   clerical   and   non-clerical   workers,    the

discrimination that had hitherto existed  between  the

white-collar and the blue-collar workers is eradicated

once and for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of our youths is in industry and the

continuance    of    the   existing    practices    of

discrimination would only dissuade young  people  from

taking  up  jobs in industry. A prerequisite  for  the

growth  of an industrial society is respect and status

for  those who work with their hands as well.  It  is,

therefore,  iniquitous that those on the factory  door

and  in the servicing industries whose creative skills

are  required  for  economic  growth  are  given  less

favourable terms than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



those  who sit in offices. The only group of employees

that  have  enjoyed a 39-hour week hitherto  has  been

clerks, but the provisions of clause 39 do not prevent

clerical  employees and other employees continuing  to

work  a  39-hour  week. However, overtime  rates  will

become  operative only after an employee, irrespective

of  the  group he belongs, completes 44 hours  in  one

week.  There  is, however, a restriction  on  overtime

work  in  that  an employee shall not be permitted  to

work  for  more than 48 hours in one month unless  the

Minister,  by  notification in the  Gazette,  declares

that  the  relevant  provisions  shall  not  apply  to

employees in any particular industry or undertaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that hon. Members will

agree  that  excessive overtime  must  be  controlled,

because  it  is a grievous anomaly and a  travesty  of

justice that some employees should earn more than  200

per  cent of their substantive pay as overtime at  the

expense of many of our unemployed citizens who have as

much  right  as they to work, earn and live reasonably

comfortable lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, therefore, an urgent need that the

excessive  benefits  enjoyed  by  some  workers   from

overtime earnings should be spread over a wider  field

to  cover more persons. This is one of the clauses  in

the Bill which should generate greater employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standardisation of conditions of employment,

irrespective of whether an employee is a workman, shop

assistant, clerk or industrial clerk, will now  enable

all  to enjoy the same number of holidays in one year.

Eleven holidays have been specified. Only clerks  have

hitherto  enjoyed  more  than  11  holidays  a   year.

However,  all  this  will  change  and  every  one  in

Singapore,    including    Ministers,    Parliamentary

Secretaries and Government officers will have only  11

holidays in one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embodied in clause 42 on this subject, however, is

one  significant change. Triple pay for work on public

holidays will disappear. This is something unheard  of

even in industrialised countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



This  practice cropped up in Singapore  because  of  a

High   Court  decision  on  the  matter.   The   Bill,

therefore,  now  provides  that  if  an  employee   is

required  by  his employer to work on any holiday,  he

shall  be  paid only an extra day's salary in addition

to his ordinary rate of pay for that day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if a holiday falls on a half working day,

the  ordinary rate of pay payable shall be that  of  a

full  working  day. This provision does  away  with  a

certain amount of confusion that has existed over  the

provision in the existing law about what the  ordinary

rate  of  pay should be if a holiday fell  on  a  half

working  day,  i.e., a Saturday. In  this  respect  as

well, there is provision that an employee employed  by

the  Government  or a statutory body  in  any  of  the

essential  services as defined under  Part  V  of  the

Criminal  Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,  1955,

who  is required to work on any holiday or part  of  a

holiday shall be given a day or part of a day  off  in

substitution. The words "part of a holiday" and  "part

of  a  day off" have found their way in the clause  by

way of amendments that are now being moved, to meet  a

situation  where an employee is required to  work  for

part of a day on a holiday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also provided that an employee who absents

himself   from  work  on  a  working  day  immediately

preceding or immediately succeeding a holiday  or  any

day substituted therefor without the prior consent  of

his employer or without reasonable excuse shall not be

entitled to any holiday pay for that holiday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  will  recall  the  malpractices  that

existed  amongst  certain sections of the  daily-rated

workers not very long ago in this regard. It is  hoped

that  this provision will eradicate once and  for  all

malpractices of this nature in the future. I might  as

well  mention here, in this connection,  that  such  a

provision is not foreign to labour legislation, as  in

a  number of other countries such a provision is  more

or less the general practice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifications have also been introduced in respect of

annual leave. Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members are aware

that existing legislation provides 14 days paid annual

leave  to  clerical employees and seven  days  to  all

others.  The  standardisation  of  annual  leave,   as

embodied  in  clause 43, now means that all  employees

should  enjoy  the same number of days  for  every  12

months'  continuous  service with the  same  employer.

However, the refinements that have been introduced are

that where an employee has less than 10 years' service

he would be entitled to seven days leave per year. But

where  an employee has worked for 10 years or more  he

would   be   entitled  to  14  working   days.   These

refinements  favour the vast majority of workmen  who,

under  the existing law, will only enjoy seven working

days  irrespective of their period of service.  Clause

43  would  now enable the vast majority of workers  to

enjoy  14  days'  paid annual leave  after  they  have

completed  a period of 10 years' service or more  with

the  same  employer. However, clerical  employees  who

have  not  completed 10 years will stand to lose,  but

for  those  who have completed 10 years or  more,  the

position would remain unchanged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if an employee absents himself from work

without  permission or without reasonable  excuse  for

more than 20 per cent of the working days in the year,

he shall forfeit his entitlement to such leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 44 introduces another change from the existing

law in respect of sick leave. It provides for 14 days'

sick  leave if no hospitalisation is necessary and  28

days  including  the  14  days if  hospitalisation  is

necessary. An employee is also required to inform  his

employer  of  his sick leave within 48  hours  of  his

falling sick. Hon. Members will be aware of the abuses

of  sick leave by some workers in the past. Absence on

fictitious  medical  certificates have  been  frequent

because  of  the  looseness of the  provision  in  the

existing law whereby a worker could be examined by any

registered  medical practitioner if the  employer  has

not appointed one for that purpose.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



This looseness in the law has now been tightened up so

that  if  the  employer  does not  appoint  a  medical

practitioner  to  examine his employee,  the  employee

concerned  will have to see a medical officer  who  is

defined in the Bill as a medical practitioner employed

by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, however, will consider the amendment

moved  by  the Member for Bukit Ho Swee for  60  days'

sick   leave  in  each  year  if  hospitalisation   is

necessary,   inclusive  of   the   14   days   if   no

hospitalisation  is necessary when  this  is  formally

moved later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 45 on the payment of retrenchment benefit is

another new provision. It does not entitle an employee

having  less than three years' service with  the  same

employer  to retrenchment benefit. It is necessary  to

have   such  a  provision  in  this  Bill  to   ensure

stability,   particularly  in   new   and   developing

industries.  With  emphasis on production  for  export

markets,  it may be necessary for factories to  engage

workers  on a temporary short-term basis. It would  be

manifestly  unfair if these new industries would  have

to  pay  retrenchment benefits to  such  workers  once

their services are no longer required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 46 provides that an employee having less than

seven years' continuous service with the same employer

shall  not be entitled to any retirement benefit other

than  that  payable under the Central  Provident  Fund

Ordinance. The Government, will, however, consider the

amendment to be moved by the Member for Bukit Ho  Swee

at a later stage to reduce the period to five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 disallows the payment of I onus or any

other ex-gratia payment other than as an incentive  to

an  employee  to  increase his productivity  or  as  a

reward  for his performance and prohibits a collective

agreement from containing any provision otherwise than

in  accordance  with this principle. This  clause  was

made   restrictive  as  pressures  put  on   new   and

developing  industries, whose profit margins  will  be

negligible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



if  at  all, can have disastrous consequences  on  our

industrialisation   programme.   It   is,   therefore,

imperative  that uninhibited demands for bonus  should

be curbed. The Member for Bukit Ho Swee, however, will

be  moving  amendments to this clause. The  Government

will  consider  very carefully his arguments  in  this

regard when he formally moves the amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53 of the Bill makes an employer liable to the

punishment  prescribed in the Bill if  he  employs  an

employee  contrary to the provisions  of  Part  IV  or

fails  to  pay  any  salary in  accordance  with  such

provisions.  The Member for Bukit Ho  Swee  has  given

notice  that he will move an amendment to this clause.

The  Government  has  already given  notice  to  amend

clause 53.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IX of the Bill gives legal recognition to the

Employment Exchange run by the Ministry of Labour  and

there   is  provision  to  enable  the  Minister,   by

notification  in the Gazette, to require employers  to

notify vacancies to the Commissioner for Labour and to

prevent  employers  from  engaging  employees   except

through the Employment Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part X of the Bill on Employment of Women remains

substantially  similar  to  the  provisions   in   the

existing  law, but with one exception. This  exception

is  that  the  benefits are now  restricted  to  three

confinements only. It is illogical, Mr Speaker,  that

while,  on  the one hand, we are actively  pursuing  a

policy to encourage family planning, on the other,  we

should through our labour laws, nullify our efforts in

this  direction.  If  our  population  growth  is  not

contained,  it  is obvious that the  measures  we  are

taking to bring about economic growth and social well-being  will be ineffective. The restriction  to  three

confinements is, therefore, meant to discourage rather

than prohibit large families. The result would be  not

the  creation of hardships but of better  and  happier

conditions of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XIII of the Bill includes provision for the

Commissioner  for Labour to collect more comprehensive

manpower data.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XVI enables the Commissioner for Labour to

inquire into and decide any dispute or claim for wages

arising  out of the provisions of this Act or  out  of

any  term  in  a  contract of service, in  respect  of

workmen and other employees whose monthly salary  does

not exceed $750 or in respect of employees who, before

the  coming  into force of the Act, were  entitled  to

lodge  a complaint with the Commissioner under any  of

the    three   existing   Ordinances.   However,   the

Commissioner  may not inquire into a  claim  involving

matters  arising earlier than one year from  the  date

the  claim is lodged or the termination of a  contract

of  service  of  the claimant. Claims  in  respect  of

matters  arising  out  of  or  as  a  result  of   the

termination of a contract of service have to be lodged

within  six  months of such termination. Provision  is

now  made  for  the Commissioner to charge  a  nominal

registration fee as provided in Schedule C of the Bill

in respect of such claims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the facts, as I have outlined so

far,  far from bear out the wild allegations that this

Bill  has sold out the rights of the workers and given

them  over, bound hand and foot, to the tender mercies

of  vengeful employers. True, it cuts into some of the

fringe  benefits which, as I said, only a minority  of

white-collar workers by and large enjoy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Bill will bring to the large

majority  of blue-collar workers benefits  which  they

did not enjoy before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not a case of the Bill withdrawing

fringe benefits altogether. What the Bill seeks to  do

is  to  prevent the abuse of fringe benefits -  fringe

benefits  being  used as cover for malpractices  which

hamper rapid growth in productivity; which protect the

inefficient  and  which obstruct industrial  expansion

and accelerated economic expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to make is that the

Employment Bill should be read in conjunction with the

two other Bills I introduced today - the Industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



Relations  (Amendment) Bill and the Central  Provident

Fund  (Amendment)  Bill.  The  first  Bill  reinforces

management's powers to manage - powers which have been

eroded over the years and without which efficient  and

dynamic industrial growth would be seriously hampered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill, on the

other  hand, adds to the pay packet of workers by  way

of   extra  contributions  by  employers  to  workers'

savings  on  retirement or to make it possible  for  a

great many workers to purchase their own home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who read the Employment Bill carefully will

discover  that  it  in no way precludes  workers  from

seeking   their  due  and  just  share  in   expanding

prosperity.  But,  first,  there  must  be   expanding

prosperity  and  this  cannot  be  brought  about   by

dividing   and   sub-dividing  a   static   level   of

prosperity. That is why this Bill relates rewards, not

to  some  abstract and arbitrary principle of justice,

but  to  more tangible and more meaningful norms  like

efficiency,  effort, productivity and so  on.  Rewards

whether  by way of profits or wages should be  related

to economic growth and efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions under which our labour laws and the

attitudes  of  workers and entrepreneurs  were  shaped

over  the  years no longer exist. These attitudes,  if

unchanged,  will instead become factors  for  economic

disaster  and political anarchy in the seventies  when

the British withdraw. We can no longer order employee-employer relations, as we have hitherto done,  in  the

belief   that   the   ultimate   responsibility    for

Singapore's  economic well-being and for its  military

defence  will rest on the shoulders of a comparatively

affluent  Britain. The British are scheduled to  leave

Singapore  by 1971 and all the responsibility  we  can

expect  from  them  would be  their  good  wishes  and

prayers  for  our  continued  prosperity  and   safety

- perhaps  a bit more if there is a change in the  tide

of British fortunes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic well-being and survival after 1971 is in

our hands. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



best we can hope for if our economy collapses would be

that  some  kindhearted  nations  will  send  us  food

parcels   and   cast-off  clothing   to   avert   mass

starvation.  And in an island like Singaore  where  we

can  grow no food or plant cotton and where one square

mile has to keep alive and sustain 8,000 Singaporeans,

a stagnant economy means starvation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I am sure, is not the future we want for

ourselves or our children. This Bill, is, therefore, a

deliberate and planned effort, taken well in  advance,

to  get our people to make adjustments now to take  in

the  economic, political and military shock of British

withdrawal. Three years do not give us sufficient time

but  the  British have decided to make  a  precipitate

withdrawal and there is no use our trying to solve our

problems  by sitting down and beating our  breasts  in

despair. Somebody has said that there are two kinds of

peoples -there are the rabbits who, when cornered, die

easily  and  there are the cats who will  scratch  and

claw their way out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are cats and this Bill will give us the

claws  and  the strength to fight our way out  of  the

coming difficulties in the seventies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be as well, here, to mention some of these

coming  difficulties  besides  which  problems   about

bonus,  rest  days, and other alleged  suffering  will

appear trivial when the moment of reckoning comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, with the withdrawal of British Forces

some  21,000  Singapore citizens out  of  some  25,500

civilians  directly employed by the  British  will  be

without  jobs.  These 21,000 citizens  are  today  not

worrying about bonus or sick leave or holidays.  Their

immediate  fear  is  that between now  and  1971  they

would,  if  we do not take stern measures now,  be  on

indefinite  holiday without pay.  For  21,000  of  our

citizens  their  major  preoccupation  is  not  fringe

benefits but jobs in order to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor must we forget the additional thousands of

citizens who earn a living



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>

by doing service to base civilians and British soldiers - such as domestic

servants, taxi drivers, shop-keepers, restaurants and bar workers and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add to this the unemployed that now exist. According

to  the  Sample Household Survey of 1966, they  number

52,000. Add to this the 25,000 who annually enter  the

labour  market. By 1971, therefore, for  some  120,000

people  -  our  citizens - the struggle for  existence

would not be debate over fringe benefits but getting a

job,  any  kind of job just to feed, clothe and  house

themselves  and  their  families.  The  problems   and

conditions of this 120,000 require our prior attention

and   concern   rather  than  the   relatively   minor

tribulations of other categories of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those trade unionists and workers lucky enough to

have   a  job  would  do  well  to  ponder  over   the

consequences for them of massive unemployment  coupled

with economic stagnation. When there are thousands  of

workers  battering  at employers' doors  for  any  job

under  any conditions, then the door is open for  real

exploitation  and  the progressive  weakening  of  the

authority and influence of organised trade unions  and

organised  workers. It is, therefore, in the interests

of   trade  unions  to  support,  whatever  the  cost,

measures  designed to reduce unemployment by fostering

sustained economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, in effect, is an attempt to tackle the

problem  of  finding jobs for as many of this  120,000

forgotten  and largely inarticulate group of citizens.

I  am  not  saying that we can solve the  unemployment

problem altogether. But we can contain it and minimise

the   tragedy  and  real  suffering  which  only   the

unemployed can know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the unemployment problem, we are going to

lose  some $450 million spent annually by the  British

Armed   Forces  in  Singapore  and  which  constitutes

approximately  14  per  cent  of  our  gross  domestic

product. This will tail off to almost zero after 1971.

To fill this gap and avoid recessionary effects to our

economy,  we  will  have to spend an  additional  $900

million between now and 1971.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all these we must add the economic burden that

defence  will impose on us. After 1971 the  centuries-old  British  shield (paid for and maintained  by  the

British) will no longer be here to protect us.  If  we

do  not develop a defensive armour of our own, then  a

rich and strategically valuable island like ours is  a

tempting  prize to seize - particularly if, out  of  a

misplaced sense of thrift, we deprive ourselves of the

tooth and claw to deter the freebooter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these might appear formidable problems - and so

they are, Mr Speaker. But no problem is insoluble and

in  so far as our economic problem is concerned -  and

on which hinges our political and military viability - we  may  not find complete solutions. But we can  with

discipline,  hard  work  and  long-term  planning  and

organisation make reasonable progress despite the many

difficulties  ahead. This is no idle  boast.  When  we

were  asked  to leave Malaysia, there were  those  who

predicted  economic disintegration  and  collapse  for

Singapore.  They  predicted an  island  seething  with

discontent  and  revolt -and  a  ready  prey  for  the

imitation  Maos  now prowling about in  the  caves  of

Victoria Street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These predictions have been proved wrong because

after  separation we got down immediately to  tackling

the  difficult economic and other problems  following

separation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So once again we must start planning now to meet and

overcome,  this time, the economic consequences  of  a

precipitate British withdrawal. If we are to meet  the

problems  of unemployment, make good the $450  million

the  British  Armed  Forces have been  spending,  then

there   must   be   massive   industrial   expansions;

accelerated economic growth through stimulation of our

entrepot  trade, tourism, shipping and so  on.  To  do

this  quickly,  we  must  attract  local  and  foreign

investments  - foreign investments because  we  cannot

mobilise  enough domestic savings except by a ruthless

lowering of living standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill should, therefore, be seen in the

context of the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



problems an independent Singapore faces. There must be

a climate of industrial peace and stability to attract

both  local  and foreign capital. It is  essential  to

increase   the   productivity  of  our  workers,   the

efficiency of entrepreneurs, so that our products  can

compete in the stiff competitive export markets of the

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the intent and purpose behind this Bill. How

far  this Bill will succeed in its purpose will depend

on   both   workers  and  employers  placing  national

interests before sectional interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware, too, that like some workers

there  will be some short-sighted and stupid employers

who  will try to take advantage of this Bill,  not  to

promote  economic expansion, but unjustly  to  squeeze

workers for personal gain. I know that one or two such

employers  have already, through a selfish  misreading

of the Bill, started wielding the big stick. They have

proposed cuts and reductions, not because of financial

difficulties, but because the proprietors want to  get

a bit more spending money for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I inform such employers that the Government will

not  stand idly by and watch them sabotage our efforts

to  bring  about industrial peace and stability.  They

are  not  the only ones who can wield the big stick  -and their stick could, when it comes to the crunch, be

broken like a rotten twig.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Bill does not provide for all

situations,  for all sorts of contingencies  that  may

arise in what is a rapidly changing area of the world.

So  the  Government  will in the light  of  experience

review the Bill when defects come to the surface.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, unless this Bill is studied in the

context  of  our  formidable  economic  and  political

problems,  its essential purpose and objectives  might

well  be lost sight of in the debate. These formidable

problems cannot be tackled without painful adjustments

though  the Government has made every effort to reduce

to  a  minimum  the  pain by sweetening  the  medicine

somewhat,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say that this Bill, with the

amendments,  still remains the most progressive  piece

of labour legislation in this part of the world. There

is  as  yet  no country in this region which  provides

(together with the proposed amendments to our  Central

Provident  Fund laws) benefits and terms  better  than

what the workers of Singapore will enjoy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

you  will  recall, one of the most popular slogans  in

Britain  in the late fifties was: "You have never  had

it so good!". It is perhaps not inappropriate to apply

this  to Singapore today. We boast of the highest  per

capita income in the region. We have a strong currency

and  our balance of payments is extremely healthy.  In

short,  we  are going through a period of  prosperity.

Perhaps some people may be wondering, what have we  to

worry  about? Indeed, if we are and can afford  to  be

complacent, we have nothing to worry about,  at  least

for  the  time  being. However, we  are  no  longer  a

subjugated  people who have no control  over  our  own

destiny,  nor  are  we a soft-headed  people  who  are

incapable  of  planning or anticipating events  beyond

tomorrow. We are committed to building a nation of our

own  which we are determined should last not  for  the

present generation alone but for generations to  come.

As  such,  we  must constantly look forward  and  plan

ahead making the necessary material sacrifices and re-adjustment in our mental attitudes from time  to  time

so  as  to  ensure that our children and grandchildren

will  enjoy,  if not a higher standard of  living,  at

least  a  standard  equal to our own.  As  responsible

citizens  and  parents, I am sure  that  this  is  one

commitment  we  are not afraid of and should  have  no

hesitation  in  entering into.  Sir,  it  is  in  this

context that I feel that the Employment Bill should be

considered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice before us is the choice between temporary

higher  income and long-range economic security.  With

the projected withdrawal of the British Forces and the

constant  population pressure upon  our  very  limited

natural  resources, as I see it, our economic security

is being seriously threatened, and unless something is

done  about it within the short time available to  us,

between  now and 1971, I am doubtful that we would  be

able  to  maintain  the high per  capita  income.  The

direction  and the manner in which we are  to  counter

the  anticipated  recession have been made  abundantly

clear by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance,

and  the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for

Labour  on  more than one occasion and  I  would  not,

therefore, elaborate. Suffice it to say here that  for

our  national  survival and economic  well-being,  the

emphasis for the years ahead of us lies in raising the

economic  productivity  of  our  people.  It  is  only

through a reputation for high productivity that we can

hope  to attract more foreign investors to participate

in our industrial programme. It is only through higher

productivity  that  we  can  hope  for  our   existing

industrial  concerns to secure a  fair  share  of  the

fiercely  competitive world market.  But  so  long  as

anomalies  are  allowed  to  exist  in  the  area   of

industrial   relations,  it  will  be  difficult   for

productivity to be raised beyond a mediocre  standard.

With  the  passage of the Bill, some of the  anomalies

that  have  arisen  during  the  past  years  will  be

regularised. This, I feel sure, will in time  help  to

put  us  on  a  stronger footing both in the  race  to

attract more investors and in the fiercely competitive

world market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in perusing the Bill, I do feel that whilst

certain disciplines and sacrifices are required of our

workers,  they  should not be left without  safeguards

entirely  in certain areas, bearing in mind  that  not

all   managements  are  enlightened,   and   not   all

managements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



are  conscious of their social responsibility and  are

capable of identifying their long-term interests  with

those of the people and the State. There are bound  to

be  some  who  will  see in the  Bill  a  long-awaited

opportunity  to  exploit  the  employees   for   their

immediate  gain. In this connection, I feel  that  the

provision for the payment of bonus as contained in the

proposed legislation does call for amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I am pleased to note that the

Central  Provident Fund Ordinance will be  amended  to

permit  members  of  the Fund to utilise  the  amounts

standing  to their credit in the Fund for the purchase

of  houses  or  flats  for their  own  occupation.  It

appears,  therefore, to me that whatever the employees

may  lose  on  the  swings,  they  will  gain  on  the

roundabouts.



<br><br>4.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, I rise to make

certain observations on the Employment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be difficult years ahead and the problems

confronting Singapore are immense and call for drastic

solutions.  If, in the course of the next  few  years,

Singapore  does  not  make  substantial  and   radical

changes to her social and economic infrastructure, the

present  unemployment problem will grow  to  grotesque

and  unmanageable  proportions,  the  consequences  of

which  will be painful and disastrous for all  persons

who make Singapore their home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade union movement of Singapore is not blind

and  deaf  to  these wider problems of  the  Republic.

Trade  union members are fully aware that as  citizens

and  permanent residents of Singapore they have  their

obligations to their fellow citizens, and  that  their

fate is interwoven with the survival of Singapore as a

political and economic entity. Any step taken  by  the

Government  as  an  emergency  measure  to  meet   the

challenge  posed  by the difficult and  crucial  years

ahead  will have the co-operation and support  of  the

trade union movement if it is convinced that such step

will eventually help the Republic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



to  survive as a political and economic entity and  to

bring  progress and economic advancement  to  its  two

million citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill should be viewed in its proper

perspective as one of the measures introduced  by  the

Government to bring about a more favourable climate to

attract  massive foreign investment into the  Republic

in  order to cushion off the expected economic  impact

of  the  complete British withdrawal by 1971,  and  to

bring  about an increasing number of job opportunities

to overcome the growing unemployment problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much as we in the trade union movement dislike the

changes  to  be introduced into the labour legislation

by the Employment Bill, we have to accept such changes

as   necessary   and  inevitable  in  the   light   of

Singapore's economic circumstances. But it  should  be

made  emphatically  clear that our acceptance  of  the

underlying principles of the Bill does not  mean  that

we  unreservedly  accept  the  manner  in  which  such

principles  are translated into the actual  provisions

of  the Bill. We do not expect the unpleasant policies

of the Government as embodied in the Bill to be sugar-coated  for  our easier acceptance but,  at  the  same

time,   we  do  not  expect  the  Bill  to   be   made

unnecessarily bitter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill, as it stands, has certain

deficiencies. It is feared that unscrupulous employers

will  take  advantage of these deficiencies  to  cause

unnecessary hardships and difficulties to the workers.

It  is  our fear that once this Bill is passed  as  it

stands it may run contrary to the desired objective of

the  Bill  and,  instead of giving  solutions  to  our

problems,  would  create additional problems  such  as

widespread  industrial unrest. While we may  not  have

serious    objections   to   prospective    investors,

particularly  foreign investors, who  seek  to  commit

millions  of  dollars  to  new  enterprises   in   the

Republic, wishing to be assured of trouble-free labour

relations  and  of the absence of any  possibility  of

unnecessary  prohibitive  labour  costs  making  their

products uncompetitive in international markets,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



we must confess that we find it extremely alarming and

disturbing that there are employers, particularly  our

citizen employers, in well-established firms and small

business concerns who are thinking of taking advantage

of the Employment Bill and treating it as a licence to

exploit labour.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.38 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in brief, this is the main

consideration for the N.T.U.C.'s decision  to  propose

amendments  to the Employment Bill through the  Member

for Bukit Ho Swee, who is the Secretary-General of the N.T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now, in a general way, point out the

objections of the trade union movement to clauses  15,

43,  44,  46  and 53 of the Employment Bill  which  we

think will not help in any way as it stands at present

to  give  effect  to  the Government's  objectives  in

introducing the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take clause 15. It seeks to restrict the

employment  of persons after the age 55 years.  It  is

true  that  clause  15 provides for  approval  by  the

Commissioner for Labour of the employment  of  persons

after  the  age  of 55 years. But does the  Government

really  believe that many employers, even if  they  do

not  use the provision as a pretext of getting rid  of

long-service  employees with their  relatively  higher

wages,  will  bother  entangling themselves  with  the

unnecessary red tape of getting such approval? Such  a

provision,  if  allowed  to  stand,  would  in  effect

condemn  a  substantial number of workers,  leading  a

hand-to-mouth  existence with family  obligations  and

without  any  life  savings, to  great  hardships  and

perhaps,  figuratively speaking, to a lingering  death

by starvation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that such horrible consequences cannot be

the  purpose  of  the  Bill. Why  then  is  clause  15

included in it? Is it to compel an employee to  retire

at  the  age of 55 so that he has to make  way  for  a

younger unemployed citizen?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



It  may  not have occurred to the Government that,  in

forcing  employees at the age of 55 to retire for  the

purpose  presumably of making way for a  corresponding

number  of  young  unemployed  citizens,  it  may  not

achieve  the desired effect of reducing the extent  of

unemployment,  because the young  unemployed  citizens

are not likely to possess the skills and experience of

those  forced  to retire at 55 years.  What  will,  in

effect, be the result is that a different category  of

citizens will become unemployed, mainly those reaching

the  age  of 55 in addition to the existing number  of

unemployed citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask, is this not

unnecessarily cruel? It is indeed pitiful  that  young

citizens are unemployed, but they are usually  without

dependants  and  can perhaps scrape an existence  from

parents and relatives for a reasonable length of time.

On  the  other  hand,  the old citizens  are  rendered

unemployed  because they have reached the age  of  55.

Those who are strong and able to work can perhaps make

a  significant and useful contribution to our national

development.  Moreover,  they  are  likely   to   have

dependants  whose  well-being and survival  depend  on

their livelihood. What is this magic figure "55"  that

will  determine that men will no longer become  useful

to  society  and must wither away from  the  scene  of

active life? Does it make sense to say that amongst us

in this House the two most senior Cabinet Ministers in

terms of age, namely, the Minister for Foreign Affairs

and  Minister for Labour and the Minister for Defence,

when  they  reach the age of 55 in a few  years,  will

become  decrepit  and must leave their  portfolios  to

younger  men? Judging from the healthy disposition  of

these  two gentlemen and their mental agility, I would

like  to believe that they will be more than fit, both

physically  and mentally, to be with us in this  House

long  after they reach the age of 55. With the passing

of  time,  they  will grow in wisdom, and  with  their

additional years of valuable experience they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



will remain to help chart the course of the Republic's

progress and destiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we in the trade union movement look forward

to  many,  many years of happy confrontation with  the

Minister for Labour over the labour problems that  may

arise  when  the Employment Bill and other new  labour

legislation  come  into  force.  It  is  not  in   the

Republic's  interest if men with skill and experience,

just  because  they reach the age of 55,  must  retire

when  at this juncture of our national development  we

are  looking towards our workers acquiring more skills

and ability in order to make a success of our economic

expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 44 has been ostensibly worded to minimise

abuses to the provision of sick leave by irresponsible

workers.  But  it should be made clear to  this  House

that  any  attempt  to paint a picture  of  prevailing

widespread  practice among workers who  use  the  sick

leave provision as a means of getting extra paid leave

is largely un-warranted. The small percentage of black-sheep amongst workers who behave irresponsibly in this

manner  must  be viewed in the correct perspective  of

the large percentage of workers who are proud of their

record  of  seldom being on sick leave. In any  event,

the  restriction of sick leave without hospitalisation

to  a  maximum  of 14 days a year should  satisfy  any

employer with an obsession that his employees on  sick

leave  are not very sick. But we are of the view  that

28  days  a  year is insufficient to provide  for  the

hospitalisation of an employee. I am of the view  that

the  maximum  period  for  hospitalisation  should  be

increased  from  28  days to 60  days  at  least.  Our

consideration  is that the stringent requirements  for

an  employee to be granted sick leave for the  purpose

of  hospitalisation leave no scope  for  any  possible

abuse  and,  secondly, medical science and  technology

have not advanced to a stage where an employee can  be

immune  from being incapacitated for one or two months

by a serious illness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 46 of the Bill states that the qualifying

period in respect of an employee's entitlement to  any

retirement  benefit payable by his employee  is  seven

years  of  continuous service with  that  employer.  I

share the view that the period should be reduced  from

seven   to  five  years  on  the  grounds  that   most

collective  agreements have provided that an  employee

is eligible for retirement benefit after five years of

service. To extend such qualifying period is to impose

unnecessary hardship on the workers who, unlike  their

counterparts  in  the civil service,  do  not  have  a

pension  to  look forward to on their retirement.  The

retirement benefit, which is an ex-gratia payment  for

past  services,  serves  as enforced  savings  for  an

employee's retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 of the Bill makes bonus a non-negotiable

issue  between  an  employer and a  trade  union,  and

relates  the  payment of bonus to the productivity  of

performance  of the workers. The weakness  of  such  a

provision  is  that  it is not only impracticable  but

also  unrealistic. It takes for granted, as proved  to

be   true   and  correct,  several  propositions   the

soundness   of  which  is  highly  questionable.   One

proposition is that an employer would not cut off  his

own  nose  to spite his own face by refusing  to  give

incentive  payments to his workers. Our experience  is

that  some employers would go to extraordinary lengths

to  avoid  giving  workers their  just  dues.  Another

proposition  is that productivity and profits  can  be

easily  and  conveniently measured or determined.  Our

understanding is that these two subjects form areas of

much  controversy. I share the view,  therefore,  that

bonus  should  be  made a negotiable  issue  up  to  a

maximum of one month's salary of an employee and  that

any bonus over the amount of one month's salary is  to

be  payable  at the discretion of an employer  on  the

basis  of  incentive or a reward for the employee.  By

allowing  bonus to be negotiated on the present  basis

between the employer and a trade union subject to  the

maximum  of  one  month's salary,  the  necessity  and

difficulty of determining what is productivity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



and  what are profits are obviated. This will help  to

minimise  industrial  friction  arising  out  of   the

question of bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53 of the Bill re-enacts the existing

provisions in the Clerks Employment Ordinance, the Labour Ordinance and the Shop Assistants Employment

Ordinance.  As the provisions of clause 53 now  stand,

there  is  some  confusion as to the  effect  of  this

clause.   The  confusion  arises  mainly  out   of   a

misinterpretation of Government statements on the Bill

to  the  effect that the provisions of the  Employment

Bill  are  intended to place a maximum  limit  on  the

terms   and  conditions  of  service  of  workers   in

Singapore. This is shown to be erroneous when the Bill

was  read  for  the  First  time.  Nevertheless,  such

misunderstanding  may persist and some  employers  may

use  it as a pretext for not giving to their employees

more  favourable terms and conditions  of  service  in

relation  to  the Employment Bill. We have accordingly

sought  to clarify these provisions so that  it  would

not  be an offence to grant more favourable terms  and

conditions of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, in brief, Mr Speaker, Sir, are some of the

grounds  for our proposed amendments to the  Bill.  My

trade   union  colleagues  in  this  House   will   be

addressing you more fully on this subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I would like to mention in passing

that all sections of the public service have helped to

make  Singapore what it is today, and  no  doubt  they

will  play  a  vital  and  significant  role  in   the

difficult  years  ahead.  They  have  grievances  over

conditions  of  service and salary structures  in  the

public  service, and these have been referred  to  the

Salaries Commission which has considered them and  has

submitted  its report to the Government.  I  hope  the

Government   will   table  the  report   before   this

Parliament as soon as possible.



<br><br>4.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that at the present

stage of nation building in Singapore we must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



put special emphasis on the development of our economy

in  order to meet the expenditure on defence,  social,

and  educational requirements. We do not have  natural

resources  such as tin and rubber. We have  to  depend

only  on ourselves as a trading centre, and to develop

our  industries  in  order  to  support  our  economic

livelihood.  Of  course, we have about  a  century  of

history  and experience as a trading centre to sustain

us.  But in regard to industrialisation we are  making

only  a  beginning.  We are making  great  efforts  to

industrialise.  This  task is very  important  to  our

economic productivity and viability. Industrialisation

must  be a viable and living force in order to  enable

our  country to achieve greater economic expansion and

increase  our  gross  national product  and  financial

resources.  By producing more revenue, more employment

opportunities  would be created for our workers.  This

is a very ambitious task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, first and foremost, become an advanced

industrialised society in this region. To achieve this

objective,   we   must,  besides  attracting   foreign

capital, give due regard to our products which must be

low in price, good in quality and modern in design  so

as   to  compete  with  other  countries.  Unless   we

accomplish  this, we cannot compete with  products  of

other  countries in the international market, and  our

attempt  to make Singapore an industrial society  will

fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore will not relax in their

efforts  nor will they shirk their responsibility  for

the development and growth of our national economy. In

the  past  few years they have been able to check  and

overcome  unfavourable conditions. They have  accepted

and  supported  the economic policy  of  the  People's

Action Party since it came into office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of industrial relations, we have done

away  with  strikes and have curbed  disturbances  and

outbreaks of violence which characterised the 1  950s.

Industrial disputes have become things of the past. We

are  now  enjoying good weather after the  storms  and

turbulence of the past few years. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



must publicise the fact to foreign industrialists that

conditions  here  are stable, that our  society  is  a

peaceful  one  and  that our workers are  enlightened.

They  will  then be willing to extend their operations

to  our country. They will be willing to invest in and

expand   our   industries.  I  fully  understand   the

importance  of large capital investment  and  economic

development  in  this country, because  these  factors

will  create  more  employment opportunities  for  our

growing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of some of the points which I have

enumerated  that our Government has now  formulated  a

sound  long-term policy by introducing the  Employment

Bill.  I  support and welcome this Bill in  principle.

But   there  are  some  provisions  in  it  which  are

unnecessary,  impractical and harsh. In spite  of  the

Minister's  detailed explanation of  the  purposes  of

some  of  the provisions, I am still not satisfied.  I

regard  them  as stringent, and many people  share  my

view.  We  must  therefore advance our views  for  his

consideration. I have said just now that I accept this

Bill  in principle. But because of the risk that  some

of  the  provisions may be abused by  some  employers,

thereby distorting the original purpose of the Bill, I

must air my views and criticisms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now enumerate some of the provisions which I

regard as unsuitable. The Member for Moulmein has also

touched on them. But his views may not be entirely the

same  as what I am going to express on behalf  of  the

people of my constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past as well as at present, business

organisations  and enterprises regard the  payment  of

bonus  as  a  means to encourage workers  to  be  more

diligent in their work. It has become an incentive for

increased  productivity  and this  has  achieved  good

results.  We  all  know that bonus is  not  merely  an

incentive to the workers but that employers also  earn

more  profits  as  a  result  of  the  diligence   and

increased  productivity  of the  workers.  Because  of

this,  the  workers are entitled to a small percentage

of the profits. This is only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



reasonable and justifiable. Moreover, in the past  few

years,  employers have never grumbled about  paying  a

bonus  to their employees. This is an undeniable fact.

So  it  is  rather strange that the Government,  as  a

third   party,  should  now  step  in  and  take   the

initiative  of introducing a provision to abolish  the

payment   of  bonus  and  giving  employers   absolute

discretion  in this connection. This will  lead  to  a

situation  where the payment of bonus to  the  workers

will  depend  entirely  on the employer.  It  is  like

receiving  charity from him. Of course,  when  I  give

these  views, I do not mean to encourage irresponsible

unions  to abuse the bonus issue and create industrial

strife  over  it. But my point is that we  should  not

have a rigid law to abolish the payment of bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a very brief provision in the Bill

regarding bonus. It says that the payment of  a  bonus

to  a  worker  should  be  an  incentive  to  increase

productivity or as a reward for good performance. This

provision  negates all past awards on the  payment  of

bonus  and  has  entirely abolished the provision  for

bonus  in the collective agreements reached.  Thus  it

will  lead to a situation where thousands of employees

will  have  no alternative but to request  for  salary

increases in order to incorporate the bonus that  they

have  lost  into their salary scales. Only  thus,  can

they  remedy  the  loss  of a bonus.  Without  such  a

remedy,  the industrial peace and stability  which  we

are enjoying now will be difficult to maintain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are dazzled by the term "bonus", we may

change  it  to  the  term  "rate  of  distribution  of

profits".  If an enterprise or a company  has  made  a

profit,  the workers and the employer can  share  this

profit  according to a specified rate of distribution.

They  should share it at a set rate. I think  this  is

the best means to increase productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to deal with retrenchment

benefits. This provision is a great boon to employers.

Of course, we must stop the small group of workers who

abuse such benefits, for example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



by  deliberately carrying out a work-to-rule policy or

by  indulging  in  absenteeism or  by  disobeying  the

orders of the management with the purpose of provoking

the  employers into sacking them so as to benefit from

such a provision. But I must say that I cannot support

the  drastic change proposed by this provision.  Those

with a service of less than two years are not entitled

to retrenchment benefits according to the provision in

the  Bill.  Such  a grave problem which  involves  the

worker  and  his family is glossed over by  the  Bill.

This will offer a very good opportunity to an employer

to  misuse  this provision and to fire  his  employees

without taking into consideration whether his business

is  making money or is running at a loss, and  without

taking  into  consideration whether such  retrenchment

arises  from  the  need  to reorganise  his  business.

Moreover,  nepotism is very prevalent in  the  Chinese

community.  Some employers tend to fill  positions  in

their  organisations with their relatives.  Therefore,

the  workers are placed in a very precarious position.

Hence,   I  would  like  the  Minister  carefully   to

reconsider   this   provision   and   make   necessary

amendments  to  it so as to make it  better  and  more

effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the provision of

compulsory retirement of employees at the age  of  55.

The Minister has promised to review this provision, so

that   a  worker's  retirement  will  depend  on   his

capability to work and not on his age. Such a move  is

very   encouraging.  We  must  not  forget  that   our

Government  is  now  propounding a  social  philosophy

which  puts a premium on a rugged and strong  society.

What  is the significance of this philosophy?  We  can

say  with  certainty  that what we  strive  for  is  a

healthy   body.  Moreover,  our  medical  and   health

services,  although they cannot be regarded  as  among

the  foremost  in the world, are, we can  safely  say,

second  to none in Southeast Asia. With such excellent

medical and health services, the average



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



life  span  of our people is longer than that  of  any

other country in Southeast Asia. The average life span

here is 63 years. If we make it an inflexible law that

a  worker  should retire at the age of 55, and  if  we

take  $200  per  month as the average  income  of  our

people, then the total income earned in a working life

of  from 20 years to 55 years will be $84,000. If this

amount  is  spread out over a period of  43  years  as

household expenditure, it will work out to $162.80 per

month. Thus, if this provision is put into effect, our

living standard will be reduced by one-fifth.

<div align="center"><b>CLAIMING BIRTH IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, although Singapore has only recently

achieved  her independence, we can take pride  in  her

prosperity and in her people in spite of her  lack  of

natural resources. While the citizens of Singapore are

enjoying prosperity, there are, in their midst, people

who  are suffering because of the uncertainty of their

citizenship   status.  They  cannot  be  regarded   as

Malaysian   citizens  because  they  are  holders   of

Singapore  blue identity cards in which their  country

of  birth  is  stated  as Singapore.  They  cannot  be

regarded  as  Singapore citizens as their  citizenship

status  has  not  been  recognised  by  the  Singapore

Government because they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



cannot  produce  their birth certificates.  They  have

either  lost  them or are unable to establish  exactly

their  dates  of birth. Their efforts to  trace  their

dates of birth in the Registry of Births were in  vain

because their dates of birth were forgotten. In  other

cases  the name of the child was not recorded  at  the

time  of  reporting the birth of that child. Only  the

names  of  parents were registered. For these reasons,

officials  at  the Registry of Births were  unable  to

issue  Extracts  of  Certificates of  Birth  and  they

advised   these   people  to   apply   for   Singapore

citizenship. Unfortunately, when these people  applied

for  Singapore citizenship, they had to  wait  for  as

long   as   two  years  or  more  without  any   reply

forthcoming.   In  order  to  obtain   employment   in

Singapore, Singapore citizenship is necessary, or  the

applicant  for  a  job  must be  in  possession  of  a

Certificate of Birth in Singapore. What then  will  be

the  fate  of these people and their families  if  the

issue  of citizenship papers is further delayed?  They

are,  thus, deprived of the benefits enjoyed by  other

Singapore  citizens.  If  they  leave  Singapore   for

Malaysia, they will not be accepted there and will  be

ineligible   for  the  rights  enjoyed  by   Malaysian

citizens. Their applications for Malaysian citizenship

will   similarly   be  rejected   by   the   Malaysian

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if these unfortunate people cannot

make  a living either in Singapore or Malaysia,  where

else  can they go to earn an honest living? Unable  to

maintain  their families, they might, in  desperation,

take  to  crime and steal and rob. Who  then  will  be

blamed?  It  is also possible that these people  might

commit  suicide rather than see their families suffer.

Such  a  thing did happen and it was reported  in  the

Straits  Times of 25th June, 1968, at page  6  and  on

26th  June, 1968, at page 5. This should be  food  for

thought  for us all and make us ponder on  whether  we

should  allow such a state of affairs to  continue  or

whether  we should do something about it. Such  people

and their families must also live like other Singapore

citizens.  Certainly it is not their wish to  see  the

lot of their children becoming worse



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



off  in  the future. It makes little sense to us,  the

people  of  Singapore, to be proud of  our  prosperity

when  there  are, in our midst, those who  are  crying

because of hunger as they have not yet been recognised

as  citizens  of Singapore. Only time will  tell  when

they will be consigned to the grave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will consider this problem

sympathetically  and  relax the regulations  in  order

that    these    people    may   obtain    employment.

Alternatively,    the   Government   should    provide

facilities   to   enable  them   to   surmount   their

difficulties and establish citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government and

I  are  well  aware of the problem to which  the  hon.

Member  for Geylang Serai has referred. We sympathise,

of course, with the difficulties of people who are not

Singapore  citizens, but we have  to  sympathise  even

more with the difficulties of Singapore citizens. This

is a dilemma which, if things were otherwise, we could

solve.   But  we  have  also  thousands  of  Singapore

citizens  who are making demands for jobs,  for  homes

and  for  houses, and every non-citizen who  is  given

citizenship  not  only  gets  a  job,  but   all   the

privileges and commitments that we have made in regard

to all our citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the national registration exercise, it was

revealed that there were many people who claimed birth

in  Singapore but who, on further investigation,  were

found  not to be born in Singapore. If we do not  have

some  criteria for judging proof of birth in Singapore

and if we just relax or ignore the law, qualifications

and  evidence  required  to  prove  citizenship,  then

having regard to the conditions prevailing around  us,

we might have thousands of people coming here who were

not  born  in  Singapore. They  cannot  produce  birth

certificates or any other evidence of their  birth  in

Singapore.  We  sympathise with the people  who  claim

that  they  were born in Singapore, but who  obviously

cannot produce any evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that during the re-registration

exercise,  holders of the old 1948 and  1949  identity

cards whose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



place of birth was shown as Singapore were issued with

pink  identity  cards. We would like to assist  people

who  are  undoubtedly  in great difficulties,  but  we

cannot  afford to relax our law on this at the moment.

We  would like to do the right thing for one  who  was

really  born in Singapore but without any evidence  to

prove  it.  But  there  is no  way  of  distinguishing

between  him  and one hundred others who just  destroy

all papers and say that they were born in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do everything we can to make life easier for

non-citizens.  For example, people claiming  birth  in

Singapore  but  without any documentary evidence  can,

first  of all, apply for Singapore citizenship in  the

normal  way  as  any other non-citizens  who  ask  for

consideration  on the basis of long residence  or  any

other qualifications. Non-citizens who are holders  of

blue identity cards can get jobs in Singapore provided

they obtain work permits.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a man holds a blue identity card and says he was

born    in    Singapore   and   has   the    requisite

qualifications,  I  am quite sure that  he  will  have

prior consideration with regard to the issuing of work

permits than a non-citizen who was born elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult problem and we sympathise with

people  who  may have been born in Singapore  but  are

without birth certificates to prove it. However, I  do

not  think  the Government can just arbitrarily  waive

aside the regulations governing citizenship purely  on

the basis of somebody claiming, without proof, that he

was  born  in Singapore and is qualified for Singapore

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.
