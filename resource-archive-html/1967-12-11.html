<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether he is aware that many teachers,

who  do extra-curricular duties in Government  and

Government-aided schools, are given less  teaching

periods  and have more free periods than  teachers

who do only teaching, and if he will look into the

matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am aware that teachers who perform

extra-curricular  duties  are  given   more   free

periods than other teachers wherever possible, and

this  is  as  it  should be since extra-curricular

duties entail a great deal of time both during and

after  school  hours and can be more onerous  than

teaching  in  a  class.  To  ensure  an  equitable

distribution  of  the work load, it  is  therefore

necessary  to  give  more  free  periods  to  such

teachers.  This  is  the  only  way  to  implement

successfully Government's policy of laying greater

emphasis   on  pupils'  participation  in   extra-curricular  activities to  produce  a  rugged  and

robust society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

is  the Minister of State for Education aware that

in  some  schools  there are  senior  teachers  in

charge  of administration who hand over  the  work

load entrusted to them to other teachers, who  are

not  senior administrative teachers, to carry out?

Thus  all these teachers will have to share  their

work. Therefore, the senior teachers in charge  of

administration  enjoy  free periods,  whereas  the

other teachers do not enjoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question does not strictly

has specific complaints to make against any senior

teacher  for passing on his work load  to  others,

the  Ministry  of Education will be very  glad  to

receive them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for Labour

whether he will consider establishing registration

centres of the Employment Exchange in all  the  51

constituencies  so  that  unemployed  persons  may

register  or re-register themselves, as  the  case

may  be,  in  their respective constituencies  and

need not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



have to incur unnecessary transport expenditure in

having  to  go to the Labour Ministry at  Havelock

Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the hon. Member may  not  be  aware

that   my  Ministry  operates  at  present   three

employment exchanges. The main one is at  Havelock

Road,  a  branch at Bukit Panjang, and another  at

the Jurong industrial estate. I do not consider it

necessary to establish employment exchanges in all

the  51  constituencies. It will  be  a  waste  of

public money to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small island with excellent and

cheap  public transport to any part of the island.

Any unemployed person can easily go to any one  of

the  present three exchanges and register  himself

there.

<div align="center"><b>REDUCED ROAD TAX FOR GOODS-CARRYING TRICYCLES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister of State

(Prime  Minister's Department) whether  Government

will  consider reducing the annual  road  tax  for

tricycles,  used for carrying goods, from  $43  to

$20 the minimum annual tax for motor cycles.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, vehicles which carry

goods,  whether  they be tricycles or  motor-cars,

are  licensed separately from vehicles  which  are

not employed for such purposes. The suggestion  by

the Member for Paya Lebar, if it is considered  at

all, must be examined from this point of view.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, is the

Minister  of  State  aware  that  a  tricycle  for

carrying  goods costs only slightly  more  than  a

hundred dollars, but every year its owner  has  to

pay about $43 for road tax?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I have stated

earlier  that if at all the suggestion  is  to  be

considered, it will be examined from the point  of

view of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



the use of the vehicle. I would like to suggest to

those   who   use  tricycles,  to  Use   motorised

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The First Supplementary Estimates

of Expenditure for 1967 contained in Paper Cmd. 25

of  1967. The summary is at the foot of the  page.

Head  0401 - Ministry of the Interior and  Defence.

Mr Tang See Chim, amendment No. (1) .



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead l.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same admendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the grant for the salary

increases was given by the Malaysian Government in

July  1965 with retrospective effect from  1st  of

March,  1963.  It  should,  therefore,  have  been

anticipated   by   the  Ministry   concerned   and

provision  be made at the beginning of  this  year

for  the increase. This has not been done  and  we

are now being asked to vote for a sum of nearly $5

million for the increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I would like to know the total sum

involved in this increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

fully subscribe to the questions posed by the hon.

Member for Choa Chu Kang. Further, I would like to

know  the  exact number of personnel who  will  be

benefiting from such salary increases with  effect

from 1st March, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if I remember well, retrospective

increases  and payments were not to  be  supported

when  the previous Minister for Finance, in answer

to  a speech on a motion on the adjournment by the

Member for Telok Blangah, said that the Government

was not prepared to give back pay with effect from

1961  in  respect of claims by the  Public  Daily-Rated  Employees'  Unions  Federation.  I  believe

there  is no connection with this whatsoever since

the decision to give salary increases was made  by

the Malaysian Government. However, I fully endorse

the  views of the Member for Choa Chu Kang on this

question  of  the  Government having  to  come  to

Parliament and ask it to endorse a vote of  nearly

$5 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the amount of expenditure that  has

to  be  incurred to pay these increases in  salary

for  the police personnel, which was decided  upon

by  the Malaysian Government when we were part  of

Malaysia, could have and has been anticipated.  It

is  for  purely technical reasons that we did  not

include  it in our Budget, because once  provision

is  made  from  our own funds, then it  makes  our

position  at the bargaining table more  difficult.

The  total increase amounted to $8,112,480,  which

was fully paid by the Malaysian Government.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an accounting procedure that all receipts

should go into revenue and all payments should  be

voted for under the heads. That is the reason  why

a  supplementary of $4,989,000 is being asked for,

because  there are savings of $3 million odd  from

personal emoluments of the police.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of the Member for

Punggol, I think he has answered it himself. There

is  no similarity between back-dating payments for

daily-rated workers and police personnel. It is  a

decision made by the Malaysian Government.  It  is

not  something that has been decided upon by  this

Government or by me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that answers all the questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am quite satisfied with the

explanation by the Minister of Defence, and I beg

leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of

Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I am not moving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,989,450

for Head 0401 ordered to stand part of the First

Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0803 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0803 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2043.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same admendment also stood in the name of Mr Tang See Chim.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, an extra sum of $233,260 is

required  to meet an increase in payments  because

of  a  bigger number of officers who have  retired

this  year.  I  would be grateful if the  Minister

could  throw  some light on the  exact  number  of

officers   (with  their  designations)  who   have

retired  this year and, if possible,  the  reasons

for their retirement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think what

is more important is the reason why the retirement

of  officers was not anticipated at the  beginning

of the year. As I see it, surely it should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



be  Government policy, especially in view  of  the

present unemployment situation in the country,  to

retire  all officers compulsorily when they  reach

retiring age in order to give job opportunities to

younger men who enter the labour market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister give reasons for the increase in

payments and why they were not anticipated at  the

beginning of the year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in addition to the two Members who have touched on

this  matter,  I  would like to ask  the  Minister

whether the unexpected number of retirements  this

year  was  due  to  the poor pay  given  to  civil

servants which hastened their retirement.  Usually

the  Government  put  them on  the  Superannuation

Scheme,  and if that is the case, I feel that  the

Government  should not allow this  brain-drain  to

occur.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Sir,  the  details  requested by  the  Member  for

Punggol are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 394 retirements as against 211 the

previous  year. Eighty per cent of the retirements

were  due to officers reaching the compulsory  age

of  retirement.  The balance were  retirements  on

optional or medical grounds and two officers  were

retired in the public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards compulsory retirements referred to by

the  Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang,  retirement  is

compulsory on reaching the age limit - 55 years  in

most  cases;  60 years for those who  entered  the

service more recently. Of course, it does not mean

that  once an officer retires, he will be lost  to

the   service.  In  some  cases  of  officers   of

exceptional  merit,  we  do  re-employ   them   on

contract   terms,  but  this  again  is   a   very

exceptional procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah suspects that the large

number of people retiring may be due to poor  pay.

I  can assure him that the civil service pays very

good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



salaries. Our difficulty is that whenever there is

an  advertisement  for vacancies,  the  number  of

applicants  is  usually 100 times  the  number  of

vacant  posts. So I do not think the  hon.  Member

can claim that we are paying poor salaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am fully

satisfied  with  the  explanation  given  by   the

Minister  for  Finance. On that note,  may  I  beg

leave to withdraw my amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0803 be

reduced  by  the whole sum in respect  of  subhead

2043.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to my mind, the amount

requested  is  for officers who have retired  this

year. As stated by two hon. Members earlier, could

the  Ministry not have anticipated the  number  of

officers who would be retiring at the end  of  the

year?  This means that the Ministry is lacking  in

efficiency  in not having been able  to  determine

the  number of officers who would be retiring. The

Minister has said earlier that 80 per cent of such

officers  had to retire compulsorily. If this  was

known, why did the Ministry not make provision for

these  people to retire? If this state of  affairs

carries  on, then our Estimates for 1968  will  go

haywire  and  there will be further  Supplementary

Estimates for us to consider at the end of 1968.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member is quite right

in saying that there will be further Supplementary

Estimates   next  year.  There  are  Supplementary

Estimates  every year, and for this  year  we  are

lucky  to  have  only  one  set  of  Supplementary

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the under-estimation, I have said that

80  per  cent  of the retirements were  compulsory

retirements.  The other 20 per cent were  optional

retirements and this is the element that  is  very

difficult to estimate from year to year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



Of course, it is also not always possible to allow

for  more  higher paid civil servants retiring  in

one year as against another year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the hon. Member that we are doing our

best to have the most exact estimate possible, but

in   spite   of  this,  mistakes  do   occur   and

underestimates do take place, as a result of which

this   House  will  certainly  have  to   consider

Supplementary Estimates next year.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $233,260 for Head 0803 ordered to

of Expenditure for 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1002 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead l.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same admendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad to hear the

Minister  for  Finance  say  just  now  that   all

estimates  are prepared in the most  exact  manner

possible. Unfortunately, the explanatory  note  to

Head  1002 subhead 1 gives an idea that it is  not

so.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, each Ministry puts in its estimates

and  it  expects  them  to  be  cut  down  by  the

Treasury.  It  is  something  like  bargaining  or

haggling  in the market. I open my price at,  say,

$3  million.  You say, "No, you can  get  only  $2

million."  Then at the end of the year,  you  find

that $2 million is not enough and you have to come

back   to  Parliament  to  get  the  extra   money

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That exactly is the position here, Mr Speaker,

Sir,I  think it behoves the Ministries  and  the

Treasury  to  come to a certain understanding,  so

that  there need not be any bargaining.  What  the

Ministries  want  must be stated exactly,  and  if

Treasury want to reduce it, they must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



give  good  reasons. And once the sum is  reduced,

the  Ministry should see to it that it  sticks  to

that figure, instead of, as in this instance, a $2

million reduction, expecting certain vacancies not

to  be filled, and they had, in the course of  the

year,  filled  vacancies up to a sum of  $660,000.

This  is the sum that falls short, and now we  are

here  asked to vote again. Parliament may  not  be

very  busy,  Sir, but surely this  is  no  way  of

employing its time!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just

been  given  a wonderful illustration  of  what  I

would  term  "inefficiency" on  the  part  of  the

Ministry    concerned   in   estimating   probable

expenditure  for the year 1967. It is  indeed  sad

for  all  of us having to come here today to  vote

for  a  sum  of $660,000 to cover the  expenditure

incurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the explanatory note, one would, in the

first  instance, be happy to note that  there  was

such  a thing as "probable under-expenditure" and,

therefore,  a  deduction of $2 million  was  made.

Here  again,  we  have  the  Ministry  of  Culture

appointing persons to fill the vacancies and today

we are billed for $660,000. This is a very big sum

of  money  and I am sure the Minister will  inform

the  House  of the number of vacant posts  filled,

i.e.,  how  many officers have been recruited,  to

merit the $660,000.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this is really a

technical Treasury point, and so I am answering it

on  behalf of the Minister for Culture because  it

deals with methods of estimation and why the  Head

has  been under-estimated and who is to blame, and

that  sort  of  thing.  Of  course,  Members  must

understand  that these estimates  were  passed  by

hon.  Members  last year. They cannot,  therefore,

entirely escape responsibility for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Member for Choa Chu Kang got

it right when he said that this amount of money is

like  bargaining  between  the  Ministry  and  the

Treasury.  This is about deductions on account  of

probable under-expenditure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



And,  of course, if hon. Members have studied  the

Estimates for next year which are now before them,

they  will  find  that this  item  is  entered  in

respect of all estimates of expenditure. There are

various  reasons for this. First, in the  case  of

personal  emoluments, where it is  the  custom  to

enter  the  full  amount for the year  January  to

December,  quite often where this relates  to  new

posts  - when you have to fill new posts there  are

various procedures to follow to ensure that  there

is no fiddling and that the most qualified persons

are  appointed  to  the public service  - this,  of

course,  means that you have to advertise  in  the

newspapers.   Before   you   advertise   in    the

newspapers,  the qualifications and the  terms  of

the  office  must  be  agreed between  the  Public

Service Commission, the Treasury and: the Ministry

concerned. This takes time, and as often  as  not,

when  you  have the time, you find  that  in  many

cases you cannot get the people with the requisite

experience and qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Culture Division of the

Ministry  of  Culture, this has been the  practice

all  along  since the establishment of television,

when  they  had  to recruit many grades  of  staff

which  were  never  found in  the  public  service

before,  such as T.V, cameramen, newsreel editors,

writers,  directors -that kind of  personnel.  And

for  many years, it has been the experience of the

Ministry  of  Culture to be unable to  fill  these

posts  to  a very considerable extent.  So  it  is

based  on  past  experience that  the  sum  of  $2

million  had  been  entered  as  "probable  under-expenditure". Fortunately for us, the Ministry has

been  able to recruit more successfully this  year

than  in  previous years. Hence, the  estimate  of

"probable  under-expenditure" proved to be  wrong.

We,  therefore,  have to give out the  money  that

they  need.  I  hope  this explanation  makes  the

matter clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I am satisfied except for

the  fact  that my colleague, the hon. Member  for

Punggol, has asked for detailed figures. I  wonder

whether the Minister could oblige.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Sir, I have the figures

with  me.  This  is  purely due to  reorganisation

which  was done. There were altogether 74  persons

who   have  been  recruited  in  the  Broadcasting

one,   Technical  Assistant  (Superscale),   five,

Technical   Assistant   (Special   Grade),   none,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 11 be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indeed happy to see the establishment

of a regular Outward Bound School at Pulau Ubin. I

can  well remember that years back we used to send

our  students  to  outward  bound  schools  in   a

neighbouring   country.  With  the  objective   of

building  a  more robust and rugged society,  this

establishment of an Outward Bound School comes, in

fact, at a very opportune time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself had the opportunity to visit this

Outward  Bound  School and to see for  myself  the

courses conducted by the authorities there. Seeing

young   boys  and  girls  undergoing  such   tough

training  to  meet  our  objective  is  indeed   a

wonderful experience. Now that the Government  has

realised  that such outward bound training  is  an

effective medium to mould our young people into  a

generation  tough and disciplined in body  and  in

mind,  I  would  like to know  from  the  Minister

concerned  what  type of outward bound  activities

would mould a tough generation disciplined in body

and  in mind. Further, when was this Outward Bound

School  instituted  and on what  basis,  in  other

words,   the   type  of  lectures,  teachers   and

management?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Outward

Bound  School  offers courses  almost  similar  to

those  being  offered by the Outward Bound  School

which  was started on an ad hoc basis sometime  in

1960 with the help of instructors from the British

Army.  We  actually took over in August this  year

when   preparation  was  made  for  the  requisite

buildings and facilities in Pulau Ubin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the courses themselves, since the hon.

Member for Punggol has attended the Outward  Bound

School -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I have only visited the school.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> - has visited the school, and if

he  is  as curious as he appears to be, surely  he

would  have gone through the hundreds of pamphlets

showing the activities of the Outward Bound School

- such as canoeing, hiking, camping, rowing,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



physical exercises, swimming, the whole lot. These

activities   are   actually  planned   to   instil

confidence into the students taking these courses,

to  let  them  prove to themselves that  they  are

capable of certain standards of performance  which

are  considered  to be the norm for  the  type  of

physique that they have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is possible for me to give a

detailed description of the syllabus of the course

that  is  now  being drawn up, since  the  warden,

chief instructors, and instructors have only  just

arrived. But if the hon. Member for Punggol  would

really like to go into it. I will supply him  with

all   the   literature  available,   including   a

description  of  the courses,  the  whys  and  the

wherefores  of the syllabus, the hours they  spend

outdoors, indoors, camping, etc.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the

Minister inform the House, since the setting up of

such  a  school, how many courses the  school  has

organised,  the  number of students,  the  schools

involved - probably the districts? In other  words,

how  many have benefited and, in particular,  what

is the duration of each course?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Each course lasts from between

18  and 25 days, and since August we have had four

courses averaging 40 to 50 students each. They are

from  the  Vigilante Corps instructors, Organising

Secretaries  of  the People's Association,  and  I

think  the  last batch were teachers from  various

schools in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment since the Minister has fully answered

all my questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $213,120 for Head 11 ordered to stand

part   of   the  First  Supplementary  Development

Estimates of Expenditure for 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 61 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 61 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the explanatory note states that a large

number of acquisitions have to be completed within

this  year to meet outstanding acquisition appeals

and  additional awards made by the Appeals  Board,

and  the  sum required is $1.5 million. Could  the

Minister elaborate on this note?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Development  Estimates for 1967 provide  the  Land

Office  with a provision of $4 million  under  the

title  "Land Acquisition for General Development".

This vote is intended to meet expenditure incurred

under the following headings:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Acquisition or purchase of land for general

development,   for  example,  fire  sites,   urban

renewal, parcels of land which may be offered  for

sale  to the State although not needed immediately

for  a public purpose but whose purchase is deemed

desirable for long-term development, for  example,

the  old  Admiralty House in Grange Road purchased

from  the United Kingdom Government in 1963:  land

in  Ulu Pandan purchased in 1967 to allow for  the

enlargement of a site adjacent thereto; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) supplementary awards arising from appeals to

the Appeals Board or from settlement out of court;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) supplementary awards resulting from

surveyings   completed   after   the   acquisition

indicating  that  more land has  been  taken  than

originally   stated   and  thereby   necessitating

additional compensation to the owner from whom the

land was taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although an amount of $4 million was provided

for,  an  additional  sum  of  about  $1½  million,

approximately  $1,448,567.89, further  particulars

of  which I will give later, is now required as  a

result  of  increases in the awards  made  by  the

Appeals   Board   and   in   order   to   complete

acquisitions  approved this year. This  additional

sum  will  enable  acquisition proceedings  to  be

finalised  in  a number of cases this  year.  Hon.

Members will remember that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



Land  Acquisition  Act,  which  was  long  delayed

partly  because we were in Malaysia,  was  finally

approved  sometime last year and made  enforceable

sometime  this year. Many acquisitions  have  been

delayed  because we preferred to wait for the  new

Act to come into force before starting acquisition

proceedings.  The  Court itself  has  had  several

sittings this year and made certain awards  which,

of course, had cost the Government a little money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A break-down of the expenditure already incurred

and  which is to be incurred under the Board  this

year is as follows:

 <pre>

 Amount expended:



               (a) For general development           $2,284,354.49

               (b) For other projects                $1,945,188.40

                                                     -------------

                   Total                             $4,229,542.89

                                                     =============

</pre>

The  approximate amount required to complete  five

acquisitions  is  $1,219,025.  These  two  figures

added   give  a  sum  of  $5,448,567.89.  If   one

subtracts  the sum of $4 million from  the  sum  I

have   just   mentioned,  the  balance   will   be

$1,448,567.89,  approximately $1½ million.  Sir,  I

have  already  bothered the  learned  Member  with

figures. I could give him further figures,  but  I

think I will be merely wasting his time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

Estimates of Expenditure for 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 67 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 67 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 102.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I am going to say also

applies to the other subheads in respect of which

I have also proposed to move reductions. It would

appear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



from   the   explanatory  notes   in   the   First

Supplementary Development Estimates that all these

five subheads, namely, subheads 102, 103, 104, 202

and  208,  could  have  been  anticipated  at  the

beginning of the year. As such, once again I  must

say that the Ministry should have anticipated this

expenditure.  It  would  only  be   a   waste   of

parliamentary time to come at the end of the  year

for supplementary estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker. This amendment to

subhead  102 stands only in the name of  Mr  Tang

See  Chim,  and  it appears no other  hon.  Member

wishes to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as my colleague,

the  Minister for Finance, has pointed out, it  is

sometimes    difficult    to    anticipate    this

expenditure,  and as he has also pointed  out,  we

have  only come back to Parliament once, not twice

or  three times. To deal with the specific subhead

102,  which  is "Major Construction and Renovation

to Government Buildings", the additional funds are

in  fact  required  to  meet expenditure  for  the

maintenance, renovation and redecoration  of  many

Government buildings as part of an overall plan of

expansion   of  the  services  and  additions   of

responsibilities   of   various   Ministries   and

departments.  Unfortunately, many of  these  items

could   not  have  been  foreseen  in  1966,   but

nevertheless  had to be implemented  on  a  rather

urgent  basis  in 1967. Examples of these  are  as

follows.  First,  certain funds  had  to  be  made

available  to  convert and renovate some  premises

for  the Public Health Transport Centre to  enable

the   emergency   cleansing  scheme   to   operate

properly.   This  should  meet  the  approval   of

Members.   Second,  many  of  our  public   office

buildings had to be given major reconstruction and

renovation and these include such big buildings as

the  City Hall, the Fullerton Building, the C.I.D.

building and a few others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several new offices were set up and major

alterations and renovations had to be effected  to

make them suitable to serve the purposes intended.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will have read Press reports to  the

effect  that  we  are  making efforts  to  promote

tourism  and we have started a school for waiters.

One  of  the  buildings is the Hotel and  Catering

Institute.  Others are the Registry of  Companies,

the Immigration Department depots, Moulmein Road X-Ray  Centre,  the  United Kingdom  Bases  Run-down

Unit,  and,  what happens to be in the public  eye

these  days,  the  conversion  of  the  school  at

Chestnut Drive into a court house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, major renovations were done to some

buildings  to  keep  them in  good  repair  or  to

convert  them to serve new purposes. These include

the  weigh-bridge at Tampines dumping grounds, the

National  Library  garages and  a  sewage  pumping

house in Ulu Pandan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just now explained that the expenditure is unforeseen in nature. I would like to know what are the projects that have been carried out in the rural areas which have been classified as unforeseen in nature.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Most of the expenditure under subhead

202  was  of an unforeseen nature and  had  to  be

incurred to meet actual requirements in the  rural

areas during the course of the year. Funds had  to

be  expended  to upgrade certain rural  roads  and

tracks, and to improve or divert existing drainage

systems as and when necessary. There was also  the

provision for new roads and drains, public utility

services such as electricity, water and sewers for

major  development  areas  in  Pasir  Laba,  Bukit

Timah, Ulu Pandan and Bedok; unfortunately not  in

Kampong Kembangan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan always rises in

this   House  to  ask  for  more  funds  for   his

constituency  to  build and improve  the  existing

roads or build new roads. I remember visiting  his

constituency at a celebration in connection with a

community  centre and I was asked  when  the  road

that led to the centre would be improved. That has

been  done.  May I state openly to the Member  for

Kampong   Kembangan   that   my   sympathies   are

completely with him, but the man behind the  purse

is  the  Hon. Minister for Finance. Though  I  can

support his representations to get more money  for

every  constituency, I am afraid I  also  have  to

convince the Minister for Finance who, I am  sure,

has the interest of Singapore at heart -

not  been proposed have been carried out. I do not

understand  how  the  Minister considers  requests

from  the  rural  constituencies and  brings  them

before  this  Parliament. Though the Minister  has

said  that  this expenditure is of  an  unforeseen

nature,  I would like to know whether the projects

proposed  for Kampong Kembangan constituency  will

be carried out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I think it is the duty of

every  Member  of  Parliament to  fight  for  more

social  amenities  for  his  constituency,  and  I

wholly   support  what  the  Member  for   Kampong

Kembangan has said. Because of this, today we have

this  extra  sum  to be voted for  - $1.5  million,

"Construction  in Rural Areas".  In  other  words,

rural services are very vital to the residents  in

the  rural constituencies, and that is why  I  had

the amendment in mind. The Government has now seen

fit  to  bring more social amenities to the  rural

constituencies, and I think the Member for Kampong

Kembangan is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang, I take it you are not

speaking on this amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I have already said just now that my

sympathies   are  with  the  Member  for   Kampong

Kembangan. Just as you want more money for Kampong

Kembangan,  I  want more money  for  Tanglin.  The

Member for Choa Chu Kang wants more money for Choa

Chu  Kang  and the Member for Punggol  wants  more

money  for Punggol. But I think you know what  has

happened  this  year. For Kampong  Kembangan,  the

funds have been utilised but we did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



approve  certain  projects  over  and  above   the

limited funds available. Funds that have not  been

used  in  other constituencies have been  used  in

several constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Kampong Kembangan made the

point  that  now  I know all the  requirements  in

Kampong  Kembangan. I am afraid I do not.  I  know

some    of   the   requirements   of   the   other

constituencies,  and  I  am  continually  reminded

about them when I make a courtesy visit to any  of

the constituencies - to open a community centre  or

join  with  Members  in the  celebration  of  some

anniversary.  I  am always met with  requests  for

water  mains,  electricity and roads.  Frankly,  I

will be happy to give Members all they ask, but  I

am afraid I cannot because the funds available are

limited  and the Minister for Finance is  the  big

boss.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

although   the  Minister  for  Law  and   National

Development does not fully understand the position

in Kampong Kembangan, I would request him to visit

my  constituency  during this rainy  weather.  The

Minister  has said just now that all Members  want

extra  funds  for  their  constituencies.  Kampong

Kembangan is a different constituency where 75 per

cent  of  the  area  has not been  built  up.  The

Minister has said that his sympathies are with the

people of Kampong Kembangan, but the funds are  in

the  hands  of the Minister for Finance.  I  would

like  to ask the Minister to assure me if  he  can

get the Minister for Finance to give some funds to

Kampong Kembangan.

<div align="center"><b>EFFECT OF DEVALUATION OF STERLING ON THE STABILITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF LABOUR AND CAPITAL IN PIONEER INDUSTRIES</b></div>



<br><br>3.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

much has been said about the Sterling devaluation

the last couple



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



of  weeks,  since  the United  Kingdom  Government

announced   the   devaluation   of   the    Pound.

Apparently, the devaluation of the Pound by nearly

15 per cent with its broader economic consequences

did  not  seem to be a matter of great concern  to

the  people  of  Singapore. Instead,  the  half  a

million   workers   and  businessmen   were   more

concerned  about  the  depreciation  of  the   old

Malayan currency by 15 per cent. This was the main

concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little or no attention was given to the effect of

the devaluation as a whole, on the future earnings

of the Singapore workers. Sir, some have expressed

gleefully, "The British-made cars would be cheaper

by  15 per cent." So may it be. But the fact  that

no  one seemed to be worried about the effects  of

devaluation   on   the  broader  economic   front,

including  its  effects  on  labour,  indicates  a

possible  complacency on the part of the Singapore

workers.  This  may be understandable.  More  than

1,200  motor-cycles  or  scooters  are  registered

every  month. This is a clear indication that  the

workers in the lower and middle income groups have

benefited  from  the economic expansion  over  the

last   five  years.  Can  this  rate  of  economic

expansion  be  maintained and can the  workers  of

Singapore  as  a whole continue to increase  their

earning capacity at the same rate? One may  wonder

what the devalued Pound has to do with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an island-State with no natural

resources,  and  the value of  the  new  Singapore

dollar   in  terms  of  purchasing  power  depends

entirely on how much Singapore-made goods  can  be

exported,  and  how much foreign exchange  we  can

earn  thereby.  There is a great possibility  that

our  export may be affected adversely one  way  or

the  other. For example, Hong Kong, which devalued

by  4.3 per cent - originally Hong Kong devalued by

14  per  cent  - would  be in a better  competitive

position in the international markets in terms  of

price,  as  Hong Kong-made goods would be  cheaper

than Singapore-made goods



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



of similar kind, as Singapore did not devalue. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  some of the pioneer companies  may

use this as an argument to deny any wage increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Commonwealth countries have devalued

equally  with  the  Pound.  Singapore,  therefore,

would  theoretically  be  at  a  disadvantage   in

pricing  by  15 per cent in competing  with  those

countries which have devalued 15 per cent. Can our

goods, therefore, remain as competitive as before?

This  may be possible if the two parties concerned

in  the manufacture of export goods, employers and

unions, preserve good sense and not take advantage

of each other by using the devaluation issue as an

excuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour in the manufacturing companies,

particularly  the  pioneer  industries,  must   be

prepared to exercise restraint for at least one or

two  years on increase of wages. This should apply

more specifically to those pioneer companies where

the  unskilled workers are being paid at $3.50 and

above. Labour as a whole at all wage levels in the

export  manufacturing industries  should  seek  to

increase  their productivity by 15  per  cent,  in

terms of greater efficiency, by cutting costs, for

example.  On the other hand, the pioneer companies

must  be prepared to recognise the greater efforts

put in by labour and grant reasonable increases to

those who are in the $2 to $2.50 bracket up  to  a

maximum  of $3 to $3.50. The Government has  given

added    incentives   to   export    manufacturing

companies.   Similarly   the   pioneer   companies

themselves  on  their  own volition  should  grant

incentives  for  increased  productivity  to   the

workers.  Both  the management and  union  leaders

must  be  prepared to appreciate the  difficulties

encountered  by  each other. The  workers  in  the

pioneer  companies  have a greater  responsibility

than   just  irrationally  increasing  their   pay

packets.   By  1971,  at  least  10,000  Singapore

citizens  would  be  seeking  employment  due   to

retrenchment  in the British bases. Owing  to  the

devaluation  of  the Pound, Britain  may  possibly

accelerate the withdrawal of the bases. To add  to

this, we have an unemployment figure of 52,000,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



not counting the school-leavers seeking employment

in the labour market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with restraint of wage increases for

unskilled  labour  at the $3.50  mark  and  above,

accompanied by an increase in productivity  of  15

per  cent, the reputation of the Singapore workers

would  induce  overseas  investors  to  bring   in

capital  to  start new companies. The greater  the

investment  from overseas, the more  manufacturing

companies  set  up,  the  smaller  would  be   our

unemployment problem. By reducing the unemployment

figure,  the workers can have more for  themselves

in the long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A practical solution must be found if we in

Singapore  are  to  overcome any possible  adverse

factors  that may arise as a result of devaluation

which may restrict our effort to export more.  One

way  is to set up a tripartite council, consisting

of  management and labour representatives together

with the national productivity centre representing

the  Government,  to investigate  the  effects  of

devaluation  on our export industry  and  to  seek

solutions. A tripartite council was set up  a  few

years  ago.  This  council  represented  all

employers  and labour at the national  level.  The

council was inaugurated with a lot of fanfare, but

where is this council today? No one hears about it

today. It is completely dormant, sleeping. Let  us

not  make  the  same mistake again.  A  tripartite

council, as I have suggested earlier, with special

functions must be initiated. The emphasis would be

on  increased  exports, higher  productivity  with

quality and lower costs, and industrial peace with

justice  which will be the responsibility  of  the

Council.  All  grievances  between  employer   and

labour could be investigated and solutions arrived

at,  to  the  satisfaction of  all  concerned.  If

concrete  results are to be obtained and the  fate

of  the first national tripartite council avoided,

the persons nominated to this council must include

persons who are directly connected with the export

industries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the functions of this council I would

envisage to be:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To educate the workers and instil in them

the importance of increased productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To instil into employers the importance of

recognising  the efforts put in  by  workers

for  increased  production which  should  be

compensated reasonably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To investigate into complaints from

employers or unions on all matters affecting

production,    quality    and     industrial

relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since increased export is the overall aim

and  is  of  vital importance to  Singapore  as  a

whole, I would suggest that the Government appoint

a  public  servant as secretary in the Council.  I

would  even  go  further  and  suggest  that  full

publicity by posters, advertisements and talks  be

given  to  drive home to all concerned  about  the

vital  role they are requested to play in boosting

the economy of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that by the efforts of this Council

production  is boosted, what should the Government

or  the  employer  do about finding  the  overseas

markets?  To what extent should employers  finance

the  setting  up of trade missions in every  large

city in the world? Sending trade missions overseas

once  in  every  six months is  not  good  enough.

Singapore must have super-salesmen posted in every

capital  in  the  world. The employers  should  be

willing  to  bear  some of the expenses  of  these

trade  missions  which would be manned  by  people

with expert knowledge of the various industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, businessmen alone cannot be

expected to have governmental contact overseas.  I

think  the  Ministry of Finance is  obviously  the

department  which  should  initiate  and  lay  the

foundation  of  setting up various trade  missions

throughout  the world. Otherwise all efforts  made

in Singapore to produce quality-made goods at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



reduced cost and all the incentives offered to the

export industries would be in vain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest in all seriousness to the Minister for

Finance  that the campaign to achieve  the  target

should  be tackled with the same vigour  that  the

Government  is  tackling  the  problem  of  family

planning  (so  that we need not have  to  legalise

abortion) and the "eat more wheat" campaign.  Sir,

I  would  go further and recommend to the Minister

for  Finance to plough back the 4 per cent tax  on

export  earnings, or at least some portion of  it,

to  the  setting  up  of trade missions  in  those

countries where Singapore-made goods have or  have

not   found  a  market,  or  in  countries   where

businessmen   find  difficulty   in   establishing

contacts. I will be failing in my duty as a  trade

unionist  if  I do not emphasise that the  workers

alone cannot he expected to practise restraint  as

part  of  their role to boost the economy  of  the

State.  The Government and the employers too  must

play  their part. It is the co-ordination and  co-operation  on the part of every one of  the  three

parties concerned that can herald a new and bright

phase  to  our  industrial growth - to  borrow  the

phrase  of  the  Finance Minister  in  his  Budget

speech.



<br><br>4.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, I fully understand the contents of the speech

made  by the Member for Bras Basah. He has touched

on  the  undesirable effects arising  out  of  the

devaluation of the British Pound. He has  proposed

several  suggestions in his speech,  and  I  agree

with some of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is about those workers who are

getting  wages  of  between $2  and  $2.50  - their

claims  for  a wage increase should be  considered

favourably by employers by reason of the fact that

daily-paid  workers who are receiving  between  $2

and  $2.50  per  day are finding it  difficult  to

maintain  their own livelihood and that  of  their

families.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



We all know that they are poor families and out of

this  meagre sum of $2 and $2.50 per day they have

to  make  ends meet. This is an almost  impossible

task.  We  also  know that low pay  may  have  bad

effects. Firstly, because of poor income, the food

may  not  be  nourishing enough. As a result,  the

health  of the workers will be adversely affected,

and  it  will  in turn affect their  productivity.

Secondly,  the workers themselves may have  family

problems,   and  this  will  affect  their   whole

attitude  towards their work. And  this  too  will

affect their productivity adversely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that we should make use of the

tripartite council to look after the interests  of

the  country  as  a whole, labour and  capital  in

particular,   and  to  avoid  any  hindrances   or

undesirable influences or results which  might  be

at  a  disadvantage  to any of  these  three;  the

country,  labour  and capital. So  the  tripartite

council  should  take up its responsibilities  and

implement  the tasks that are assigned  to  it  as

suggested by the Member for Bras Basah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to stress that our currency is

very  strong because we have a backing of 400  per

cent  in  reserves, in  fact,  the  currency   in

Singapore  is  trusted by many. Not  only  do  the

people  of  Singapore have confidence in  it,  but

many other countries also have full confidence  in

it.   For  instance,  our  Deputy  Prime  Minister

recently passed through Bangkok, and according  to

him, the people there are using our currency. From

this  we can see the strength and prestige of  our

currency.  Sir, because our currency is backed  by

400  per cent in reserves and also because we  are

maintaining  our currency at its face  value,  our

people can buy more goods than before.



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, from what my friend, the Member  for

Bras  Basah,  has said, I think we  should  pay  a

great  deal  of  attention to  economic  measures.

Although I do not wish to speak at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



length,  I wish to offer some suggestions  to  the

Government. For production, raw materials are most

essential.  These raw materials are imported  from

abroad. Local businessmen sometimes buy these  raw

materials  at  high prices, and  then  manufacture

them here in this country. Thus the prices of  our

manufactured products rise. There should  be  some

measure  of control over imports of raw materials.

Take  a  glass  factory,  for  example.  The   raw

material  is imported from abroad. The businessmen

in  those foreign countries and the businessmen in

our  country  get together, and the  raw  material

prices  are pushed up. These prices naturally  are

reflected  in  locally-manufactured  products, if

this  trend continues, in what way will we be able

to  increase our exports to foreign countries?  We

ought  to look into these matters. If our  country

is  to  gain strength, particularly because we  do

not  have  raw  materials, we  should  as  far  as

possible  import  them from nearby  countries.  If

this  matter is rectified, perhaps we will be able

to maintain competitive prices. I think Government

should  look into this matter - from what countries

we  should  import and at what prices.  These  are

worth  investigating.  If  these  prices  can   be

controlled  or  reduced,  then  both  our   export

industry  will thrive and our currency  will  gain

strength.  Therefore, I suggest that  the  Finance

Minister should investigate these things and  take

suitable steps.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Member

for  Anson  has  got it all wrong. People  do  not

import  raw  materials at high cost. They  try  to

import   raw  materials  at  the  cheapest   cost,

otherwise  they  will  go  bankrupt  because  they

cannot  sell  the finished products anywhere.  So,

far  from  Government  introducing  any  form   of

control  on  imports  of raw  materials,  I  think

Government  is well advised to let the businessmen

do  their own buying. I am not quite sure  whether

the interpreter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



did  a  correct job of interpreting what the  hon.

Member has said. I must confess I cannot make much

sense out of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang says that it is wrong to

pay workers $2 and $2.50 a day because they cannot

maintain  a family at that wage. He must  remember

that  these  rates are really rates  paid  not  to

workers  as their normal wages, but are  rates  of

pay  given  mostly  to girl workers  during  their

initial period of training. Of course, these girls

are  unmarried, and this really means paying  them

money  while they acquire skills which will enable

them  to earn more when they have completed  their

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the speech by the Member for Bras

Basah.  I  think  this is a very well  thought-out

piece.  Obviously the Member has spent  a  lot  of

time  and a lot of thought on it. He has made many

valuable suggestions which deserve to he seriously

considered  not  only by Government  but  also  by

unions and employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not like to comment in detail on the

various  useful  suggestions he has  made,  except

perhaps  to say that his speech, I think, deserves

to  be  produced and printed in a special  booklet

for circulation to interested parties. I will give

him  a firm promise that I will look into the  two

suggestions he has made, i.e., to establish a new

council  which  will be concerned  with  educating

workers  on  the need to improve productivity  and

the  methods of so doing; and the need to  educate

employers on how greater productivity should  lead

to greater pay; and also the possibility that this

new council can formulate some system whereby they

can investigate complaints, presumably either from

workers or employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member, of course, has long experience in

trade  unions  and I think what  he  says  on  the

subject  should be taken seriously,  as  also  his

proposal  that we should set up trade missions  in

our export markets, a subject which I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



have  dealt  with  in  my Budget  speech  at  some

length.  I think the hon. Member can rest  assured

that   the   coming   year  will   see   important

developments in this field.
