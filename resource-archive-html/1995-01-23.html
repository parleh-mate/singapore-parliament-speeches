   <b>SKILLS DEVELOPMENT LEVY</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr John De Payva</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether he will consider (i) increasing the Skills Development Levy rate to 4% and (ii) revising the salary ceiling for the Levy to $1,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chee Wee) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government announced in February last year that the salary ceiling for the Skills Development Levy will be raised from $750 to $1,000, but the rate will remain at 1%. The revision will take effect from April this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also said in the same announcement that the salary ceiling will need to be raised further in the future in order for the annual levy collection to match the annual disbursements of training grants from the Skills Development Fund (SDF). The SDF will continue to play a key role in the skills training and upgrading of our workers. It must therefore be adequately funded. My Ministry will continue to review the levy collection and funding requirements periodically, and make further revisions when necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr John De Payva (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the Minister be in a position to tell us how many people in Singapore would be contributing based on the impending salary ceiling of $1,000?

   <b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</b>

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Termination of gas supply to older private housing estates)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry why the Public Utilities Board has decided to terminate the gas supply to older private housing estates and how many estates are affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) will be terminating piped gas supply to 40 low-rise estates affecting 15,970 households over the next two to three years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gas pipes in these estates were laid between 22 and 40 years ago. Over the years, house owners have built extensions in their backyards over the run of these gas pipes, thereby rendering maintenance of gas pipes difficult, if not impossible. These gas pipes could be corroded and the risk of gas leak would increase as the pipes get older. The leakage of gas could accumulate in the voids beneath the house extension and accumulate into an explosive mixture. Hence, for safety reasons, these pipes have to be replaced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the cost of re-laying new pipes is very high and is not economically viable in view of the small number of households which use PUB piped gas in these estates. Although all housing units in the 40 affected estates are served by the PUB gas network, only 46% of them use PUB gas. It would not be justifiable for PUB to expend large sums of public fund when the majority of residents are not using PUB gas but bottled LPG.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those households using PUB gas now would not be unduly inconvenienced as they can switch to LPG which is readily available and competitively priced. However, if the affected households wish to continue with PUB gas supply, they could collectively, within each estate, make a capital contribution towards part of the cost of laying the new gas pipes in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> order to make the gas mains renewal project financially viable. Additionally, each household would have to bear the cost of laying a new gas service pipe within his premises. It is estimated that each household would have to pay between $2,000 and $17,000 depending on the location and number of households in the estate. The average cost is $4,000 per household.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, PUB has served notice to seven estates but has yet to terminate supply to any. The Members of Parliament of these seven estates have been informed of the intention and the rationale behind this exercise. Some households have already applied to cut off gas supply following the notification.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that PUB will continue to render all possible assistance to affected households and will carry out the exercise in a manner which will cause least inconvenience to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights):</b> Sir, what is the total cost of re-laying the gas pipes in all these estates?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> It depends on the housing estate concerned. The figures I quoted, ie, between $2,000 and $17,000, are the contribution to be made by the households. The cost actually depends on the estate concerned, ie, the condition of the pipes, the pipelines, the layout, etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Would the Government consider doing this as an upgrading project for the private housing estates?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> I have already explained the rationale why, from PUB's analysis, it is not economically viable to re-lay the pipes. But if the residents insist that they want the PUB gas supply and they are prepared to bear part of the cost, PUB will oblige.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> My question is whether the Government is prepared to do this as an upgrading project, just like the Government is upgrading the HDB estates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> Even if the residents pay the cost which I have mentioned, they only bear part of the cost of laying the pipes.

  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> As I mentioned, it depends on the estate. In this case, I also want to mention that the residents have an alternative. They can always switch to LPG gas which is available at more or less the same price as PUB gas.

  <br>
  <br> expressways will pose a hazard to motorists as some drivers suddenly reduce speed after seeing the camera box.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together as they are related?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, speed detection cameras are a means to curb and deter speeding. Their mere presence does not render a road suitable for its speed limit to be raised. On the contrary, it is at locations where vehicles frequently speed and where accidents are more likely to occur as a result of speeding (for example, Holland Road) that speed detection cameras are installed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, separate from the question of speed detection cameras, there have been suggestions in the press that existing speed limits be raised. Others, however, have argued that the present speed limits are appropriate and should remain.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departments concerned, ie, Traffic Police, PWD and ROV, take great care in recommending speed limits for our roads. The maximum speed we can allow on a particular road would depend on all the factors that affect traffic safety, ie, the physical nature of the road itself such as its width and existence of bends, presence of merging lanes, slip roads and centre dividers, the general traffic volume of different classes of road users and vehicles and also, in general, the behaviour of road users including the level of road courtesy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Singapore had only two speed limits - 50 km per hour for most roads and 70 km per hour for the larger and wider roads. 80 km per hour was introduced when expressways were constructed. At some portions of expressways, the speed limit is lower (70 km per hour) for safety reasons, eg, in the Central Expressway tunnel. These speed limits are reviewed periodically. Based on the above factors, setting appropriate speed limits is a matter of judgment. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> professionals have, all things considered, advised retaining the present speed limits. We should abide by their judgment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some motorists, eg, those who drive higher capacity cars, may feel safe driving at speeds above the present speed limits, we must not forget that there are many other road users who drive smaller cars or who are relatively inexperienced. At higher speeds, they would have less margin for avoiding accidents. The Commander of Traffic Police informs me that high speed compounds the effect of other causes of accidents, such as skidding, failure to have proper control of vehicle, overtaking dangerously, changing lanes without consideration for other road users and tail-gating. At high speed, a driver is less able to have complete control of his vehicle; he also has less time to react to changing traffic conditions and potentially hazardous situations. An accident which occurs at high speed causes greater damage and injury. Death is also more likely in high speed accidents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies in the United States in 1990 show that raising speed limits have led to increased road casualties. Their figures show that when some 38 states raised their speed limits from 55 miles per hour to 65 miles per hour, deaths rocketed by 34% compared with the previous four-year period. In eight states where the limits were retained, the increase was just 8%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned with what our statistics show. Since 1992, there has been an increasing trend in fatal cases in speed related accidents. In 1992, there were 93 cases. This rose to 96 cases in 1993 and 118 cases in 1994. Do we want the number to go higher? The answer must surely be no.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that we live in a largely urban environment. Our roads and expressways are not as long as the highways of other countries. Our expressways have slip roads at relatively short intervals. It is not advisable to have too many different speed limits on different stretches as this will lead to confusion. The PWD who are the experts
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in road engineering have also advised that the speed limit of 80 km per hour is an appropriate speed limit for our expressways. In the interest of traffic safety, we should not increase our speed limits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked whether the speed detection cameras installed along the expressways would pose a hazard to motorists, as some motorists might suddenly reduce speed after seeing the camera box. Such a situation should not occur if motorists travel within the speed limit of the road at all times. However, I am not saying that the problem highlighted by Mr Low could not happen. Nevertheless, I hope that he is not suggesting that we do away with the speed camera on this account. Speed cameras, in the long run, would save more lives by deterring speeding on our roads and expressways.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not Traffic Police's intention to catch the motorists by surprise. Traffic Police have provided full details of the locations of these cameras. In addition, there are prominent signs to give sufficient advance warning to motorists on the road. Over time, as motorists get used to the idea of the speed camera and, more importantly, comply with the speed limits on our roads, even in locations without cameras, the problem highlighted by Mr Low should not occur.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, since the Parliamentary Secretary cannot deny the fact that there is a possibility of such a hazard, would he suggest any measure to reduce the hazard, if possible?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I think the so-called hazard that Mr Low has mentioned arises essentially from the newness of the scheme and the fact that drivers are not keeping to the speed limits. Therefore, when they are approaching the camera, they slow down. If this exercise has its desired impact of reminding Singaporeans that there are speed limits, it is for their benefit as well as for the benefit of public safety to keep to the speed limits, when this gets to the ground over time, this so-called hazard that Mr Low mentioned will not be present any more.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, if the motorists are familiar with the location of the cameras, they reduce the speed at that stretch of the road, but after that they increase their speed again. How do you achieve the purpose of installing the speed detection cameras? You have to install cameras for the whole stretch.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> It would seem that Mr Low is actually suggesting the installation of more cameras.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Are you going to do that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> This is a pilot project. Six cameras have been installed all over the island. The Traffic Police says that after another five months, they would review. Should the pilot project prove successful, yes, indeed more cameras will be installed. Whilst that will deter speeding in most areas of Singapore, I think the ultimate message must really be that Traffic Police is not out to catch motorists. And that is why great pains have been taken, both in the press and also on location on the ground, to let motorists know where the cameras are. The exercise is to remind Singaporeans that speeding is something that all of us should not do and the cameras reinforce this message.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the Parliamentary Secretary consider having speed regulating strips at the stretches where there are cameras so that the cars will slow down?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I am not sure whether motorists will really like that because they will talk about possible damage to their vehicles' tyres. And also that will be an overkill because once you have the speed detection cameras, they know that the message is for them to stop speeding. I think that will suffice. We do not want to impose too many different types of mechanisms.
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the general feedback is that 50 km per hour is unfair?

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It is too low for the motorists.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I think we must bear in mind that Singapore is an urban setting where our roads are used not just by motorists who have high capacity cars like Volvos and Mercedeses but also motorists who drive smaller capacity cars. Also the types of drivers in Singapore are of such a wide diversity. Some are more experienced, perhaps like Mr Chiam, and others are less experienced. All things considered, it is better to heed the professional advice of the Committee and keep the speed limits as they are.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that along Holland Road, whenever motorists approach the speed detection camera, they will slow down? As soon as they pass this camera, they will pick up speed again, defeating the purpose of this camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> We cannot control, as it were, the specific behaviour of the road users. But I think we must keep in mind the larger objective of these speed detection cameras which is to reinforce the message that speeding is an offence and that they are for the benefit of motorists themselves. As the press reports have said, now less people in fact speed along that stretch of road. I think that is evidence that the message is filtering down to the ground.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether the pedestrian's well-being is a primary factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as I said just now, there is a wide diversity of people using the roads, including not only motorists but pedestrians, cyclists and even drivers of lorries and trucks. Given this situation in Singapore, let us be conservative. Some may argue that 50 km per hour is low. But I think we should be conservative, play safe and make sure that the central message of public safety for all concerned gets through. That is important.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned about the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> diversity of people using the roads. Pedestrians are supposed to use the pedestrian crossings or overhead bridges. As for lorries, they have their own speed limits, have they not? Why is it that you are blanketing the speed limit to 50 km per hour?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, we are not blanketing the speed limit to 50 km per hour. Even though different road users may have primary access to different areas of the road, the Member cannot deny the fact that there will be cross-fertilisation. Pedestrians have to cross the road and lorries have to move across the road whenever they turn right. I think it is a very simplistic view to say that different road users use different areas and therefore different speed limits apply, and everything is all right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, is it true that for the speed limit of 50 km per hour, the Police shall only take action against motorists who exceed 60 km per hour?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I think I should say this. The Traffic Police has taken a pragmatic approach towards enforcing speed limits. In other words, consideration is given to people who may exceed the speed limits by a certain amount because, after all, sometimes we have to speed up when we overtake. There are situations when we may exceed the speed limit. I think this is something that I am sure Mr Chiam will agree - that it is good judicious enforcement.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development why there is a necessity to increase the season parking fee at Housing and Development Board estates and whether the HDB will provide security guards at these car parks to prevent illegal parking, car thefts, vandalism and other misdemeanours since residents pay for their parking lots.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Acting Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, HDB car parking charges were priced to gradually recover the full cost of building and maintaining its car parks. Based on this policy, the monthly parking charges were fixed at $75 for multi-storey car parks and $55 for surface car parks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this disparity in pricing has led to an imbalance in the demand for the two types of car parks in precincts where they co-exist side by side. Car owners prefer the surface parking lots, mainly because they cost $20 less than in the adjacent multi-storey car park lots. This has resulted in shortages at the surface car parks, while the multi-storey car parks are under-utilised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB therefore recently reviewed the car parking charges in precincts which fall under one of the following three categories.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first category involves five precincts where there is a severe congestion in the surface car parks while the multi-storey car parks nearby are under-used, mainly because of the large difference in the season ticket prices for the two types of car parks. The equalisation of the car parking charges will help resolve this problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category involves 12 precincts where temporary surface car park lots were provided while multi-storey car parks were being built. The residents were informed from the start that the surface car park lots would be removed when the multi-storey car parks were completed. However, the residents have now appealed to retain some of these surface lots to supplement the multi-storey car parks. As the majority of the surface lots will be removed ultimately, HDB wants to prevent a mismatch in demand arising from the difference in car parking charges. A single charge would therefore be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category involves six HDB upgrading precincts. The residents were previously paying $55 per month for the surface car parks. In the upgrading, the surface lots were replaced either fully or partially by a multi-storey car park to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> enhance the aesthetic value of the living environment. However, these car owners then end up having to pay $20 more than before.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking these circumstances into consideration, HDB has decided that, in future, car parking charges will also take into account the utility value to the car users, and the demand and supply situations of car parks in the housing estates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, HDB has adjusted the parking charges for 23 of its car parks. From 1st February 1995, the monthly parking charges for multi-storey car parks in these 23 precincts will be decreased from $75 to $65, and that of surface car parks adjusted from $55 to $65.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By equalising the parking charges, car owners will now be more willing to park in multi-storey car parks. Both surface and multi-storey car parks are now integrated into one category for a more efficient usage of parking lots.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the suggestion of providing security guards for car parks, this would increase the cost of operation, and the cost increase would have to be passed on to the car owners. With the generally low crime rate in Singapore, HDB does not see the need to specially provide security guards and increase the operation cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in response to the Member for Potong Pasir's concern, I have instructed HDB to increase the number of patrols by HDB parking wardens in Potong Pasir in order to prevent illegal parking and to deter car thefts, vandalism and other misdemeanours. The Member will be glad to know that these increased patrols have over the last three nights resulted in HDB issuing 600 parking offences. I assure the Member that HDB will keep up its effort to reduce illegal parking and deter car thefts and vandalism in Potong Pasir.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am happy that the Acting Minister has increased the number of parking wardens at Potong Pasir and he said that over the last three days there were 600 parking offences. Can I have a clarification? Where were these 600 parking offences committed?

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If he could, he could roughly tell me which are the car parks in which these 600 parking offences were issued over the last three days. Is it near Block 108?

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am just responding to the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your indulgence, I will read out the list. There are altogether 11 car parks in Potong Pasir grouped under two groups. HDB calls them Group 17 and Group 12. Group 17 is in Potong Pasir Central and Group 12 is in Toa Payoh Estate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Potong Pasir, a total of 147 parking offences were issued on 21st January, 140 on 22nd January and 149 on 23rd January. In Toa Payoh, 52 parking offences were issued on 21st January, 52 on 22nd January and 61 on 23rd January.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Mr Minister. I think it is high time that the HDB got on to the job. It is probably due to other people coming into the estate to park their cars indiscriminately.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, are you asking your question? If you are making a speech, I will ask you to resume your seat. Ask your question now.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> All right. Why is the Minister so reluctant to supply security guards at places where there are rampant vandalism and/or thefts from cars?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I have asked HDB to enquire from the Neighbourhood Police Post in Potong Pasir whether there was indeed a higher incidence of crime in Potong Pasir or not. I am afraid that I have not got the data. But from the overall macro-data that I have received, the rate of crimes in car parks in Singapore is in fact very low. On the average, two crimes of theft from and theft of cars are committed per car park per year. So with that kind of low crime rate, there is no need to deploy special security guards for the car parks. But, knowing Mr Chiam's concern, I assure him that HDB will deploy extra parking wardens in Potong Pasir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I know how many extra parking wardens will be deployed in Potong Pasir and can he please let me know when will it be implemented?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I received the Question for Oral Answer, I felt that Mr Chiam probably had a problem in Potong Pasir. So I asked HDB to gather information on the ground. As a result, in the last three days they have deployed extra parking wardens to ensure better safety and less illegal parking in Potong Pasir. That is the reason why we have got 600 parking offences. I assure the Member that this exercise will continue and we will eradicate illegal parking in Potong Pasir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have already told the Minister that I welcome the move of the Minister to be so diligent at Potong Pasir. He has said that more parking wardens will be deployed. I want to know how many more parking wardens will be deployed in Potong Pasir and when they will be deployed. After all, I am the MP there and I should know.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I leave this to the operational people on the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ground. They will deploy the required number of parking wardens to eradicate illegal parking in Potong Pasir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I know that uppermost in the Minister's mind is revenue. So if his purpose is to eradicate illegal parking, I would certainly, as the MP there, welcome such a move. I think we are privileged to have such attention given to us.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Mr Chiam?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I still have not got the answer from the Minister because I have to report back to my constituents at Potong Pasir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> That question has been answered. Have you got any other questions? We have to move on.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. What is actually the problem at Potong Pasir for him to deploy extra parking wardens there?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as with many of my colleagues on the Frontbench, we take Questions very seriously from Members. So when we receive a Question like this, I have to ask HDB what is the situation on the ground because Potong Pasir was not involved in the revision of car parking charges in the 23 precincts. So obviously something must be amiss in Potong Pasir that prompted Mr Chiam to raise the Question. So I asked them to check and they told me that there was in fact rampant illegal parking in Potong Pasir. I told them that, as Mr Chiam is very keen to remove illegal parking, we should provide a higher level of service. So the parking wardens will continue to go down and provide this level of service for Potong Pasir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am surprised at the answer of the Minister. Does it mean that if there is no increase in the rate of parking fees at Potong Pasir, there will be none in future? Certainly, we have to anticipate that this increase will be coming. So the Question is absolutely in order. Nevertheless---

  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development whether he will consider the grant of higher housing loans to those who purchase Housing and Development Board resale flats in older housing estates to live near their parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB provides mortgage loan financing to resale flat buyers of up to 80% of the market value or 80% of the declared resale value, whichever is lower. The interest rate on the loans, pegged at 0.1% above the CPF rate, is much lower than the housing loan rates charged by banks. For
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> low-income families whose monthly household incomes do not exceed $1,000 per month, HDB provides an even higher quantum of mortgage loan, of up to 95% of the market value or declared resale value, whichever is lower.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, those who purchase resale flats to live with their parents in older estates are eligible for a $30,000 grant under the CPF Housing Grant Scheme, if they are first-time purchasers buying an HDB resale flat in the same new town or within 2 kilometres of where their parents are staying. The grant is credited into their CPF accounts for the reduction of the principal sum of their mortgage loan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As HDB already subsidizes those who buy resale flats to stay close to their parents both through its generous loan terms and through the CPF Housing Grant Scheme, my Ministry does not see the need for an additional subsidy in the form of higher housing loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, is the Minister not aware that it is the cash upfront that young people got to pay that makes it difficult for them to live with their parents in older housing estates? Therefore, I would like to ask two supplementary questions: (1) Could the Buy-Back Scheme, with some proviso, be extended to this group of people? (2) Could the Minister also look into the ballooning repayment scheme by extending it to this group?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, HDB is aware that in the resale market, the current market practice is for purchasers to pay cash upfront to the sellers. This is not a very healthy practice and HDB would take steps to try and reduce the prevalence of such a practice. However, granting higher loans does not help the purchaser if cash upfront is a market practice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Buy-Back Scheme, so far we have about 2,800 applicants for the 3-room flats. HDB has plans to buy back 1,500 3-room flats in the first year of its operation. HDB is looking at ways to increase the number of 3-room flats that it can purchase under the Buy-Back Scheme so that those who apply for these flats can get their flats earlier.

   <b>(Debate by Singaporeans on merits)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon</b> asked the Prime Minister, with reference to the letters written by his Press Secretary published in the local press recently, whether the Government encourages Singaporeans to actively debate the merits of Government policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government encourages Singaporeans to actively debate the merits of Government policy. My position on this question is fully set out in my Press Secretary's two letters to the Straits Times in December 1994. These letters reflect the Government's view on how the debate should be conducted: the limits to openness, the need for the Government at times to respond robustly to criticisms and why Singaporeans who seek to set out the political agenda should enter the political arena to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the Prime Minister agree that it is a mark of a good citizen that he should keep himself informed of what is going on to contribute constructive criticisms when he can?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, I agree fully.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Would the Prime Minister say whether it is Government policy to try and silence people whose views do not agree with theirs?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said many times that I welcome dissenting views from members of the public. I am also on record as saying that the Government does not believe that it has got a monopoly of ideas and I do welcome debate of a constructive nature on Government policy so that we are in a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> position to distil the best contributions to a particular question for us to make a decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Will it be fair to say that any Singaporean can express his views freely without fear of retribution or persecution?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, every Singaporean is welcomed to make his viewpoint known. But if a viewpoint is against what we believe in, the Government must have the right to rebut. Because if we do not rebut a particular viewpoint which we believe will lead the country to no good, then that viewpoint will catch hold of the population, and the country will be influenced by a wrong viewpoint to our adverse interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Can I ask the Prime Minister whether he has noticed any increase in reluctance on the part of concerned Singaporeans to publicly express their views after the recent series of exchanges in the newspapers and, if so, whether this is desirable?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in no way able to conclude that there has been a decrease in interest in contributing to the debate on Government policy. There is no measure for me to come to that conclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Government adopting double standards? When journalists are very critical of the Opposition, they can take part in politics. But anyone writing in the papers against the Government, he or she will have to answer very serious questions from the Government side and being accused of taking part in politics or not joining an Opposition party to take part in politics. Is there a double standard?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no double standard. If the Opposition Members of Parliament or Opposition parties are criticised by journalists and others, it is for the Opposition Members of Parliament or parties to rebut the criticisms. When the Government is criticised, we reserve the right to rebut and it depends on the nature of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> discussion. There are occasions when we rebut gently. But there must be occasions when we have to rebut robustly. It depends on the particular policy which is being debated and the motive of the person making the criticism of the Government policy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for joining politics or getting them to be in the political arena, again, the position is very clear. The agenda must be set by the Government, and anybody who wants to set the agenda for the country must enter the political fray. Then we are on level ground. You can criticise us, and we would treat you as though you have entered the political arena. If you do not wish to do so, you want to hide in sanctuaries to criticise the Government, to attack the Government, we say, even though you do not want to join a party, we would treat you as though you have entered the political arena. I think that is fair. Because you cannot just criticise without expecting us to reply to you in the same manner which you have attacked us. If you land a blow on our jaw, you must expect a counter-blow on the solar plexus.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, how does the Prime Minister determine the motive of a writer who has published a certain article in the press and decide what sort of rebuttal, whether it is gentle or something else?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> You will know when the blow lands on you, whether it is gentle or robust. But there are many people who write to the press and many of these do not attract our attention. We do not spend our time trying to give reply to every point of view in the newspapers. We have to give priority to certain matters. There are times when letters to the press or criticisms deserve reply, and they will get the reply; and not all replies need to be of an adversarial nature. Very often, it can be a constructive debate, and we do want to involve Singaporeans in a constructive debate in order to yield facts and information to allow us to make the right decision for Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I have a clarification from the Prime Minister? I think Singaporeans would like to have this matter clarified.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he say that one must be in a political party before one can take part in political comments or criticisms of Government policy? Is that the position? No well-known person in Singapore can criticise Government policies?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam has misunderstood me. You do not have to be a member of a political party before you let your viewpoint be known. You can make commentary occasionally or regularly. But if you wish to change a particular policy in Government and you do take a position, you make criticisms regularly, then, of course, you must expect us to regard you as wanting to influence the political agenda of the country. And if it is a simple matter of constructive debate, you will get a constructive reply. But if you try to undermine the authority of the Government through snide remarks, by mocking the Government, you must expect a very, very hard blow from the Government in return. We return the compliment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, how would concerned citizens know what are the out-of-bound markers? And the second question is, because of not knowing the limits, would some concerned citizens then be reluctant to speak up if these limits are not well known?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not possible to demarcate the boundary clearly. Use your commonsense. On Government policy, ministerial salaries, COEs, and so on, you are free to debate that. No problem, whatsoever. If you are to venture into, say, areas which touch on religious sensitivity, on race, then we would pull you back very early before you cause problem for the ground or for the communities. So, generally, I would say, use your commonsense. And the manner in which you put forward your viewpoint is important. You disagree with us, you put forward your viewpoint in such a way that we know that you are not up to any mischief but merely expressing a different viewpoint. We welcome a debate with you. But if the tone is sarcastic, it aims at undermining respect for the Government, as I said just now, we will return the compliment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Does the Government not realise that there are people or groups of fairly well-known people who do not want to join any political party, but they are concerned Singaporeans and they want to take part in the political process of the country? There are these groups of people. I do not think that they want to undermine the country, but they want to put their views across, maybe fairly strongly. Are these people not shut out from the political process of the country?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is no. If there are such people who do not want to join a political party but, nevertheless, they want to try and get us to move away from certain positions, as I said just now, we will regard them as wanting to change the agenda of the country and we will treat them as though they have joined a political party. They do not have to join a political party. But if you want to change policies, we will treat you as though you have joined a political party. And, again, the nature of the debate, the manner in which we debate with you will depend very much on the tone in which you conduct your criticism. So well-meaning people who put forward their views in a very well-meaning way will receive a very gentle and very well-meaning reply.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Some of these well-meaning people have volunteered themselves to be selected as NMPs. What is the position of the NMPs? Are they allowed to criticise the Government outside this House?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, of course. They could criticise in the House or outside the House. But I would certainly welcome a debate in the House, because then we can join issues face to face and get the matter cleared.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Prime Minister has said that the type of reply will depend on the motive and the tone. Does he agree that these are very subjective?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, I think in many cases they are subjective. We will be in the best position to judge, because when a blow has been landed, we know. We
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> would then have to defend ourselves and rebut the criticism. But more importantly, it is the arguments which are important. From our own experience and from our study of experiences elsewhere, if we find that certain arguments are wrong, they are negative, they are going to lead Singapore to ruin, we are going to challenge that viewpoint. Because if we do not do so, we are abdicating our responsibility in governing Singapore. We are allowing somebody else to actually determine where Singapore should go. We cannot allow that, and we would rebut the criticism. But, as I said, if your worry is the robustness of our reply, then I think most people do not have to worry. We do not normally want to reply robustly unless we have to.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Isn't the stand taken by the Government rather regressive? Because this assumes that the Government is always right and all others are wrong. There are times in which the Government policies may be wrong, and these people who speak up may be right.

  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam has got me wrong. They are encouraged to speak up, as I said in my very first sentence in reply to NMP Walter Woon. There are times when valid points have been made by members of the public and we do give due recognition to the points and we do modify policies or our position, if we think that they are right in their point of view. But if we think they are wrong and we are right, then we have to correct that mistaken viewpoint. And they are free to make their viewpoints known. There is no repression of their viewpoints whatsoever. That is the question which Walter Woon has asked and I have replied that I encourage active constructive debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Even with the assurance of the Prime Minister, there are many intellectuals in Singapore who do not think so. They have points of view to make but for fear of retribution, they have not made these points. How can the

  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure all these intellectuals that they need not fear retribution. They must expect a rebuttal where we disagree with them. A rebuttal is not a retribution.

   <b>HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE SURVEY AND CONSUMER PRICE INDEX</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the new Household Expenditure Survey has been completed and when the new Consumer Price Index based on household income groups as proposed by the Cost Review Committee will be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the latest Household Expenditure Survey has been completed. The Department of Statistics is now in the process of revising the items and the weighting pattern in the CPI basket to incorporate the survey results. The new CPI for the overall population will be released in March this year. Separate CPIs for the lowest 20%, middle 60% and highest 20% of the population, based on household income, will be released in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, when was the data collection of the Household Expenditure Survey completed?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> The survey was conducted over the period October 1992 to September 1993.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> When was the data collection completed?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> The data collection was completed in September 1993.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Why did it take so long for the Department of Statistics to compile the data? Would it not be better if the new CPIs were implemented before April 1994 to reflect the effect of GST?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> The Household Expenditure Survey is a very comprehensive and detailed survey of expenditure patterns. Every member of the Household in the Expenditure Survey has to record down in detail, the items he purchased, how much he paid for it, and so on. So there is a large volume of data involved and therefore the Department of Statistics has taken some time to compile, analyse, and complete the survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister of State mentioned that the data collection was completed in September 1993. So from September 1993 to April 1994, when the GST came into force, you have about six months. Why can you not do it?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> In as far as the collection of data for determining the CPI is concerned, a main objective of the Household Expenditure Survey is to update the basis for computing the CPI for the subsequent years, in fact, for the next five years until the next Household Expenditure Survey. In as far as inflation is concerned, the Member would note that last year the Department of Statistics was actually very heavily involved in monitoring the price increases of consumer goods and hawker food, for instance, consequent on the implementation of GST. So such information was available.

  <div align="center">
   <h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chee Wee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act, which I will refer to as the EEI Act in short. The Bill is to put into effect several tax changes which were announced in the 1994 Budget Statement. It will also make a few technical changes
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to the EEI Act to facilitate the administration of the incentives, and two consequential amendments to bring the EEI Act in line with the Income Tax (Amendment) Act 1994.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now describe each of the proposed amendments in turn.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Tax changes of the 1994 Budget</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first set of amendments are those pertaining to the tax changes announced in the Budget Statement. The changes are in the tax relief period of four existing incentives to make them more attractive. The four incentives are the Expansion of Established Enterprise incentive, the Expanding Service Company incentive, the Export of Services incentive and the Warehousing and Servicing Companies incentive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Expansion of Established Enterprise incentive and the Expanding Service Company incentive seek to encourage companies which are in businesses of very substantial economic benefit to Singapore to expand their operations. Both incentives exempt from tax the incremental profits of the incentive company which are in excess of the agreed pre-expansion level.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Export of Services incentive is granted to companies which export their services in qualifying activities spelt out in the EEI Act to other countries. The incentive company will be exempt from tax on 90% of its qualifying income. The Warehousing and Servicing Companies incentive, as the name suggests, is applicable to companies which operate warehousing facilities or those which provide technical or engineering services. It exempts from tax one-half of the incentive company's qualifying income.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with these four incentives now is that they are not attractive enough to companies. Firstly, the maximum length of the initial tax relief period is only five years which is too short to give companies enough certainty for planning purposes. Secondly, the two expansion incentives, that is, the Expansion of Established Enterprise and the Expanding Service Company incentives, cannot be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> extended beyond the initial tax relief period. That these incentives are unattractive is reflected in the low number of companies which have received these incentives since the incentives were introduced. For example, only four companies have obtained the Expansion of Established Enterprise incentive since 1967, while no company has been given the Expanding Service Company incentive since its inception in 1984.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3, 4, 5 and 13 of the Bill relate to the amendments to address the weaknesses of these incentives. Firstly, they will increase the maximum length of the initial tax relief period of these incentives to 10 years, instead of the current five years. Secondly, they will allow these four incentives to be extended beyond the initial period by further periods of not more than five years each time, subject to a maximum total tax relief period of 20 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Technical amendments</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to the technical amendments which are intended to facilitate the administration of three tax incentives.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Approved Foreign Loan Incentive</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the technical amendments is to the Approved Foreign Loan incentive. In this incentive, the interest on an approved foreign loan will be fully exempt from tax, but only if the Comptroller is satisfied that the exemption will not increase the foreign lender's tax liability in his home country. It is a statutory condition. The intention is to ensure that the foreign lender has sufficient foreign tax credit to benefit from the exemption so that the exemption will not result in the mere transfer of tax revenue to the foreign treasury.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, companies which have been given the Approved Foreign Loan incentive have found the statutory condition administratively onerous to comply with. Clause 6 of the Bill will therefore remove that statutory condition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while we will remove the statutory condition, it is important to continue to have some safeguards to minimise the likelihood of the revenue forgone by
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore going to a foreign treasury. To achieve this, an assessment of whether the foreign lender will have sufficient foreign tax credit to benefit from the exemption will still be made at the point of the application for the incentive. In addition, the amendment will give the Minister an option to grant a concessionary withholding tax rate of, say, 10% or 15%, instead of a full exemption only, on the interest payable on approved foreign loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Approved Royalties Incentive</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Approved Royalties incentive has a similar statutory condition - the Comptroller may exempt approved royalties from tax only if he is satisfied that the home-country tax liability of the non-resident recipient will not increase as a result of the exemption. Clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill will make similar changes to the Approved Royalties incentive, for the same reasons which I have given above.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Investment Allowance</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third set of technical amendments pertains to the way an Investment Allowance, or IA in short, may be used. IA is given for fixed asset investment, and may be used to set off chargeable income. However, the EEI Act has not specified how an IA may be used where a company has various incomes which are taxed at different rates. There is a need to clarify how IA can be used.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments in clauses 9 to 12 are to provide that under normal circumstances, an IA given for an activity where the income is taxed at the normal rate (or normal IA) may only be set-off against income taxed at the normal rate (or normal chargeable income), and an IA given for an activity where the income is taxed at a concessionary rate (or concessionary IA) may only be set-off against income taxed at the concessionary rate (or concessionary chargeable income). Normal IA that cannot be fully absorbed within one year of assessment may be carried forward to be set-off against future normal chargeable income. Similarly, companies may carry forward unabsorbed concessionary IA to set off against future concessionary chargeable income.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unabsorbed normal IA may also be used against concessionary chargeable income, on a dollar for dollar basis, if a company chooses to do so instead of carrying forward the unabsorbed normal IA to be used against its normal chargeable income in subsequent years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, concessionary IA will not be allowed to be used to set off normal chargeable income. This will only be allowed under one situation, which is when the company has ceased to derive concessionary income permanently. And the concessionary IA will be adjusted using a conversion factor in the ratio of the two tax rates. Such adjustment is similar to that provided for in the Income Tax Act vis-a-vis unabsorbed losses arising from activities which enjoy a concessionary tax rate. To give an illustration, an absorbed concessionary IA of $100,000 for an activity taxed at 10% rate will be reduced by a factor of 27/10 when it is used to set off against normal chargeable income.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Consequential amendments</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are two amendments found in clauses 2 and 14 of the EEI Bill which are consequential to the Income Tax (Amendment) Act 1994. These are to provide that the Comptroller may raise additional tax assessments to recover tax only within the time limit allowed under the Income Tax Act, which is six years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the EEI Act will improve and update existing tax incentives for the inflow of foreign investments into Singapore, and encourage local companies to expand and upgrade.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While supporting the Bill, I have some queries for the Minister regarding this legislation which gives tax holidays to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> pioneer companies which produce specific products which could be declared as pioneer products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation is laudable when it was first enacted in 1967. Singapore, at that time, suffered large-scale unemployment. The British were pulling out their troops and Singapore's survival depended on attracting large-scale foreign investments so that factories could be started here to mop up the existing unemployment and to give jobs to the large numbers of school leavers. It was proper at that time to give attractive tax holiday schemes to investors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employment situation has now changed. There is full or over-full employment now. Our banks and other financial institutions have ample funds. The question is: why do we still need to give complete tax holidays or partial tax holidays to foreign companies, sometimes up to 20 years? Perhaps the Minister could enlighten the House why this legislation is still necessary in the light of Singapore's full employment, its economically advanced status and also Singapore itself is investing massive funds abroad, like in China, Vietnam and India. There is no shortage of funds in Singapore today. Is Singapore, on balance, losing out by continuing to give such generous tax-free packages to foreigners? What about the issue of technology transfer? Are these pioneer status foreign companies, while enjoying tax holidays, required to employ Singaporeans or local people in their top level positions and to have a minimum expenditure on their R&amp;D programme? How many such companies are enjoying pioneer status in Singapore today and how much annual turnover are they generating? What are the types of business or companies which Singapore hopes to attract under the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act? Perhaps the Minister could enlighten the House.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> Sir, we have a number of incentives to encourage foreign investments. This particular Bill actually deals with only four incentives: the Expansion of Established Enterprises, the Expanding Service Company, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Export of Services, and the Warehousing and Servicing Companies. These are four specific incentives and they apply to both foreign companies as well as local companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is wrong for Mr Chiam to become complacent, thinking that since everything is good in Singapore, we have full employment, there is no need for us to offer incentives in order to attract foreign investments. We are in a highly competitive world. Many countries are still continuing to compete for foreign investments. I think we must continue to make our incentives attractive enough to attract foreign investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Minister of State has not really answered my questions. What are the types of companies and the type of products which the Government is aiming? I do realise that every country is competing for foreign investments. But you are giving them so many give-aways. In return, what do we hope to get from these companies?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> In the initial years, we focused on attracting labour-intensive industries which could provide jobs. Later on, we upgraded and tried to attract high-value added operations and more capital-intensive type of operations to Singapore. And that has been our policy in recent years. High-value added industries can cover quite a whole range of industries in the industrial sector. Of course, we have been attracting electronic and petroleum companies. But any industry or company which can add value to Singapore and which can provide good jobs to Singaporeans will be welcomed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Other than petroleum companies, what are the other companies that are enjoying pioneer status in Singapore today?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> Pioneer status incentive applies to all sectors. That means all industries or investments can apply for the incentive. Of course, they must meet certain conditions. We do not say that this incentive only applies to, say, electronics or petroleum companies. It applies to all industries. But in evaluating whether we should give them incentives, whether it is pioneer incentive or other
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> incentives, we consider the value to Singapore. We consider their investment. We consider what sort of employment they are providing to Singaporeans. All these are taken into consideration.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What sort of turnover are these companies generating every year? Can the Minister of State name a figure?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> We do not specify the minimum turnover for companies to enjoy the benefits and we have actually a whole range of incentive schemes. It does not mean that every company that comes to Singapore will be given pioneer status. Depending on the type of investment, we will evaluate them and decide on which type of incentive tof be accorded to them.
  <br>

   <b>FACTORIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>3.22 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House seeks to amend the Factories Act to improve safety and health standards at factories and other workplaces. The Bill also seeks to expand the scope of the Act to cover more workplaces. I shall now highlight the major changes introduced through this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the Factories Act to expand the interpretation of "factory" to include, among other things, warehouses and industrial testing laboratories. Such premises are presently not covered. It is quite clear that activities carried out in warehouses and industrial testing laboratories may expose workers to safety and health hazards similar to those present in manufacturing factories. For instance, workers in warehouses are exposed to hazards from falling materials and material handling equipment, while those working in the testing laboratories are exposed to toxic, corrosive or inflammable substances. With the amendment, the safety and health provisions of the Act will apply to warehouses and industrial testing laboratories, thus enhancing workers' safety in these premises.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 also amends the Act to delete existing section 6(5), which excludes from the Act factories in which less than 10 persons are employed and no mechanical power or dangerous substances are used. With the amendment, the safety and health provisions of the Act will be extended to workers working in these small factories. These factories, however, will not be required to meet all the existing registration requirements which
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are meant for factories with more workers and equipment. For instance, it will not be necessary for an occupier of a factory with less than 10 workers to comply with the requirement of submitting a layout plan to the Chief Inspector of Factories when he applies to register the factory. Hence, the Chief Inspector will be given the power to simplify the registration requirements in respect of these factories. This is provided for under clause 4 of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends the Act to stipulate technical standards on natural and mechanical ventilation provided at workplaces. Here, we have adopted criteria laid down in Singapore's Building Control Regulations and internationally recognised standards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 amends the Act to allow any person, instead of only a male, who meets the necessary requirements to carry out examination, lubrication or other operation on unfenced machinery.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 14 to 17 amend sections 36 to 39 of the Act to apply the same requirements of test and examination on different types of pressure vessels such as steam boilers, steam receivers and air receivers. Also, a new provision is introduced to require the authorised inspector to inform the Chief Inspector immediately if the examination shows that the pressure vessel is unsafe for use. This will enable corrective action to be initiated immediately.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as more toxic chemicals are now being used in factories, an increasing number of workers may be exposed to chemical hazards. The Ministry, therefore, proposes to introduce additional measures to better protect the health of these workers. Clause 22 of the Bill seeks to amend the Act to introduce new measures to protect workers against toxic dust, fumes and other contaminants. These measures include requiring processes that generate such contaminants to be carried out in isolated areas or in closed vessels or systems. Clause 22 also enacts a new section 60A in the Act, to require factory occupiers to obtain from their suppliers of hazardous substances
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> material safety data sheets (MSDS) and take appropriate precautionary measures based on information contained in the MSDS. In addition, clause 24 empowers the Minister to prohibit the use of certain chemicals or processes that may pose serious health risks to workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 31 creates a new section 76A to extend certain provisions of the Act as specified in section 76A(2) to works carried out in an airport for repairing, servicing, cleaning, loading and unloading or refuelling of aircraft. However, where a provision specified in section 76A(2) refers to machinery or plant, section 76(A)(3) will exempt the application of such a provision as long as the machinery or plant is part of the aircraft and is the property of the owner of the aircraft. For instance, section 21(1) mentioned in section 76A(2) refers to the guarding of transmission machinery, and section 22, sub-sections (1) and (2) refer to the guarding of other machinery. "Guarding" in this connection refers to protective devices over any moving parts. These sections will not apply to such machinery if it is part of the aircraft. This is because it is impracticable to require the fencing of or modification to these mechanical parts of an aircraft which are already regulated by the civil aviation authorities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, I would like to thank Mr Charles Chong and officials of the SIA Engineering Company Engineers and Executives Union for drawing my attention to section 76A(3). They were concerned that the exemption is too wide and could give rise to situations where workers will be exposed to unnecessary hazards. I have therefore re-examined the section closely and concluded that it is necessary, as I have explained earlier, to provide for such an exemption. I would also like to point out that such an exemption is not new. Similar exemption already exists under the current Act in section 74(4). Essentially, section 74(4) exempts "machinery or plant which is on board a ship and is the property of the owner". The reason for such exemption is not to cause unnecessary modifications to ships and aircraft calling at our port and airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, I would like to clarify that where a provision specified in section 76A(2) does not refer to machinery or plant, it will not be given any exemption as a result of this amendment. For example, section 33, sub-sections (2), (5) and (7) refer to openings in floors, ladders and work conducted at an elevated platform, or work at heights. As these sections do not refer to machinery or plant, which is part of the aircraft belonging to the owner of the aircraft, they would apply even in relation to work carried out on such machinery or plant. To put it in another way, a worker working on a machinery or plant belonging to the owner of the aircraft will still be protected by the Act because, in the process of working on such a machinery or plant, should the worker have to use a ladder or erect a scaffolding in order to reach a particular machinery or plant, then all the safety precautions pertaining to the erection of the scaffolding or ladder or work platform will still apply because the exemption is only for machinery or plant which is part of the aircraft belonging to the owner of the aircraft, whereas all the other fixtures that are necessary for the worker to gain access to this particular machinery or plant should be governed by the Factories Act and all safety regulations will still apply.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 32 amends section 77 to extend the power of the Minister to make regulations on work involving the use of pesticides, maintenance and repair of roads, lift maintenance and any other process or operation which poses safety and health hazards to workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 33 enhances the powers of the factory inspector to enable him to:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) take samples of any substance found in a factory;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) monitor the workplace for various health hazards, such as excessive noise and heat, and harmful substances; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) require any hospital to provide information of any person who is injured in an accident and is receiving treatment at the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the maximum fine for any contravention of the Factories Act which
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> results in the death of, or serious bodily injury to, any person, is $25,000. This fine was first introduced in October 1979, more than 15 years ago. Furthermore, no distinction is made between a contravention which results in death and that which results in serious bodily injury. To differentiate the seriousness of any contravention that results in death, especially multiple deaths, it is proposed that the maximum fine for such a contravention be raised to $50,000 where there is one fatality, and $200,000 where there are two or more fatalities. Clause 35 of the Bill seeks to amend the Act to make these changes. The maximum term of imprisonment will, however, remain at one year for both types of contravention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many provisions of the Factories Act which require factory occupiers to provide safe machinery and equipment are written in general terms. What constitutes safe machinery and equipment is not spelt out in detail. Clause 36 of this Bill introduces a new provision in the Act to require that the relevant Singapore Standards or Codes of Practice published by the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research be taken into consideration in determining whether a machine, apparatus, appliance or equipment is safe.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Chief Inspector is empowered to compound any offence under the Act for a sum not exceeding $200. Composition has proven to be an effective way to deal with less serious violations as the punishment is meted out almost immediately. It has led to many offenders taking prompt action to rectify the unsafe conditions found at their workplaces. To enhance the effectiveness of this enforcement option, the Ministry proposes that the maximum composition fine be raised to $1,000. This amendment is in clause 38 of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also contains other amendments which are made for the purpose of bringing the Act up-to-date. They are mostly of a technical nature or consequential amendments. Explanations for these amendments are in the Explanatory Statement of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill which will make further provisions for securing the health, safety and welfare of our workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new amendments will expand the scope of the Factories Act. It is of utmost importance that our workers work in safe and healthy work environments so that they can concentrate their efforts to improve productivity and quality. We have to therefore constantly monitor the safety standards and procedures in the various factories, shipyards and other working areas to ensure that workers' health and safety will always be given priority.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1993 and 1994, many accidents had occurred, especially in shipyards, resulting in loss of lives and injuries to our workers. Various Committees of Inquiry were established to investigate into the accidents, why they had happened and who were responsible. They had made various recommendations to improve safety in the working environment in these workplaces. However, accidents continued to occur in shipyards in 1993 and 1994. While legislation will indeed help to ensure that our factories and workplaces will be safe and healthy, I think there are also other measures that need to be implemented. Of course, stiffer penalties will act as a deterrent and will also wake up management to improve their safety practices and procedures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that our top management and workers have a strong commitment to safety. Management must periodically review the safety standards and procedures in their companies. For example, there must be annual audits of the company's safety plans and procedures. Training of their employees is important and they must ensure that their employees are adequately trained on safe work practices. This is particularly important in companies where there are many foreign workers and sub-contractor workers. Here it is important that these workers be given special training in work safety in a language which can enable
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> them to benefit from training. And as part of the safety measure, no one should be allowed to take a job in a workplace which is considered hazardous without undergoing a safety course conducted by the Ministry of Labour. On the part of the workers, I think we have, at the unions, encouraged that they have a healthy attitude towards safety. They cannot afford to have a casual attitude towards safety.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will help to enhance the safety and well-being of workers. However, Government, employers and workers must always be vigilant and alert to take action against unsafe and unhealthy work practices. In this way, health and safety of our workers will always be accorded top priority.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Factories (Amendment) Bill, I must say, is a necessary piece of legislation as it ties up loose ends and simplifies administrative and enforcement procedures. For example, the ship-repair and related activities, which have been responsible for some bad accidents in recent years, are brought more squarely within the ambit of the principal Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that the Bill strengthens the provisions of the principal Act in protecting the life and limb of factory workers. For example, the Bill includes excessive noise as a hazard to be safeguarded against and relates the penalty for contravention of the Act to the severity of the consequences.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have three comments to make on the Bill. The first concerns clause 6 of the Bill which repeals and re-enacts section 14 of the principal Act dealing with ventilation. The underlying presumption of the proposed section 14 seems to be that the atmospheric air will be the source of fresh air. What will happen if this source is polluted by the haze we experienced during the months of July to October last year? I hope the Minister's reply is not that the proposed section 14(4) will come into play.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concerns clause 21 which repeals and re-enacts section 58 on "First-aid" and clause 22 which repeals and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> re-enacts, among others, section 60 on "Toxic substances". These provisions are satisfactory in themselves except they are silent on the need to familiarise workers with the safety aspect of these provisions. First-aid facilities and handling directions for toxic substances by themselves may not enable workers to deal with an emergency arising from a spillage of toxic substances. It may be necessary to provide for the periodic conduct of emergency drills, on the line of fire drills for high rise buildings, boat drills on passenger ships and life-jacket drills on commercial flights. A slight disruption to the production schedule of a factory will be justified by the workers gaining hands-on experience of dealing with an emergency situation, which may occur despite the provisions of this Bill and the principal Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third comment is that tightening the provisions of the principal Act will not by itself ensure a safe system of work. Factory owners and operators must apply these provisions not only to the letter but also in the spirit they have been made, that is, ensuring the safety of factory workers. Two events speak for themselves. The Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the fire and explosion at Sembawang Bethlehem Pte Ltd on 9th August 1994 showed that safety rules had not been observed. The Jurong Shipyard was recently fined the maximum of $25,000 for flouting the principal Act in a flash fire on board the British Adventure with a loss of ten lives on 8th February 1994.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, the Minister is to be commended for moving this comprehensive and important amendment to the Bill and I support the Bill. But I have some comments and queries for the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 10, which amends section 23, it is highly commendable that the requirement of the person who carries out the examination and lubrication of unfenced machinery is now not limited only to a male. Thank you for being gender sensitive. However, I am puzzled at setting the minimum age at 20. What is the rationale for this? It is not even the age of majority. Secondly, who gives the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> training to this person who carries out the examination, and do we have a uniform and accepted system of training? And also, is there continuing education as machines change with technology advancing?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 35 amends section 89 to raise the maximum fine to $200,000 for a contravention of the Act which results in the death of two or more persons. Why do two deaths have to occur to incur this maximum fine? In the original Act, the reference is only to the "death of any person". Why have we increased this to two deaths in the amendment? Is not one death already a death too many? So I think we should change this amendment to "death of any person" instead of "death of two or more persons".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 40, why are we replacing "maximum permissible working pressure" with the words "safe working pressure"? Should not the maximum permissible working pressure be a safe working pressure? Which of the two is more safe?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in view of the recent spate of shipyard accidents resulting in many deaths, can the Minister assure the House that the new amendment will minimise the causes that led to these very accidents? Singapore cannot afford a reputation of unsafe labour practices resulting in the unnecessary loss of human life.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr John De Payva:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I also rise in support of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any effort to enhance safety is always welcomed as a safer working environment will eventually minimise the number of unnecessary fatalities amongst workers. These fatalities are preventable if only more detailed attention is given to safety regulations and procedures. Experience has shown that without deterrent sentences being imposed, some management tend to give safety very low priority. Hence the provision in the Bill for a fine of up to $200,000 or a jail term or both, if two or more workers died on the job, is not excessive.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous seminars and forums have been organised by the Ministry of Labour, NTUC and other authorities, but yet some worksites fail to put in place a proper safety management system. In this connection, I would like to reiterate the labour movement's call to get all companies, regardless of their size, especially those in the heavy industry, to submit annual safety plans. We are of the view that such a measure would compel those managements with indifferent attitude to take the appropriate action to beef up safety requirements at their workplace. Would the Ministry of Labour look into this suggestion and consider implementing it?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, a major concern is the fact that most fatal workplace accidents involve contract workers, the majority of whom are low-educated and lower skilled. This group of workers cannot be ignored if we want to create a safer working environment. Legislation after legislation is not enough to maintain or improve safety standards until and unless people in the workplace are trained and committed to observe safety procedures. In this respect, I would like to suggest that contractors and sub-contractors be compelled to show that they have a good safety system in their place before they are allowed to tender for contracts in heavy industries such as shipyards and construction sites, aprons, or even parking bays of airports.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the labour movement has also hailed the recent directives of the Ministry of Labour requiring shipyards not only to have a safety management system but also to have it audited. I am confident this will go a long way towards reducing industrial accident rates. However, this requirement is only confined to the shipyard and construction industries. In my view, such a requirement should be extended to cover other industries in keeping with the overall objective of keeping our worksites safer and healthier. What I would like to know is whether the Ministry of Labour intends to move towards this direction. In other words, make it mandatory, in particular the heavy industry, to have a safety management system and auditing system.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about safety, it is worthwhile reminding ourselves that safety is everybody's business. Commitment to safety must start from the CEO and top management of a company who must demonstrate it very clearly in words and deeds so that they could set examples for their workers to follow. In other words, a company should and must have a comprehensive written safety policy that incorporates the CEO's statement of commitment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I once again support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to thank all the Members who have spoken up in support of the amendment to the Factories Act, and I will respond to the queries and questions raised by them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me respond to Mr Othman Haron Eusofe's point about safety in the shipyard. Like everybody else, we in the Ministry of Labour are equally concerned with the spate of accidents in the shipyard and we have taken particular measures to try to reduce such accidents. The Committee of Inquiry mentioned by Mr Othman Haron Eusofe is just one of the measures when we look into the details of a particular accident and arising from it, try to learn the lessons so as to avoid a recurrence of similar accidents in the future. We have also made all the recommendations of the Committees of Inquiry part of the shipyards' safety regulations. We have made it mandatory for shipyards to comply with the recommendations of the various Committees of Inquiry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is quite unfortunate that we have had a series of serious accidents in shipyards that killed quite a number of workers, if we look at the overall picture, the number of accidents in the industry has actually been declining. For instance, between 1993 and 1994, the number of accidents has dropped from 4,257 to 4,003 in 1994. This is the overall accident rate. If you look at the severity of accidents, the number of fatal accidents has dropped from 77 in 1993 to 53 in 1994.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me say, Mr Speaker, this statistical trend which shows that the number of accidents is declining, and the number
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of fatalities and severity of accidents are going down is really no cause for complacency. The most important thing is that despite all the measures that have been taken so far, from time to time we are still encountering totally unnecessary preventable accidents. And the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that such accidents should be kept to the barest minimum, if not, totally eradicated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Othman Haron Eusofe also spoke on the training of workers, particularly foreign workers and sub-contractor workers, ie, workers who are less well educated and lower skilled, which Mr John Payva has also mentioned. I agree that this is an important area and we have in fact made it mandatory for such workers to undergo proper safety orientation before they can commence working. For instance, there is a Construction Safety Orientation Course. There is also a Shipyard Safety Instruction Course. Workers in these sectors must complete these courses before they can commence working in the worksites in the construction industry or in the shipyards. When we conduct such training courses, we take note of the fact that a large number of these workers are in fact foreign workers and may not understand English all that well, or they may only speak their own native languages. So, in fact, our safety courses are conducted in English, in our four national languages, even in dialects, if necessary, in Thai, and in Bengali for many of the workers who come from Bangladesh. So we do tailor-make our safety orientation courses to the language that the worker is most familiar with.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for sub-contractor workers, I think it is a responsibility of their supervisor and employer, ie, the sub-contractor himself, to ensure that they comply with the safety rules, the procedures or the safety management system installed by the company in which the sub-contractor is working, whether it is for a particular shipyard or whether he is a sub-contractor or a main contractor in a construction site.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also provided training for the safety supervisors for shipyards and contractors. We will continue with our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> training and educational efforts in order to raise the awareness of workers on the proper safety procedures, the safe way to work in whichever industry. However, I believe that at the end of the day, we need more than just legislation. We need management's total commitment to safety. We also need workers' understanding and appreciation of the need to comply with the safety regulations of the company because sometimes we see reports of accidents happening where workers in fact caused or contributed to the accidents through sheer negligence and blatant disregard for safety regulations. So there is a substantial need for workers to also play their part. In this respect, my Ministry is working closely with NTUC in order to initiate some programmes whereby we will be able to work with the union branches or the union officials in the particular industry, especially in the shipyards, to alert the workers to their contribution towards safety management in the company, their role and responsibility in helping the company to maintain a safe working place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in response to Mr Chin Harn Tong who spoke on the repealing of section 14 by clause 6 to introduce new standards for natural or mechanical ventilation, I think the point here is that the source of air must of course be the atmospheric air. There is really no other way. Short of insisting on purifying natural atmospheric air, we cannot really improve on the quality. And even if we do, we are only affecting the air quality for a small proportion of the total population, which has no option but to breathe the air that we are living in. So his reference to atmospheric pollution is taken note of. The Ministry of the Environment will be working very hard to ensure that our ambient air is of good breathable quality. There is nothing much that we can do within the Factories Act itself to specify that quality of air. What we are specifying is to ensure that within the workplace itself, there is sufficient ventilation, mechanical or otherwise, to ensure that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the workers are enjoying good quality air and they are not subjected to working in a polluted atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the need of getting workers to be familiar with first-aid drills and other measures to prevent the contamination of the work area by dust and other toxic material, we have already, in this amendment, required the management to obtain all the safety instructions or precautions necessary by way of obtaining the material safety data sheets (MSDS) which I referred to earlier on. There is an obligation on the management to ensure that the safety precautions which are clearly spelt out in the MSDS should always be complied with in the place of work. So in that sense, I think workers will become familiar with the dangers associated with the kind of materials or chemicals or substances that they are working with and they should therefore comply with all the safety precautions. They would also be familiar with the measures to be taken in case of an emergency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Chin that, apart from tightening up the provisions in the Factories Act, it is important that factory operators follow the spirit of the Factories Act which is really to ensure that our workers can continue to enjoy working in a safe and healthy environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the comments raised by Dr Soin on the age of 20 for workers who are authorised to make inspections on unfenced machinery and such likes, ie, examination, lubrication or other operations of unfenced machinery? The age of 20 is basically to ensure that such workers have a certain number of years of working experience. As you know, in our system, people may go into an industrial employment at the age of 16 because after their 'O' level, some of them may well leave school and go on to such a job. But we think that a young worker, with hardly a few years of experience, is not an appropriate person to do such work because in checking on some unfenced machinery where there are exposed moving parts, you need to be more experienced, more matured and more careful. So the age of 20 has nothing to do with the age of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> majority. It is just an estimate, a subjective assessment of how many years of experience would be necessary before a worker has sufficient maturity and a sense of responsibility to be allowed to carry out such job safely for himself and for his co-workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 35, I take the point that one death is already one too many. That is why I said in my earlier response that even though the statistical trend is favourable, we are still very concerned and we will implement and impose any measure necessary to minimise accidents. She will notice that the amendment is, in fact, to raise the penalty even when there is a case of one death. It will be increased from $25,000 to $50,000. We are just saying that in the case of total disregard for safe practices resulting in an accident that causes multiple deaths, we think we should signal that this is more serious and that the employer or the operator should be subjected to a much heavier penalty of $200,000. It is in no way trying to minimise the impact of just having one death.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on clause 40, "safe working pressure" is in fact a much more dependable and reliable measure than the old terminology of "maximum permissible working pressure" because I think safe working pressure is precisely what it means, ie, the condition under which a particular pressure vessel, whether it is a steam boiler, compressed air receiver or underfired vulcaniser, can be operated without any risk to its worker. Maximum working pressure means you are reaching the maximum limit. The margin for error is henceforth much less. We prefer to choose a more conservative and safer approach to it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member's question whether the amendments will reduce or minimise the causes of accidents. That is our intention, that is our hope. But, of course, on their own, the amendments themselves may not achieve this. We need, and we seek, the cooperation of employers and, as I mentioned earlier on, workers also. To reduce accidents, it requires total effort on the part of the legislator, the employer and the workers. Everybody must contribute. Everybody has something to lose if an accident happens, most
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of all the worker who is at the frontline. So we hope that workers will pay greater attention to the safety requirements of their company and, at the same time, employers will invest more in terms of providing a better, a safer and a healthier working environment for their workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the comments by Mr John De Payva. I have responded to his comment on contract worker with low skill and low education. I think this is an area that we will continue to provide the right kind of safety orientation and safety training to ensure that they are adequately prepared to work in the hazardous industries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we can compel contractors to have a good safety record before they can tender for a certain job, in so far as private sector employers are concerned, I understand that some companies, particularly those dealing with very hazardous activities, for instance, oil refinery, do have corporate policies where they would bar contractors from tendering for any service, repair or maintenance work with them, if the contractors have been shown to have a poor safety record. So companies on their own are already adopting this approach because they are conscious of the need to maintain good housekeeping and good safety management. So they would want to keep out contractors who do not comply with their requirements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will encourage as many factory operators as possible to adopt this approach. But I think there would be difficulty in implementing this purely by force of law. We have been discussing with CIDB whether it is possible to ensure that in the CIDB registration for building contractors, we should incorporate a criterion on the safety record of the contractor. So the Government, as the registering body for building contractors, will be examining whether, in future, before a contractor can be registered with CIDB under its various categories, it has in fact got a good safety record. And if a contractor persistently has a bad safety record and a lot of accidents has been happening in the particular contractor's work site, we could consider either not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> allowing him to be registered or debarring him from tendering for Government contracts. This is an idea that my Ministry has taken up with the CIDB and we will be examining the feasibility of implementing such a criterion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also worked with the Association of Singapore Marine Industry (this is an association of the shipyard industry) to encourage them to draw up some pre-qualification among their members for contractors tendering for work within a shipyard and to look into the safety record as one of the factors in assessing the suitability of such contractors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should expand the system of safety audit to other industries, let us look at it from a broader view. As it is, apart from the shipyards and the building industry which are already required by our regulation to have safety audit, all other factories, including the heavy industries, are already subjected to regular inspection by the factory inspectors. Special attention is paid at these inspections on the hazardous equipment, such as lifting equipment and pressure vessels. This equipment, in fact, is required to be inspected periodically by competent engineers. For instance, a boiler, or lifting device, like crane, has to be inspected annually and certified to be safe and fit for use.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, whenever there is a change in the layout of the factory, or whenever there is an installation of new equipment that changes the operational procedure within a factory, the operators are required to inform the Ministry of Labour about such changes. So safety precautions will be looked into at that point in time before they can commence work. These regulations will enable the Ministry to monitor closely and regularly the safety conditions in factories, thus, to a large extent, achieving the objective of the annual safety plan proposed by Mr John De Payva and Mr Othman Haron Eusofe.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, in the case of shipyards, those that are employing 200 workers or more are required to appoint external
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> auditors to audit their safety management system annually. And for the construction industry, we require them to conduct an audit once every six months, if the contract sum exceeds $30 million. So with this auditing requirement for the two most hazardous industries, we believe that it would have contributed greatly to minimising the accidents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that I have dealt with all the points raised by Members. Once again, I want to thank them for supporting the Factories (Amendment) Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Point of clarification, Mr Speaker. The Minister did not answer my query about the training given to the people who do the examination of unfenced machinery.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the training of the workers in dealing with a particular piece of machinery would have to be the responsibility of the operator. Whatever machinery that is installed by the operator before it can actually commence operation in the factory, or before it can be licensed or certified by the Factory Inspectorate, they will have to inform the Factory Inspectorate of the process that is going on in the factory. We will then ensure that the working condition and the process that they are going to operate are safe and that they have complied with the requirements for the particular operation. For instance, if you need to train a worker to do a particular job, it is really the responsibility and onus of the employer to ensure that the worker is properly trained. Likewise, whether it is to inspect an unfenced machinery or to operate a lifting device, you have to provide the training. With the exception of certain statutory requirements like a steam boiler, or pressure vessel, there are clear-cut statutory requirements on what kind of training is required before you can operate. They have certificates like Boiler Certificates which will categorise the skill of the worker and allow him to operate a particular type of boiler up to a certain capacity. So there are some specifications which are listed in the regulations. There are many other areas of work, particularly
  <br>

  <br> in the inspection and maintenance of machinery which must be the responsibility of the operator to provide the training.

  <b>The Acting Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of the Architects (Amendment) Bill is to liberalise the requirements for licensing consultancy companies. The Bill seeks to amend two provisions of the Architects Act, namely:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) it seeks to remove the professional-shareholding requirement for architectural consultancy companies; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) it seeks to allow persons other than allied professionals to be appointed as directors of consultancy companies, subject to the Chairman and not less than two-thirds of the directors being allied professionals registered in Singapore.

   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>
  </div>
  <br>4.16 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Architects Act was enacted in 1991 to replace the previous Architects Act of 1976. Among the new provisions, the 1991 Act provides a new legislative framework for the licensing of architectural consultancy companies to provide architectural services. Section 20(1) of the Act requires such consultancy companies to comply with the following four licensing conditions:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, not less than two-thirds of the shareholding of the consultancy company must be beneficially owned by allied professionals. Allied professionals here refer to architects, professional engineers and land surveyors registered under their respective Acts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, only allied professionals can be appointed to the board of directors of the consultancy company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the professional services supplied must be under the control and management of the appropriate allied professionals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the consultancy company which is incorporated as a limited liability company must have at least $1 million paid-up capital and it is required to take out professional indemnity insurance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of the two-third professional-shareholding requirement is to ensure that the licensed consultancy companies are majority owned by allied professionals. This was incorporated in the Act to address the concern among some allied professionals of the possible erosion of professional standards if these consultancy companies were under the control of persons other than allied professionals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the drafting of the 1991 Act, the Ministry of National Development looked at the multi-discipline corporate practices of several developed countries, including the USA, the UK, Canada and Australia. Some of these countries have liberalised their regulations on their architectural consultancy companies, including not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> having any requirement on professional-shareholding of their architectural consultancy companies. However, the Ministry of National Development felt that it was better to take an approach of gradual liberalisation given that the introduction of consultancy companies and the formation of multi-disciplinary practice were already considered a major change in the manner of providing professional services in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the enactment of the Act in 1991, a total of 16 architectural consultancy companies have been licensed. Consultancy companies have become an accepted vehicle for the provision of architectural services here. The architectural profession should be ready for further liberalisation of the conditions governing consultancy companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposal to relax the shareholding restriction was prompted by the needs of the profession in an evolving business environment. Construction projects in Singapore are becoming larger and more complex in scope requiring the inputs of several professional disciplines. Clients may desire a complete package of related services under one roof, rather than having to deal with different professional firms. As the business environment becomes more competitive, consultancy companies may have to tie up with others to render such wide scope of services, or to expand and develop them in-house.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the opening up of China, India, Vietnam and other countries in the region, quite a number of our architectural consultancy companies are venturing to these countries in search of business opportunities. To clinch deals, these consultancy companies are often required to take up equity stakes in the development projects in order to assure developers and clients of their commitment. Overseas projects are often large developments. Clients of such projects may expect a complete range of services, including financing, master planning, design and construction. As such, these companies are finding it
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> increasingly necessary to expand their capital base to finance their overseas business ventures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the professional-shareholding requirement, a consultancy company's ability to expand its capital base is limited by the financial resources it can muster from its professional shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional-shareholding requirement is not an essential precondition for professionalism. Professionalism of a consultancy company depends on the competence and ability of its individual professionals in upholding high standards of professionalism. There are also provisions in the Act and its Rules to regulate the practice of individual professionals. Moreover, the company's licence can be withdrawn, or will not be renewed if the company's professional conduct is found unsatisfactory.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I now come to the second amendment. Currently, only allied professionals can be appointed as directors of consultancy companies licensed under the Act. As I have explained earlier, the removal of the professional shareholding requirement is to allow consultancy companies to grow by raising equity capital from investors other than allied professionals. In line with this, the Bill proposes to allow persons other than allied professionals to be appointed to the board of directors. However, to maintain substantially the professional character of these companies, the relaxation will be subject to the Chairman and not less than two-thirds of the directors being allied professionals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consultancy companies in many developed countries are not hobbled by professional-shareholding requirements or restrictions on their capital base and board composition. The Architects (Amendment) Bill is necessary to allow our consultancy companies to grow and to compete on a level playing field internationally.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I declare that I am a practising architect.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. The rationale of the amendment to the Architects Act is appropriate and timely, as the present-day professional practice is very much interwoven with the business environment. Changes have to be made so that the scope can be expanded and regulations amended to accommodate the rapid changing conditions and demands. Specially in the light of our ever expanding regionalisation drive, corporatising of the professional service is necessary so that we can have sufficient capital base to service the ever increasing demand of the commercial interest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like the Minister to enlighten me on a certain clause in the amendment that appears to have some ambiguity. I am referring to clause 4(1) which states:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It shall be a condition of every licence granted to any corporation or partnership that the corporation or partnership shall supply architectural services in Singapore only under the control and management of a registered architect ...'
  <br>
  <br>Then under paragraph (b)(ii), it states:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`in the case of an unlimited corporation which has a share capital, a director and registered owner of at least one share of the corporation;'
  <br>
  <br>Sir, if the intention of the corporation which supplies architectural service requires the control and management to be under a registered architect, I cannot reconcile how the registered person who owns only one share of the corporation be in control of the management. Under company law, the control and management of a corporation is always under the majority shareholder. I therefore request that a provision be introduced to clearly state that the registered person, even if he is not a major shareholder, in a corporation that offers architectural service be given a special voting or management right so that he or she can be in control of the management of the corporation, so as to be consistent with the intention contained in clause 4(1) of the amendment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the intention of clause 4 is to make sure that we separate the business practices from the professional practices. In the business practices, the company may have non-professionals as part of the shareholders. But in the supply of architectural services, clause 4 insists that in the supply of such services, this must be under the control and management of a registered architect who is resident in Singapore and has in force a practising certificate. Sub-clause (2) goes on to explain the different types of companies under such a condition. In the case of an unlimited corporation, the person who is controlling or managing the project not only has to be a registered architect ordinarily resident in Singapore and has in force a practising certificate but also be a director and a registered owner with at least one share. So sub-clause (2) is reinforced. In an unlimited corporation where the risk to all the persons involved in the corporation is unlimited, then the one who is supplying the services not only must be an architect but also has at least one share in the unlimited corporation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of the Professional Engineers (Amendment) Bill is similar to that of the Architects (Amendment) Bill, ie, to liberalise the requirements for licensing consultancy companies. The Bill seeks to amend two provisions of the Professional Engineers Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it seeks to remove the professional-shareholding requirement for professional engineering consultancy companies; and, second, it seeks to allow persons other than allied professionals to be appointed as directors of consultancy companies, subject to the Chairman and not less than two-thirds of the directors being allied professionals registered in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the rationale for moving this Bill is exactly the same as that for the Architects (Amendment) Bill. As with the Architects Act, the same four licensing requirements for corporate practice are also provided under section 20(1) of the Professional Engineers Act, which was enacted in 1991. Again, for the same reason, in 1991, the Ministry of National Development decided on a gradual approach to liberalise the licensing requirements for professional engineering companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 40 licensed professional engineering consultancy companies now in practice, consultancy companies are now an accepted vehicle for provision of professional engineering services. The engineering profession is now ready for further liberalisation of the conditions governing consultancy companies.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the Architects (Amendment) Bill, this Bill seeks to amend the Professional Engineers Act to allow appointment of non-professionals as directors of consultancy companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also seeks to amend section 10(5) of the Professional Engineers Act to restrict the offering to supply of professional engineering services to only registered professional engineers or allied professionals. Currently, the restriction is on the supply of professional engineering services. This amendment will bring the Professional Engineers Act in line with the Architects Act.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong</b> asked the Minister for Finance what is the total amount of Goods and Services Tax collected from April to December 1994.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of GST collected from April to December 1994 is $1.11 billion. However, this figure pertains only to gross collection less any refunds made up to December 1994. It does not include $62.9 million worth of claims for input tax refunds, which are being processed by IRAS. After allowing for this potential refund amount of $62.9 million, the estimated GST revenue is $1.047 billion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST collection for 1994 has already exceeded the estimate of $960 million quoted in the 1994 Budget Statement, because of unexpected high economic growth. The $960 million was estimated based on the Private Consumption Expenditure (PCE) figures of 1992, adjusted to 1993 and 1994 levels. The estimate assumed nominal GDP growth rates of 7.5% for 1993 and 8% for 1994. Actual nominal growth rate in 1993 turned out to be much higher at 13%, while Ministry of Trade and Industry has projected nominal growth in 1994 to be around 14 - 15%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the coin, the value of the GST rebate/offset package has also increased substantially beyond the $1.2 billion estimate announced in the 1994 Budget Statement. This is because the reductions in personal and corporate income taxes are highly buoyant, that is, their value increases sharply with higher GDP growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government remains committed to implementing GST in a revenue negative manner in the short run, and in a revenue neutral manner in the long run.

  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1993, I mentioned that 800 more teachers would be needed in our secondary schools in 1994 with the implementation of the Improved Education System. This estimate was based on the assumption that all pupils who sat for the PSLE in October 1993 would proceed to Secondary 1 in 1994. However, this was not so as about 4,500 pupils did not perform well in the PSLE and had to remain in primary schools or be channelled to vocational training at ITE. As a result, the additional number of teachers required in secondary schools was revised downwards to about 650.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the Ministry managed to recruit a total of 678 teachers for deployment to secondary schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry mounted the first exercise to recruit polytechnic graduates for primary school teaching in 1994. A total of 75 polytechnic graduates accepted the offer and are currently undergoing teacher training at the National Institute of Education.

  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police have been actively dealing with the problem of illegal games saloons in Singapore. Last year, the Police intensified its enforcement actions and carried out some 3,000 checks against illegal saloons. This resulted in the seizure of about 1,800 illegal game machines and the arrest and prosecution of 663 persons who operated and patronised these illegal saloons. Of these, 119 were operators and 544 were patrons. Summons actions were also taken against another 170 persons under the Public Entertainment Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these enforcement actions, Police estimated that there are now less than 50 active saloons which operate sporadically changing their locations and hours of operation to avoid detection. Police will spare no effort to track down and act against these remaining saloons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is monitoring the situation closely and will consider amending our laws to provide for greater deterrent sentence should the situation worsen despite active police enforcement.

  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task force, led by the Chairman of the Singapore Retailers Association (SRA), was set up to help improve the service quality in the retail sector and labour productivity. It had three main recommendations. They were:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. To encourage retailers to adopt the ISO 9000 certification scheme to maintain consistent service standards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. To train as many retail frontliners as possible and within the shortest possible time, eg. in product knowledge and sales technique.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. To encourage more retailers to price tag.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations are being implemented. Giordano and Hour Glass were awarded the ISO 9002 certification during SRA's Annual Conference in August last year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the training of retail frontliners, STPB is studying how a programme used overseas can be modified and adapted to meet our local needs. It hopes to launch this programme by the end of 1995. National Productivity Board (NPB) has also tailored its training programmes, especially its on-the-job training (OJT) schemes, to meet the needs of retailers. Since the launch of the NPB Retail OJT Programme in July 1994, some 400 workers from 60 neighbourhood retailers have been trained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for price tagging, the price tagging campaign was held for the third consecutive year in November 1994. Its purpose is to educate retailers of the merits of price tagging which would help to boost the shoppers' experience in Singapore.

  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministry of Health received a total of 10 complaints of complications pertaining to the use of lasers by beauty salons between 1992 and 1994.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these 10 complaints, an instrument thought to be a laser was reported to have been used to remove tattoos( 6), moles (2) or freckles (2). The complications were mainly in the form of infection, formation of bad scars, and worsening of the initial problem. All required further medical treatment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The import and use of lasers for medical and other purposes is regulated by the Ministry of Health and requires a licence. Generally, lasers that are used by beauticians are low powered lasers which are incapable of causing burns and do not require a licence. The Ministry is presently working with the Police on complaints against beauty salons, with a view to possible prosecution of beauty salons operators found to be illegally using high powered lasers.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (1980) which came into operation on 1st January 1993 requires that all medical clinics be licensed by the Ministry of Health. Beauty salons cannot provide medical care on their premises.

   <b>NUMBER OF RETRENCHMENTS</b>

  <b>Mr Ling How Doong</b> asked the Minister for Labour, from 1994 up to the latest available date in January 1995, how many companies have retrenched their staff, what is the total number of workers affected and which are the companies involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our surveys, 210 companies retrenched their workers during the first nine months of 1994. This was less than the 228 companies recorded during the same period in 1993. However, retrenchment exercises in 1994 involved a larger number of workers resulting in 5,487 workers being retrenched as compared to 4,422 for the same period of nine months in 1993. The companies involved include AT &amp; T Consumer Products, Thomson Television Singapore, Mitsubishi Electronic Manufacturing and Shintom Electronic. About half of the retrenched workers were from the electrical and electronics industry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary figures for the last quarter of 1994 show that there were at least 24 companies which retrenched another 2,256 workers, making a total of 7,743 workers retrenched for the whole year. Hence, the total number of retrenched workers in 1994 would be higher than the 6,487 workers retrenched by 305 companies in 1993.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our feedback, many of those retrenched have no difficulty finding jobs. As part of our Ministry's employment assistance programme, the Employment Service has offered to help the retrenched workers to look for alternative employment. It is also common for companies involved in a retrenchment exercise to help their retrenched workers by contacting the potential employers and arranging for them to be interviewed for suitable jobs. In our current tight labour market, workers who are not choosy should have no difficulty finding alternative employment.

  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) How many Certificates of Entitlement have been issued and how many cars have been registered under the Off-Peak Car (OPC) scheme since 1st October 1994
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registry of Vehicles has issued a total of 15,280 Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) since 1st October 1994, excluding those for registration of Category 5 (commercial) and Category 6 (motorcycles) vehicles. As at end December 1994, there are a total of 127 Off-Peak Cars (OPCs), 97 of which are registered new and 30 of which are converted from normal cars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) How is the strike price determined and whether the OPC bids influence the strike price;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no special COE category for OPCs. All car buyers will bid for normal car COEs and the strike price will be determined by the lowest successful bids in the respective COE categories. At the point of registering their cars, owners are then required to indicate if
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> they wish to register OPCs or normal cars. If they choose to register OPCs, they will then receive a maximum upfront tax rebate of $17,000 on the net Additional Registration fee (ARF), customs duty and COE premium. In addition, they get a discount of $800 on the annual road tax subject to a minimum road tax of $50.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence to suggest that the OPC Scheme has led to higher COE prices. The scheme is designed to help those who can marginally afford to own cars. It will not be in their interest to push up COE premiums, as it will then nullify the tax concessions given to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Whether an OPC can be converted into a normal car after 10 years, on payment of the quota premium
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An owner can convert his OPC to a normal car anytime during the lifespan of his car, by paying an administrative fee of $800 and refunding the "unused" portion of the upfront rebate, calculated as follows:
  <pre>

       $17,000

     ----------  x (120 months - age of car at date of conversion)

     120 months

</pre> There is no need to pay another quota premium, as the OPC owner has already bid for a COE. The top-up amount to convert an OPC to a normal car is "depreciated" over 10 years and equals to zero when the car is 10 years or older. The prevailing quota premium is payable only if the owner wishes to revalidate the car's COE for another 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Why a deadline is imposed for conversion of weekend cars to normal cars;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the former Weekend Car (WEC) Scheme, owners who wanted to convert their WECs to normal cars were required to obtain a normal car COE. When the WEC Scheme was revised in October last year, to cap the road tax discounts eventually at $800, it was decided to give WEC owners the option to convert their cars to normal cars without having to bid for a new normal car COE. They are required only to pay an administrative fee of $100 and a top-up charge, as follows:
  <pre>

     (Upfront tax rebate +

     savings in COE premium      (120 months - age of car

       at point of tender)    x   at time of conversion)

     ----------------------

           120 months

</pre> The top-up charge is pro-rated to the age of the WEC concerned and takes into account the savings in COE premium at the point of tender, and will "depreciate" over time. As this is a concession, owners are given up to end September 1997 to exercise the option. The 3-year grace period to exercise the option will help owners to depreciate their top-up charge. WECs which are not converted to normal cars by the end of the grace period, will remain as WECs until ERP is implemented islandwide. The exact date, which is expected to be beyond year 2000, can only be determined after ERP is implemented. By then, as promised by the Government, WECs will automatically be converted to normal cars at no cost to the owners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Whether the OPC scheme has inadvertently penalised owners of bigger weekend cars and, if so, what is the remedy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WEC Scheme was implemented to help more Singaporeans to own cars. Its tax package was formulated with the intention to help the marginal car owners, who were expected to be the buyers of small or medium-sized cars. The revised WEC Scheme and the new OPC Scheme preserve this intention. There is no justification to allow owners of bigger WECs to enjoy more tax concessions than owners of smaller WECs. It is only fair that all owners of OPCs or WECs, regardless of their engine capacities, be subject to similar usage restraint and be given similar tax concession.

   <b>NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST TRADE FAIRS 1990 - 1994</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for the Environment, for each of the years from 1990 to 1994, (a) what is the number of complaints arising from trade fairs and mini trade fairs (pasar malams); (b) what is the nature of these complaints; (c) where are the locations of the fairs complained against; and (d) what are the organisations to which the licences for the fairs were issued.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The complaints against trade fairs and mini trade fairs were received verbally or in writing by various government agencies, the media, Shopkeepers Associations and Members of Parliament. The aggregate number of complaints is, therefore, not available.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Members of the public complained about noise nuisance, poor food hygiene, littering, gambling, illegal engagement of foreign workers and traffic obstruction. Shopkeepers complained about unfair competition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Locations of fairs which have attracted complaints included those held in void decks, spaces next to flats, along roads and sites near to shops.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Prior to 1st July 1994, no licence was needed to hold such fairs. Between 1st July 1994 and 31st December 1994, the following licences were issued:

   <b>(Deprivation of citizens' rights)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development whether it is the policy to deny citizens of their rights to register for Housing and Development Board flats and to apply for or renew their licences if they fail to pay their fines, compositions, dues, levies and Central Provident Fund contribution and if he will specify the circumstances under which these rights are being deprived.
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB Home Ownership Scheme is one of the Government's programmes to help Singaporeans own homes and to give them a stake in the country. It is not a right. They have to meet prevailing criteria.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has used the HDB Home Ownership Scheme to effectively deter anti-social behaviour. For example, the Government has taken a strong stand against those who throw killer litter from their HDB flats. Upon their second offence, they would no longer be allowed to stay in their flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, if a recalcitrant parking offender blatantly ignores the law and does not settle his warrant of arrest issued due to his refusal to pay up his parking fines despite repeated reminders, then HDB imposes a range of disincentives to ensure that he settles his warrants of arrest and pays up his fines.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These disincentives include withholding the keys from those who have just purchased flats, not renewing their contractor licences if they happen to be HDB contractors, etc. These measures are only temporary until the warrants of arrests are settled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the failure to pay levies and CPF, neither issue directly affects the registration for HDB flats or the renewal of HDB contractor licences.

   <b>SUBLETTING OF ENTIRE HDB FLAT</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development if he will state the criteria for subletting the entire Housing and Development Board flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following categories of lessees are allowed to sublet their entire HDB flat, subject to HDB's approval:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) lessees who are residing in quarters provided by their employers;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) lessees who have to go abroad for work or study, and whose family members/permitted occupiers accompany them;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) lessees who have to go abroad for work or study, leaving behind household members, such as children or aged parents, who cannot take care of themselves;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) lessees who are the sole occupiers of their flats, and who require hospitalisation for more than 6 months;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) lessees who are sub-tenants, tenants or owners of
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- HDB shops with dwellings, or
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- private commercial properties with dwellings,who have to stay in the shop to look after their businesses;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) grandparents/guardians/Public Trustees who are holding the flats in trust for minor children of deceased lessees;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) sick or physically unfit single lessees who move in with their children or relatives; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) lessees who have other reasons acceptable to HDB.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other lessees must occupy their flats, although they can sublet all except 1 room in the flats. This is because subsidised public housing should be used for owner-occupation, and not as an investment for rental income.

   <b>REVERSE MORTGAGES FOR ELDERLY WITH HDB FLATS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development if the Housing and Development Board is considering making feasible the idea of reverse mortgages for the elderly with HDB homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems faced by an ageing population were touched on by the President in his Address to the House in January 1994. One of the measures the Government has taken to address this issue is to raise the Minimum Sum under CPF over time, to provide for a longer lifespan and to enable members to withdraw higher amounts each month after they retire at 60. Singaporeans are also encouraged to purchase annuity policies when they are younger, so that they can be assured of a steady stream of income in their old age. Furthermore, elderly owners of HDB flats who find less need for larger flats can always sell their flats, move to smaller flats, and live off the profits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the financial needs of our elderly are largely well taken care of by themselves, and their families. Very few need to resort to reverse mortgages of their HDB flats as a means of financial assistance. Most elderly home-owners want to leave their homes as an inheritance for their children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will continue to monitor the situation and assess the demand for reverse mortgages.

  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Acting Minister for Community Development whether there are any guidelines for centres running before-and-after school care and, if not, whether his Ministry will consider formulating the necessary guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before-and-after school care programmes cater to older school-going children and have been set up by voluntary and community organisations and private operators to provide care for the children so that they do not get into mischief.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard of care and services provided in such centres are determined by the demands and expectations of parents who use the services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before-and-after school care programmes are set up on a voluntary basis and my Ministry does not see any need to regulate voluntary action through guidelines, rules or regulations.

  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Acting Minister for Community Development whether there are sufficient social service agencies in Woodlands and Marsiling areas and, if not, what are the future plans to remedy this.

  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry monitors the demand for and supply of social services island-wide on a regular basis. It works closely with other Ministries and various organisations to identify the support services needed and their possible location and development.

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Child Care Centres
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Senior Citizens Clubs
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Befrienders' Service

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Nursing Homes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1995 and 2000, the following new or additional social service facilities are in the pipeline for the two areas:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) an additional 10-14 child care centres;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) facilities for the disabled including residential, day care and sheltered workshop facilities; and
