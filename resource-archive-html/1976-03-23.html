<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No ministry in our Government has been as riddled with

problems as the Ministry of Education. Only last year one

of the previous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



Ministers for Education came out with a restructured system

which  he  claimed was not an exercise on paper. A  warning

was  sounded in the House that what seemed to have  started

with  a  bang  might end with a whimper and  actually  this

seems  to  have  come to pass, because new directions  have

this  year been laid down. How is ii that all these  things

have happened in education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic education policy of the Government was laid

down   in   the  chapter  Spring  Source  of  our   Nation,

incorporated  in  the Party manifesto The Tasks  Ahead,  in

1959. I  agree with the previous Minister, who is now  the

Minister  for  Science and Technology, that basically  this

policy  has not changed. Throughout the years of PAP  rule.

this policy has been assiduously adhered to because it  was

shown to have continuous relevance and to be grounded in  a

clear-sighted understanding of issues.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have trained teachers and built schools to give

everybody  a  place and a chance for primary education.  We

have  given  places in secondary school  to  all  who  have

qualified  for  it. We have established  the  Institute  of

Education to provide for more varied and better quality  of

training of teachers; although here presently a constituent

has  written  to  me commenting upon the  alarmingly  small

output of teachers from the Institute of Education. We have

established the Industrial Training Board in response to an

important article in our education policy, namely, that  of

contributing towards a better and more productive  economy.

We  have done our best to take care of the material aspects

of  our  policy  with emphasis on science  and  technology.

technical  training, a  chance for  everybody  to  prepare

himself for a job for which he may be well fitted. We  have

encouraged  bilingualism and multi-lingualism  in  response

also  to  the  needs  for  integration  in  a  multi-racial

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lines of policy direction are as relevant today as

they  were in 1959. Yet we seem to have missed out on  some

important  ingredient. I am not talking about  the  changes

which have been many indeed: for example, we have had three

or  four  Ministers of Education within the space  of  less

than  1  5  months - a high turnover rate indeed.  Changing

directives  have  been freely issued  but  these  switches,

modifications and variations are not basically the ailment,

they  seem to me to be symptoms. They indicate that we have

been  more concerned with the educational outcomes that  we

wanted  or thought we could contrive. The point is we  were

so concerned with objects and objectives that we lost sight

of  the fact that we were dealing with children and people.

Let us just consider the following scenario relating to the

early education of our children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a pre-school stage our children are brought up in an

atmosphere of care and attention. Parents show their  great

affection  for their children by looking after  them  well,

and  even  by indulging them. Our children respond  with  a

freshness. We can see it in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



the  kindergarten classes in the community centres when  we

organize little occasions for children. They respond with a

freshness. That, however, seems to be a little dimmed  when

they enter into school. Once our children go to school they

become  enmeshed,  geared into a  system  that  is  heavily

influenced  by  a  compulsion to achieve,  initially  in  a

superficial way, namely, the examination. Towards  the  aim

of passing examinations, pupils will obediently lap up even

a  surfeit of information (I think our school curricula are

over-loaded),  and  regurgitate  what  is  appropriate  for

examination purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally our children give the appearance of being

obedient  and  well disciplined. Or is  it  that  they  are

subservient and subordinate to the petty needs  to  achieve

in  examination. Of course, many do not achieve. The normal

distribution  of  talent  would  exclude  them   from   the

meritocratic upper strata.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasis on competition has resulted in the inculcation

of  some  very good virtues -for example, a willingness  to

work  hard and to strive after set objectives. But  because

of the need to achieve distinction in schools, teachers too

have  been  tempted to Orientate their teaching  simply  to

those   factors  that  are  tested  and  are  revealed   by

examinations.  In  the  process a  fundamental  educational

principle  is ignored. The system becomes subject-oriented,

not pupil-oriented. The basic principle that you learn when

you are at the Teachers' Training College or normal classes

or  at the Institute of Education is that you care for  the

little  children.  You orientate your  effort  towards  the

children, not towards what you want to teach them. They are

not  bottles into which you fill little things.  It  is  no

wonder  that  we  have  discovered in  dismay  lapses  into

illiteracy in fact possibility that literacy may never have

been  achieved  by some who have gone through  the  primary

stages of our school system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system has significant characteristics of being an

impersonal one. Even in the treatment of teachers, much has

been  said  time  and  again  about  the  impersonality  of

directives and poor communication between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



the   Ministry   and  the  people  in   the   field.   This

impersonality can be further illustrated by the way a  very

senior  Ministry official, in addressing school principals,

likened a school to a factory, principals to managers, and

pupils  to  factory products. With that  kind  of  attitude

characterising the thinking of a very senior man, what sort

of  human  component do you expect to be worked in  to  the

attitude towards children?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of attitude has led to the notion that the

school  can provide the inputs that will result in a  pupil

endowed with the right knowledge and attitudes. We have not

thought   too  often  about  the  fact  that  the   child's

environment  also  determines the way he behaves.  We  have

changed  the  physical  environment for  thousands  of  our

children as a result of our successes in the housing field.

But  is  it  not possible for us to try, through  the  mass

media  especially, to  reach to  the  home  and  community

environment,  to  the parents and adult citizens,  to  show

them how they might reinforce what we teach our children in

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even what we teach our children in schools in

respect   of   their  cultural,  historical,   geographical

environment becomes subordinate to other considerations as,

for  example,  Education for Living having  to  be  in  the

second  language. Education for Living should be taught  by

Education-for-Living  teachers,  not  by  second   language

teachers. Frequently the two specialisms do not coincide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, where community influence and school

influence have combined to sharpen the competitive instinct

in  our  young  people, we get what is exemplified  in  the

following.  When a team wins a school debate on television,

the  members of the winning team are so completely overcome

with elation that they have no care for how their opponents

feel as a result of their unseemly jubilation. When results

are  announced  at an interschool band competition  at  the

National  Stadium, the same unseemly jubilation results  in

near  chaos  on  the  field. Ranks are broken,  nearly  all

semblance of order and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



discipline  become vapourised. Where is the spirit  of  the

game? Where is the vying in friendly competition? Where  is

the  consideration of one young person for another in these

hysterical  circumstances? All this is the  result  of  the

emphasis not on individuality but on individualism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talking of individuality, let me hark back to the

odious  comparison  of the school to  the  factory.  It  is

important  that  all  should  realise  that  the  child  at

whatever  stage  he  leaves  school  is  never  a  finished

product.  He  is  a developing person. You  cannot  produce

finished  products from schools. The child is a  developing

person, moving  to  the next stage of his  life,  growing,

changing  with  a personality blossoming and  in  some  sad

cases withering. I do not think our teachers are interested

in  producing stereotyped finished products, duly  labelled

and set out on the assembly line. On the whole, I think our

teachers are concerned for their charges, that is why  they

find  all  the  administrative and clerical  work  that  is

sometimes imposed upon them irksome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we want to give our teachers all the support

possible  in the development of individuality in our  young

citizens, and we want, if possible, to encourage schools to

bear  the  stamp  and  impress of each school's  particular

personality.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at

the  outset I wish to stress that the observations which  I

will  make under this head are made with the knowledge that

the Minister of State has a difficult job on his hands. But

at  the  same  time  I want to say that he  must  grasp  in

perspective the problems that have bedevilled the Ministry,

and  in  this  regard  I will make references  to  specific

issues  which I have raised in this House. In doing  so,  I

also wish to indicate to the Minister the existence in  his

Ministry  of  a  professional mechanism  which  appears  to

obscure fundamental errors of decision in education  policy

or  implementation of policy. I would warn the Minister  of

the  propensities of this mechanism and to ask  him  to  be

alert in issues of education at all times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is one Ministry the successes or failures of

which determine the successes or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



failures  in  other  Ministries  and  ultimately   in   the

performance of the nation, it is the Ministry of Education.

Education  makes the kind of manpower which will  fill  the

Ministries and which man the nation. It determines the kind

of  young  people you have, the workers, the soldiers,  the

managers,  the  leadership  you  have;  and  then  it  also

determines  the  kind of teachers you have.  And  if  these

teachers are 30% below par, then their pupils will probably

be  30%-plus  below  par;  and  if  some  of  these  pupils

themselves   become  teachers  then  these  teachers   will

probably  be  3O%-plus-3O% below par, and  so  on.  Finally

teachers  will  not be able to give much of  value  to  the

pupils  because they have not got the stuff themselves.  On

this, I said in 1968 Hansard, Vol. 28, col. 364):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The reason why I am concerned with the subject of

education  is my belief that it will take a new society,  a

society  with radically different responses and  reactions,

if  we  are to achieve national security and prosperity  in

the  years  ahead.  And in the final analysis,  it  is  the

content  of  the education that we provide our young  today

which   will   determine  their  responses  and   reactions

tomorrow.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have improvements of the recently restructured

system.  The recently restructured system was a restructure

of  the  system restructured in 1968. At that time  I  said

[Hansard, Vol. 28, col. 365]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today we have restructured our education system. The

restructuring  is  extensive in scope, involving  primary,

secondary, technical, tertiary and teacher education  which

I  hope  is  a  final  restructuring, and  is  intended  to

describe in perspective our education system.'



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a little optimistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have identified certain basic difficulties in

our  system,  one of which is the non-retention  policy  by

which  pupils  get promoted upwards irrespective  of  their

performance  in the year. This difficulty, we all  seem  to

agree, is partly responsible for the slide into illiteracy.

But  the Backbench identified it in 1968. In the debate  on

the  President's  speech in May that  year  I  said,  after

analysing the defects of the non-retention policy [Hansard.

Vol. 27, col. 89]:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The non-retention policy by which the student of maximum

age for that class is promoted to the next grade at the end

of   the   year, despite  his  failure  in  the   terminal

examinations, progressively worsens  his  inarticulateness

apart  from  his overall ability. Sir, this  is  a  decline

which must be arrested immediately.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at this time I was already aghast at the kind of

effects  that  the non-retention policy was producing.  The

non-retention policy was introduced in 1956 by the Ministry

of Education to correct the inability of the administration

at  that time to build schools sufficiently fast enough  to

accommodate   a  backlog  of  children  due   to   commence

schooling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Ministry has also discovered the

meaninglessness  of the Primary School Leaving  Examination

and  has initiated the assessment system at the end of  six

years'  primary education. This is also done at the end  of

the  third  year of primary education as described  in  the

restructured system. This is intended to divert  pupils  at

an  early stage so that they will be able to learn at their

own   rate  of  capacity.  In  the  debate  in  1968  after

underlining  the  adverse effects that the  Primary  School

Leaving Examination was having on our primary and secondary

education I said [Hansard, Vol. 27, col. 89]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, as suggested, the Primary School Leaving

Examination may be suitably modified or even abolished  and

in its place a system of annual assessment set up.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also said in that debate [Hansard. Vol. 27, cols. 87-8]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, diversion of academic potential, which is the end

product  of  six  years  primary  education,  to  technical

education  and  vocational training is  short  of  what  is

ideally  correct. Diversion of primary school  students  to

vocational  training as it is being done today must  cease.

It  is  a  diversion  of primary school students  who  have

failed   in   the   Primary  School  Leaving   Examination.

notoriously, abbreviated as PSLE, and who are over-aged. It

operates on the inscrutable theory that the overage rejects

of   this  examination  have  an  aptitude  for  vocational

training.  I  would  suggest that the  Government  consider

making the diversion at the early secondary school sta9e.'



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigo, could you slow down a bit

because the interpreters cannot catch up with what you  are

saying.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I am trying to hurry between the

interpreters and your ten- minute guillotine.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is too bad. You are so long-winded.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> In this case the Ministry did rearrange the

diversion to take place at the end of Secondary II in 1969.

But  I  am sure it was not as a result of my having  raised

it. Suffice it to say that my anxieties have been confirmed

by the initiative of the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made these flashbacks with the intention of

indicating to the Minister that on education the  Backbench

has  searched the subject and articulated on it extensively

in Parliament. Contributions have come from the Members for

Jurong.  Paya  Lebar.  Jalan  Kayu  and  Telok  Blangah.  I

hesitate  to include the Member for Moulmein.  I  think  he

holds  a  watching brief for teachers in this House.  If  I

have omitted quoting all Members it is purely because of  a

lack of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are realising today that the traditional media in

which  the  education  of pupils is  undertaken, i.e, the

classroom,  has lost its effectiveness as the form  at  the

primary level. The classroom has always been a grouping  in

which   there  quickly  developed  a  relationship  between

teacher  and  pupils  that  made  education  possible   and

effective. This form dissipated as soon as subject teaching

was liberally used in the primary schools. If four subjects

in  the  class  time-table  draw into  the  classroom  four

different teachers of the subjects, then the close intimate

relationship between one teacher and 35 pupils is lost  and

in  its  place  there is only the indifferent communication

link  between one teacher and 140 pupils. What happens then

is   that  you  no  longer  tend  to  have  education   but

instruction  and therefore you no longer have  schools  but

centres of instruction. Subject teaching may be suitable as

a  method of instruction, but is it suitable as a  form  of

education? I expressed this worry in 1968 where I  insisted

that  quality  in education can be achieved only  when  the

classroom   retains  the  intimacy  of  the   teacher-pupil

relationship.  I  would urge the Minister  to  explore  the

desirability of once again recovering what we formerly had,

that is, the true form teacher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me say that our education system has not

collapsed. There are major defects. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



we  are to attempt the correction of these defects we  must

be  realistic. These defects cannot be solely attributed to

the  system.  The  failure  in or  the  non-performance  of

teachers has helped to bring about these defects. The  bull

in  the china shop is all right. Sir, but teachers are  not

china  wares  also. If I am the Backbencher  to  say  these

unpopular  things,  let it be so. But to  what  extent  the

system has been responsible in stifling the performance  of

teachers so that their performance as the teacher has  been

aborted  or  retarded by the system, is a  matter  for  the

Minister to find out and correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I wish to make the point that the Ministry in

charge  of  half  a million pupils and the  teacher  unions

representing  approximately 20,000 teachers determine  much

of  the future of our society. While I realise that parents

in  their homes owe it to themselves and their children  to

begin laying the basis for the development of character and

ability, many parents still depend and, in fact, expect the

institution  of the school to nurture their  children  into

citizens  useful  to parents and society.  This  in  itself

calls  for  a re-education of parents. In this co'inection,

what  does the Minister think about reactivating on a  mass

scale parent-teacher association?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher unions have grave responsibilities in the effort

to  make  our education, system successful. On the question

of  education  policies  and their implementation,  teacher

unions  cannot afford to posturise or compromise to achieve

administrative  convenience at the risk of a  deterioration

in  the content of education. Principals of primary schools

had  their  post allowances withdrawn. This change  removed

administrative difficulties in selecting senior teachers as

principals  of  primary  schools  At  the  same  time,  the

professionals  in the Ministry are prepared to  admit  that

the system should assist in achieving the correct motivated

principal  for  the school in order that the entire  school

functions. If the restoration of post allowances  for  such

principals is necessary I would urge the Minister to do so.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigo, your time is up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, travelling in an

elevator  one  day  recently,  I  happened  to  overhear  a

conversation between two school children. They were arguing

as  to who was the Minister for Education. Neither of  them

was obviously in the right and they would appear to realise

it  too, as they finally compromised by agreeing that  what

difference did it make whether it was Lee, Chua or Chai.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this little incident, amusing as it may be,

illustrates very well the state of confusion we are all  in

as  a result of regular changes in our education policy  in

recent  years from Ministry officers to school  principals,

teachers, pupils and parents. It would seem to me that very

few people really know what is happening at any one moment.

Take,  for  example the subject of the use  of  the  School

Funds.  More than a year ago, the attention of  the  Public

Accounts Committee of Parliament was drawn to the fact that

all  the schools in Singapore had among them accumulated  a

total  sum of close to $10 million under their School Funds

and  this large sum of money was left lying idle in  banks.

The  reason,  as  the Committee discovered, was  apparently

that  principals  were at a loss as  to  how  to  go  about

obtaining the necessary approval from the Ministry  to  use

their School Funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Accounts Committee of Parliament, under the

chairmanship   of   the  Hon.  Member  for   Katong, then

recommended that the money should be used for the  purposes

intended,  since  they  were  collected  from  the  pupils.

Subsequently,  in  March 1975, a Notification  No.  73  was

issued by the Ministry authorising the principals to  incur

any expenditure not exceeding $200 from their School Funds.

This partial relaxation obviously was not too successful as

on  1  7th December, 1975 a further Notification No. 150  on

the  same subject was issued, removing all restrictions  in

the  use  of School Funds. On the one hand, this  news  was

enthusiastically welcomed by the teaching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



profession  and hailed as a significant step taken  in  the

right  direction,  and yet in an article  entitled  "School

Funds,  a New Look", appearing in the latest issue  of  the

Teachers  Rostrum, the author urged that  principals  would

appreciate  it  very  much  if  some  guidelines  could  be

provided  for  them.  This, to  my  mind,  suggests   that

principals  are  still at a loss as to how they  should  go

about using their newly delegated authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, Sir, you would have noted that the first

Notification No. 73, referred to by me earlier, was  issued

in  March 1975 but by December 1975 the second notification

on  the same subject has already reached the number 150. In

other  words, altogether a total number of 78 notifications

were  issued by the Ministry to schools in a matter of nine

months.  I  do not know what is contained in the  other  76

notifications. All that I can say is that I sympathise with

the  poor principals and teachers in trying to comply  with

whatever the nature of the numerous notifications,  not  to

mention  the  poor  pupils  who  obviously  suffer  in  the

process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more recent example is to be found in a seminar

conducted by the Ministry. According to the press,  at  the

opening  of  the  Seminar  the  Senior  Minister  of  State

emphasised   the  need  to  educate  school   children   on

population   control.  There  were,  I  gather, subsequent

speakers from the Ministry. After listening to the  various

speeches, some primary school principals, I was told,  went

away  from the seminar feeling rather confused as  to  what

they  were  expected  to  do. One  expressed  rather  grave

concern  to  me that principals were asked to borrow  films

and  illustrations from the Family Planning and  Population

Board  to  show  to their children. His interpretation  was

that  primary  school  children  were  to  be  taught   sex

education or birth control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two examples only serve to illustrate a rather

sorry  state  of  affairs  in  the  implementation  of  our

education  policy. It would seem to me that a very  serious

communication gap exists in all levels of our Ministry  and

the  schools. The gap would appear to be much worse between

the Ministry and the schools. Sir, unless there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



greater and constant awareness of the need, on the part  of

those  implementing the policies of Government, for  proper

dialogue to be maintained between Ministry officers and the

schools,  policy  decisions are unlikely  to  be  correctly

interpreted  and  translated into  suitable  administrative

actions   to  attain  the  desired  objectives.   We   have

emphasised  on  greater  qualitative  improvement  in   our

education  system but until and unless the very fundamental

problem   of   communication  gap  can  he   satisfactorily

resolved.  I have my doubts as to the extent of improvement

that we can hope to achieve.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, since 1959 our

education policy has undergone many and varied changes. Two

features  stand out for commendation and condemnation.  Let

us  take the commendable feature first. We have diversified

the  educational structure from a purely academic  type  of

education given to pupils in the past to one with a science

and  technology  bias. Our emphasis on  technical  schools.

vocational  institutes,  etc, is a complimentable  feature.

Other than that, we have left a string of failures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education policy is still examination-oriented. Let

us  take the Primary School Leaving Examination first,  the

six  to  seven-year  primary  education  controversy.  What

happens  to  the thousands of children who have failed  the

Primary  School Leaving Examination? About 10 or  12  years

ago, we  started  post-primary  classes  for  Primary   VI

failures  and  advocated the setting  lip  of  post-primary

vocational  classes for pupils who did not make  the  grade

for   a  regular  secondary  education.  The  Ministry   of

Education  was not prepared nor equipped for the vocational

classes  and  the  programme was a  failure  and  the  post

primary vocational classes closed down.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are talking in terms of allowing pupils who failed

the  PSLE to repeat and to keep them in schools until  they

are 1 5 years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



old. What kind of instruction are the 1 5-year old backward

pupils  going  to  get?  I  should  not  have  called  them

"backward  pupils". In the new educational  parlance, they

are  ESN,  Educationally Sub-Normal. Are they going  to  be

grouped with the other students who have failed? Are  there

still  going to be 40-odd backward overaged pupils  in  the

same class? Does the Ministry seriously expect the 1 5-year

olds  who fail year after year to really make good with  40

such pupils in any one class? What attention is going to be

paid  to  them  to actually make them useful citizens?  Are

remedial teaching methods advocated? If so, has any thought

been   given   to  remedial  education,  and  are   answers

available?  These are questions for which answers  must  be

found before action could be initiated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take our second language policy. From normal

second   language  teaching,  the  Ministry  of   Education

advocated additional exposure for the second language. When

they   found   that  the  children  were  not   effectively

bilingual,  they decided they could solve  the  problem  by

increased  exposure to second language  for  all.  Subjects

normally  taught in the first language had to be :aught  in

the second language. As a result, we found that many of our

pupils  who  were  not  effective in  the  second  language

earlier became ineffective in both the first as well as the

second languages. What we are now, therefore, advocating is

back  to  square  one, and that is, an  under-exposure  for

those who are not able to cope up with the two languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We gave another name for Civics. We did away with History

and  introduced Education for Living to be  taught  in  the

second  language. This has really become neither  a  civics

lesson,  nor  an Education for Living lesson  but  in  many

schools,  it has bec3me a second language lesson. Again,  a

failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activity method advocated by one of the seven Education

Ministers  (we have had seven Ministers since 1959)  became

PPP.  For  those  who  are uninitiated in  the  educational

jargon of these days, it means the Primary Pilot Project.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon. Member:</b> Play, play, play!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes. A big boo-ha was made. Special

classes for teachers were conducted. Special teaching  aids

were  made. Instruction manuals were printed. Thousands  of

dollars  were  spent  by individual  teachers  as  well  as

schools.  After a few years' trial, even as  late  as  last

year, we were told that the PPP programme has come to stay.

Now I hear it is out. Why?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only last year we were debating in this Chamber on

another  new  education  policy,  namely  the  Restructured

Education  System.  There were considerable  criticisms  as

well  as  apprehension  about this  policy.  The  Education

Minister  then,  tried  to  explain  the  system,  not  too

successfully, I am afraid. He also sang praises for such  a

system.  Sir,  now the rumour has it that the  Restructured

Education System is still-born.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every child was forced to participate in extra-curricular

activities. Special record cards were introduced  for  ECA.

The  points system was introduced. Parents kicked up a row.

Members  of Parliament made speeches in this House and  ECA

cards were withdrawn and insistence on participation in ECA

has been relaxed and forgotten. Another change in policy or

a failure?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers, while keeping tab of the numerous changes

and  trying to understand and implement them, have also  to

be  Anti-Narcotics Counsellors and, of late,  as  has  been

mentioned  earlier  by the Member for  Jalan  Kayu, family

planning experts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon. Member:</b> Post Office Savings Bank.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes, Post Office

Savings Bank. I read in the papers that family planning  or

population  education  is  to  be  given  even  in  primary

schools. Do we seriously expect primary school students  to

understand family planning concept?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage of teachers in our schools is phenomenal,

especially  graduate  teachers in secondary  schools.  Even

from  the Government's own statistics, in Division I alone,

there is a vacancy position of 45.3%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



Secondary school pupils even up to Secondary IV levels  are

being taught by non-graduate teachers, in some cases,  even

by those who themselves only have a School Certificate. The

Ministry  of  Education  ought  to  be  grateful  to  these

teachers  who  teach Secondary IV classes far beyond  their

call  of  duty. There was some talk earlier on of upgrading

these  teachers  by inservice classes in the  Institute  of

Education. What has happened to this scheme? How  does  the

Ministry hope to recruit graduates for secondary schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary teachers, principals and inspectors have now

been  classified  differently. Just as a  jaga  these  days

calls  himself  a  Security  Officer,  and  a  door-to-door

salesman   calls   himself  a  Sales  Representative,   our

teachers,  principals, inspectors, etc, have  become  EOs,

SEOs, PEOs, EDOs, ADs and DDs. Very soon we may run out  of

alphabets! This euphemism has become some kind of a  status

symbol   among  our  educators.  The  need  for   promotion

prospects for teachers was understandable. In fact,  I  was

one  of those who advocated for more promotion posts in our

Education  Service but never did I dream that the  Ministry

would be creating so many grades of teachers. It appears as

if there are no more teachers in our Education Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are all the failures that I have enumerated necessary?

Sir,  a  study of the Hansard, as pointed out by  the  Hon.

Member  for  Serangoon Gardens, would  show  that  numerous

criticisms were made in this Chamber. Some of the  pitfalls

of  the education policies were pointed out and they  could

have  been avoided. If only the gods at Kay Siang Road  had

genuinely discussed with the organisations representing the

teachers  and the people who have to implement  the  policy

before  proposing any new scheme, many pitfalls could  have

been avoided. When I say "discussions and consultations". I

mean  genuine  discussions and consultations and  not  some

little  dictator from the Ministry of Education calling  up

principals  and  organisations  representing  teachers  and

giving them a lecture on the latest policies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a moral to be learnt from the past failures? I

would say `yes. If the education planners in Kay Siang Road

take  heed  and accept the fact that there are also  others

outside  the  Ministry  who  are  also  interested  in  the

education of our young, we will not be in the mess that  we

are in now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, education

has  always  been  a subject of interest  both  within  and

without this House. This is to be expected considering  the

fact  that  in  our society so much depends on  the  proper

development and utilization of our human resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criticisms on our educational system as well as on our

educational  standards have been galore.  No  doubt,  these

criticisms  have  been  made  with  good  intentions,   but

unfortunately  quite  a lot of them have  been  misdirected

against  the  teachers, maligning them for so many  of  the

ills  in  our educational system. Teachers have  been  made

convenient   whipping  boys  for  any   failings   in   our

educational endeavours. This can only engender a feeling of

malaise  and dejection among teachers, especially  when  so

many   of   our  criticisms  on  our  failings  have   been

misdirected against the teaching profession. It is time  we

stopped  making  scapegoats out of  the  teachers  whenever

something goes wrong in our educational system. It is about

time  we  directed our volleys of criticisms at  the  right

places  where  the  sins  of  commission  and  omission  in

education have been committed. I am referring to the source

where   many   of  the  ills  of  the  educational   system

originated. This is where many of the "bright"  ideas  were

conceived  and then turned into educational Policies  which

must be implemented at all costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in our educational policy are desirable as we

must  keep up with the times and new demands, provided such

changes  are made after very careful consideration  of  the

impact and the implications these changes would have in the

total  context of our educational, policy In some instance,

corrective measures will have to he taken in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



order to reduce any ill effects resulting from any shift of

our   educational  policies.  Changes  in  our  educational

policies must be few and gradual as the educational process

is  a  long-term  one. Time and care in nurturing  the  new

ideas  are  important elements that will determine  whether

the new ideas will blossom or wither. But when changes were

made  and then retracted at some future time, they not only

reflect the haphazard manner in which some of these changes

were  made, but also caused so much confusion among  school

principals and teachers as to what the educational  policy-makers  really  want, apart from causing a  dislocation  of

existing   educational  programmes  in  our   schools.   In

determining educational changes, one cannot be as fickle as

a  vain  woman in her dressing room, changing her mind  now

and then about what she ought to wear for a party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point of this fickleness in policy adjustments

is the recent announcement by the present Minister for Home

Affairs  and Education that primary education will  now  be

extended  up to a maximum of nine years for a slow  learner

and  that  automatic promotion in primary schools will  now

cease. This announcement represents a total reversal of the

announcement made by the ex-Minister for Education (who  is

now  the  Minister  for Science and Technology)  in  1  975

concerning the restructured education system. Following the

ex-Education  Minister's announcement on  the  restructured

education  system last year, the whole Ministry was  geared

to  prepare  for  the  implementation of  the  restructured

education  system.  Evaluation and assessment  courses  for

teachers and meetings of principals were arranged  to  work

out  the details to implement the ``brainchild'' of the ex-Education  Minister. It now appears that with the  changing

of the Education Minister, there also goes the "brainchild"

of the ox-Education Minister. But what remains still is the

hullabaloo  arising  out  of  the  restructured   education

system.  Instructions to principals and teachers concerning

steps  to  be taken to implement the restructured education

system  have  not  been withdrawn, although  the  Education

Ministry now adopts a completely new set of ideas. Ministry

officials when contacted by the principals for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



guidance  are  bewildered and are not  sure  which  is  the

latest "fad" in the educational policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of these confusions, not to mention the

entire  efforts put in by teachers and principals over  the

implementation of the restructured education  system  going

up  in  smoke, how in the name of fairness can we point  an

accusing finger at principals and teachers for the misdeeds

originated  and  perpetuated  by  the  Education   Ministry

itself?  For  goodness sake, can the Hon. Minister  or  his

Senior  Minister  of State inform this  House  whether  the

policy regarding the restructured education system and what

it  entails are thrown overboard or are still operative, in

the  light  of  the  recent  announcement  by  the  present

Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and  Education  that  primary

education will now extend up to a maximum of nine years for

the slow learner with no automatic promotions?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the

sentiments  so  ably  expressed by  my  colleagues  on  the

Backbench   who  spoke  before  me  just  now  on   matters

concerning the policy of the Ministry of Education. I would

like to make reference only to two issues. Firstly, I refer

to  the  announcement  of the Ministry  of  Education  with

regard  to  what is termed as "New rulings of priority  for

Primary  I  admissions" which amongst other  things  stated

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`only children whose parents were sterilised before they

reach  40 years of age will be given priority for admission

to  Primary I from this year. Previously there was  no  age

stipulation'. (Straits Times. Thursday, 18th March, 1976).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  are  well  aware of  my  personal  feelings

towards  abortion  and sterilisation. But  I  am  extremely

disturbed  about  ground reports voicing not  only  concern

which  is  growing with increasing intensity of unhappiness

and  snowballing into resentment, but also posing questions

such as: is it really necessary for Government to push  the

education  policy  so  far as to compel  aided  schools  to

conform  to  it when such rulings handed down  are  against

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



moral principles? If Government can push such a policy down

their  throats,  what  is to follow next?  These  questions

cannot  be  lightly  treated. Morally it  is  wrong  to  do

likewise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the question of sterilisation is not

something which is directly connected with education. By so

doing, the Government is taking it too far. I would suggest

that this matter ought to be reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to touch on concerns the

requirement of Secondary I and II students, boys or  girls,

to  attend  a 3-hour workshop session once a week.  I  have

received  complaints from parents whose daughters  have  to

attend  such sessions. They complain that there  is  little

time  for  their daughters to have their meals before  they

catch  a bus to go to their workshops or schools. I believe

there  is a point in their complaint. Moreover, the parents

also  point  out  that  they  would  prefer  to  see  their

daughters  take  up  Home Economics  instead  of  attending

workshop  sessions. This is because they  feel  that  their

daughters  could learn something more meaningful for  their

future  lives  than  to spend three hours  a  week  in  the

workshops  for  two years and at the end of which  a  basic

knowledge of technical skill is picked up by them and which

will  not  be  of  any benefit if they should  go  to  non-technical schools to complete their secondary education.  I

would  strongly  urge the Hon. Minister to look  into  this

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  fact  that  so many Hon. Members have  spoken  on  the

problems  of  education shows the concern we all  have  for

education  which  directly  affects  one-quarter   of   our

population  and  indirectly  affects  the  whole   of   our

population. It is only natural and it is good,  because  it

is an important matter affecting our future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing the problems of education, we must

recognise  that on the whole there is nothing fundamentally

wrong  with  our education system. Otherwise we  would  not

have a society as stable as we have now, or we would not be

here  either. With changing times and social progress, our

education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



policy, system, syllabuses and teaching materials, have  to

change accordingly in order to meet the requirements of our

nation  and  our  society. Education is not something  that

cannot change. However, the more conservative group do  not

like  to  see  any changes or innovations in our  education

system.  On the other hand the innovators are impatient  to

see  that  education is being changed with  quick  results.

Therefore, there is inevitably a conflict between  the  new

and the old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, there have been many changes in our

education system. From my observations and experience  over

the  years, frankly speaking all these have been quite well

motivated. If there had been any aberrations, they could be

due  to  the decision makers not having thoroughly examined

our  education  policy.  They could  also  be  due  to  the

inappropriate moment of its implementation. However,  there

has been one shortcoming, that is to say, in the process of

formulating  our  educational  policy  those  organisations

representing the teaching profession had not been  given  a

say.  I  have always held out that teachers are the  actual

implementors  of any education policy. Since  the  teachers

come   into  direct  contact  with  the  students  in   the

classroom,  they should know the feelings and  response  of

the  pupils and they should also know what is receptive and

absorbable and what cannot be acceptable to the pupils.  We

have   20.000   teachers  represented  by   five   teacher-organisations.  I  think if the teacher-organisations  were

given  some  say in the educational policy-making  process,

then there would be fewer changes due to education theories

which might sound very grand but are not practicable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education affects the future of our country. The

chief  implementor of education is the teacher. So  we  can

see that the teachers are very important in the process  of

education.  I regret to say that in our mercenary  society,

teachers  are  losing their status and are  less  and  less

respected. The respect for the teacher and the teaching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



profession  seems  to  have  become  a  historical  relic.

Therefore,  it  is  important to  enhance  the  status  and

respect  for teachers, and the Government can do a  lot  in

this  matter besides the efforts by the teachers themselves

and their organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers are all

professional  people. They have professional  bodies  which

are  given  considerable  statutory  power  in  respect  of

admission  for practice and disciplinary codes to  exercise

control over them. The teachers should also be regarded  as

professionals,  as  they  have  gone  through  professional

training.  However,  unlike the other professional  bodies,

the  teachers' organisations are not given statutory  power

with  disciplinary codes to control their members. Teachers

are  not required by law to join their representative body.

So  the  teachers' organisations are not able  to  exercise

authority  over  the teachers, neither can they  raise  the

social  status  of the teacher. If teachers'  organisations

are given such a statutory right and if we also enhance the

status  of  the  teachers,  it does  not  follow  that  all

problems  will be solved. But at least we will be  able  to

help them to better honour their professional duties and to

be more contented in their profession. At the same time, we

would  be  able  to attract more talent into  the  teaching

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all those who are engaged in the teaching profession

are  basically given three categories of salary scales with

nine  grades. The intention is good and it is good 10  give

them  yearly  increments. But, there is no  special  salary

scale  for  the  principal. This seems a bit  unfair.  Very

often, there are principals who are only Education Officers

whereas some teachers are Senior Education Officers. Sir,I

have  said  in  this House many a time that  a  principal's

appointment  is due to his superior merits. He  has  to  be

responsible for the affairs of the whole school,  including

school   administration,  the  arrangement  of  the  school

curricula, time-table, and he will have to take  charge  of

the school finance, personnel control and the discipline of

the  students. Whatever matter, big or small, will have  to

go  through the principal. However, his salary is sometimes

not compatible with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



his  heavy  responsibility. No wonder  some  principals  on

their  appointment  seem to accept it  with  a  feeling  of

drudgery.  I  wonder whether the Ministry of Education  has

noticed this problem and will consider giving the principal

a more adequate and significant salary.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry

of  Education  is  in  some  ways  comparable  to  our  bus

services. During the last 15 years, at least five ministers

have been given this portfolio. It has gone through so many

changes  that  it produced nothing but only confusion,  not

only among the officials in the Ministry but also among the

teachers, students and parents. Nobody knows what is  going

to  happen next. Nobody knows what is the aim of education.

The situation seems to be `the blind leading the blind'. It

is time a commission of inquiry was set up to look into the

question  of  why  many  teachers  are  resigning  and  are

disgruntled with their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to prevent our education system from going down

the  drain.  It appears that our young citizens  have  been

turned  into  guinea pigs to satisfy the  fancies  of  some

administrators  in  this  Ministry.  Whenever  some  senior

officials  want  to impress the public with their  ability,

they think of changes and then introduce them through trial

and  error,  literally bulldozing the system by  virtue  of

their  seniority.  School principals and teachers  are  not

given a chance to question these changes but simply told to

carry  out  instructions. We have seen the failure  of  the

Primary  Pilot  Project.  Sometime  ago  bilingualism   was

emphasised.   To  a  certain  extent  the  classes   became

dramatic.  Schools were told to increase the exposure  time

for  the second language. Then, all of a sudden, principals

were  given the discretion to reduce exposure time as  they

see fit. Why this about-turn? Obviously very little thought

has been given to planning this policy in stages.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of six or seven-year primary education

is  another  fiasco. The criteria for guiding  the  pupil's

ability are so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



confusing. There is so much doubt that very few people  are

really  convinced  that  it will really  work.  The  simple

reason  is  this.  The judging of the individual  student's

potential is left in the hands of the young teachers,  some

of,  whom have very little experience in teaching. What  is

the position of this system now? Is it still in force?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also seen another move whereby pupils are

allowed to take care of their schools by doing some kind of

work  in  the  schools. The danger is that  principals  may

become   over-enthusiastic  and  may  use  the  pupils   as

substitutes for school servants. Some principals  are  only

interested  in  creating all image to the Ministry  at  the

expense  of  teachers  and  students.  Many  parents   have

complained that their children have been made to sweep  the

school floors. Why is this so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has become a tradition with the Chinese schools

to  conduct  classes  on Saturdays. Of late,  many  English

school teachers have been seconded to these Chinese schools

because  of  bilingualism. Many of these  English  language

teachers have expressed dissatisfaction with these Saturday

classes.  They  say  that during the weekdays  after  every

subject period there is a short break and it has to be made

up by the Saturday classes. I wonder why the Chinese stream

does not follow other streams and leave Saturday for extra-curricular activities only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard of Tamil education is rather "high". I am

told the teachers themselves are not familiar with the text

books.  They are not given proper training. If so, how  are

they going to teach? I hope the Ministry will recruit, more

qualified Tamil teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some schools the teachers themselves do not know what

they  teach.  There was a case where a father  checked  his

son's  books and found an answer to a mathematical  problem

marked  as wrong when it was, in fact, correct. So to  seek

clarification,  the  father wrote a  note  to  the  teacher

through  his son. The teacher in turn scribbled a  note  to

the  father  in pencil admitting the mistake, and  he  also

told the boy to erase the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



scribbled note after showing it to the father, Again, time-tables  in  some primary schools are not strictly followed.

Quite  often, the time-tables are changed all of a  sudden.

so  much  so  that  the students do not have  the  required

books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some primary schools teachers request pupils to

pay for something which they do not properly explain. There

was  a  case  of  a  student who had to pay  50  cents  for

something  which he could not explain to his parents.  When

the   parents  asked  the  teacher  the  reason  for   this

collection, the reply was for a curtain. I wonder what  has

happened  to  the  school's miscellaneous  funds.  Why  are

teachers  collecting donations from students? Is  this  the

type of education for our children?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late principals have been given the discretion to

spend money collected from pupils. However. I wish to point

out  a  certain anomaly. The schools are still  allowed  to

spend  only  a  certain sum, a sum specified several  years

ago.  Let  us take, for example, a school with an enrolment

of  2,000  pupils. Tile collection from these 2,000  pupils

will  come  to $7,000 a month and the school is allowed  to

spend  only $3,000 a month. Any further expenses will  need

special permission to be sought every month. The figure  is

unrealistic,  for the simple reason, that  it  was  decided

long  before the fantastic price inflation occurred. I feel

that  the rate of expenditure should be revised to a higher

proportion of the total collections from the school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest a commission of inquiry be set up to look into

what  has gone wrong because most of our teachers  are  now

disgruntled  with their duties. This inquiry could  correct

the  defects  in the education system so that our  students

would not be made guinea pigs where at the end of 1 0 years

of schooling they would be more illiterate than literate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the education policy with regard to sterilisation is

unfair.  Most  of  the mission schools give  preference  of

allocation to those who already have brothers or sisters in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



school.  The introduction of this new priority for children

whose  parents  have been sterilised will seriously  affect

these mission schools. Therefore, could the Minister review

this policy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, many

times  I  have  criticised the Ministry of Education  as  a

Ministry which has changed its policy most frequently. Last

Monday when we were debating the Budget statement, a number

of  Members in this House expressed their concern over  the

confusion caused by the frequent changes of policy  in  the

Ministry of Education. Even a few moments ago, some Members

have also touched on this subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some senior officers in the Ministry of Education, in

order to show off that they know more than the others,  try

to  copy  whatever  they have gathered  from  overseas  for

implementation  in  Singapore. But they  have  not  made  a

thorough study of local conditions to see whether what they

have  copied would fit into our education system.  So  what

they  have  copied was implemented. The moment  they  found

that  something  has  gone wrong with such  implementation,

they  changed their policy. So we had a situation in  which

instructions  issued  in the morning were  changed  in  the

evening.   As  a  result,  teachers  and  principals   were

completely at a loss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been given to understand that the various

specialist  inspectors in the Ministry  of  Education  have

called up teachers in charge of various subjects to discuss

invariably  how to improve the teaching standard  of  those

subjects. This is, of course, a good move since the aim  is

to  improve.  But in such a discussion they invariably  say

that  the teachers must do more work to bring about an all-round  improvement.  So they must do  this,  do  that,  and

everything  else.  As a result the teacher's  work-load  is

increased  and  the  students  also  have  their  increased

burden.  But  if  the students have very  few  subjects  to

study, then  the situation is different. But we  all  know

that the present secondary students, particularly those  in

Secondary  I and II, have to take as many as ten  subjects.

On top of that, they have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



attend  technical  lessons and go for workshop  practice

and  a  host  of ECA activities. In the case  of  school

girls,  they have to learn domestic science as well.  If

various  specialist inspectors intend to show off  their

performances  by  way  of increasing  the  workload  and

lessons  of the teachers and students, in the  end,  the

students  will  suffer  more. The  obvious  consequences

would  be that, they fear to attend school and will  not

know a subject well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend of mine told me that he has two children in

the  same secondary school, one in Secondary I  and  the

other  in  Secondary II. In order to teach the  students

how  to read newspapers, the language teachers make  the

students  do  press cuttings on editorials.  The  civics

teachers  also want these two students to cut out  items

on  civic news, The music teachers also want them to  do

the  same  thing but on musical events. As a result,  my

friend finds a lot of holes in his newspapers, and  that

one  set  of  newspapers is not enough to share  between

the  two  sons. He has to buy another set of  newspapers

for  them  to cut out. He also says that, as  marks  are

given  for  newspaper cuttings, his sons have  to  spend

some  time  to cut them out and paste them  up  properly

and  show  them  to the teachers for marking.  In  fact,

they  have no time to read the newspaper cuttings,  some

of which they might not even comprehend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the example I have quoted is the cause for an

increased   sale   of   newspapers,   which    may    be

misinterpreted  as  the rise in our  cultural  standard,

then it is a travesty of the truth. Just to require  the

students   to  cut  out  and  paste  newspaper  cuttings

mechanically is to achieve nothing for the teachers  and

the



students  themselves. It is deceiving oneself  as  well  as

others.  So  I feel that this practice of the specialist

inspectors  vying for show should stop. I  would  go  so

far  as  to  suggest that there should be a coordinating

committee  in the Ministry of Education to  ensure  that

there  will  be  a fair distribution of time  among  the

various subjects for secondary school students, so  that

there will be no more stereotyped method of teaching.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently some parents are vexed about the use of

simplified  Chinese characters because their  children  now

write  a number of simplified characters which many  people

do   not  understand.  The  simplified  Chinese  characters

initiated by the Ministry of Education have increased  from

502  to 2,248 characters. Some of them have been considered

not  suitable for use are still being used in the magazines

and newspapers. Some new locally created simplified Chinese

characters  are not to be found in any Chinese  dictionary.

This  gives  rise  to a greater problem  for  the  students

studying  the language. Our history is very short  and  our

new culture is still in the making. We should not create  a

Picasso-type of simplified Chinese character experts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, language takes a long time to develop. It is also a

common  fact that language develops with the history  of  a

country.  It  is my hope that the Ministry of Education  in

promoting  the  use of simplified Chinese characters  could

accept  and pay attention to the new development of Chinese

culture  in this field. We should not be narrow-minded  and

obstinate.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> Sir, much criticism has already

been  levelled in the House against our educational  system

in   general  as  well  as  in  specific  terms.  Both  the

educational  administration and the teaching staff  in  our

schools  have been in the line of fire. This identification

of weaknesses in the system is entirely constructive and to

the point in the present context of our rapid progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wholly relevant to stop and ask ourselves seriously

just  where  we are going with our educational  innovations

and  reforms, and what exactly are the ultimate  goals  we

hope  to  achieve  within  the framework  of  our  national

aspirations.  Mistakes in education are  too  expensive  in

human  terms  for us to delay any further in attempting  to

locate  the  trouble spots and areas of  vagueness  in  our

educational policies and administrative approaches.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to suggest practical action

in  three  areas  for  consideration by  the  Minister  for

Education.  First, I would like to suggest the  restoration

of  a  special  allowance for principals  in  view  of  the

important  role  they  are  called  upon  to  play  in  our

educational  sphere. In this respect, I share the  view  of

the  Member  for Jurong expressed earlier on.  The  present

scheme  is  quite  ludicrous, for it is based  on  academic

qualifications. It is quite common in many  schools  for  a

principal  to be earning far less than his teachers  merely

because he is not a university graduate but has come up the

ladder  by  dint  of  hard work, skill and  experience.  In

rational  terms, it would seem that this is  all  the  more

reason  for  appreciation to be accorded  him  in  concrete

money  terms, thus acknowledging the special status he  has

won for himself.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, a principal who does not have his special

position acknowledged and safeguarded in some definite  way

is  going to suffer from a certain sapping lack of  morale.

He  thereby  stands in danger of having his very  authority

undermined.  He  has  every  right  to  expect  a   special

allowance by virtue of the fact that he is the man  who  is

at  the top and responsible for the- coordinated running of

the  entire school. If we deny him this right,  we  are  in

actual fact and by definition denying his special authority

and  thus  condemning  him, in psychological  terms,  to  a

mediocre performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make, Mr Speaker, Sir,

concerns  our  policy of bilingualism, which has,  to-date,

produced innumerable casualties from the point of  view  of

the  fact that some of our students are not even proficient

in one language. The policy has been implemented inflexibly

so  far,  and  it  is high time that a thorough  study  and

review  be  immediately initiated, before  we  proceed  any

further.  Only  after  such an assessment  has  been  made,

should  there  be  any  decisions made  on  the  degree  of

bilingualism, could we then impose it on our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



students. It is a psychological fact that some students are

fast  at  learning  languages while others  are  impossibly

slow,  though they may excel in other areas of  the  school

curriculum. We should manifest our educational  realism  by

adapting  national  goals  to  the  facts  of  an  existing

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most of the developed countries a careful study is

made  before  educational policies are  implemented.  Pilot

schemes are usually introduced and the results fully tested

before  any  policy  decision is taken.  Here  we  seem  to

specialise  in  the "instant change" method,  change  being

introduced  according to the whims and  fancies  of  a  few

educationists  who thus far appear to have  betrayed  their

appalling detachment and lack of comprehension of  existing

realities.  I  submit. Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  on  such  an

important matter as bilingualism a careful study should  be

made  on  the  implications of any change  in  implementing

methods.  We  are  not  quarrelling with  the  bilingualism

policy. The introduction of the exposure time and Education

for  Living  have  resulted in a  lot  of  unhappiness  and

confusion  not only for principals, teachers, students  but

also  parents. I do not intend to go into detail  as  other

Members have already aired their views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to bring up, Mr Speaker, Sir, is

the  fact  that  we  have a vast reservoir  of  educational

expertise that we can profitably tap, instead of having  to

rely  so  heavily, and in some cases, blindly, on expensive

foreign  expertise.  I refer to our retired  educationists,

among  whom  we  have some truly notable talents.  This  is

available  for  the  harnessing at  our  very  doorstep.  I

suggest that the Ministry of Education seriously look  into

the  possibility of reemploying as advisers or  consultants

men who have already proved their eminence in the field  of

education.  The  Health Ministry utilises the  services  of

consultants  many  of  whom  were  formerly  in  Government

service or in the university.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is both foolish and dangerous to maintain the notion

that  the more money one is called upon to shell out  to  a

foreign expert.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



the  greater the quality of his expertise and wisdom.  More

often than not, the expertise of these foreign experts have

proven  to be wide of the mark simply because they are  not

familiar with existing local situations, and the net result

is often a precious waste of both time and money. A pool of

wisdom  created from among our own citizens should prove  a

source   of  inspiration  that  can  fuel  many  worthwhile

policies, innovations and reforms of real practical  value.

Let  us  not  waste any time in creating such a source  for

dynamism in the education mill,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have started to look closely and critically

at  our  educational system, we can hope to make some  real

progress.  I  hope  that the new spirit  of  criticism  and

inquiry is viewed in a positive and optimistic light by all

concerned. What we need for the future may be education "in

questions   rather   than  answers"  as   one   educational

sociologist  puts  it.  For  teachers,  administrators  and

students it sounds a workable philosophy, for education  in

questions pre-supposes education in the right answers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  the middle of last year the Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister of Defence revealed a piece of very  alarming

news  that over the past 10 years more than $1,000  million

had  been  spent by the Government just to create  a  large

number  of  educated illiterates. According to  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister, these illiterates mainly came from English

schools  with a non-English speaking family background.  If

this  is  so  and if in future more and more  parents  send

their children to English schools, will it not result in  a

situation  in  which more and more money will  have  to  be

spent  to create still more illiterates? This is the  state

of  affairs  which is causing alarm and concern  among  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that parents expect their children to grow up into

celebrities is understandable. If there could be a Muhammad

Ali in Singapore, I believe our parents would also want  to

send  their children to some boxing school. What corrective

measure does the Ministry have to rectify such an incorrect

choice by parents?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, UNESCO conducted a certain survey of certain

countries which were ex-colonies. The report of the  survey

revealed   that   those  countries   which,   since   their

independence, still continue to adopt the language of their

former  suzerain  power as a medium of  education,  despite

spending  millions of dollars are still lagging far  behind

in  social and economic development as compared with  other

countries whose educational medium is their mother  tongue,

or  with  countries  which pay equal  importance  to  their

mother tongue and the former colonial language. They opined

that  modern  educational system should contribute  towards

the economic, social and cultural development of a country.

They  criticised the educational system left behind by  the

colonial  power  as "Schools meant only  to  produce  civil

servants  who  could  not engage themselves  in  productive

work."  "Such educational system has destroyed the national

cultural  values  and  character  of  those  countries  and

created  a group of foreigners out of their own nationals".

Such  observations are also to be found in the speeches  of

our political leaders. Why is this so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an African scholar, Abdou Mounouni, who said

that  in  the  past the Education Ministry in  the  African

state  defended  and  implemented the  colonial  system  of

education  left behind by the colonial power.  They  argued

that  if  education  was  based  on  their  mother  tongue,

complicated  problems would arise. Although they  advocated

educational  reforms, they never interfered with  the  sole

use  of  the  colonial language as a medium of instruction.

literacy  and the mass media. Therefore, the colonial  type

of  educational relic developed into the foundation of  the

education system of an independent nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we care to study what I have quoted, we would

know  that the cause for anxiety and confusion which  exist

in  our education system at present could be attributed  to

the neglect of our national culture and mother tongue. That

is   why  our  political  leaders  have  today  once  again

emphasised  that education must be relevant to  production,

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



incidence  of  juvenile crimes must be  reduced,  that  our

young  people  should be instilled with  the  correct  work

ethics, and that we should return to our mother tongue  and

writing at once, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking about the values of the languages and the

cultures  of  the  various  races  and  the  importance  of

English, the Prime Minister has clearly indicated that  for

our economic reasons English is most important. However, in

our  multi-racial and multi-cultural context,  if  we  only

study  English it is a great folly because it will separate

ourselves from our cultural roots. He also emphasised  that

we  must  let our younger generation strike root  in  their

respective  languages and cultures and  at  the  same  time

arrive  at  the  largest  common ground  through  a  second

language  (i.e.  English), in the context of  living  in  a

multiracial  and  multi-cultural society. He  also  frankly

pointed  out that after 15 years of heart-searching  for  a

solution,  we  have come to adopt the policy  of  bilingual

education  -the  mother  tongue  and  English.  The   Prime

Minister  has said that our ultimate decision and objective

is  to  have a bilingual education policy. This will  be  a

foundation for our future education policy as well  as  the

ballast for our multi-racial society.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make two points here. I believe that we

must   resolutely   proceed  with  our   bilingual   policy

thoroughly in spite of difficulties. We should not give  up

such  a  policy as a failure merely because of  some  minor

drawbacks  in the way. I would like to remind the  Minister

that  our  bilingual policy has been implemented  only  two

years  ago.  So we should continue to carry  it  out  to  a

successful conclusion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  the views expressed by the Member for Punggol  and

the  Member for Anson against the priority admission  of  a

child into a primary school through the sterilisation of  a

parent. This is an immoral



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



incentive.  Sir, the Archbishop of Singapore has  expressed

his views as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The proposal to grant privileges on admission to a

Catholic  school to children one of whose parents has  been

known  to  be sterilised is not acceptable to the  Catholic

church  on grounds of conscience. To accord such privileges

is incompatible with the moral teaching which specifies our

Catholic church. At no time has the Catholic church, either

directly  or  indirectly,  approved  of  the  granting   of

privileges on admission to a child one of whose parents  is

known  to have been sterilised. This is for us a matter  of

conscience.'



<br>Sir,  since  the Archbishop of Singapore has expressed  his

disapproval  of  the sterilisation of the parents  so  that

their child could be admitted into a Catholic school, may I

suggest  to the Minister for Home Affairs and Education  to

review  this  policy  and to accord a discussion  with  the

Archbishop of Singapore and other Christian leaders on this

moral issue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   we   have   heard  a  number  of  Members   speaking

enthusiastically  on education. I endorse  their  views  in

many  respects. But I feel that education in  Singapore  is

not  entirely a fiasco. I feel that we have been successful

in our education insofar as providing primary education for

all  our children is concerned. We have also increased  the

provision for education to $390 million for this  year  and

it  now  takes the fourth position in the entire allocation

of Government expenditure, This vote is to maintain as well

as  develop various stages of our national education.  This

is  only  right.  It  also shows how  much  importance  our

Government   has  given  to  the  question  of   education.

Undoubtedly  education occupies a very important  place  in

nation  building. It is only with universal  education  and

the  development of talents of our people that we are  able

to proceed with nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past few years there have been

far  too many changes in our education policy, as has  been

mentioned by other Members in this House. The main  changes

relate  to  exposure  time  for  second  language  and  the

extension  of primary education from six to seven  or  nine

years.   These   issues  have  caused  much  confusion   in

educational circles. Even those in the school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



inspectorate are confused because when questions are  asked

of them, the school inspectors are not able to give a clear

answer.  They  just  give  a very  vague  answer  on  these

matters.  In  this regard I would like to  ask  the  Senior

Minister of State to clarify the whole position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the question of emphasis

on  teaching  the second language. On 23rd October, 1972  a

circular  was  issued by the Ministry of Education  to  all

primary  schools to the effect that from 1973 the  exposure

time  for second language should be increased from  18%  to

25% of the total curriculum, and that by 1974 such exposure

time was to be increased to 33.3%. Again, it also says that

by  1975 the exposure time should be increased to 40%.  But

surprisingly, on 19th September, 1974 another  circular  was

issued  to  all principals of primary schools saying  that,

dependent on Circumstances in each school, principals would

be  allowed  to  adjust the exposure time  for  the  second

language  so  long  as  it would not  drop  below  25%.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, does the second circular signify a relaxation

of  the  policy on second language? I would also  like  the

Senior Minister of State to clarify this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to refer to the question of redundancy

of  teachers in Chinese schools. I understand that  in  the

first semester of this year there are a number of redundant

teachers in some Chinese schools. I would like to know  how

many  Chinese school teachers in the primary and  secondary

schools have become redundant, and what is the Ministry  of

Education going to do about them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know how many English schools are

under-staffed. According to my understanding  these  vacant

posts  are  manned by relief teachers. This is an  abnormal

situation. I would also like the Senior Minister  of  State

to  answer  this and inform the House how is  he  going  to

tackle such problems.

feel  that the Government has got to give a review in  this

respect.  When the Member for Paya Lebar spoke  in  Chinese

just now, many students in the Strangers Gallery had to put

on  their  earphones to listen to him. I suppose they  must

have  come from the English stream, This goes to show  that

there  is  something  wrong with  our  bilingual  education

policy as a result of which these "guinea pigs" (not guinea

pigs  as  mentioned by the Member for Anson) in the  public

gallery have to use earphones.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the names of 14 Members on my list,

the  last  one  being the Member for Bukit  Merah  who  has

expressed  his  feelings  on  the  failure  of  our  second

language  policy. Sir, as far as I know, 14 is the  largest

number  of Members to have spoken on a single head in  this

Budget  debate.  In a way I am honoured  but  I  am  a  bit

nervous having to reply to so many questions. I have  tried

to  take down as fast as I could the points raised by these 14  Members, but I am quite sure I have missed out quite  a

few of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I answer the various questions raised by these 14

Members,  I would first like to thank them for the interest

they   have  shown  towards  our  education  system.  Their

speeches  give me the impression that Singapore's education

system  has  failed  badly, although a few  do  not  agree,

saying  that  we have done not so badly. Is  it  true  that

Singapore's  education has failed?  Personally,  I  do  not

think  so.  Singapore's education system, like  any  other

education  system  in  the world, has  its  fair  share  of

shortcomings.  I  accept  that  there  is  ample  room  for

improvement  in our education system. The question  rightly

should  be, have we done enough? Could we have done  better

if  we were given a second chance to do it again? I am  not

so sure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, we have not done too badly. Our

education  is regarded as one of the test in this  part  of

the world. Sir, in the field of education everyone of us is

an expert



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



of  some sort. We have at least gone through many years  of

school  life. We have at least talked and read a lot  about

educational problems. In addition to school life,  some  of

us  have a few years of teaching experience. We are  either

the  brothers  or parents of some pupils in schools.  Under

these circumstances, it appears to me that the best line of

defence  is  to  receive all criticisms with  a  smile  and

proceed  to  analyse  all the constructive  criticisms  for

facts  and  figures  that  may  help  us  to  improve   our

educational efficiency. Education is teaching our young the

proper values and knowledge and preparing them to face  the

real  life  situation some 15 or 20 years later  when  they

grow  up.  So in the process a lot of unknowns have  to  be

faced.  When we are solving unknowns, the chances of making

mistakes  are very much greater and changes are unavoidable

in order to achieve better results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since Singapore attained self-government, there have

been  a  lot  of  changes in our society in the  political,

economic and social fields. Under such circumstances, it is

unavoidable   that  some  corresponding  changes   in   our

education  system  have to be made. We  all  know  that  no

matter  how  accurate our prediction is, we can  hardly  be

sure  of what is going to happen, say, five years from now.

So  it  is not possible for an educational system to remain

static  all  the time. Sir, we inherited from the  colonial

days  four  separate educational systems. So at  least  the

first change which we should do is to try to form them into

a single system and, of course, this change is unavoidable.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the various questions, especially the

communication  gap raised by the Member for Jalan  Kayu,  I

would  like  to  inform  the House  that  the  Ministry  of

Education   has  recently  undergone  some   changes.   The

Permanent  Secretary  and  his three  deputies  were  newly

appointed. The Permanent Secretary has made it a  point  to

visit the schools every week together with his deputies.  I

am sure that this will at least



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



improve   the  understanding  between  Ministry  officials,

school  principals and teachers. So let us  hope  that  the

communication gap will be narrowed as much as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah raised a few questions on

primary  school dropouts, second language policy,  the  PPP

system,   the   population   education   seminar   recently

conducted, teachers with "0" level qualifications  teaching

in  Secondary  IV.  On the question of  teachers  with  "0"

levels  teaching in Secondary IV. I would like to say  that

this  is true. We do not like then to do that. But it is  a

fact  that  the  Ministry  is faced  with  the  problem  of

shortage of graduate teachers. These shortages are felt  in

the area of English. Mathematics and Physical sciences. The

teachers   with  "0"  level  qualifications   teaching   in

Secondary IV are those who mainly teach the languages. They

are  normally teachers with more than 10 years' experience.

Sir,  I have some figures here which indicate that teachers

with  "0" level qualifications are mainly teaching  English

as  a second language in Chinese schools. There are also  a

few  Mathematics  teachers  with "0"  level  qualifications

teaching Mathematics. These are the two main areas. But  as

I  said they are teachers with long years of experience who

have  picked  up sufficient knowledge and the  decision  to

allow such teachers to teach in Secondary IV rests with the

principals.  The  principals  must  have  found  that  such

teachers are capable of teaching the subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of primary school dropouts, primary

school  pupils who sit for the PSLE when they have  reached

the age of 1 4 years are those who have been retained twice

during  the primary stage of education. Under our existing'

system  when they are superannuated they are encouraged  to

enrol  in vocational preparatory classes organised  by  the

Adult  Education Board. The latest change  of  providing  a

maximum  of nine years in Primary means all those who  fail

again  in  the  eighth year will receive a  ninth  year  of

education. The curriculum for the ninth year will be a mono-lingual  one,  and it will consist of the learning  of  one

language, basic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



arithmetic, craft work and workshop practice for  boys  and

handwork  or home economics for the girls plus  civics  and

moral  education, some physical education, health education

and  singing, to make it more interesting. The  purpose  of

craft  work  and  workshop practice,  hand  work  and  home

economics   is   to  prepare  the  pupils   concerned   for

employment.  The details of these courses are being  worked

out  in  collaboration  with  other  Ministries, statutory

bodies, industries and commercial organisations. We believe

that this strategy will help pupils to become literate  and

to become useful citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of Education for Living, this subject is

aimed  to  inculcate moral and ethical values in our  young

pupils.  From  Primary Ill upwards, apart from  Civics  and

Ethics,   the   curriculum  also  comprises   History   and

Geography.  At  Primary IV, V and VI  levels,  it  includes

topics  on  the  preparation of working and living  in  the

adult  world,  such as the fostering of  right  values  and

attitude  towards honest labour, family budgetting,  habits

for  saving,  consumer education, population education  and

knowledge about the functions of the various occupations in

our  society.  This  is done with the object  of  educating

those  who can make the grade and those who have  to  leave

school after the primary stage. It must be recognised  that

at  the primary stage when children are still rather  young

and  physically undeveloped, physical skill training is not

provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of exposure time for the second language,

may   I   inform  Hon.  Members  that  the  rationale   for

bilingualism remains as relevant in our present context  as

it  did  when the policy on compulsory learning of a second

language was first announced more than 10 years ago.  There

is  no  intention whatsoever to change this policy. In  the

implementation   of   this   bilingual   policy,   however,

flexibility  in respect of exposure time and  the  rate  of

learning  must  be accepted. This is because  a  number  of

factors  such  as  the availability of  properly  qualified

staff  able to teach a second language competently  and  to

use  it  effectively  as  the medium  of  instruction,  the

availability  of suitable instructional materials  and  the

availability of suitable general reading



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



materials must be taken into account. Thus the trend is not

towards under-exposure but is a realistic response  to  the

situation as it exists in our schools. It is the policy  of

the  Ministry  that  those  who  aspire  to  pursue  higher

education  are  expected to know a  second  language  well.

Those  who  are  unlikely  to go  beyond  Primary  VI  may,

therefore,  concentrate  on one  language  as  it  will  be

unrealistic to expect them to know a second language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Primary Pilot Project, the PPP as

it  is  commonly known, is a child centred approach towards

achieving  the  outcome  as  spelt  out  in  our   national

syllabus.  All  the materials which include  the  teaching-unit,  readers and work-cards have been tried Out  in  some

schools  and  revised  and, based on  feedback  from  these

schools, they are then released for publication. Principals

and   teachers   have  the  professional   prerogative   to

scrutinise, to evaluate and hence to adopt, adapt or reject

the  use of these teaching units, each according to his own

professional judgment.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chai, I am giving you 10 minutes more

than  you are entitled. Perhaps if you could hasten  a  bit

you might be able to finish your reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Yes, I will try, Sir,It has been

found  that  PPP  is  very  useful  in  terms  of  language

development but it is very demanding for teachers to  adopt

the  system.  So  the  Ministry  in  reviewing  the  system

realises  that not as many teachers as we thought  like  to

teach  under  this  system. As it is  very  demanding,  the

Ministry has no objection to those principals who  wish  to

carry  on. We also have no objection to those who  want  to

revert  to  the traditional system. The materials developed

by PPP so far-have been found to be very useful and it will

be  used by schools, if not as teaching materials, then  as

supplementary materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few more matters which I want to clarify concern

population education. It is definitely not the intention of

the Ministry to teach



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



birth  control or sex education in primary schools.  It  is

essential to teach our younger generation the broad concept

of  a  small  family so that when they grow up  and  become

parents themselves they will keep their families small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterilisation is an issue raised by a few Members. I

would  like  to  say that this policy is  not  new,  It  is

actually a revision by the Ministry after having taken into

account the various representations. It is true that one of

the   churches  does  not  agree  to  it  but  we  do   see

representatives from churches and the majority of  them  do

not  object (if not agree) to this national policy.  It  is

actually  a  revision  taking  into  account  the   various

suggestions  made  by  members  of  the  public.  We   have

definitely  no  intention  to  meddle  with  the  religious

beliefs but national policy should take precedence over any

other policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Members again for their interest

and  if  there  is  anything which they would  like  me  to

answer. I shall be glad to do so.

in  the matter of high-rise fires raised by the Member  for

Kim Seng?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I give my consent. Do I have the general

assent of Hon. Members?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, due to

insufficient coverage in press reports concerning the reply

I  made to a question raised by the Member for Kim Seng  on

high-rise  fires, I wish to clarify some of  the  points  I

made on fire safety in HDB flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have stated is from the point of view of the Fire

Brigade  in  terms  of overcoming some of the  difficulties

faced  by  firemen in having to carry the  fire  hoses  and

other equipment with them when climbing up the stairs where

the lifts are rendered unusable. From the point of view  of

fire  safety, the HDB flats are quite safe. Such flats  are

constructed  of  non-combustible material.  There  is  also

little  danger  of  a  fire-spread  since  the  flats   are

separated by fire-resisting walls and floors, and  hence  a

fire  originating  in  one flat will  be  confined  to  the

affected flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the private high-rise flats, :here are staircases in

addition  to  lifts in HDB flats. Modern and  sophisticated

fire   protection  equipment, like  sprinklers  and  smoke

detectors,  are  only  required in  office  and  commercial

buildings  because  of  the greater amount  of  combustible

material  used and stored. Furthermore, in these commercial

high-rise  buildings, the  installation  of  central  air-conditioning  enhances  the  chances  of  fire  and   smoke

spreading through the air-conditioning ducts. For  the  HDB

flats  and  other  private  high-rise  flats,  it  is   not

necessary  to  install such expensive equipment  which  are

intended  as  warning and automatic devices  to  deal  with

fires  which might have started in portions of  office  and

commercial buildings which are not always occupied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Fire Brigade has experienced no difficulty

at  all  in dealing with fires occurring in HDB flats,  The

few  fires that occurred were put out within minutes of the

arrival of fire engines. For example, a fire



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



which broke out on the 10th floor flat at Chin Swee Road on

22nd October, 1975 was immediately put out by two  jets  of

water  without difficulty. Similar fires which occurred  in

HDB  flats  at  Outram Park, Toa Payoh and Bendemeer  Road.

were also quickly extinguished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brigade has conducted regular fire drills in high-rise buildings. Fire exercises have been conducted in

selected  HDB flats as part of the pre-fire planning  which

is  being  carried out by the Brigade to familiarise  their

men  with the layout of the premises, and to give them  on-the-spot  training  in  tactical fire-fighting  and  rescue

operations  in  HDB  flats.  To  increase  the  operational

efficiency  of the Fire Brigade, recently three  new  water

tenders,  one  emergency  tender,  one  30-metre  hydraulic

platform, a dry chemical truck, and six light water tenders

have  been  acquired, and orders have been placed  for  two

more  water tenders. The Brigade has also acquired a mobile

control  unit  for facilitating effective communication  in

the  event  of a high-rise fire, and a breathing  apparatus

vehicle equipped with breathing apparatuses for use at  the

fire ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, fire safety in HDB flats, for that matter,

any  building,  will depend upon the residents  themselves,

for  they  must  cultivate  good  fire  safety  habits  and

understand the need to exercise greater caution and be more

fire conscious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience has shown that fires are often caused by

carelessness and complacency. We must inculcate  the  habit

of exercising constant vigilance against any fire hazard in

our  homes  and daily life. Simple measures like forbidding

children  to  play with matches and inflammable substances,

or  making  sure that naked flames are not left unattended,

or  that cooking and electrical appliances are switched off

after use, can be easily observed, and do not require  much

time or effort. In addition, residents should also learn to

handle    simple   fire-fighting   equipment,    such    as

extinguishers, so that they will be able to put out a  fire

in  its  initial stage and thus help to prevent fire-spread

and unnecessary damage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brigade conducts short courses in fire-fighting and

fire  protection  for  occupants  of  high-rise  buildings,

industrial workers and members of the public. Every year, a

Fire Brigade Week is also organised. Exhibitions to educate

the  public  on  fire  safety measures  are  also  held  in

conjunction  with the campaign. Pamphlets and brochures  in

different  languages such as Fire in Your  Home  and  Check

list for Fire Safety in Homes are distributed to members of

the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope more people will take advantage of these

educational programmes so that collectively we can help  to

promote fire safety in the Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Sir, I am glad to have this opportunity

to  correct  any misconception that may arise  out  of  the

observations made by the Member for Kim Seng yesterday with

regard  to  fire safety precautionary measures  in  Housing

Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, the Housing and Development Board has been

accused of many things, some of them deserved, most of them

undeserved.  The  implication made  that  the  Housing  and

Development  Board  does not provide  minimum  fire  safety

precautions or does not incorporate safeguards against fire

in HDB flats is most undeserved and unfair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has made a thorough study of the fire prevention

aspects  in  the design of its flats and as  a  result  the

flats  are designed and built so that there is a relatively

lower fire risk,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fires in homes are mostly caused by short-circuit of old

electrical wires concealed in ceilings; often they start in

the  kitchen. There are no concealed ceilings in HDB  flats

and all wirings are exposed enabling easy identification of

faults  and  rectification.  Any  electrical  point  to  be

installed  and  any renovation or change in design  of  the

flat  have  to  be approved by the Board. The  wirings  are

renewed  at intervals of 15 to 20 years. There is therefore

less  chance of fire occurring due to old wiring  or  short

circuits inside the ceiling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flats are built of reinforced concrete, bricks or

hollow bricks which are also non-combustible. The risk of a

major  fire  is  greater  in hotels,  departmental  stores,

commercial  buildings  and store houses  where  combustible

materials are likely to be stored. The combustible material

in HDB flats are limited to a small amount of furniture and

furnishings.  The  HDB  is  very strict  in  ensuring  that

commercial and industrial activities are not carried out in

its flats. The use of charcoal and wood for cooking is also

prohibited. We know of one instance where a goldsmith  made

illegal  use  of  his  flat and he probably  used  an  oxy-acetylene  torch  to  design his jewellery.  There  was  an

explosion but the fire did not spread.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many casualties in a fire are due to the victims being

overcome by smoke, But staircases in HDB flats are made  of

concrete  and  will  not  burn. These  staircases  are  not

enclosed. They are open and smoke cannot build up to impede

access.  In  slab blocks, several concrete staircases  with

access  to common corridors which are fully ventilated  are

provided.  So the chances of being overcome by smoke  in  a

HDB  flat  in a fire are almost negligible. The  flats  are

designed in such a way that fire occurring in one apartment

is  unlikely to spread to another. Our experience has shown

that  the  design  to contain fire is successful  for  fire

occurring in 2, 3, 4 and 5-room flats had not spread  after

burning up the contents within the flat itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in 1 --room flats, fires have spread from one

flat to the adjoining flat through open BRC wire-mesh below

the  ceiling.  Hon. Members will remember  that  complaints

were  made  against sealing these openings in  the  present

debate  and the reply given was that they have to be closed

in  order  to  prevent  fire  from  spreading.  It  is  not

fortuitous that there have been no raging infernos  in  HDB

flats. It is by design that the Fire God has not been given

the opportunity to vent his fury there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB is fully aware of the danger of fire occurring in

high-rise  buildings and has minimised fire  risks  in  the

design and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



structure  of its flats. There is a relatively  lower  fire

risk  in HDB flats and the anti-fire measures mentioned  by

the  Member  for  Kim Seng need not be installed.  For  his

information and for the information of Members, even luxury

high-rise  flats  built  by  private  enterprises  are  not

required  to  instal  them.  To prevent  alarm  among  flat

dwellers, let me say that sprinklers, or the smoke or  heat

detecting  systems, are required by law to be installed  in

hotels,   commercial   and   industrial   buildings   only.

Residential buildings are not required to instal them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprinklers are very expensive items and need only be

installed where necessary. Smoke and heat systems  are  not

practical  in  flats  and  homes  as  smoke  and  heat  are

generated in the kitchen and will set them off. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  like  to assure Members  that  the  safety,

comfort and wellbeing of its tenants are uppermost  in  the

minds of HDB and the Board will continue to improve on  the

design  and  structure of its flats  not  only  to  prevent

occurrence   of   raging  infernos  but  also   to   enable

Singaporeans to build a comfortable home.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask a

supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Minister willing to reply to the

supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, the fact still remains that fires do

occur  in  Housing  Board  flats, Therefore  some  sort  of

preventive  measure is necessary, as prevention  is  better

than cure. Sir, does the Minister not think so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, fire has also occurred

in  my  home. But what is the Member implying when he  says

that the Housing Board flats are a fire hazard and they are

dangerous? I have already explained that having studied the

occurrence  and the whys and wherefores of fire in  Housing

Board  flats, these flats are so designed that they have  a

relatively lower fire risk.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I do not quite agree

with what the Minister has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



said in his reply to the Member for Bras Basah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, our schools are built of incombustible

materials,  They  are built of concrete and  solid  bricks,

unlike  Housing  Board  flats which  are  built  of  hollow

bricks.  If  my  memory is right, there is the  requirement

that a fire hose must be provided in every school. I do not

mean  that  in every school floor there must  be  one  fire

prevention  equipment  but  there  should  be  one  in  the

building.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, will the Minister

please consider a sustained and intensive national campaign

of  public  education through schools,  community  centres,

commercial enterprises, the press, radio and television, on

the Dos and Don'ts of fire prevention and fire-fighting?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, the reason which led me to ask the

question just now is that the Minister was so confident and

proud  of the fact that it is not fortuitous but by  design

that there have been no raging infernos in H DB flats.  But

the  fact is, by his own admission, that fire still  occurs

in Housing Board flats. If this statement is not corrected,

he  may be giving misleading information to the public that

the Housing Board flats are really fire-proof. They are not

fire-proof.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the fire that has occurred was due

to human frailties. No matter how fire-proof a building is,

fire  can still occur as there may be children playing with

matches or fire may occur due to acts of mischief. But  the

fact is that fire is contained in Housing Board flats. I am

proud of the fact



and  I think we should all be proud of the fact ----- that

during  the last 16 years there has not been a raging  fire

in  the  1 20,000 units of HDB flats. This is a tribute  to

the  architects in the Housing Board who have  designed  to

make the flats fire-proof.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> As the Minister has said, there is an

element of human frailty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, I want to stress to

the  Minister  the  importance of  a  sufficiency  of  fire

hydrants  in  all housing estates. I wonder  if  there  are

sufficient fire hydrants in all HDB estates.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, in answer to the question by

the  Member  for Mountbatten, the answer is "yes".  I  have

stated that the fires which have occurred in Housing  Board

flats  were  all put out quickly because there  are  enough

fire hydrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the question by the Member for Kim Seng, we

will  sustain  the  campaign on fire  prevention.  We  have

carried  Out  this  campaign for many  years  at  community

centres  and Housing Board estates. We also have a national

campaign  at the Victoria Memorial Hall a couple  of  years

ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head V (cont.) --



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was expecting the reply of the Senior

Minister of State for Education to be more elucidating  and

encouraging.  However, I must say that his reply  has  been

most   pathetic.  It  was  nothing  more  than  a  pathetic

mitigation.  Parliament is the last place for us  to  plead

for  mitigation.  What  the Hon. Members  wanted  are  firm

commitments  as  to  what  the Minister  would  direct  the

Ministry  to do. What we heard from the Minister  of  State

was a mere restating of the various policies. He gave us  a

very  good lecture on the contents of the various subjects.

These are not what we want. We want a firm commitment  from

the Minister in categorical terms as to what line of action

he  would take to correct all these mistakes that have been

plaguing the principals, teachers, parents and students.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how many sinecures there are in the

Ministry of Education, perhaps the Minister can tell the

House. He told us that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



as  a  result  of reorganisation some senior officers  have

been  removed.  But  he did not tell us  why  these  senior

officers were removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most unsatisfactory reply I have heard is that on the

PPP. This is only one of the minor problems. In fact, there

were  many  other problems mentioned by Members.  In  areas

where  teachers  and principals should be given  some  free

hand  to decide, they were not given. But in the matter  of

"tried  failure", as I have said in my speech in the debate

on  the  Budget statement, the Minister suddenly became  so

generous  that he said. "We will leave it to the principals

and  the  teachers to decide whether or not  to  adopt  the

PPP."  Why this sudden generosity? This is not the  way  to

cover  up a mistake. If it is a mistake, let us acknowledge

that  it  is a mistake, Let us be brave or bold  enough  to

declare that we will discontinue with the PPP, But no, that

was  not  to  be  the  case. So in  the  end,  if  all  the

principals were to decide to drop the PPP, there would  not

be  any more PPP classes in Singapore. And then quietly the

Ministry  will say, "There you are. There are no  more  PPP

classes."  The  Ministry  can thus  achieve  its  objective

without  having  to  admit in this  House  that  it  was  a

failure.  I want to hear from the Minister whether  or  not

the  PPP was a failure, and whether or not the Ministry  is

going to discontinue with the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer the Minister to Hansard. Vol. 34, No. 18,

col.  1317, dated 20th November, 1975 where at that  sitting

of  Parliament  the  Senior  Minister  of  State  committed

himself  that  the  PPP  would  be  incorporated  into  the

education  system. I would like to know from  the  Minister

since  when  this  change of heart  took  place,  that  is,

between November 1975 when he gave the answer to a question

from  the Member for Serangoon Gardens and now. He  made  a

firm commitment that he would incorporate the PPP into  our

education system, And yet today the principals are given  a

free  hand.  I can assure you, Sir, that this is  one  free

hand which the principals would not want.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question on the six or seven-year

primary  education  in  the restructured  education  system

which many Members have raised. We have not heard from  the

Minister up till now whether this system is on or  off.  My

understanding is that the restructured education system, as

has  been  pointed out by the Member for Telok Blangah, is

still-born. I have also stated in the debate on the  Budget

that  it is still-born. Yet the teachers are still required

to attend the evaluation courses. God help us as to what is

going  on  in  the Ministry of Education!  They  have  been

playing  with guinea pigs long enough. We do  not  want  to

continue to be guinea pigs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  voice my deep regret that the Government has chosen  to

retain  the  use  of  sterilisation  as  an  incentive  for

admission to schools. Sir, there is no disagreement on  the

need   for  population  control;  neither  have  I   strong

objection to preference being given to a two-child  family,

though one could argue reasonably about the human rights of

every  child  born  into  this  world  by  mistake  or   by

intention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some questions that Government should consider

carefully.  Is it necessary at all to use sterilisation  to

achieve  population  control?  Are  there  no  other   less

objectionable  means?  In any case,  how  many  babies  are

thereby prevented from being conceived? Is it right at  all

for  the  majority  to ignore the strong convictions  of  a

minority?  What will it cost to the majority to reject  the

use  of  sterilisation as a means of obtaining priority  of

admission?  Sir, let me emphasise here that  the  right  to

govern  is not in question at all here. What I question  is

whether  the  same  objective, namely, population  control,

cannot  be  attained  by less objectionable  means.  Surely

Government should try to accommodate as many points of view

as  possible  without having to sacrifice  its  basic  good

objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, Sir, Members are aware of the valuable

contributions  that  the  Catholic  schools  have  made  in

Singapore -contributions to the stability, growth and well-being of Singapore by producing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>





good  citizens with the right values and attitudes.  People

may  choose to question about values and systems of values,

but   I  think  there  are  boundaries  beyond  which   the

Government should not intrude upon, unless there  are  good

rational  reasons for doing so. In the case  of  population

control, why take on sterilisation and use that as a  lever

to  get people to practise population control? Even in  the

case  of  abortion,  it  is clearly  a  very  objectionable

measure.  The  Catholic stand is very simple, namely,  that

human beings are more than mere animals, I can bring my cat

or  dog  to  the  veterinary department  for  sterilisation

because  I  do  not want the cat or the dog to proliferate,

but human beings are totally a different matter altogether.

The Government is only a temporary guardian of the land. It

is  made  up  of  individuals who are mortal  and  all  are

subject to the same law of God.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the specific point

of  the  PPP raised by the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister   for  Labour,  I  did  say  that  it   would   be

incorporated into the education system. But that was on the

understanding that it is workable. As I understand it, and

I still maintain, the PPP itself as an approach to teaching

is  good.  But  unfortunately, although it is theoretically

good,  in  practice it is highly demanding on our teachers,

We  do  not  have  that many suitable teachers  and,  as  a

result, we have to say that if the principals and teachers

feel that they can cope with it they can carry on. This  is

in line with our latest change of policy whereby principals

were  given more authority to decide what is best for their

schools,  basing  on  the overall  concept  of  the  policy

decided by the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the six or seven years of primary education, I

would  like  to  clarify to the House  that  with  the  re-introduction of the retention system, the question of seven

years  does  not  arise  at  all.  Basically,  our  primary

education is still six years. Whether one wants to call  it

a  still-born restructured education, or by whatever  name,

the question of seven years does not arise now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of sterilisation, I fully agree that this

is something which is very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



personal. I did say just now that this is a condition  for

a  privilege. We are not forcing it on anyone. If  any  one

feels that sterilisation is against his religious belief, I

am  not  asking him to undergo sterilisation. A policy  may

sometimes be unpleasant, but I suppose a certain amount  of

tolerance is expected of citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am still a little

confused.  Would the Minister of State categorically  state

in  this House whether the restructured education scheme is

on or off? Even the teachers and the principals are arguing

among  themselves whether the restructured education scheme

is on or off.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an education system,

unfortunately, may be called by many names.  When  we  make

some  modifications, then another name is given. If we were

to  say  that the restructured education system is  off,  I

would agree that the name is not in use any more. Regarding

the   six   years'  primary  education,  there  have   been

modifications and changes. It is not true to say  that  all

changes  are  entirely off and that there is  no  value  in

training the teachers. But if Members refer to the specific

term, yes, I agree that it is not used any more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, in the restructured education

system,  as  announced by the ex-Minister for Education,  I

think  the  fundamental  feature of  that  system  is  that

children  in Primary VI need not have to sit for the  PSLE,

The  question  now asked by parents and teachers  is  this:

with  the  recent announcement by the present Minister  for

Education,  are  we going to introduce or  reintroduce  the

Primary VI School Leaving Examination?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, there will be an annual

assessment.  Therefore, the PSLE, or whatever  name  it  is

called   will  be  different  in  nature,  In  the   annual

assessment, the child has to pass at every level. And  when

he  reaches  Primary  VI,  of  course,  there  will  be  an

examination.  If Members still want to call  it  the  PSLE.

then it will be so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I think the Senior Minister of

State  has  missed my point. In the restructured  education

system,  it  has  been pointed out that there  will  be  no

Primary VI School Leaving Examination of the old system  to

determine  whether the child will proceed to  the  academic

stream   or  the  technical  stream  to  do  his  secondary

education.  And if the child failed the PSLE, he  would  be

considered  a  dropout. The restructured  education  system

therefore   abolished  this  criterion  or  assessment   to

determine whether or not the child could proceed  with  his

secondary   education.   The  impression   given   by   the

announcement  of the new restructured education  system  is

that  every child irrespective of his performance in school

(although  it  will be based on assessment) will  go  to  a

secondary school according to his aptitude. But then  every

child is assured of a post primary education. That was  the

impression given. Nobody should worry about PSLE any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now with the recent announcement, do we take it that

there will still be a weeding out of the failures? In other

words, those children who pass the PSLE examination will go

to secondary schools, and those who fail will have to grope

around  and  find  whatever education is available  in  the

Adult  Education Board and other private schools.  This  is

quite  an important question but we are not able to  get  a

definite answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> I fully understand the question. The

PSLE  was  based on the non-retention or partial  retention

system.  It means that when a child reached Primary  VI  he

would sit for the PSLE, and having passed he would then  go

to  the  secondary schools. Therefore, once  the  retention

system  is  introduced, there will have  to  be  an  annual

assessment including Primary VI. If the children  pass  the

Primary  VI examination they will go to secondary  schools.

If  they  do  not  pass the examination  then,  as  I  have

mentioned   just  now  about  the  so-called  nine   years'

schooling, they will be channelled to do various courses of

training. This is actually the difference. Whether we  like

it or not, we cannot do away with the examination system at

the moment. We need the examination to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



assess  and  select  which children will  go  to  secondary

schools and which children cannot go to secondary schools.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister of

State has improved somewhat from omission to ambiguity.  He

has made all of us more confused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding of the restructured education system was

that  it  would do away with the PSLE which was a  kind  of

objective  examination  that  allowed  the  pupils   during

examination  to  gamble as to whether  or  not  the  answer

provided was right or wrong. We realise the adversities and

the  weakness of this system and therefore the restructured

system  introduced an assessment at Primary III to cause  a

diversification  of  two streams, one  towards  six  years'

primary  education  and  the  other  towards  seven  years'

primary education. At the end of six or seven years, there

would  be  a  second assessment. But the understanding  was

that  such an assessment would not be on the lines  of  the

PSLE  where  a student ticks away answers to questions.  It

would  be an assessment based on the yearly performance  of

the pupils as they proceed upwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us for the time being forget about the non-retention

of  students. This is going to complicate things much worse

if  we  start talking about it at this stage. I agree  with

the  Member  for  Moulmein that what is necessary  at  this

stage  is  a  categorical  statement  by  the  Ministry  of

Education  on  what is happening now with the  restructured

system.  Are  we having a seven-year primary education  and

would there be a selection process undertaken at that point

to  stream  some pupils to the nine-year primary education?

And  what kind of selection process is going to be held  at

that  point?  Sir,  can the Minister  answer  my  questions

before I ask more questions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I answered a

question just now. I said that there is no such thing as  a

seven-year  primary education. There will be no  seven-year

primary  education. It is still Primary  VI  and  there  is

assessment. It is true that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



PSLE, or  by whatever name it is called, will most  likely

remain the same because we need a selection examination and

so  we  have  to continue with the PSLE. So the Member  for

Moulmein   can   rightly  say  that  the   PSLE   will   be

reintroduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister of

State has not replied to the second point that I raised. It

is  with  regard to girls in Secondary I and II  having  to

attend a three-hour session at the workshop once a week. In

that  respect, would the Ministry consider scrapping it  or

give  the parents an option? I pointed out that the parents

wanted  their daughters to take home economics  because  it

would be beneficial to them in their future years when they

marry and have their own families. Home economics is a good

course  for  them to learn in their teens, especially  when

they  are in Secondary I and II. At the moment. I am  given

to  understand that at the end of a two-year stint  at  the

workshops, the girls are given an aptitude test. I am  also

given  to understand that many girls prefer to fail  rather

than  pass  the  test because they do not  like  to  pursue

technical education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, will the Minister of State consider this

point?  Because  many parents are not only  concerned  with

this  matter  but  they are sending their daughters  to  do

workshop  practice  with  some  dissatisfaction  over  this

question because the girls are not given an opportunity  to

opt  for  home economics. At the same time, they feel  that

this  two-year stint at the workshops is just  a  waste  of

time, because after all their children would only acquire a

basic  technical skill, maybe filing, woodwork, metal  work

or electricity.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, there is no need for you to repeat.

You have been saying that many times over.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I have to repeat because the Senior

Minister  of  State  has not taken  note  of  what  I  have

mentioned, and I want an answer now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, I could not reply to the Member

for Punggol just now because I did not have enough time. As

regards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



Secondary I and II students who are required to go  through

three  hours a week of workshop practice, this  applies  to

100% of the boys and 50% of the girls. It is true that some

of  them  may  have to travel some distance to the  central

workshops  as  we cannot afford to have the  facilities  in

each  and  every school. This is for economic reasons.  The

origin  of getting these girls exposed to workshop practice

was  that  eventually when they become mothers  they  would

have a better understanding of the importance of industrial

training. And besides this workshop training, they are also

required to attend home economics classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Member for Punggol that most girls

drop  out from workshop training after completing Secondary

II because it could be that they do not want to go into the

technical  stream.  He  has  a  very  good  point.  We  are

reviewing this matter with a view to allowing the girls  an

option  whether  they want to carry on  with  the  workshop

practice. But at the moment though they are doing  workshop

practice, they are also doing home economics.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like the

Minister of State to reply to some questions I raised  just

now.  I  want  to know whether the teachers'  organisations

would be consulted in the formulation of education policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, we will consult the teachers,

including  the  teachers' organisations. In  fact,  it  was

announced by my Minister in his speech that we will consult

as  much  as  we  can  and as far as possible.  Of  course,

consultation does not necessarily mean that it will end  up

with accepting the representation from the teachers' bodies

or  from  principals, because all aspects have to be  taken

into consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Two questions, Sir. First, whatever you

call it, whether it is the restructured education system or

ill-structured  education  system,  it  is  no  longer   of

interest to us now as the whole thing has been dropped. But

since  the six- or seven-year system has been dropped,  why

are teachers still required to attend so-called



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



evaluation  courses? I have got a letter from  a  group  of

primary school teachers in the Stamford Constituency saying

that  they are still attending evaluation courses.  Why  is

this going on?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, the Minister has given a free

hand  to  principals to adopt or to do away with  the  PPP.

Will  this free hand be given to principals on other policy

matters too?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, I am not aware that teachers have

to   attend   evaluation  courses.  If  the   Parliamentary

Secretary can refer the case to me, I will look into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards giving the principals a free hand, of course,

this has to be within the policy of the Ministry. Otherwise

we will have many different policies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> The principals have a free hand on

policy. Is this true or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> It is within certain guidelines. The

Ministry  issues certain guidelines and the principals  use

their discretion in the implementation of that policy. They

do not decide on policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  of  State's answer to the question  of  six-  and

seven-year  primary education seems to be wrong.  According

to  my  understanding, the curriculum committee has already

revised the six-year syllabus to a seven-year syllabus. For

example,  there is a textbook graded Book Seven. If  it  is

true  that  the  seven-year system has been abolished,  why

should there be a Book Seven textbook?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, at the time the restructured

education  system  was introduced,  there  was  a  move  to

publish  a textbook for the seventh year. But as far  as  I

know no such textbook has been published. As I said, we are

not having any seven-year primary education; so there is no

need   for   that  textbook.  The  Ministry  of   Education

definitely  has not published a Book Seven textbook.  There

may  be  some  arrangement during  the  interim  period  to

redistribute the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



curriculum  into  seven years, but no such  book  has  been

published.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  of  State answered that this book  has  not  been

published or issued to the public. In fact, the schools are

using this Book Seven textbook.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, not as far as I know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, before I ask leave to withdraw my

amendment, may I just make two points. I think there  is  a

great  deal  of confusion about six years and  seven  years

primary  education. If there is confusion in this House,  I

think a clear statement from the Ministry to the public, to

the  parents  aid to the teachers is called for.  I  myself

have  received a letter along the same lines. It  seems  to

indicate  quite  clearly that we need a  very,  very  clear

statement about what is going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> My second point is this. I would like to

follow  in the footsteps of my Hon. Friend from Whampoa  in

regretting  that in Catholic schools, it is being  insisted

that  sterilisation certificates will have to  be  accepted

for priority to be given to holders of such certificates in

respect of admission of their children to schools. It would

seem,  Sir, not unreasonable for consideration to be  given

to  the sensibilities of authorities in Catholic schools in

this matter. The Senior Minister of State has not once, but

more  than once, referred to ethics, sense of values, moral

aspects.  It  is this concern that has led to the  position

stated  by the Catholic Archbishop of Singapore.  It  seems

anomalous when you pronounce an article of moral belief  in

the  classroom to act against this belief in  the  schools'

administration   office.  We  also  talk   of   a   special

personality  given to schools. We want to  develop  certain

characteristics.  Some  of  the  schools  have   for   such

characteristics certain stated beliefs and I  think  it  is

not unreasonable to take these into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Teong Eng Siong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1008.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, amendment (2).



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ang Nam Piau, amendment (3).



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy, amendment (3).



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead BAA 1105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the authorities are

aware  of the hardship faced by parents in relation to  the

high  cost  of school books. Before the school term  closed

last  year, some schools handed out to students  book  list

with   prices  quoted  for  the  books.  But  when  schools

reopened, the prices of some of the books went up  by  more

than  100%.  When  the book sellers were  questioned,  they

replied  that  freight charges had gone up and  that  their

books were new stocks. How is it that these increases  were

permitted?  Who  authorised the  sale  of  books, and  who

controlled  the prices quoted in the price list  issued  by

the  school? Parents have been complaining about this,  but

nothing could be done about the increased prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Budget estimates, there are 1 59 posts of non-teaching staff required by the Ministry of Education. I

understand that at present most of the posts are filled  by

temporary  clerks. I wonder why these temporary clerks  are

employed  on a month-to-month basis. They have no incentive

and  they have nothing to look forward to. Therefore, their

turnover rate is very high.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



How  can  a  school work properly when the clerks  are  not

emplaced  on  the permanent establishment? As a  result  of

this,  many  school clerks have resigned and sometimes  the

teachers have to take over the duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is that the relief teachers are employed

on  a  day-to-day basis to fill the vacancies. These  young

school  leavers are unqualified and inexperienced. They  do

not have any sense of attachment to the schools nor do they

have  any  loyalty for the simple reason  that  they  could

become  unemployed overnight. They take up the job  because

they  want  to get extra pocket money, and in the meanwhile

they are looking around for some other jobs. We are leaving

the  future  of  our young citizens in the hands  of  these

inexperienced, undedicated young relief teachers.  Is  this

the right thing to do? Why cannot our retiring teachers  be

given  an  extension  of two to three  years  to  meet  the

shortage  of  teachers,  instead  of  depending  on  relief

teachers?  I  am  sure  that many retiring  teachers  would

certainly accept this offer, if they are given a chance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my fervent hope that in future the senior

officials of this Ministry would consider the views of  the

principals  and  the teachers first before introducing  any

change  in  education policy. I also hope the senior  civil

servants  in  the  Ministry would contain their  enthusiasm

about  certain ideas which have cropped up in their  minds,

probably in their wild dreams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I understand that in some schools, the Vigilante

Corps  members who are using the premises as their branches

at  times  misuse the place. For example,  they  have  been

known  to damage school property, like tuck-shop furniture,

displacing  classroom desks, throwing cigarette butts  into

toilets and choking the sinks, etc. I have also heard  that

some  of  them who come very early to the school showed  no

respect  for  the  National Anthem. They were  seen  moving

around  while the National Anthem was being played. And  in

co-education  schools some of them went to  the  classrooms

and  started to change into their uniforms openly.  What  I

want to know is whether steps have been taken to discipline

these inconsiderate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



members  of the V.C. I do not blame all of them. But  these

complaints do come from some schools. I am told  that  some

school  teachers have reported the matter to the  superiors

in  the V.C, who had promised to advise their members.  But

they  seem to pay only lip service. Will the administrators

see  that  remedial steps are taken in those  schools  with

problems of this nature?



<br><br>6.08 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, on the question of prices of

textbooks,   I  would  like  to  inform  the  Member   that

principals are authorised to look after the sale of  school

textbooks.  They  are  issued  with  lists  of  books   and

stationery with prices stated, well before the end  of  the

school year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of textbooks is one of the main factors to be

considered  in the selection of textbooks for  use  by  any

school. Mindful of the price increase of certain textbooks,

the  Ministry  has carried out a survey of textbook  prices

and  at  the  same  time  held  informal  discussions  with

representatives  of the Singapore Booksellers'  Association

and  the  Singapore  Book Publishers' Association.  It  was

found  that 80.4% of our school textbooks had not increased

in   price,  while  the  rest,  comprising  19.6%  of   the

textbooks, registered an increase in price from 1% to  20%.

No  textbook had gone up 100% in price. It should be  noted

that all-primary school textbooks are locally produced  and

imported  textbooks are used for upper secondary and  Pre-U

classes  only. The increase in price of imported  textbooks

is  imposed by the publishers in the country of origin  and

we have no control over this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education and school principals are very

much  aware of the hardship experienced by some parents  in

relation  to  the  high  cost of textbooks.  Thus,  a  free

textbook  loan scheme is operated to help all needy  pupils

to be provided with textbooks. The Educational Publications

Bureau,  a  non-profit organisation under the Ministry, is

producing school textbooks and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



other  educational  materials at low cost  as  a  means  to

stabilise  book prices. The NTUC's Fairdeal is  also  doing

its  part  by buying textbooks and stationery in bulk  arid

selling them to school pupils as cheaply as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of temporary clerks, to-date the Ministry

has  only  six  temporary  clerks.  These  six  clerks  are

appointed  on a temporary basis, as they fail to  meet  the

requirements of the Public Service Commission for permanent

appointment.  As the number of temporary clerks  is  small,

they do not pose a problem in the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards relief teachers, admittedly they have their

shortcomings. These are to be expected. However,  they  are

performing  a  useful  service in the  schools.  We  cannot

entirely  dispense  with their services  because  they  are

required  to fill casual vacancies arising from substantive

teachers  who go on leave, sick leave, etc. Relief teachers

who possess the qualifications and are interested in making

teaching their career may undergo training at the Institute

of  Education and be considered for a permanent appointment

in the Education service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the question of extension of service for

retiring  teachers, this Ministry is already taking  action

to  extend,  wherever possible, the employment of  retiring

teachers.  For  1975  a  total of 119  teachers  had  their

services extended or were reemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Vigilante Corps members using the

school  premises,  the  Member  for  Anson  is  correct  in

pointing out that some of them have caused damage to school

property, littering classrooms and toilets, and other  acts

of  indiscipline. When this was brought to  the  Ministry's

attention  by school principals, it was taken  up  recently

with   the  Assistant  Commissioner  in  charge  of  Police

National  Servicemen and the Vigilante Corps. The Assistant

Commissioner  has taken a serious view of this  matter  and

the  Ministry  is  given  to understand  that  disciplinary

action  will be instituted against those found  guilty.  In

addition,   close  liaison  will  be  established   between

principals concerned and officers in charge of each of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



these  training  centres  in  order  that  problems  of

mutual  concern, such as discipline of these  uniformed

officers,  cleanliness and damages to  school  property

may be resolved promptly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would avail

myself  of this opportunity to ask the Senior  Minister

of  State a question, namely, the redundant teachers in

Chinese schools, I shall be grateful if he will  inform

this House how he is going to deal with this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now when

the Member for Sembawang

raised  this  question, I did not have sufficient  time

to   give   him  a  full  answer.  According   to   the

information  I  have  here,  there  are  57   redundant

teachers  in the Chinese primary schools and  only  one

in  a  secondary  school. Altogether 58 Chinese  school

teachers  are  redundant. They will be  sent  to  other

schools  to  share in certain classes.  It  amounts  to

certain  schools having one or two extra teachers.  But

when  some  teachers  retire, they  will  fill  up  the

vacancies   caused,  otherwise  there  will   be   some

adjustment in posting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to ask

the  Senior  Minister  of State  to  answer  the  third

question that I have raised. The question is:  will  he

consider giving the principals a higher salary scale?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> We recognise the importance of

the  work  performed by school principals, and  we  are

currently  looking  into how to accord  recognition  of

this importance.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Will the Ministry of Education

control the price of school textbooks?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> We will do as much as we can to

help, but I do not think we can really control, in  the

sense of the word.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> In view of the explanation of

the  Senior Minister of State, I beg leave to  withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead CAA 1105*. (* The same amendment also stood  in the names of Messrs Lai Tha Chai, Yeo Choo Kok, Sia Khoon Seong and Phey Yew Kok.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we note that corrective and remedial measures to the

education  system  have been taken to correct  the  defects

which  have  persisted through the years  before  they  are

identified,  I  am led to the belief that there  never  has

been  an  effective  system of monitoring  the  effects  of

education policy and implementation. For instance,  now  we

know that the additional learning load of bilingualism upon

children  was  too  much for them.  If  there  had  been  a

reliable feedback by the officers of the inspectorate, who

are all professionals, the slide into illiteracy would have

been apparent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong with the inspectorate of the Ministry? The

inspectorate  is the unit which should be able  to  quickly

sense the effectiveness or otherwise of education policies.

Assuming  that  this facility and expertise  exist  in  the

inspectorate,  then the education and development  officers

(assuming that the education and development officers  have

fed  back  relevant  information to a  high  level  in  the

Ministry),  the question may be asked, why then  has  there

not  been any impact on those people at the high levels  in

the  Ministry who are in charge of policy? I feel that  the

inspectorate  operates  within limitations.  Being  a  unit

within the service (and they are constrained on educational

development officers to make realistic independent  views),

to   this  extent  the  system  of  monitoring  effects  on

education policies suffer.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier. Sir, I referred to a professional mechanism

which  operates  in  the Ministry and  I  called  upon  the

Minister to be alert towards the operation of this in-built

mechanism  in  his  Ministry.  This  mechanism  is   barely

discernible  most  times, but once  in  a  while  it  shows

itself.  Let me give an example. In the Budget debate  last

year when I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



stressed to the then Minister for Education that a lot  was

wrong with the system. I said that "pupils' performance was

falling,   that  pupils  cannot  count,  speak   or   spell

correctly,' (Hansard, Vol. 34, col. 1021). And I asked  the

Minister for his views. The Minister obviously answered  on

the  basis  of  what the professionals in the Ministry  had

advised  him. So the Minister denied that there were  these

defects  and referred me to the Bullock Report  on  Reading

which applied to the situation in the United Kingdom.

The  Report denied that "the standard of English was  going

down  but  that the demand on the standard of  English  was

going up."

(Hansard,  Vol.  34, col, 1024), Sir, I am still  wondering

how this Report is relevant in our situation,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months later the Deputy Prime Minister revealed the

extent  to which our school leavers are illiterate and  the

fact that illiteracy is acknowledged by all today. This  is

the mechanism in the professional side, which I am alluding

to,  which operates very insidiously. The Minister of State

himself  has  not  been spared. He has unwittingly  allowed

himself to be ensnared by this similar mechanism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my subsidiary question to him on the evaluation of the

Primary  Pilot Project last year, he endorsed  the  project

and  stated his intention to incorporate the project method

into our education system. (Hansard, Vol. 34, col. 131  7).

I do not think he said it with the kind of reservation that

he  has intimated to the House. I asked the Minister  again

whether  he  really  intended to incorporate  this  project

method into our education system because, frankly speaking,

I  am apprehensive. I made it a point to try and gather  as

much knowledge myself on the effectiveness and efficacy  of

this project method. It is an integrated system of learning

where  one  learns  the  3-Rs all  at  a  time  Arithmetic.

Reading,  Writing - on apparatus prepared by  the  teacher.

When  I asked the question it was still a pilot project  at

that  time and it was known to the professionals  who  were

advising  the  Minister that about 250 upward  schools  had

already been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



operating this project method -- which is a strange kind of

pilot system, if you ask me, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would imagine that a pilot system would be limited to a

few schools and an assessment and evaluation made before  a

decision is taken as to its usefulness or otherwise for the

purpose of improving the education system. I feel that  the

project  method  of learning is unrealistic and  unworkable

for   our   needs   and  does  not  suit  our   educational

imperatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on the need to stir some areas

in the Ministry of Education. In the Estimates, the lay-out

of  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  impressive.  But  the

question is how coordinated are the efforts of these  units

in  getting  the  system remedied as fast as  possible  and

going. In fact, the Minister may not know it but complaints

have  reached  me  that  some of  his  officers  are  still

retaining  foot-stools in their offices to rest their  feet

on  as they undertake their work. Whatever be the merits of

foot-stools arid their contribution to the grey  matter,  I

think that these are work excesses which we can do without.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would ask the Minister to respond to two

issues  which I raised in my opening observation under  the

Minister's subhead but which I grant the fact that  he  did

not  have  time to do so. First. I would like to  have  the

Minister's  response  to the desirability  of  reactivating

parent-teacher  association  for  the  purpose  of  jelling

obligations in education on the parents and teachers and to

stimulate  an  awareness of how these  obligations  may  be

effectively undertaken. I think that the approach to parent-teacher  association by the Ministry  has  been  a  nominal

approach   and   I  see  a  scope  for  the  parent-teacher

association in Singapore to make a substantial contribution

to education especially in the primary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue which I would ask the Minister to respond

is  the observation which I made: to try and recover in the

system  the  form  teacher situation and the  reduction  of

subject  teaching  in  the  primary  school  which,  as   I

maintained,   is  dissipating  the  intimate   relationship

between the teacher and the pupil.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, before Parliament sat  on  this

Budget   debate  the  Education  Minister   announced

outside  this House a new education policy. Before  I

speak on the question of education here I would  like

to  praise the Minister for having changed  well  and

done well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that over the past few years some

educationists  seem  to  be  involved  in  a   mountain

climbing race, which is a favourite sport in the  West.

But  our  local  mountaineers,  however,  are  not   as

experienced  as the Westerners. On climbing  to  higher

and  higher levels they have to work their way  through

a  winding  course,  and in doing so  they  lose  their

bearing,  and finally also lose their way. I have  been

musing  to  myself that this exercise  in  copying  and

aping  educational  development in  foreign  countries,

without  taking  into account our local conditions  and

practical  reality,  what  will  it  turn  our  teeming

youngsters  into?  What  will they  become  after  this

training?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in this multi-racial and multi-cultural

society  of  variegated backgrounds, education  is  a

very  big  and thorny problem to handle. But  it  does

teach  us  one  lesson, and that is, if administrative

instructions issued in the morning are changed in  the

evening,  and  innovations  of  teaching  methods  are

churned  out  every  so  often  as  described  by   my

colleagues  here, then this kind of  ad  hoc  exigency

measures   is  not  the  way  to  plan  our  education

programme  on a long term basis. Now the Minister  for Education  has decided to carry out a thorough  reform

as  indicated by the Senior Minister of State  in  his

reply  relating to the six-year or seven-year  primary

education.  One characteristic is that the  principals

are  given  certain power of discretion in respect  of

administrative  matters.  This  enhances  the   social

status  of  the teachers. This is a good beginning  as

it  has  strengthened the confidence of the principals

and  the  teachers  in  general  and  the  parents  in

particular.   In   this   favourable   atmosphere   of

confidence,   those   people   who   have   leadership

potential,  those  teachers  who  have  administrative

capability,  and  those  educationists  who  are  good

teachers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



will  then  come forward to give of their best in education

and lead the teaching profession forward for the benefit of

thousands  of our school children. In this way,  they  will

gradually get the respect of the people in our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we can see a strange tendency in

Singapore.  Good teachers are getting lax; good  principals

are  resigning;  and  good schools are becoming  fewer  and

fewer.  As  a result, parents are scrambling to get  places

for  their children in good schools. If they succeed,  they

feel  happy and have peace of mind, knowing that they  have

done  something  for  their children. If  they  fail,  they

become  dejected and constantly worry over  the  fact  that

they  could not succeed in doing something good  for  their

children, And for this, they spend sleepless nights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to my colleagues here in this House and to my

friends outside, I say to them: as parents, do you not hope

that  your children will some day become important figures,

endowed  with rare attributes, and be superior  to  others?

This  is  the  common aspiration of all parents.  From  the

educational point of view, I feel that if a school is  able

to  train only a very small group of talented children  and

weed Out a lot of those with a low Ia, then education is  a

failure. On the other hand, if a school is able to train  a

lot  of children and weed out only a few with low IQ, then

true  education would have been achieved. In fact, a  good

school will produce many more talents than stupid people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give some statistics on examination results

achieved by some 20 schools over the past five years, 10 of

which  are  good schools and the other 10 are not  so  good

schools.  I  have  categorised these 20 schools  into  five

groups, and the percentage of passes for these five  groups

over the past five years is as follows:



<pre>

       First Group of Good Schools

         Percentage of Passes



         1st       2nd       3rd       4th       5th

1971     94.8      93.4      95.3      98.7      98.2

1972     96.6      89.1      93.5      98.8      98.8

1973     97.8      98.2      97.1      99.4      97

1974     95.9      95.4      96.6      99.4      98.2

1975     94.2      96.4      93        98.9      100

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give more statistics for the other five schools but

I will withhold them for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the list of poor schools. These are the

results for the second group of poor schools:



<pre>

      Second Group of Poor Schools

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lai, are you going to read out the

percentage figures of all 20 schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> No. I am only giving the figures of five

of each category of schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think you have made your point, and there

is no need to carry on giving your figures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): All right, Sir, I have a

list of 20 schools and I have given some statistics to make

my  point.  But if the Minister is interested. I  can  even

give  him the names of the schools, However. I do not  wish

to disclose the names of those poor schools and so put them

to shame publicly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the figures that I have given we can see

clearly  that the first category of schools is  successful.

There  are  more than 90% passes. These schools  should  be

publicly  commended.  The second category  of  schools  are

failures because their school results average 40%. This  is

a  serious  matter that we should not overlook.  I  suggest

that  the  Ministry  of Education should  draw  up  certain

criteria for awards or reproaches to serve as guidance  for

the  principals  and  teachers  and  to  ensure  that  good

principals  be  given  at  least some  incentives  of  post

allowance -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards those teachers or principals whose bodies are

in  the  schools  but whose hearts are  in  business,  they

should not be retained in the Education service so that  no

harm  may  be done to the school or to themselves.  On  the

contrary, we should ask them to join the commercial  sector

to  give rein to their ambition to make more money for  the

country  rather than remain in the schools.  On  the  other

hand,  we should totally reform the Institute of Education,

raising  both the quality and the quantity of its contents.

so as to ensure a new breed of educators who will take over

the task of education from us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, before I Come to the point which

I  wish  to  make,  I would like to compliment  the  Senior

Minister  of  State for having so valiantly  stood  up  and

defended the education policies that were formulated in the

last  decade or so, but which he has had no part  in  their

formulation. I feel somewhat sorry for him in that today we

have  to crucify him for the misdeeds for which he  is  not

responsible.  Having said that, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I

wish to -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Further crucify him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Yes. I wish to further crucify him,

Recently, the present Minister for Education - -  you  will

notice.  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that I have used the  word

"present"   because  of  the  frequent   changes   in   the

appointment   of   Minister   for   Education, and   this

clarification will indicate which Minister I  am  referring

to  the present Minister for Education made an announcement

recently to the effect that principals and teachers will be

consulted  before new policies are formulated. I think  the

intention  behind such an announcement is commendable.  But

what  I  am afraid of is this: how do we implement  a  good

intention  when we have 20,000 teachers? I think the  fault

with  the Ministry of Education is not because there  is  a

lack  of good ideas, but very often the fault is that these

ideas  are  not  properly implemented. They  are  so  badly

implemented  that even though they are good ideas,  in  the

end they have resulted in a lot of ill-effects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the point about consulting principals and

teachers.  I just want to say this. It is no use  making  a

public  declaration of intent. More important is, how  will

the  Ministry  of  Education impose this policy  on  20,000

teachers  and  principals?  Is  it  the  intention  of  the

Ministry  to call them up in groups and discuss the  issues

with  them  from time to time? Is there an organisation  or

machinery in which there are capable officers who are  able

to  lead  the discussions. A discussion must be  a  two-way

affair.  I  feel that this is an idea which  has  not  been

given very careful consideration in its implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the impression I get just now when the Senior

Minister of State, in replying to the Member for Jurong  on

the  question of consulting unions, said that it  need  not

necessarily  end  up  with  consulting  the  unions.   This

reflects the lack of consideration of what unions can do in

these  matters.  This  is  an  accepted  practice  in  more

advanced countries when there are organisations, especially

if  they  represent members of interested groups. They  are

the  best'  representatives with whom one can consult.  One

can  seek the views of the teachers' unions because through

their organisation, experience and the feedback which  they

get  from their members, they have a wealth of ideas  which

one  can tap and fruitfully engage in discussions with them

so  that  better  decisions can be made in regard  to  many

matters   that  will  come  up  before  the  Ministry   for

consideration.  Not to recognise the role  of  consultation

that  the  teachers' unions can play is to  ignore  a  very

important channel of communication. It proves my point that

very little consideration is given to the implementation of

ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know why there is a reluctance to accept the

unions  with open arms in matters like this. Is it  because

they  are afraid that the unions are able to show up  their

faults and, therefore, as far as possible, it is better  to

keep  them  out?  It is good public relations  to  consult.

However,  besides  the  declaration of  intent,  in  actual

practice  there  is  no  consultation.  I  saw  the  Senior

Minister of State nod his head when I asked whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



there is such an organisation for consultation. I say  this

is  also  another  eyewash. How would you  organise  20,000

teachers effectively, solicit their opinion, and make  them

understand  the  rationale behind  some  of  the  education

policies?  How would the Education Ministry get  this  done

with  20,000  teachers if it intends to have a  proper  and

effective consultation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Meaningful consultation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Yes, a meaningful consultation, as

the  Member for Bukit Ho Swee has kindly helped me with the

correct word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

trade  union movement in Singapore clearly recognises  that

the  social  and  material well-being  of  our  society  is

irrevocably linked with our total development.  This  is  a

lesson  which we have learned, unlike trade union movements

elsewhere, many of which have become enmeshed in  economic,

social  and  political  concepts and  practices  which  are

irrelevant  to  the  harsh and naked realities  of  today's

troubled world. What we have built so far must be sustained

and  strengthened for the future lies in the hands  of  our

young people who should be equipped with a deeper and  more

profound understanding of the facts of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would commend to the Ministry of Education to consider

including in the curriculum of secondary schools,  both  at

Secondary  IV and pre-university levels, a subject  on  the

trade union movement in Singapore, embracing such topics as

its  history, its economic role and function  in  a  modern

society, its responsibilities and obligations and on labour

laws  and our industrial relations machinery. Many  of  our

youngsters  after  leaving school will find  their  way  to

industrial  and commercial enterprises, while some  of  the

more   fortunate  and  bright  ones  will,  after  tertiary

education,  enter  into  business or  become  managers  and

executives. Whether they become workers or executives, they

will  be  better  able to understand and  appreciate  their

respective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



roles  in  the  world of commence and industry,  develop  a

greater  sense of industrial and social discipline  through

the  subjects that I have mentioned and thereby be able  to

contribute  to the betterment of our society  by  directing

their  ambitions  and values to larger  and  higher  social

ends.  If anyone raises his eyebrows in dismay or dismisses

this  suggestion as trivial. I would like to tell him  that

subjects on trade unions and labour laws are taught in high

schools in some countries. For instance. I am told that  in

Japan high schools teach students these subjects and one of

the  end  results is the well-known skill amid  disciplined

dedication of the Japanese worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we can instil in our youngsters the right

attitudes  and values by including in the secondary  school

curriculum such subjects. For in the ultimate the value  of

a  person,  whether he is a worker or a business executive,

is  measured by what he can give in a disciplined manner to

our economic and social progress and prosperity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, on the points raised by the

Member  for  Serangoon Gardens, I would like to inform  the

House  that the Ministry of Education is now in the process

of setting up a feedback unit to monitor the results of any

policy  which has been implemented. This will  also  answer

the question raised by the Member for Moulmein as to how to

consult. Once this unit is set up, then of course it  would

be  easier to monitor the principals' and teachers'  views,

especially  the rationale behind the various objections  or

support  for  any  policy. I fully agree  that  we  need  a

feedback in order to make modifications to any policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of illiteracy, I would like to say that

there will always be a certain percentage of people who are

illiterate,  even  in  a monolingual  society  in  advanced

countries  where  education is  free  and  compulsory.  The

recent statements made by the Prime Minister and the Deputy

Prime  Minister  merely drew the attention of  the  people,

especially  the Ministry of Education, to some  aspects  of

illiteracy which we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



not perhaps given sufficient attention We are now directing

our  attention to this problem so as to minimise illiteracy

in our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of parent-teacher association raised by

the  Member  for Serangoon Gardens, it is a good  idea.  We

will encourage the setting up or such associations whenever

possible. But It would appear that there are not many  such

associations being set up at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Henderson has pointed out that a large

number  of good principals and teachers have resigned  from

the education service. I would like to give some statistics

in  case a wrong impression is created. In 1975 there  were

only  306  resignations, giving a total of  1.7%.  In  1974

there  were  350  resignations, giving  a  total  of  1.9%.

Members  will  notice that there were less resignations  in

1975  than  in  1974. In 1 973 there were 379 resignations.

giving  a  total of 2.1%, which was even higher.  In  other

words,  the trend in resignation is coming down. It is  not

true that the teachers are running away.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with the Member that good teachers and

good   principals  should  be  remunerated  or  should   be

commended  because sometimes it is not always  possible  to

adequately   remunerate  a  person  in  terms   of   money,

especially in the field of education. Wherever possible and

wherever  we can identify, I fully agree that we must  give

them  due recognition for the good work done. So if Members

come  across  any particular principal or teacher  who  has

done  very well and has not been discovered, please let  me

know and I will personally look into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify one point made by the Member for

Moulmein. He quoted my words saying that when I replied  to

the Member for Jurong, I said that it v/as not necessary to

consult the teachers' unions. I did not say that. I  merely

said  that the consultation does not necessarily mean  that

it  may  end up with their views being accepted. I did  not

say that it is not necessary to consult the unions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question raised by the Member for Boon Teck

whether  we  could include trade unionism as a  subject  in

secondary and pre-university classes, I would like  to  say

that  it  is  not  feasible at the moment, especially  when

there  are  so  many  complaints  of  overloading  of   the

curricula on the students and whatnots. I would like to let

him  know  that  the  general idea  of  trade  unionism  is

discussed in current affairs and the study of economics, in

the upper secondary and pre-U classes. But it is not taught

as a subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it cannot be

denied  that the turnover rate of teachers has  been  high.

This  leads  to a shortage of teachers, especially  in  the

secondary schools. I do not know why, but it could  be  due

to  some  mistake or due to the policy of the  Ministry  of

Education.  But  the situation is that, on  the  one  hand,

while  we  are short of teachers with tertiary  educational

qualifications,  on  the other hand,  we  find  that  these

teachers with tertiary educational qualifications have been

asked  to  teach  in primary schools instead  of  secondary

schools. This is one question which I would like the Senior

Minister of State to clarify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that we have accepted professionals

from  Taiwan in the field of architecture, engineering  and

so  on.  But  for teaching, our Government has  refused  to

recognise the Taiwan graduate. I understand that  a  number

of  Taiwan graduates have not been allowed to teach in  the

secondary schools, and this has created a bad feeling among

the  Taiwan  graduates who are now still  teaching  in  the

primary schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, there are a few graduates, both

local  and  foreign, teaching in primary schools.  Most  of

these  graduates  have been accepted for  training  in  the

Institute  of  Education specifically  for  primary  school

teaching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Taiwan degree holders not being allowed to teach

in  secondary schools, this is the practice all along. Some

of  the  graduates may have the ability  to  teach  in  the

secondary schools but the point is how are we to select and

get  the  right  person to teach in the secondary  schools,

especially when we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



have  an excess of Chinese language graduates. What we  are

short  of  is  English language graduates who are  able  to

teach the English language in secondary schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

would just like to request the Senior Minister of State  to

clarify certain matters in regard to bilingualism.  I  have

already  quoted the Prime Minister in my speech  just  now.

The  Prime  Minister  said  that  after  15  years'  heart-searching he has decided on the bilingual education  policy

using  English  and Chinese or the mother tongue  on  equal

terms as a policy for education in Singapore. Today, is the

use of the bilingual education policy declining? The Senior

Minister of State is now shaking his head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Of course, I am glad to

hear that the answer is "No".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask, or rather make a suggestion.

Can  the  two languages be given equal exposure time, i.e.

50% for the mother tongue and 50% for English? Perhaps only

in  this  way  can we eradicate the long existing  barriers

among the various types of schools in Singapore and mould a

common  type  of Singapore school in the end. In  my  view,

there  should be no English schools. Chinese schools. Malay

schools  or Tamil schools as such, There should be no  such

distinction in our schools, but Singapore schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also understand that there are students who do

not  have the capacity to learn two languages, particularly

English as a second language. Having accepted that, can  we

say  that in the common Singapore schools we can set  up  a

system  in  which  emphasis will be given to  learning  the

mother tongue but the second language, namely, English  can

be used as a common medium of instruction?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

just  now when I answered in English, maybe there was  some

distortion in the interpretation. So if I may now speak  in

Mandarin to answer the Member for Paya Lebar's questions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, there is no change in our bilingual policy.

There has only been some emphasis placed on certain aspects

of  the policy as a corrective measure. The Member for Paya

Lebar  asked whether equal exposure time could be given  to

both  the mother tongue and the second language in  pursuit

of the Singapore type of school espoused by him. I must say

that  although the schools in Singapore belong to different

language  streams,  they  are, in  fact,  gradually  moving

towards  one  common  type. We cannot  enforce  the  change

rapidly. The reasons are quite obvious. There is a shortage

of  suitable  teachers: furthermore, the  pace  cannot  be

enforced  just  by making some regulations that  cannot  be

carried  out.  But it is obvious that the  trend  is  going

towards that direction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, I regret to hear from the Senior

Minister of State that at this moment he is not prepared to

entertain  my request, But I must say that if Singapore  is

to   continue  with  our  industrialisation,  it  is   very

important  to us that our secondary school children  should

know  the ABC of our Employment Act so that when they leave

school   they  have  the  right  attitude  and   are   more

disciplined.  I would also say that I am sure  that  unless

the  Senior  Minister of State thinks that the children  in

schools  are  really overloaded, as mentioned  by  quite  a

number  of  my  colleagues here, I feel that this  is  more

important  than asking our school children to save  in  the

Post Office Savings Bank.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, I fully realise the importance of

trade unionism. As I said just now, this is being discussed

in  schools  in  the  General Paper  because, among  other

things, they have to understand current affairs; but not to

the  extent  of making it a separate subject  as  you  need

fairly  seasoned minds to understand it. At upper secondary

and  pre-.U  level, I feel that the curriculum  is  already

overloaded. I realise the importance of trade unionism  and

whenever  possible  they should discuss  it  under  current

affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V her educed by $10

in respect of subhead CBA 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to further promote education, the Ministry

has set up an Educational Media Service whose main function

is   to  provide  educational  aids  in  the  form  of  ETV

programmes.  The  provision in  the  Main  and  Development

Estimates  for this Service is $2,131,500 which  is  not  a

small  sum  of money. Of course, to enable the students  to

better  understand the teaching content, the use  of  these

modern scientific teaching aids make up for what is lacking

in teaching materials. This is something that I will not be

up  against. However. Sir, if we spend so large  a  sum  of

money  every year and still do not know its effects, it  is

high time that the situation was reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the representations which many

principals  and  teachers  made  to  me,  the  content  and

screening  times of the ETV programmes are not  exactly  in

keeping  with the learning progress of the students.  As  a

result, the students who attend ETV periods do not benefit.

On  the  contrary, it is a waste of time. So  many  schools

simply do not allow students to attend the ETV periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that the ETV section has been very

conscientious in producing educational films. The  standard

is  also quite high. But having spent so much money and  so

much  effort,  if  in the end the films  produced  are  not

effectively  made use of by the students, it  is  really  a

waste of time and money. I do not know whether the Ministry

of  Education will make duplicates of the TV films produced

by ETV section and loan them to schools which need them.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that many schools have facilities like video

tape  recorders, So there will be no difficulty in the  use

of  video tapes for such purposes. If we can do this,  then

the educational films produced by the ETV section could  be

screened in keeping with the pace and progress of teaching.

In  this way, the amount of money we spend will be the more

worthwhile,  and  the  students  will  also  derive   great

benefits from these educational aids.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, the Member for Jurong said

that  the  content in the ETV programmes is not  very

suitable, as commented upon by some principals. I  am

not  sure  whether  he is right  or  wrong,  but  the

evaluation exercise carried out by the Ministry  with

the  assistance of the Data Processing  Unit  of  the

Ministry  of Finance indicated just the reverse.  The

programmes telecast by SEMS (Singapore Education  and

Media  Service) were all intra-curricular  programmes

and directly related to the curriculum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the primary school level they enjoy an acceptance

rating  of  over  90%,  that  is,  according  to   the

evaluation.  And at the secondary level, a  rating  of

nearly  100%. So I am at a loss to know who is  right.

At   the   junior  college/pre-university  level,   an

acceptance  rating  of about 90% is indicated.  Unless

in  the  evaluation exercise the wrong information  is

fed  into  the  computer, which I  am  sure  is  quite

unlikely, these are all the indications. Maybe if  the

Member  has any specific information, he can  draw  my

attention  to it so that I can make further checks  on

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the frequency of its use, that

is, the time of the broadcast, there were a number  of

inherent  problems  that make it  difficult  for  some

schools  to utilise every ETV programme. Examples  are

the  difficulty in the time-tabling, the large numbers

of  classes,  and the difficulty in matching  the  ETV

programme to the sequence of lessons taught.  This  is

genuine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of increased use of video tape,

video recorders are, as he had rightly said, introduced  to

schools. Certain schools have their video tape recorders as

well  as  television sets. SEMS send out Video officers  to

schools  to  assist them in the utilisation  of  the  video

recorders   and,  in  addition,  a  special  programme   on

utilisation  of  the  video  recorders  was  produced   for

schools.  Schools are encouraged to video-tape the selected

ETV   programmes  in  order  that  the  inherent   problems

mentioned  above,  such  as the  timing  and  the  progress

difference can be overcome. If SEMS is going to produce all

the video tapes for borrowing, that may not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



be financially possible for the Unit. However, video taping

is  very  easy. As long as you have the video  recorder  to

play back, you can tape the programme from the television.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I did not suggest

that  the contents of ETV films are not very good.  On  the

contrary.  I  said  that  this ETV section  has  been  very

conscientious  in  its  production  of  educational  films.

However, because the programming times and the contents are

not  in keeping with the learning progress of the students,

therefore, many schools do not find much practical use  for

them. Since the Minister of State said that as a result  of

scientific  progress  some schools have  these  video  tape

recorders  and TV sets and so on, I hope he can allot  more

funds to more schools to buy such aids so that the problems

I  mentioned  will be solved. In view of his reply,  I  beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead CCA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a must for teachers and

pupils  to  involve  themselves  in  some  sort  of   extra

curricular activities in the schools. This is in line  with

the  policy  of building a rugged and robust  society.  The

different  extra  curricular  activities  are  of   varying

degrees.  Some  may  be tough and others  may  be  easy  or

simple. The pupils and teachers have to carry out their ECA

outside  the normal school hours. This means that the  time

meant for studying is sometimes taken away because of these

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers who are involved in the uniformed groups

like  the  Police Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Corps, St  John's

Brigade etc, find it difficult to resign from these  groups

after  involving themselves for many years. It  seems  that

once  they are engaged in a particular ECA, they are unable

to   get  out,  though  participation  is  voluntary.  They

themselves  are  in suspense and do not know  exactly  when

they  will  be released. Are they to be released only  when

they retire from the service? May I ask the Minister why is

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



condition for release so strict? Because of this condition,

the  recruitment of new members to the uniformed groups  is

rather  poor. Also one of the reasons for the poor response

to  join the Institute of Education is due to this move, as

all  new  recruits  must undergo training  in  one  of  the

uniformed  groups.  Such  conditions  are  obstructing  the

recruitment of teachers. May I get the Minister's  view  on

the subject?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Sir, it is time for me to relieve my

Senior  Minister  of State who has been working  very  hard

since 2.30 this afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not quite correct to say that officers of uniformed

movements are not allowed to resign. In 1974 and 1975 alone

a  total  of 1 63 officers of the National Cadet Corps  and

the  National  Police Cadet Corps were allowed  to  resign.

These  movements are accorded national importance  and  the

demand  for  enrolment by the pupils is  overwhelming.  But

these   movements  are  seriously  affected  by  a  current

shortage  of  350  officers. All means of encouraging  more

teachers to join have been tried out. Training courses  are

held  during term time, the parade and camp allowances have

been  raised, promotion  within  the  movements  has  been

speeded up, and the organisation has been revised to  raise

morale,  but the demands on officers are heavy. As long  as

there is a shortage of officers, coupled with a high demand

by pupils, it is not wise to allow any and every officer to

resign  upon request. However, a system is now being worked

out  by  the councils of the National Cadet Corps  and  the

National Police Cadet Corps on how officers may be  allowed

to resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member that poor response

from  people to join the Institute of Education is  due  to

the move that all new recruits must undergo training in one

of  the  uniformed groups, I am sorry to say  that  I  have

checked  with  the Registrar of the Institute of  Education

this  morning and learned that there is no such  policy  as

far as the Institute of Education is concerned. What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



has   happened  is  that,  as  part  of  their  recruitment

campaign, officers of the extracurricular activities centre

have  been to the Institute of Education to give talks  and

lectures  to trainees in the hope that they would join  the

movement when they graduate from the Institute of Education

and  are selected to be teachers in schools. So it  is  not

true  to  say  that it is compulsory for the  Institute  of

Education trainees to take up one of these movements as  an

activity.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Can the Parliamentary Secretary

assure me that they can resign any time they want?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> As long as there is a shortage. I am

afraid  it will not be so easy, if I may put it,  until  we

have overcome the shortage. As far as I know, in these  two

movements, the National Cadet Corps and the National Police

Cadet  Corps,  we are trying to build up  a  corps  of  NCO

leaders at student level. Once this corps of NCO leaders at

student  level  has been established, hopefully  these  NCO

student leaders will overcome the shortage. When that  time

comes,  I  think  resignation may be a little  easier.  But

until  then,  we  hope  that the officers  concerned  would

cooperate with the movements for a little longer.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Si-, the Parliamentary Secretary has

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Conceicao, Mr Rodrigo, and Haji Mohd.

Ariff are not here. Mr Ho, Amendment (10).



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead AAA 3020.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.

First, can he inform the House the amount of allowance  for

each  student in the Singapore University and  the  Nanyang

University for FY 76?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as we know, Nanyang University has improved its

standard  and  it  is embarking towards  the  status  of  a

national university, when it will take in students from all

streams  of education. The Singapore University is enjoying

this  status.  I  would like to ask whether the  Government

will  amalgamate  the two universities  into  one  national

university  with two campuses, one at Kent  Ridge  and  the

other  at Jurong. In this way, we can avoid the duplication

of  academic  courses  in  these  two  universities  as  at

present, and it will be better able to train our people for

future manpower requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question concerns the Southeast Asian Research

Institute.  I do not know what has been done  in  the  past

year,  but  I  would  ask  whether this  Institute  can  be

incorporated into one of the two universities,  or  whether

it should remain an independent body.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth question is in regard to Youth Associations.

We  know that the People's Association has embarked  on  an

extensive  youth movement and many community  centres  have

set up their own youth sections



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



or   youth  corps  which  also  have  extensive  scope   of

activities.  In  these circumstances,  should  we  allocate

funds  to assist the Youth Associations? Could these  Youth

Associations be incorporated into the People's  Association

so that they need not be an independent body?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, on the question of the subsidy

per  student  for Nanyang University and the University  of

Singapore  for  FY  76, I regret to  say  that  it  is  not

possible to provide information for FY 76 since the  actual

increase in expenditure for the two universities as well as

the  student enrolment are still not available.  Similarly,

the  information for FY 75 is dependent on the finalisation

of accounts due to be closed on 31st March, 1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can give the Member some figures for 1974. I

am  making  a  comparison of the Arts and Social  Sciences,

Commerce   and  Business  Administration,  and  Accountancy

because  Nanyang  University  has  place  for  only   three

departments  and it is not comparable to take in  Medicine,

Law.  Engineering  and  Dentistry. For  the  University  of

Singapore   the  subsidy  per  student  for   these   three

departments  works out to an average of $4,279 whereas  for

Nanyang  University  the subsidy was  $3,506.  But  I  must

hasten  to add that subsidy means a deficit, and in Nanyang

University  there  are  other  incomes  to  be  taken  into

consideration. If we take the actual expenditure,  not  the

subsidy,  per  student for 1974 for these two  Universities

the  total  sum for the University of Singapore was  $4,729

whereas  for Nanyang University the actual expenditure  per

student was $4,637.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of merging the two universities, I would

like  to  say  that the Government is not  contemplating  a

merger of the two universities, There is no good reason  to

do  so.  On  the  contrary, because  of  their  traditional

academic organisational and administrative incompatibility,

there  is  every reason to encourage them to develop  their

individual  disciplines, each on its own, Even economically

there   is  no  benefit  to  be  gained  in  the  proposal.

Furthermore, with similar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



courses  being offered by the two universities, the  spirit

of  competition  will spur them on to  greater  heights  of

achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Youth Associations. I would like to

inform  the Member that the grant to the Youth Associations

in  question  is meant only to supplement the shortfall  in

annual  operating costs in respect of the  Singapore  Scout

Association and the Singapore Girl Guides Association.  The

activities of these two associations form an integral  part

of  the  extra-curricular activities organised for students

and  are  distinct and separate from other youth activities

run by community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Institute of Southeast Asian

Studies. I would like to inform the Member that in the past

year  the  Institute of South-east Asian Studies awarded  a

total  of  seven  Research fellowships  for  research  into

various  areas  of  current  interest.  These  are:   three

Institute  of South-east Asian Research Fellowships,  three

fellowships  in conjunction with the Federal Government  of

Australia  on South-east Asian relations, and one Fulbright

Hays  scholarship.  In  addition to  these,  the  Institute

received five Visiting Fellows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the seminar and conference front, only one major

international seminar was organised and this centred on the

topic  "Trends in Thailand" as a follow-up of the  previous

year's   seminar  on  "Trends  in  Singapore".   Occasional

seminars  held during the year numbered 20 and in  addition

to  this,  28  in-house seminars were also  organised.  The

research effort has resulted in a total publication  of  17

new titles for the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of the Institute has brought about closer

contact  among  scholars  and  specialists  concerned  with

modern Southeast Asia and its development. Various research

projects conducted by the Institute centre upon the  socio-economic  and  sociopolitical problems  of  the  South-east

Asian region. The nature of the problem delved into and the

contact  developed with scholars of the  region  will  also

promote a better understanding between the nations of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



region.  The  Institute  is presently  located  within  the

campus  of the University of Singapore. To absorb  it  into

the  University proper would cause it to lose its  regional

and  autonomous character. Further, it exists to serve  the

region as a whole and its interest lies further afield than

the  more restrictive curriculum and research conducted  at

either of our universities. Therefore, to absorb it as part

of  either  of  the universities would stifle the  original

objective  in  the establishment of this Institute  besides

curtailing the freedom under which it may operate. There is

no economic advantage too in the proposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to thank

the  Minister  of  State for his detailed reply.  Before  I

withdraw my amendment I would like to suggest that the term

"Youth  Associations"  should not be  used  because  it  is

misleading. He has said that the funds will be allocated to

the  Singapore  Scout Association and  the  Singapore  Girl

Guides Association. Such allocation should not appear under

`Youth Associations". I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10

in respect of item (d) of subhead AAA 3030



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the South-east Asian Ministers of Education

Organisation   (SEAMEO)   is   to   me   an   anachronistic

organisation. It has been outdated by the new  developments

in  Indo-China.  I wonder if the new governments  of  Indo-China  will  continue to subscribe to the  concept  and  to

contribute to the various centres of SEAMEO. I do not think

the   programmes  and  activities  of  these  centres  have

meaningfully  helped member-countries in  those  fields  in

which these centres are purposefully engaged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regional English Language Centre (RELC) has recently

been  renamed. The letter "E" in the abbreviation RELC does

not  stand for "English" any more. This letter "E' now goes

with the letter "R" to stand for "Regional". Sir, what does

this change



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



imply?  I am sure Members in this House would like to  know

what  the  Centre  has  done,  with  or  without  the  word

"English", in helping this country to improve the  teaching

and  learning of English apart from sponsoring the eye-wash

type of seminars from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone is complaining about the ever lowering

standards  of  English  in  our  schools  from  primary  to

tertiary  levels. Has the RELC done anything to help  solve

the  problem  of poor English by designing  a  teaching  or

learning programme that is relevant to the context of  this

country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister the following

questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Is there any change in the membership of SEAMEO?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What monetary contributions have the Indo-Chinese

states made hitherto to SEAMEO?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the breakdown figures of our contribution to

the Secretariat and the various centres of SEAMEO?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Does RELC intend to introduce new language programmes

which are really regional?



<br>Sir, I  think  languages such as Thai and Tagalog  of  the

Philippines  should  be  studied at the  Regional  Language

Centre,  if  we  are  really interested  in  promoting  the

concept of regionalism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, on the question of whether there

is  any change in the membership of SEAMEO. I would say  at

the  moment  "legally no" although the  three  Indo-Chinese

states did not attend the meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for our contribution to the Secretariat, it varies

from   year  to  year.  Based  on  a  formula,  Singapore's

contribution is approximately 4%, or slightly more, of  the

total expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on linguistic studies at RELC, the RELC is a

regional institution with regional responsibilities. It has

to  concern itself with the varying needs of the South-east

Asian member-nations in the improvement of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



English  language  teaching. These needs are  expressed  to

RELC  equally  by  each  country through  RELC's  governing

board.  One of the means of meeting these diverse needs  is

through RELC's training courses for key personnel from  the

region.  The  courses are specially designed  for  teacher-educators  rather  than  teachers,  designers  of  research

rather   than  researchers,  supervisors,  inspectors   and

curriculum  specialists and other  key  personnel.  It  is,

therefore,  necessary to design the curriculum  content  of

these  courses to meet the needs of training  personnel  at

this high level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre nevertheless does offer short-term courses

designed  specially to assist teachers in  improving  their

methodology  in  the teaching of English  in  schools.  The

Ministry  of  Education  is aware of  the  need  to  review

continuously  the  need  of upgrading  Singapore's  English

language teaching programme that can best be served by  the

RELC. These are being channelled to the Centre through  the

governing  board. Our suggestions for change  to  meet  the

needs of Singapore, however, would have to be considered by

the  governing board in the light of the overall  programme

of priorities of the Centre. The Centre is, in fact, in the

process  of  planning  to upgrade the  courses  for  senior

English  language  teachers  in  secondary  schools.  These

courses  are  specifically designed to meet  the  needs  of

Singapore.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the change of the name of the Regional English

Language  Centre  (RELC)  to the Regional  Language  Centre

(still RELC), I would like to inform Members that the first

5-year  phase of operation of the RELC is scheduled to  end

in  December  1976.  During this phase  of  operation,  the

primary objective of the Centre was to improve the teaching

of  English  as  a  second on foreign  language  in  member

countries  of  SEAMEO. The Centre will soon move  into  its

second  5-year  phase of operation. At the same  time,  its

name  will also be changed to the Regional Language Centre.

Its  emphasis will correspondingly shift to the undertaking

of  research and publication of the problems and  needs  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



region.  While  it  will  not be  engaged  specifically  in

training  in  the use of the different languages, it  will

delve  into  contrastic  studies, cross  cultural  studies.

social  linguistic studies and other such related  studies,

all of which cut across language barriers. It will continue

to assist member-countries in improving the teaching of the

English language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, do the three states of Indo-China

still send trainees to the RELC for training?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr J. F. Conceicao --



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 4001.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead AAA 8302.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, under this subhead, the sum

allocated  for  Nanyang  University  Students'  Hostel  was

$500,000 for FY 75 and $1.5 million for FY 76. And there is

a  revote of $237,800. For Nanyang Staff Quarters, the  sum

allotted was $100,000 for FY 75 and it is also $100,000 for

FY  76;  and a revote is also sought. Sir, I would like  to

ask why is there a need to revote on these two items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I would like to ask is when will the

Sports  Complex  for Nanyang University  be  completed.  On

completion, will the facilities be available also  for  use

by,  say, the villagers living in the vicinity of  Nanyang

University?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third question is in regard to the new canteen for the

Library. I understand that at the moment there is a canteen

on the top floor of the Library building. Why is there a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



need  to allocate $80,000 for another new canteen? I  would

like  the Minister to enlighten this House on the need  for

this provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last question is in regard to the provision of

$120,000 for the Department of Student Affairs Building. At

the  moment the Department of Student Affairs has  its  own

office. If it is necessary to shift the office. I feel that

a  better  place for it will be in the students'  building,

that  is, the Union House, because the Department has  very

close  relationship with the students.  I  would  like  the

Minister  to  enlighten  this House  on  the  need  for  an

allocation   for   the  Department  of  Students'   Affairs

Building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, the need to revote the provision

for  the Students' Hostel is due mainly to a change in  the

decision to resite the hostel from the site near the Sports

Complex to the present site near the Auditorium next to  an

existing block of hostels. The delay has also been  due  to

construction  activities, such as  boundary  surveys,  soil

testing,   earthworks,  layout,  drawing  up  of   detailed

architectural  plans, and plan clearance  by  the  relevant

authorities. In the case of Staff Quarters, the delay  was,

in  part,  due to difficulties in finalising the policy  of

allocation  and  the actual number of units  to  be  built.

Formal  clearance of the Development Planning Committee  is

also awaited before expenditure could be incurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Sports Complex, it is expected to be completed

in mid-June or early July this year. When not in use by the

students,  I understand that the University is prepared  to

make  its  facilities,  or  pant  of  them,  available   to

organised groups only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of building a new canteen, I would like

to  inform  the  House  that the present  location  of  the

canteen  on the top floor of the Library has been found  to

be unsatisfactory. Those using the Library are disturbed by

the  students  and  staff members going  to  and  from  the

canteen,  as  they  have to pass through the  Library.  The

present canteen, therefore, has to give way to expansion of

the Library to cope with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



increase  in  student  enrolment and  an  increase  in  the

collection  of  books. The new canteen will be  constructed

outside the Library building to replace the existing one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether there is a need to put up a

building for the Department of Student Affairs, the  Member

for  Delta happens to be the Director of the Department  of

Student Affairs, and he may be able to substantiate  or  to

add  to  my  reply if it is not satisfactory.  Although  it

would  seem practical and convenient for the Department  of

Student Affairs to be housed in the Students' Union  House,

this is not feasible as it is fully occupied by the various

student  societies  of  Nanyang  University.  The  existing

premises of the Students' Union House is not adequate  even

to  meet  the  requirements of the  students.  The  various

sections of the Department of Student Affairs are presently

operating  at  different  parts on  the  Campus  due  to  a

shortage  of  space.  Besides, with  the  increase  in  the

student  intake and the corresponding increase in students'

activities, the present general office of the Department of

Student Affairs will be inadequate to cope with the day-to-day   administration  of  the  Department.  This  situation

affects  the  efficiency  and  smooth  functioning  of  the

Department of Student Affairs. Hence, there is a need for a

new building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister whether he would ensure that construction  of

the  Students' Hostel and Staff Quarters would not be again

delayed. I hope we will not find it necessary next year  to

again ask for an allocation of funds for these buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of building a new canteen for the

Library,  I  feel  that the provision  of  $80,000  is  not

enough.  It  will  require  about$200,000  to  $300,000  to

construct even an ordinary building. I wonder what kind  of

canteen can be built with this small sum of $80,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the office for the Department of Student

Affairs, the Minister of State said that the canteen on the

top  floor of the Library will be shifted out and the space

used



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



for  the Library. As far as I know, the Library has  enough

seats  for the use of the students. When the said space  is

vacated,  it  could  well  be  `used  to  accommodate   the

Department of Student Affairs. In this way, we can save the

$120,000  meant  for  the  Department  of  Student  Affairs

Building  and add it to the provision for the  building  of

the new canteen so that a better one can be built. I wonder

whether the Minister would agree to this suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I understand the

Nanyang   University   authorities  have   consulted   some

specialists  on  a  comprehensive plan for  development.  I

wonder  whether the proposal to build the Students' Hostel,

Staff  Quarters and other buildings has been  envisaged  in

the  comprehensive  plan  for the  development  of  Nanyang

University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> May I first answer the Member for

Tiong  Bahru,  Sir, It is most likely that  the  proposals

would  not  deviate fan from the development  plan.  But  I

myself   am  not  sure  about  this  because  the  detailed

operation of Nanyang University is under the control of the

Council  and not under the Ministry of Education  as  such.

The Ministry of Education merely looks after its finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong wants an assurance regarding the

building of the Students' Hostel and the Staff Quarters.  I

have  just looked at the Budget estimates and I find  there

is no asterisk to these two items. I presume the plans have

already   been  approved  and  it  is  now  a   matter   of

administrative expediency. I will convey the wishes of  the

Member  to the Nanyang University authorities to  see  that

they are built as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the "New Canteen for Library", I see

an  asterisk against the provision in the Budget estimates.

There  is  also an asterisk against the provision  for  the

"Department of Student Affairs Building". This  means  that

they  are  subject to sanction by the Development  Planning

Committee. The final approval still remains with  the  DPC.

They  have  only been approved in principle. Regarding  the

canteen, I have said that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



top  floor of the building would be used as additional

space  for  the  Library. But I would like  to  inform

Members  that,  as  far as I know, the  Department  of

Student  Affairs  is quite large.  One  floor  in  the

Library building is not big enough to accommodate that

office.  In  fact, it is quite far from the  Students'

Union House and, therefore, it would not be practical.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of the

Senior  Minister of State's assurance  that  he  would

convey   our   wishes   to  the   Nanyang   University

authorities and hoping that the Students'  Hostel  and

the Staff Quarters will be built soon. I beg leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $391,843,670 for Head V ordered to stand

part of the Main Estimates.
