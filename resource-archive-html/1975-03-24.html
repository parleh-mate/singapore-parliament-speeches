renovation  or alteration works to be carried  out

to    leased   Housing   and   Development   Board

valid.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a 2% fee was

levied,  where Housing and Development Board  land

is   leased  to  industries,  for  extensions   or

alterations  to  their  premises.  The  fees  were

collected  more  as  an increase  in  the  premium

because  of the more intensive usage of  the  land

rather than to defray processing costs. The charge

is  valid as it is provided for in a clause of the

lease.  The fees are not charged for shop premises

which   are  on  rental  nor  do  they  apply   to

extensions  to residential properties sold.  These

fees have been waived for industries for this year

in view of the present economic conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head S (cont.) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Messrs Ng Kah Ting, Sim Boon Woo and Ong Teng Cheong:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the sum to be allocated for Head S be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CDD 1107.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting is not here. Mr Sim Boon Woo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead CDD 1107.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was wondering whether the Minister

concerned  would recall - if he were to  refer  to

page  235 and page 244 of the Main and Development

Estimates  for the Financial Year 1974-75  -  that

there was, in fact, no indication at all that  the

function  of  the Development Control Division  of

the  Planning Department would be transferred. But

as  soon  as  the last Estimates were approved  by

this  House  last year, a Ministry circular  dated

28th  March,  1974, was issued advising  that  the

function  of the Development Control Division  was

to  be transferred from the Planning Department to

the  Building Control Division under  the  overall

charge   of   the  Assistant  Director   (Building

Control)  of  the  Public Works  Department,  with

effect  from 1st April, 1974. No reason  had  been

given for the transfer of functions. But one thing

was  clear. It was a hasty decision because it had

rendered  the last Main and Development  Estimates

out  of  date as soon as it was approved  in  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not against the transfer of the Development

Control  Division to the Building Control Division

of  the  PWD.  In fact, I thought it  would  be  a

rather good idea if it could cut down red tape  by

amalgamating the two Divisions, both  having  very

closely  related functions regulating  almost  all

aspects  of  the  physical  development   in   the

Republic. Although almost a year has lapsed, it is

noted  that  there  is still an  obvious  lack  of

communication  and coordination  between  the  two

Divisions  within the same Department. It  is  not

unusual to realise that one Division is not  aware

of  the  decision  or action taken  by  the  other

Division  and  members of the public involved  are

often  required to transmit information  on  their

behalf. This has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



resulted in unnecessary loss of valuable  time  to

both the Department and the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Minister is aware of this and

whether  immediate  remedial  measures  would   be

introduced  to rectify the situation in  order  to

achieve the intended objective of the transfer  of

the  function  or  part of  the  function  of  the

Planning   Department   to   the   Public    Works

Department. I am sure the Minister will agree that

the  sooner  the working relationship  within  the

Department is improved, the more expeditiously and

effectively it will serve the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I would like to speak under

this  subhead is on demolition enforcement. It  is

noted  that the demolition enforcement policy  has

been rather inconsistent and that the action taken

by  the  Department has been rather unpredictable.

There  were  complaints that stringent action  had

been  taken  against those who had  difficulty  in

communicating  with  officers of  the  Department.

There  were also complaints that swift action  had

been taken against those members of the public who

had   innocently  put  up  minor  extensions   and

repairs,  as  have  already  been  raised  by  the

Members  for Jurong and Paya Lebar. And  sometimes

even awnings erected over windows to keep off  the

weather  had  to  be demolished at  short  notice,

while   other  unauthorised  erections  had   been

allowed  to  remain. If this is not inconsistency,

what is? What about unauthorised erections put  up

by  Government agencies or statutory bodies?  What

action has been taken against them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nothing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> I hope the Minister will not

ask  me to name the unauthorised erections put  up

by  Government agencies. I am not suggesting  that

the  Demolition Enforcement Department  should  be

more  stringent. On the contrary, I am  suggesting

that they should extend their understanding and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>

reasonable attitude to the public, as they have to

Government agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to join my colleagues in urging the

Department  officers to adopt a  more  humane  and

reasonable  attitude in the performance  of  their

duty  in order to minimise grievances and hardship

to the people. The public is aware arid recognises

the  powerful arm of the law. But there is nothing

to  be  gained  by  adopting  a  harsh  and  rigid

approach. Sometimes economic loss to our nation is

the result instead.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some teething problems are

inevitable  in the early stages of the integration

of  the  Development  Control  Division  with  the

Building  Control Division. Most of these problems

have  now  been  resolved, but if members  of  the

public   encounter  inconveniences   because   the

departments do not function efficiently, they  are

requested to write in to my Ministry.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Division's demolition enforcement officer by

the very nature of his work attracts an impression

of  harshness and rigidity, while in effect he  is

merely  discharging the unpleasant duties  of  his

job  which  is  really  not an  easy  one.  Actual

physical demolition represents the culmination  of

very  careful  consideration and decision  by  the

Division's  officers in every case. Demolition  is

resorted  to  when  all avenues for  the  possible

regularisation  or toleration of the  unauthorised

structures  are exhausted. Members of  the  public

should  not erect unauthorised structures  in  the

hope  of  escaping  official  detection.  Building

procedures  have  been  streamlined,  but  relaxed

wherever  possible.  It is  not  so  difficult  to

obtain  permission  before carrying  out  building

activities. If there are incidents where  officers

in  the  department have been rude or  intolerant,

Members are invited to bring such incidents to  my

notice and appropriate action will be taken.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy on unauthorised erections is quite

clear.   Under  the  Building  Control  Act,   all

structures which are erected without the  approval

of  the Building Authority or in contravention  of

the Building regulations are unauthorised, and the

Authority has power to demolish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for statutory boards, there has been no

occasion  when  the  Division  has  taken   action

against unauthorised erections. Besides, the  fact

that  the Government is exempted from the Building

Control   Act,   all  Government   buildings   are

scrutinised by the Planning Authorities and  there

is  nothing  to  gain  from erecting  unauthorised

structures.  Statutory  bodies  are  required   to

obtain  planning permission and building  approval

for their buildings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's reply, I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Haji Mohd. Ariff is not here. Mr P. Govindaswamy,

amendment (8).



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead CDE

1107*.

(*The same amendment stood in the name of Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that several trees in parks and

along roads are slanting dangerously and appear to

fall  at  any  time. Can the department  concerned

plan  a programme to cut them down so as to  avoid

unnecessary damage to property and lives?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also believed that a major park is to be

opened  in Marine Parade and in various  parts  of

the  country.  Can  the Minister  elaborate  these

programmes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, lighting and parking facilities in some

of  our  present  parks are  inadequate.  Can  the

department concerned kindly look into this  matter

in order to improve the situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, slanting trees are not necessarily

dangerous. The condition of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



the  tree  depends not only on the  soundness  of

its  roots  but  also  on whether  its  trunk  has

suffered  decay.  But  the  Parks  and  Recreation

Division  does  carry out periodic inspections  of

old trees. Those trees that are found dangerous or

likely to fall down are cut down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member wants to know more about parks. The

East Coast Park of 350 acres, or 140 hectares,  of

reclaimed   land   with   a  five-mile   shoreline

stretching  from  Tanjong Rhu to  Bedok  is  being

developed  into a park and recreational area.  The

area  between the Singapore Swimming Club and  the

Housing and Development Board Marine Parade Estate

has  already  been  turfed  and  planted.  A  six-hectare,  or  15-acre, swimming lagoon,  which  in

terms  of  surface area is equivalent to about  40

Olympic-sized  swimming  pools  and   capable   of

accommodating  about 6,000 people at  a  time,  is

being   constructed  by  the   Ministry   of   the

Environment and scheduled for completion in  early

1976. Other facilities will include footpaths, car

parks,  cycle tracks, changing rooms,  hawker  and

food  centres,  and  even a  golf  driving  range.

Camping  sites will be provided and chalets  built

by  the  Housing and Urban Development Co.  (Pte.)

Ltd, for rental to the public. An orchard is being

developed in an area of about four hectares, or 10

acres, behind the Chinese Swimming Club. There are

also  plans to build a tennis complex,  an  indoor

recreational centre and even a bicycle station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether that satisfies the Member or

whether  he  desires  more  information  on  other

parks.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with the Minister's reply,

and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead CEA 1107.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Planning Department, which is the nerve

centre for all planning matters in Singapore and a

very important section in the Ministry of National

Development,  was  split into two  in  April  last

year.  One section of the Planning Department  was

to   deal  with  the  Master  Plan  and  long-term

planning,  and  the  other section  known  as  the

Development  Control Division is to operate  under

the PWD. As a result of the split, the position of

the professional planners is not clear. The morale

of  the officers is low. They even fear to talk to

members of the public, who from time to time  seek

preliminary advice prior to submission  of  formal

applications to the Development Control Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In overseas countries development control is

always  part  of the Planning Department  for  the

efficient operation of planning control. What  was

the  reason  behind the split? Is  the  separation

going to be permanent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know how many resignations have

taken place since the separation? Are the planners

who   are  in  the  profession  happy  with   this

separation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether officers of

both  divisions are eligible to apply for a senior

post  when  a  vacancy arises. At  the  moment,  I

believe  that  promotion  to  a  senior  post   is

confined  to  officers of the particular  division

where  the  vacancy exists. This has caused  great

dissatisfaction  among  the  planners  because  of

frustration  and lack of promotion  prospects  and

incentives.   This  was  what  I  was   given   to

understand  from  a disappointed planner  who  has

since  resigned,  and  as you  know,  Sir,  it  is

difficult to recruit planners. I would request the

Minister  to  make  a  review  of  this  important

division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what is really

happening to the former Raffles Institution  site.

I  believe the former historic building had to  be

demolished to make way for urban renewal, and that

a tall building will be built at the site so as to

keep up with other tall buildings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



in  the city area. But instead of  the  tall

building  as expected, the site has been converted

into  a car park. Just imagine, a historic Raffles

Institution  building demolished for  a  mere  car

park!  May I know why the Planning Department  had

second  thoughts on the project in this  important

area?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, another precious piece of land, the

former  Gemini Chit Fund site at Bras Basah  Road,

has  been converted into the best plot for growing

lalang.  While there is acute shortage of land  in

the  city area for development, we find this place

lying idle for growing lalang. I hope the Planning

Department will not be so fickle in its functions.

Either  we develop according to schedule or  leave

the  place  to our citizens who are occupying  the

land.  Sir,  can the Minister give an  explanation

for these anomalies?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received many complaints about

development in my constituency. Building approvals

have  been  granted  for  some  areas  in  Wallich

Street,  which is indeed very good for the  uplift

of  Anson constituency. However, I would  like  to

know  why there is some discrimination in the Tras

Street  area  where building approvals  have  been

granted for a certain section but not granted  for

another  section.  Can  the Minister  explain  the

policy of granting building approvals?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the decision to split the long-term

planning  and  development control  functions  was

made  in  the  interest  of improving  efficiency.

Prior  to  April,  1974, the  Development  Control

Division  which  deals  with  private  development

applications was part of the Planning  Department,

whilst  the Building Control Division which  deals

with  building  plan approvals  was  part  of  the

Public    Works    Department.   Logically,    the

Development  Control  Division  and  the  Building

Control  Division  should be integrated  into  one

unit  because building plan approvals are tied  up

with planning approvals and vice versa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Plan and long-range planning, on the

other  hand,  embody  a  wider  area  of  planning

control   and   are  best  left  as   a   separate

department. This will save



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



the  long-range  planners from being  bogged  down

with  the  routine development applications  which

entail  time-consuming interviews with  architects

and   developers;  follow-up  action  on  planning

approvals,  attendance  at  hearing  appeals   and

taking  enforcement action for  contraventions  of

planning permission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the separation of functions, the

Development  Control planners are  able  to  spend

full-time on the day-to-day applications  received

from the private sector and are thus able to offer

better  service to developers and architects.  The

Planning Department planners in turn are  able  to

do  a more thorough and uninterrupted job at long-range  and  block-planning and to  concentrate  on

public development projects.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the transfer, there have been three

resignations  of planners, two from  the  Planning

Department  and  one from the Development  Control

Division.  All  three have resigned  for  personal

reasons. Their resignations had nothing to do with

the transfer of the departmental functions. It  is

not  understood  why the Member for  Anson  should

think that the morale of the planners is very low.

Additional  senior posts have been  created  since

the  promotion, and the promotional  prospects  of

planners in both the Planning Department  and  the

Development   Control  Division   have   improved.

Vacancies of senior posts are now open to officers

of both sections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the former Raffles Institution

site  and the Gemini Chit Fund site at Bras  Basah

Road, I do not understand why the Member for Anson

should  blame  the  Planning  Department  for  the

absence  of  development. It is not only  planning

approval  that leads to a building. A lot  depends

upon   the   owners.  In  the  case   of   Raffles

Institution, it belongs to the Development Bank of

Singapore.  For  their  own  reasons   they   have

postponed  the  construction of the building.  The

proposal has been temporarily shelved. At one time

it  was  because of the shortage of skilled labour

and building materials.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



The   project  has  since  been  revived  and  the

architects, I understood, are now proceeding  with

the  detailed planning. The site would not be left

as a car park-cum-school field as it is now, but a

70-storey  building is coming  up  and  it  should

satisfy the Member in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gemini Chit Fund site was granted planning

approval  in 1968 for a hotel/commercial building.

This  permission was cancelled in 1970 because  of

non-compliance  with planning  conditions.  A  new

proposal   for   the  erection  of   a   24-storey

hotel/commercial building was approved  in  April,

1973.  The  developers  have  requested  that  the

project   be  deferred  because  of  the   current

economic situation. Since this site belongs  to  a

private developer, the Division cannot compel  the

developer  to proceed if he is unable  to  do  so.

However,  every encouragement is being  given  for

the revival of the proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to reply to the Member's last

question without details of the site being  given.

He  refers  to  new  buildings  being  allowed  in

Wallich Street. Perhaps he is referring to the one

at  the  junction of Wallich Street and Peck  Seah

Street where planning approval was granted for the

erection   of  a  17-storey  office  building   in

February,  1972. In contrast to the site  at  Tras

Street, which is only about 2,900 sq, ft, in area,

the  site  at the Wallich Street/Peck Seah  Street

junction  is about 10,000 sq, ft, and therefore  a

building could be allowed without prejudicing  the

comprehensive redevelopment of the area. The other

one  was not approved on the grounds that  it  was

made  on  a  piece-meal basis and  too  small  and

likely     to    prejudice    the    comprehensive

redevelopment of the area.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am not so interested in that. What I am

more interested is why a historic building such as

Raffles Institution had to be demolished?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CFA 1107*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ho Kah Leong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister elaborate on what is being

done  to  improve market gardening facilities  and

pig and poultry rearing in the State? Would it  be

feasible  to  at  least provide  market  gardening

facilities  on roof-tops of 11DB flats  which  are

lying  idle and which receive the beneficial  rays

of the sun constantly? No damage could arise where

residents  are  concerned.  This  is  one  of  the

solutions   as   Singapore  is  short   of   land.

Alternatively,  it  would  be  advisable  if   the

Government  could acquire certain pieces  of  land

and  give them to the farmers to cultivate for our

daily needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if we cannot depend much on

agriculture, what about fishing? I would  like  to

know what is being done to encourage our fishermen

to  engage themselves in deep sea fishing for  our

daily  supplies  of sea food. I suggest  that  the

Primary Production Department should take steps to

see that farmers and fishermen are well taken care

of,   and  ensure  that  ample  encouragement  and

facilities  are  given to them so  that  they  can

enjoy the fruits of their labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Department look into the price of

mutton which does not seem to come down during the

last  few  years?  Prices of  mutton  are  causing

hardship to our people. Something must be done  to

import  more sheep in order to cut down the  cost.

We   cannot  all  the  time  blame  the  exporting

countries for not exporting enough to us. I  think

we  must  decide to negotiate with  the  exporting

countries for a better deal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, although the Member for Anson is an MP for

an  urban  area,  he  has  been  very  sympathetic

towards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



farmers  and  fishermen.  For  that  I  am   very

grateful to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the job of the Primary

Production   Department   is   to   further    the

development  of our agriculture and fisheries  and

to  assist  the  rural  people  to  improve  their

methods  of  production so that their standard  of

living  could  be  raised.  However,  I  am   most

disappointed  to  find that recently  the  Primary

Production  Department officers have  become  land

inspectors instead. They go round to check whether

the  villagers have erected any illegal structures

or  whether  their buildings have  been  used  for

illegal  purposes. I have here a letter  from  the

Commissioner of Lands addressed to me saying  that

a  farmer in my constituency is manufacturing kaya

a  kind of coconut jam in his house, and that this

matter was reported to him by a land inspector  in

the  Primary Production Department. Then there  is

also  another  farmer who was found by  a  Primary

Production Department land inspector to have  used

his  store  as  a hatchery without permission.  In

actual   fact  a  hatchery  is  another  form   of

agricultural  activity.  If  the  farmer  had  not

applied  for  such  a  permit,  then  the  Primary

Production  Department  officer  should  be   more

sympathetic in his attitude. He should advise  the

farmer as to how an application could be made  for

this  purpose. On the contrary, the land inspector

not  only did not give any advice but reported  it

to  the Commissioner of Lands. So this poor farmer

removed  the incubators out of the store, thinking

that the matter would end there and there would be

no   more  trouble.  But  the  Primary  Production

Department  did  not stop there. It  made  a  very

absolute recommendation to the Land Office - allow

me  to  read  out  the  original  letter  for  the

appreciation of hon. Members here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Although the two incubators have been removed

from  the  structure,  they are  presently  placed

outside  the store and the power points are  still

intact  in the structure. We are therefore of  the

view that the two incubators



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



and  the  power  points should be totally  removed

from  the premises so that it will not be possible

for him to reuse the structure as a hatchery at  a

later date.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this farmer is regarded as though he was a

criminal,  having  committed a heinous  crime  and

would  have  to  be put to death  by  the  Primary

Production Department. As an MP for a rural  area,

I  am  most disgusted and painstricken at the base

attitude adopted by the officers of the Department

who  regard the farmers as enemies. With  such  an

attitude,   how   are  they   going   to   promote

agricultural development? I hope the Minister will

reassess  the scope of operations of  the  Primary

Production  Department  and  conduct   a   special

political  training course for those officers  who

have frequent contact with the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the current resettlement regulations,

the  allocation of land to affected farmers  would

have  to  be recommended by the Primary Production

Department.  However, there  are  complaints  that

some   people   who  are  not   engaged   in   any

agricultural work at all have been so recommended.

Finally these people chose to be allocated a  free

flat  with higher compensation, while some genuine

farmers  were not recommended for land allocation.

Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what are the

criteria   adopted   by  the  Primary   Production

Department  in  making  recommendations  for   the

allocation  of  land, and whether  the  survey  of

farmers  by the Primary Production Department  was

done  before  or after finalising the registration

of  farmers  by the Resettlement Office.  Can  the

Minister enlighten the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member for Jurong, of course, always supports

the  farmers and fishermen who live in  his  area,

but  we now have a new supporter in the Member for

Anson who has also become a farmer, fisherman  and

gardener.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the left hand of one department does

not know what the right hand is doing, MPs ask  me

questions, like the Member for Kim Keat. And  when

one   branch   of   the   Ministry   of   National

Development, that is the Primary Produc-.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



tion  Department, works hand in hand with  another

department,  the  Land Office of the  Ministry  of

Law,  they ask me questions too! So when there  is

communication they question it, and when there  is

lack of communication they also question it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong should be aware of the

efforts of the Primary Production Department, even

to  improve  market  gardening! Besides  providing

services  on  the sale of pesticides,  control  of

diseases   and  the  improvement  of  agricultural

practices,   even   hydroponic   cultivation    of

vegetables  has been encouraged so  as  to  obtain

higher  yields than ordinary vegetable cultivation

methods.  However,  that is for  hydroponics.  But

because of the high capital cost, not many farmers

have attempted this yet.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department also assists the pig and poultry

farmers  by  the sale of high grade  piglings  and

chicks   to   upgrade  stock  and  by  controlling

livestock  diseases.  Technical  know-how   gained

through  research is disseminated to the  farmers.

To   encourage  more  efficient  production,   pig

farming  on  a  large  commercial  scale  will  be

encouraged,  not  in  Jurong,  but  this  time  in

Punggol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultivation of crops on roof-tops of HDB

fiats  is  not  considered  a  practical  nor   an

economical proposition. The flats are not designed

to withstand any additional load or to accommodate

this kind of activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for fishing, Singapore has limited

territorial waters in which to fish. Our fishermen

must  go  out far to fish in international waters.

This  means  a hard vigorous life. Sometimes  they

are kidnapped and held to ransom for long periods.

So  fishing is a prospect which most of our  young

men  are  reluctant  to take up,  especially  when

there  are  more  attractive and comfortable  jobs

available on terra firma.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson likes to eat mutton, the

price  of  which he said has increased during  the

last  two years. This is true. The price of mutton

went up with other food items. In April to June



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



last year the retail price was about $3.10 per lb.

This  was  at  its  peak. But the  price  has  now

dropped by about 40 cents and this should keep the

Member   happy.  We  are  dependent  on   imported

supplies  of mutton. However, frozen or fresh,  it

is  expensive  to import live animals  as  freight

costs account for about one-third of the price  of

a live animal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong wanted to know the

criteria for the assessment of a bona fide farmer.

The status of a farmer is assessed on a number  of

factors.  Firstly, the actual number of  livestock

that the farmer owns, and secondly, the degree  of

his  other farming activities as determined by the

detailed census records of his activities over the

last  two  or three years. Thirdly, dependency  on

farming  for  a livelihood, and other  sources  of

income  are  also  taken into consideration.  This

information is collected and reviewed by  a  panel

in the Primary Production Department who then make

recommendations as to the status of  a  particular

farmer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Member's information, five licences for

kelong  operations  off the  coast  of  Tuas  were

revoked  by  the  Primary  Production  Department.

Unfortunately, the sea coast of Tuas  is  affected

by   reclamation   work   of   the   Jurong   Town

Corporation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this

opportunity  to  speak  on  the  problems  of  pig

farmers.  In  the  past,  the  Primary  Production

Department did quite a great deal for the pig  and

poultry   farmers.   For  example,   the   Primary

Production  Department provided  inoculations  for

the  chickens  in  order to  develop  the  poultry

industry.  But I understand that this service  has

stopped recently. I do not know the reason. I feel

that inoculation of chickens should continue to be

provided  to  help our poultry farmers.  Moreover,

the  Department  should also continue  to  provide

assistance in methods of increasing production and

higher  egg yields so as to meet local consumption

needs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask two questions in this

regard. Firstly, the pig farmers in Chua Chu  Kang

are  being  resettled in Punggol. The  process  of

resettlement will certainly affect the  production

of pigs. During the transitional period the supply

of  live pigs to the market will also be affected.

In the circumstances I would therefore like to ask

the  Minister what effective steps are being taken

by  the Primary Production Department to ensure an

adequate supply of pigs in the market during  this

transitional  period'? I would also like  to  know

what  steps  are  being taken to ensure  that  the

price of pork is stabilised in the process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, according to my understanding,

last   year   the  Primary  Production  Department

planned to set up an enterprise for pig farming in

the Central Experimental Station in Sembawang. Now

that  a year has passed, I would like to know what

progress has been made. Can the Minister enlighten

this House as to when will this enterprise for pig

farming be operational and when will it be able to

supply the market?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

remember   you  had  previously  ruled  that   the

colloquial  term used by the Member for  Sembawang

likening a hawker inspector to a kind of land  cow

was  somewhat unparliamentary language and  could.

not  be  used in this House. This term  was  again

used by the Member for Jurong just now. In view of

your  previous ruling, I wonder whether the Member

for Jurong would consider withdrawing such remarks

as implied in the term used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this term is a colloquial

expression used by the people. It is not meant  to

be   offensive  to  this  House  or  to  cast  any

aspersion  on any Minister or Member. How  are  we

going to reflect the views of the people if we  do

not use the term as used by the people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo:</b> Sir, the point is whether your previous ruling

is still valid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to ask in which year and at what

time was this ruling made?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo:</b> Sir, the Member for Sembawang must have a very

good  memory of this. Perhaps he can help to trace

the record.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to join in the

argument on the use of this term.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Let us not lose our tempers. Sir, I accept the

explanation of my Friend, the Member for Jurong. I

have been called worse names in this House, but  I

am  sure any name he calls me is with the best  of

intention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the resettlement programme has been in

operation for many years. The pig production  has,

in  fact,  increased between 1967 and  1972.  This

shows  that the resettlement programme has  little

effect  on  the production of pigs.  Members  will

remember  that  prices of pigs went  very  low  in

early  1972  causing  much  concern  to  the   MPs

concerned.  Production fell subsequently  in  1973

and  1974  but this was because of other  economic

factors. Prices of feed for pigs increased in 1973

and   1974  as  a  result  of  general  inflation.

Following this, the cost of pig production went up

and  the  marginal farmers were  eased  out.  Pork

prices   also  rose.  Like  any  other  commodity,

Members  should be aware that the  price  of  pork

depends  on  supply  and  demand.  During  festive

seasons  prices rise and fall back to the  general

level  soon  after. It is not always  possible  to

stabilise  the price of pork by merely  increasing

or decreasing pig production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not very good news for the Member for

Sembawang.  The intensive commercial  pig  farming

scheme, which was previously proposed to be set up

in  his  constituency,  is now  being  shifted  to

Punggol.  Sembawang  has  been  designated  as   a

catchment area. Water comes first before pigs. The

land  in Punggol is now under preparation and  the

first  lots for these pig farms will be  available

next month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware whether the Member's allegation

about  the  withdrawal of poultry  vaccination  is

true  or  not. If it is, then it is an undesirable

step and I will certainly look into it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, 1 am very glad to note that we

have  a  very broad-minded Minister. I  think  the

Parliamentary Secretary could learn a lot from him

in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister referred to his Ministry

coordinating  the work of the various departments.

What I am trying to say is that I do not mean that

there  should  not  be  any  coordination  between

government departments. Coordination is  good  but

every department must know its own basic functions

and  role in dealing with the people. For example,

in  dealing with the people, officials should take

a  sympathetic view of the matter. In the  case  I

cited just now, I feel that the Primary Production

Department  was  too  cruel.  Even  the   electric

sockets  and  plugs  had  to  be  removed.  In  my

opinion, this is going too far.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also informed the House just now

that  in my constituency five licences for kelongs

had  been  revoked. I am aware  of  this.  But  my

question  i5  this: in the revocation of  licences

for  the kelongs, the fishermen need fishing boats

to  go to the kelongs. And the problem is that the

Primary Production Department has refused to issue

licences  for  these fishing boats. As  a  result,

kelong  workers and owners are not able to  go  to

their  kelongs  in  their boats.  Hence  the  fish

caught  would be utterly lost. So I would like  to

ask  the  Minister  whether licences  for  fishing

boats can be issued to them so that they can go to

the kelongs. If he can promise me this, I will  be

very grateful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards deep-sea fishing, I am quite

aware  of  the hard life of these fishermen:  They

are  exposed  to all sorts of dangers,  risks  and

even  piracy on the high seas. I am sure that  the

Minister  also understands their problems.  He  is

also  a  good Minister as he takes an interest  in

the  welfare of fishermen who are exposed to risks

and  dangers. I feel that the Government has  some

responsibility to help the fishermen solve some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



of  their  problems. We should get in  touch  with

ASEAN  countries and work out some arrangement  to

ensure  the safety of our fishing vessels  on  the

high  seas and to ensure that should our fishermen

go  into  the  territorial waters of  other  ASEAN

countries by mistake, they should be permitted  to

continue  fishing  there.  I  wonder  whether  the

Minister will agree to this suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, as for the boat licences requested for by

the   Member,  I  will  certainly  look  into  his

request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for our fishermen, we do not abandon them on

the  high  seas.  When  they are  caught,  whether

rightly  or wrongly, our Foreign Office does  make

representations to the government concerned.  Sir,

you  may  remember  the research  vessel  "Changi"

detained  in Rangoon. We made many representations

through  the Foreign Office, and the Head  of  the

Fisheries  Department  of the  Primary  Production

Department made several trips to Rangoon not  only

to  help  the seamen who were detained but  in  an

effort to get them out. Finally we succeeded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware whether the question of fisheries

has been taken up in ASEAN. Perhaps the Member can

ask  the  Minister  for Foreign  Affairs  when  he

returns.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, what the Minister said was right. However, I

too  buy fish and vegetables, and that was  why  I

brought it up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CFE 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I would like to draw

the  attention of the Minister to cases where  the

Fisheries  Division had refused to renew  quite  a

number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



of  kelong  licences in my constituency.  However,

the  operators were told verbally that they  could

carry  on  until such time as they  were  told  to

stop.   I  am  given  to  understand  that  kelong

licences  cannot be renewed and that the operators

are  also unable to get boat licences. Sir, on the

one  hand they are allowed to carry on with kelong

fishing  but,  on  the other hand,  they  are  not

allowed  to  renew their boat licences.  I  wonder

whether  the Minister could look into this  matter

and give his sympathetic consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question I am going to raise with the

Minister has already been brought up by the Member

for  Jurong,  and therefore I would  like  to  ask

another    question.   The   fishermen    in    my

constituency, that is, in Telok Mata  ikan,  Bedok

and  Ayer Gemuroh, are very badly affected by land

reclamation  work. Big monsoon  drains  have  been

built  about  two  years ago.  I  have  asked  the

Primary Production Department and the Housing  and

Development  Board,  who were  in  charge  of  the

reclaimed  land,  to  make  every  effort  not  to

inconvenience  the  fishermen  in  that  area.   I

remember   having  asked  the  Primary  Production

Department  to construct a temporary  bridge  over

the  monsoon  drain  for the  convenience  of  the

fishermen  so that they can bring their  nets  and

other fishing gear to the sea. At the same time  I

have also asked the Department to construct a path

leading  to the sea for the fishermen.  But  until

now  this  job has not been done and the fishermen

are very unhappy about it. Some three weeks ago  I

asked  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for National Development to convene a meeting with

the  Primary Production Department and the Housing

and  Development Board, but to my surprise nothing

has been done. When I pressed the matter further I

learned  that  the  Primary Production  Department

officers  were asking the Housing Board  engineers

as to who have got to pay for the bridge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this state of affairs has been going on for

nearly two years. I was given to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



understand that the land reclamation work would be

completed in about a year's time. I hope that this

year, within a period of 12 months, something  can

be done to help these fishermen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the facts are that the Housing and

Development Board is dredging the coast off Changi

to  provide fill for the reclamation in the  Telok

Ayer Basin. As a result the licences of 15 kelongs

affected by the dredging have, therefore, not been

renewed. The licensees have been given one  year's

advance notice. But as the dredging works have yet

to  reach  these kelongs, the operators have  been

allowed  to  continue  their  operation   in   the

meantime.  Fishing  boats  serving  the   affected

kelongs  have  not been issued with  licences,  as

licences  for  the kelongs have not been  renewed.

However,  arrangements  will  be  made  to   issue

temporary licences to these boats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any reclamation work must interfere with

fishing, kelongs and their operations. Two loading

and  unloading areas for the fishermen  have  been

designated  on the coast between Bedok  and  Tanah

Merah  Besar. Roads have been provided across  the

reclaimed land to these loading areas for the  use

and  benefit of the fishermen. A crossing over the

conveyor belt system has been built servicing  the

reclamation  works and a pedestrian bridge  across

the  drainage canal at Sungei Mata Ikan have  also

been   provided   for  the  convenience   of   the

fishermen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as the Member complains, he has not been

able to get much out of the Departments concerned,

I would suggest that he puts this down in a letter

to me.

of  the  Minister,  I  beg leave  to  withdraw  my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood on the Order

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Conceicao is not moving his amendments.

Amendment  (15). Mr Ng Kah Ting is not  here.  Mr  Teong Eng Siong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 8104.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment refers to the

Urban and Rural Services Committee. The Urban  and

Rural Services Committee has achieved quite a  lot

in  the  past few years. It has provided a lot  of

services  and amenities for the rural  people  and

has  also  helped in the development of the  rural

areas. Many roads, street lights, drains and water

supply have been provided in the rural areas. ,All

these have brought benefits and convenience to the

rural  people.  However, in the last  one  or  two

years  the allocation for Urban and Rural Services

has been reduced drastically. For the current year

the provision is increased by about $200,000 only.

This  is insufficient to meet the demands  of  the

rural  areas. In the past few years many roads  in

the rural areas have been metalled, streets lights

installed, drains constructed and water  supplied.

But only half of the rural areas has been provided

with  these amenities. The other half of the rural

areas  still  lacks these modern  facilities.  The

Government   should  allocate   more   funds   for

development work to be carried out in  the  second

half of the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask two further questions.

Firstly,  we  find that many roads  in  the  rural

areas deteriorate very fast. In other words,  many

potholes appear on the surface of the roads in,  I

think, less than six months after construction. Is

it because the authorities concerned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



have  not  exercised  strict  supervision  on  the

contractors engaged in building the roads? Do  the

contractors indulge in malpractices when  building

roads? It is a waste of public funds. I would like

the  Minister  to take note of malpractices  among

the  contractors and see that the roads  built  by

the contractors are strictly supervised.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we find that the roads built by the

national  servicemen last longer than those  built

by  the  contractors. This goes to show  that  the

roads  built by national servicemen and  villagers

are  more  durable, and every cent spent is  worth

it.  Moreover, the expenditure incurred is  lower,

and  is  therefore  cheaper than  roads  built  by

contractors.  If we allow the national  servicemen

to  carry out road construction, then we can  save

half  of  the expenditure because the  other  half

goes  to  the wages of the labourers. So  I  would

like   to  ask  the  Minister  to  encourage  more

national    servicemen   to   engage    in    road

construction. Firstly, they are more lasting  and,

secondly, we can save money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I am not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Sir, kampung roads are constructed for the use

of  residents  only, and therefore can  take  only

light   traffic.  However,  once  the  roads   are

completed, heavier vehicles and higher  volume  of

traffic are attracted to the area and this  causes

the  road  to  break up relatively quickly.  Rural

roads  constructed by contractors normally have  a

four-inch  thick crusher run aggregate covered  by

1k-inch thick asphalt. The standard roads  have  a

four-inch  thick  quarry waste sub-base  under  an

eight-inch layer of crusher run aggregate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



covered  by a two-inch asphalt premix. The latter,

of course, cost very much more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads constructed under gotong royong projects

use   PWD  machinery  and  workmen  and  voluntary

assistance by members of the public, resulting  in

a saving in cost, and normally used to incorporate

a   sublayer  of  quarry  waste.  I  support   the

suggestion of the Member to encourage more  gotong

royong road projects. However, there is a limit to

which  the  PWD  machinery  and  workmen  can   be

deployed for this purpose as their routine work of

patching  up potholes and repairing minor  damages

to other roads would be affected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> (In Mandarin): Sir, I would like to thank the Parliamentary

Secretary  for  his explanation. I  beg  leave  to

withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting is not here to move amendment

(10). Mr Ho See Beng, amendment (10).



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 8201*.



(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ng Kah Ting, Lee Yiok Seng, L. P. Rodrigo and Ong Teng Cheong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a matter in connection with the

Resettlement  Department  under  the  Housing  and

Development Board. As a result of urban renewal in

my  constituency,  many  single  persons  who  are

affected by it have been unable to obtain priority

for  allocation  of Housing and Development  Board

flats.  The  Resettlement  Department  refused  to

resettle  them on the ground that these subtenants

have  never lived there at the time when a  census

was taken and therefore their names did not appear

in its register.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the this ground unfortunate. Department's

official held against them, it is most They are

unlike those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



people  who,  knowing that the property  has  been

acquired,  moved in and stayed after  the  cut-off

date,  in  the  hope  of  obtaining  priority  for

allocation of HDB flats when eviction takes place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the subtenants I am referring to are bona

fide  residents, whose authenticity can be  proved

beyond  doubt as their identity cards  bear  their

names,  addresses and date of original issue  long

before   the  acquisition  took  place.  But,   Mr

Speaker, Sir, the reason why their names have  not

been  recorded  in  the  census  at  the  time  of

acquisition  is that they have "missed  the  boat"

while working on board the ship, if I may use this

analogy  to  describe their position. Hence,  when

the  Resettlement Officers visited their place  of

abode  to  take  census,  their  names  were   not

recorded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that clothing, food,

accommodation  and conduct are the four  important

factors in a man's life. If so, how can they  live

without   accommodation?  They  are  citizens   of

Singapore,  and how can we see them roaming  about

in the streets without a roof over their heads?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, Sir, I appeal to the Minister

concerned  to  make  a ruling on  this  matter  in

favour  of  these unfortunate single persons,  the

victims  of  circumstances, who  have  lost  their

dwelling places through no fault of their own.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am afraid I am not prepared to make the

ruling asked for without an investigation into the

facts and particulars. Single persons affected  by

resettlement    are   entitled   to    alternative

accommodation and priority therefore if  they  can

get others to join - two or three bachelors or two

or  three spinsters getting together provided,  of

course, they qualify in other respects. Here,  the

Member  says that their identity cards  show  that

they are living at Bras Basah constituency and  at

the time of the census, they were not around. That

raises a doubt as to whether they missed the  boat

as  the Member said, either in Bras Basah or  they

missed  the boat elsewhere. Perhaps they were  not

seamen. We can look into their particulars



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



and  if  they  can prove by their  passports,  for

instance, that they were working as seamen at  the

date    when   the   census   was   taken,   every

consideration will be given to their cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, it seems we have got to settle this matter

outside the Chamber once again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I wish to raise the issue of non-citizens who

are affected by the resettlement clearance scheme.

In the resettlement clearance sites, we often come

across  families where both husband and  wife  are

non-citizens  but  hold  blue  Singapore  identity

cards, and their children, born in Singapore, hold

Singapore  pink  identity  cards  but   they   are

underaged. According to the current policy of  the

Housing  and  Development  Board,  they  are   not

eligible  for  rehousing  under  the  resettlement

priority scheme. Although they have been living in

these clearance sites for many years, they are not

considered  for rehousing and have to  find  their

own   alternative  accommodation,  which  is  very

difficult.  As there is no way out, they  stay  on

day  after day in the clearance sites. They do not

know what to do, and because of this the clearance

projects  have to be delayed. Therefore,  I  would

like to ask the Minister whether he is prepared to

reconsider  the  HDB  policy and  to  allow  these

people   to   purchase   HDB   flats   under   the

resettlement priority scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Government's first duty is towards its

citizens.  Our policies must favour our  citizens.

Let  us look after ourselves first and if we  can,

we will look after others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for HDB policy, only Singapore citizens can

apply for Housing Board accommodation. Non-citizen

families   are   not  provided  with   alternative

accommodation by the HDB even though they  may  be

affected by development projects. However, we have

become  a little flexible. A family, some of  whom

are  non-citizens, can qualify if the majority are

citizens  or permanent residents and the applicant

is a Singapore citizen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



above  the age of 21. In the case that the  Member

quoted  the mother and father were not born  here.

They  have  three children. That is all right.  If

they  have only one child, then it is no good.  It

means they must have more children to qualify, and

the  Minister for Health would not like that.  But

here we are being sympathetic and human.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of families which are affected by

resettlement, the second condition, i.e, the  age

limit  of 21, is relaxed and the family is allowed

to  rent  HDB  flats  on  a  temporary  occupation

licence  basis. There has to be this condition  if

the  eldest child is under 21 hut above 12  years.

When the eldest child reaches 21, a proper tenancy

agreement is executed.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, under this head, I just wish to raise two

queries in relation to the massive project that is

being  undertaken in the constituency of Serangoon

Gardens. With the vast clearance that is going on,

I  would  like to ask the Minister (a) to  restate

the  policy  of  the Ministry on the  compensation

that  is  accorded to the management of a  private

school,  as  and when the Housing and  Development

Board acquires the land and demolishes the school,

and  (h)  such  policy  in relation  to  community

centres.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also would like to raise a query in

relation  to a road in the constituency  which  is

very  much  used by farmers and residents  in  the

kampung areas, namely, Cheng San Road. May I  know

whether there is a plan to develop this road  into

a  main thoroughfare. Because if there is, then it

will lead into the estate proper and will become a

main thoroughfare for traffic. This could lead  to

considerable  congestion in the estate  which,  as

the  Minister knows, consists of roads  which  are

rather  narrow  and  which do  not  make  adequate

provision for large traffic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, Cheng San Road will eventually have to be

closed and re-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



placed  by a new road system proposed for Ang  Moh

Kio New Town. Different portions of Cheng San Road

will  be closed off in about a year. However,  the

residents  in this section will he able to  obtain

access through the new road system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for community centres, the decision whether

or  not  to  demolish depends upon the  structural

condition  of the building, its accessibility  and

its location within the new estate. Of course, the

People's  Association has a big say and they  will

be  consulted to find an appropriate site if a new

centre i5 needed. However, any existing Ones  will

continue until an alternative site is provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for schools, compensation is provided.

Whether  or  not an alternative site  is  provided

will  depend on the circumstances and, of  course,

advice of the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, it is observed that the standard of

maintenance   services   in   the   Housing    and

Development    Board   estates   has    apparently

deteriorated,   despite   the   fact   that    the

conservancy  charges  have increased  since  early

last  year. The lawns are not mowed regularly  and

the  public corridors and staircases are not  kept

clean  as  they  should he. I hope the  Management

Department  of  the Housing and Development  Board

will examine and tighten their administration  and

supervision  to  ensure that  full  and  effective

maintenance   services   are   rendered   by   the

maintenance contractors or subcontractors or  sub-sub-contractors. Meanwhile I wish to ascertain  if

the   Housing  and  Development  Board   has   any

intention  to expand their maintenance  department

and  task force to maintain their estates  instead

of  relying  on  the  maintenance  contractors  or

subcontractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to request the Minister to

reconsider  the suggestions which have  been  made

frequently of the provision of lift attendants  in

Housing  Board estates, in view of the  increasing

crime  rate  particularly  in  these  high-density

housing  estates.  I hope that the  suggestion  of

providing lift attendants will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



be ignored or brushed aside simply because it will

cost  the HDB $8 million to $10 million a year.  I

am sure the Minister is aware that many direct and

indirect  savings and other benefits  will  accrue

with  the  introduction of  lift  attendants.  For

example,   it  will  cut  down,  if  not   totally

eliminate,  vandalism to lifts  and  other  public

properties:  This  is a direct, though  invisible,

saving  to  the  Housing  and  Development  Board.

Besides,  the consequent reduction in crime  rate,

such  as  robberies in the lifts or in the  flats,

would mean a saving not only to the society  as  a

whole but also to the Ministry of Home Affairs  in

respect  of  their  costs  of  administration  and

operation  against crime. But the  most  important

consequential  benefit is  that  the  Housing  and

Development  Board estates will be  a  much  safer

place  to  live  in.  Therefore,  I  request   the

Minister  to  take the suggestions  seriously  and

perhaps I should take this opportunity to urge him

to  consider  the possibility of  carrying  out  a

comprehensive cost-benefit study on the subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue is the most generally

acknowledged fact that the quality of construction

and  finish of HDB flats have obviously been  poor

and deteriorating. I would like to know what steps

are being taken to remedy the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to ask the Minister - I

have  brought it up previously and I  am  sure  he

will  recall  it-  is the problem of  water-logged

open  spaces in Toa Payoh Town. I had raised  this

point in the past and he admitted then that he was

aware  of the problem and that he would look  into

it. I wish to enquire what measures or action have

been taken so far to remedy the situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, by and large, the standard of maintenance

services in Housing and Development Board  estates

has   not   deteriorated.  In  some  estates   the

maintenance contractors have found it uneconomical

to  operate  unless they accumulate  their  repair

orders  over  a period so as to make  less  trips,

thereby inconveniencing many residents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has taken

steps  to  rectify this by dividing these  estates

into zones so that more contractors are engaged to

deal  effectively  in respect of  each  zone.  The

Housing  and  Development Board has also  recently

formed  a  high  level inspection  team  which  is

charged   with  the  task  of  looking  into   and

rectifying  any  shortcomings in  the  maintenance

service.  The Board relies directly on its  daily-rated task force for the maintenance of 75% of its

open  public spaces. The remaining 25% of the work

is let out to maintenance contractors. In a way it

is  good  administration to have some  competition

between  the  two groups as a guide to measurement

of efficiency and cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to flooding referred to by the Member, sub-soil drainage has been introduced to the open

space  between Blocks Nos. 1 and 2, Lorong 6,  Toa

Payoh.  Part  of  the  area  was  also  raised  by

additional  fill and this measure  appears  to  be

satisfactory so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lifts, I can assure the Member that we do

not  brush aside reasonable suggestions. It  would

appear impractical to introduce the lift attendant

system.  We  had  discussed this  before  in  this

House.  Today there are about 1,700 lifts  in  HDB

estates.  Based  on 24 shifts per  day  per  lift,

about  4,250 lift attendants would be required  to

man  the  lifts.  This number  would  continue  to

increase  in  future as more lifts  are  put  into

operation  in new blocks of flats. At the  moment,

of  course, it is not even easy to recruit such  a

number  of lift attendants, even if residents  are

prepared  to  pay an additional $10 per  flat  per

month for lift attendant services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member on the benefits lift

attendants  must bring -reduced crime and  reduced

vandalism, and general cleanliness. Some lifts are

in a disgraceful condition because of the use made

of  them  by  some people. But I  can  assure  the

Member  that we have not completely brushed  aside

the   suggestion  and  have  been  reviewing  this

proposal over the years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, with more than 180,000 units of flats under

the  management  of  the Housing  and  Development

Board  and nearly half the population residing  in

housing  Board  flats, the problems  mentioned  by

various Members of the House will increase in  the

future.  It  is  recognised that the  Housing  and

Development  Board  has  a  formidable   task   to

construct and manage the numerous housing estates.

Too   often  have  we  heard  of  defects  in  the

construction of flats, resettlement of  residents,

hawkers,  parking  charges  and  the  attitude  of

Housing  and  Development Board officials  towards

members of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the main function of the Housing

and  Development  Board is to  construct  as  many

flats  as possible at the shortest possible  time,

and  then  follow  up with strict  enforcement  of

tenancy  and  lease agreements to prevent  abuses.

Very  little  is being done to foster good  public

relations between residents and officials  of  the

Housing Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letters to the press are promptly answered.

These are mostly in defence of the inadequacies of

the service provided by the Housing Board. Tenants

and  hawkers,  particularly those from  the  lower

income  group, are constantly harassed or  treated

with  indifference by hawker inspectors and  other

officials. Problems and complaints brought  up  by

them are not properly attended to. Very often they

are  told to refer their problems to the  MPs,  if

they are not satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit that the Estate Officers in charge

of  an  Area  Office  have an unenviable  task  to

perform.  In most cases, they handle the  problems

pretty well. But those officers below them do  not

appear  to  understand the problems of  residents,

shop-keepers  and hawkers. It is  recognised  that

the  Estate Officer cannot handle all the problems

himself,  but then the officers serving under  him

should   be   properly  trained,   especially   in

maintaining   good  public  relations   with   the

residents in the various housing estates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on some of these

complaints  and inadequacies, in the balloting  of

flats  we  often  notice prospective  flat  owners

jumping  up  with joy or rubbing their hands  with

glee  the  moment it was announced that they  have

got their ideal flats, that is, on the lower floor

or  facing  the  desired direction.  This  gleeful

expression  is short-lived, and it soon  turns  to

gloom  when  they receive the keys  to  the  flat,

because on inspection of the flats they will  find

so  many defects which Members of this House  have

been  complaining about. The most  common  defects

are uneven floors, paint- or tar-soiled floors. My

party  office, for instance, I had to saw off  the

bottom of three doors in order to accommodate  the

unevenness of the floors. For those who can afford

to  relay the floors with mosaic, etc., it is  all

right.  But  what about those who  cannot  afford,

especially the people resettled from other  areas?

I would suggest that the Housing Board contractors

should be asked to place as a deposit a prescribed

sum of money or a bank guarantee with the Board on

the  understanding that if defects are found  such

deposit  would  be confiscated and the  contractor

barred  from  Housing Board projects for  a  given

period.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that the Housing Board has

done  nothing to rectify the defects found in  the

flats.  It  is  the time taken and  the  haphazard

manner  in  which the contractors  put  right  the

defects.  One  solution would  be  to  allow  flat

owners  to  rectify  the  defects  themselves  and

charge the cost to the Housing Board who will,  in

turn,  recover  this  cost  from  the  contractors

responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, shopkeepers and hawkers are always at the receiving end of the stick. When they want to rectify any of the defects mentioned earlier, they are asked to pay a reinstatement deposit amounting to hundreds of dollars. It is a common practice for shopkeepers to display their wares or advertise their services in order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



promote sales. Officials of the Housing Board are

unduly strict in the application of regulations

governing obstruction in common passage-ways. In

one instance, shopkeepers in my constituency had

their goods confiscated for allegedly causing

obstruction. When I took this matter up with the

Area Office, I was asked to refer it to the head

office. The official in the head office told me

that the problem could be easily settled if I were

to ask the shopkeepers concerned to see him. When

the shopkeepers called at his office, they were

politely told that the goods had already been

disposed of. All this happened in one day. Surely

the HDB is not that efficient! When it comes to

exercising their right, Housing Board officials

are unusually quick on the draw. But when

complaints are lodged, it takes a long time for

them to act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present system of rentals

for  eating  houses and hawker stalls  in  Housing

Board  estates  could lead to  many  problems  and

abuses.  The  usual minimum rental  for  a  eating

house is around $700, but it is often tendered for

as  high  as  $3,000. To recover this amount,  the

shophouse  tenant  sublets  as  many  cooked  food

stalls  as  the  shop-house  can  accommodate   at

rentals between $100 and $600 each a month.  In  a

coffee  shop premises as much as 50% of the  floor

space  is rented out to these cooked food  stalls.

The  result is that patrons have to eat  on  five-foot  ways and in adjacent empty spaces. Then here

comes  along  a  Housing Board  official  to  take

action  against the offending coffee shop  tenant.

This goes on all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentals for cooked food stalls arc the same,

irrespective of the type of food sold  in  Housing

Board  hawker centres. For instance, an  ice-water

seller is charged the same rental as one who  runs

a  restaurant type of business. The daily turnover

of  these  two types' of business is poles  apart.

Such   a   situation  gives  rise  to  abuse   and

malpractice.   It   encourages   stallholders   to

illegally sublet or assign their stalls to  others

for a profit. For example, if a person pays



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



$500  to $600 for a stall in a coffee shop to sell

Hokkien  mee,  a stallholder in the hawker  centre

near  to the coffee shop can demand a similar rate

for  subletting or illegal assigning of his stall.

In Hokkien, this term is known as pak hor Ian, or,

in  English  it  is  known as  Ali  Baba  type  of

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister would probably ask me why I

did  not report this state of affairs. The  reason

is  that it is very difficult to prove such wrong-doing  as  there  is some collusion  somewhere.  I

would suggest that offenders should be charged for

corruption  if  they illegally  sublet  or  assign

their  shophouse for a profit. Anyone  who  enters

into such an arrangement makes exorbitant profits,

all tax-free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would suggest the following proposals.

The  Housing Board should restrict the  number  of

cooked  food  stalls  allowed  for  subletting  in

coffee shops. It should be based on the proportion

of the floor space available. In other words, if a

coffee  shop premises has a floor space  of  3,000

sq, ft, so  many square feet of  space  will  be

allowed for cooked food stalls and so many  square

feet  for  patrons. A ceiling should he placed  on

rentals  for  subletting, just  like  the  maximum

rental  charged by flat owners who wish to  sublet

their  flats.  Rentals for cooked food  stalls  in

hawker centres should he based on the type of food

sold.  In this way, we can minimise all the abuses

and malpractices mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the hawker centres in Housing Board

estates  are badly planned. Two hawker centres  in

Toa  Payoh have been reconstructed costing several

hundred thousand dollars. Another one is earmarked

for reconstruction. In some of these centres there

is  an  excess of stalls in a certain trade and  a

shortage  in  others. There are either  inadequate

facilities  or no access for hawkers  to  transfer

their  goods into the market. As a result passage-ways and footpaths are clogged with goods carriers

left  there  by  the hawkers. Some of  the  access

facilities  lead  only half way into  the  market.

Hawkers are compelled to make use of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



the  paved  areas around the market, thus  causing

more  obstruction and littering. To overcome  this

problem and shortcoming, I would suggest that  the

Housing  Board consult the MP in the  area  before

constructing any hawker centre or market.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Cheong, your ten minutes are up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if everything that the hon. Member has said

is   true,   then   he  had  better   change   his

constituency.  He  won  the  last  election  quite

easily, which means the people in his constituency

are happy and, I repeat, if everything he says  is

true and the people there are so unhappy, then  he

had better watch out in the next elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to be fair to the Housing Board, and I have

not  heard one good word about the Board  in  this

House,  it  is  doing a good job.  The  number  of

houses that it has built or is building under  its

programme  over the last five years has  increased

four-fold. Today it is building about 25,000 units

per  year  and the target is 30,000 in a  year  or

two. But the actual volume of construction work is

more  than four times as the average sizes of  the

flats are more than twice those built earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shortage of skilled construction

workers  in  the  Republic.  The  workmanship  has

suffered  somewhat not only because of the  larger

proportion  of unskilled and semi-skilled  workers

but  because  of  the increase in the  numbers  of

buildings   or  building  units  that  are   being

constructed  every year. However,  the  structural

soundness  of the buildings is in no way affected.

There  is no short cut to training a large  number

of  skilled workers. It requires several years  of

apprenticeship at the construction site. The Board

has,  in  conjunction with the Industrial Training

Board, sponsored a scheme to train more workers at

construction sites. The response has not been very

encouraging.   The   majority   of   our   workers

apparently prefer jobs in offices or hotels  where

they work in air-conditioned comfort.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked for the retention of a

deposit. The answer is that the Board has a system

whereby it retains 5% of the contract price over a

period of six months, in case there are defects to

the buildings which have to be put right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member complained about the Board's

officers.  I  understand that the  Board's  Estate

Officers  and  Assistant Estate Officers  actively

participate   in  Meet-the-People  sessions   with

Members  of  Parliament in all the  constituencies

where there are HDB estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If not, then we will send some of these

officers.  Problems concerning  tenants  and  flat

owners are dealt with directly, wherever possible,

to    minimise   bureaucratic   red   tape.   Such

participation  by  the  Board's  Estate   Officers

should promote goodwill between flat dwellers  and

the Board. As regards Estate Officers who are rude

or  do  not  do  their work properly, disciplinary

action will be taken against them. In fact,  quite

a few have been dismissed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need to say more except to

assure  the  Member  for Toa Payoh  that  we  will

seriously consider all the suggestions he has made

and, wherever feasible, put them into practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under this subhead several

complaints have been made by various Members,  but

in  so  far  as the issues I have brought  up  are

concerned,  the door is not slammed  in  my  face.

Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn viz.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Probably it would be convenient at this stage to

have  a  suspension.  But  before  I  suspend  the

sitting,  may  I make some remarks  about  my  so-called ruling on the Chinese term "land cow". This

happened  during  the sitting on the  23rd  March,

1971,  when I did indicate to Mr Teong not to  use

the   term   "land  cow"  but  to  use  the   word

"inspector", as a certain Member of this House was

particularly unhappy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



about  the  term "land cow". I did not then  know

why,  but  he was unhappy. Anyway, it  was  not  a

definite  ruling as this Chinese term  is  one  of

common  usage  in  Singapore  and  I  am  not   an

authority on Chinese usage here. So it  is  not  a

definite ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took tile Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suspend the Sitting now and will

take the Chair again at 5.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head S (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 8301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment presents an opportunity to

reopen  the  matter which the Minister  has  dealt

with quite thoroughly. But maybe there are one  or

two   matters,  relating  in  particular  to   the

clearance  activity being undertaken  in  the  new

town, Ang Mo Kio, in my constituency, that need to

be  aired.  The Minister has told the  House  that

physical  clearance of families who have  received

clearance notices actually takes place some months

after  notice of clearance and notice to quit  are

given  to  the families. This is quite true,  Sir.

But complaints have reached me from families being

resettled  in my constituency that while  this  is

so,  officials  from  the Resettlement  Department

continue  to  urge families having  received  such

clearance  notice  to  move  out  as  quickly   as

possible. And all the time that this is being done

the  question of compensation entitlement  of  the

families and the computation thereof have not been

completed in the cases that have been referred  to

me.   I  would  have  thought  that  having  given

clearance  notice to the families, the next  thing

that should be done by the Resettlement Department

is to hastily decide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



the  question of compensation entitlement and then

`worry  about computing the amount of compensation

to  be  given before urging the families  to  move

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter relates also to resettlement in

the  sense that the Resettlement Officers go round

to  approve  closure of ponds which  are  a  basic

factor  in  the  livelihood of the  farmers,  even

before   computation  of  compensation  or   their

entitlement  is decided. This causes  hardship  to

the  farmers  in the area. Ponds,  on  which  they

depend  to feed their pigs and sometimes vegetable

farms, need to be levelled off or covered over  by

the  earth in the levelling process, and this also

causes   hardship   to   many   families   in   my

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to bring notice of this development to

the  Minister because it appears to me and to  the

families in my constituency who are affected  that

the  officers from the Resettlement Department may

be  over-enthused in their work. I am particularly

worried  when  I  read, for example,  the  1973-74

Housing and Development Board Annual Report, under

Resettlement,  page  4,  where  the   Resettlement

Department  talks  about  achieving  an   all-time

record  of resettling 12,067 cases in the 15-month

period under review, and so on. This gives me  the

impression  that the Department may  be  regarding

such  families  as near cases to be resolved.  But

these are families whose lives are being disrupted

and  who  have  to  change  to  a  new  means   of

livelihood.  I  hope  the Resettlement  Department

will be prepared to extend human consideration  to

such  cases and not treat them just as cases  with

an   enthusiasm  to  outdo  previous  records   in

resettling  families. I am sure the Minister  will

be able to undertake some action here to alleviate

the worries of the families in my constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, a notice to quit is served on all

resettlement  cases. This is a legal formality  to

enable  the  Department to  obtain  a  warrant  of

dispossession from the Magistrates'  Courts  where

those concerned do not move. With this warrant the

Department can ensure that resettlement  cases  do

not resist clearance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



when  actual physical clearance is initiated.  But

the  warrant  is  only used as a last  resort  and

actual  physical clearance is not initiated  until

alternative  accommodation has been  provided  and

computation  of  compensation to  the  prospective

resettler has been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Serangoon Gardens

that the Resettlement Department is not interested

in  breaking any records. The Department is  under

considerable pressure from various Ministries, not

only from the Ministry of National Development  as

far  as  sites for housing are concerned but  they

have also the unpleasant task of resettling people

in  most parts of Singapore for practically  every

department.  When tile Ministry of  Defence  wants

large  areas in Singapore for the requirements  of

the  military,  it is the Resettlement  Department

that  has  to  do the dirty work. So it  is  under

considerable pressure from the Ministry of Defence

to do its resettling as soon as it is possible. If

we  are to provide cheap housing accommodation for

people  as  in Ang Mo Kio, then they  have  to  be

resettled.   But   the   Resettlement   Department

officers are not over-enthused with their work. As

far  as it is possible they are humane. As I  said

yesterday, resettlement is an unpleasant  business

hut  it  has  to  be done if Singapore  is  to  be

redeveloped.   People   sometimes    get    bitter

especially  when they have to be resettled  twice.

But this is happening in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I accept the explanation given by the

Minister,   and  I  beg  leave  to   withdraw   my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr

L. P. Rodrigo -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(18) That the sum to be allocated for Head S be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CDA 8103.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(19) That the sum to be allocated for Head S be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (a) of  subhead CDB 8106.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I am not moving my amendments (18) and (19)

in  view  of the fact that in the debate  on  this

Ministry  a  number of matters  mentioned  by  the

Minister  relate  to some of the  queries  that  I

intended to raise under these two subheads.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well. Mr Govindasamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CDR 8106.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year when $300,000 was appropriated

for   the  widening  of  Upper  Thomson  Road  and

Sembawang Road I was relieved, and I thought  that

at last the bottleneck at Neo Soon was going to be

eased  and  that  there would be a  free  flow  of

traffic. But, sad to say, the bottleneck there has

become more acute and traffic jams are more common

now  than ever before. Last year only S 10,000 was

utilised, unfortunately. With the new Jurong  Town

Corporation  flats coming up there, the  expansion

of  the  shipyard  and  the industrial  estate  in

Sembawang, it is even more essential now to  widen

that  road.  I hope this year at least the  amount

appropriated   will   be   utilised    and    some

improvements   made   to  this   important   road,

especially with the industrial estate being  built

in Sembawang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to the Member for

Telok  Blangah for moving this amendment. I  share

the  sentiments expressed by him because with  the

expansion   of  Sembawang  Shipyard, and   other

industrial  projects  the  existing  road  is  too

narrow and it is not able to cope with the traffic

during  the peak hours in the morning  or  in  the

evening,  resulting in congestion. The Member  for

Serangoon Gardens and the Member for Telok Blangah

live   in   my   constituency.   They   personally

experience such traffic congestion when they go to

work in the morning and return in the evening. The

traffic  congestion  has  become  more  and   more

serious.   I  would  also  like  to  support   the

suggestion put forward by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Telok Blangah to widen  he  road  in

order to cope with tile traffic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am glad for this opportunity to reply to

both  Members. My answer will put the Resettlement

Department in a better light. They asked what have

we  done  about this road since we had money  last

year  but  nothing was done. The answer is,  there

are  problems in connection with resettlement  and

land  acquisition.  There  are  large  numbers  of

resettlement cases, and at least 450 shops  to  be

resettled. Hence the delay. In order to  speed  up

construction,  the  road has  been  realigned,  in

consultation  with  the  Housing  and  Development

Board,  to minimise the number of cases that  need

to  be  resettled. The Resettlement Department  is

not  anxious to resettle people nor is it  anxious

to break records.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $600,000 is only part of the

amount  for  the widening of the entire  Sembawang

Road from Sembawang Hill Circus to Admiralty Gate.

The  project  will be carried out in three  stages

and will cost more than $9 million when completed.

Stage I from Mandai Road to Jalan Sembawang Kechil

is  targeted to begin in the third quarter o 1975.

So  I ask the Members to be a little patient. Work

on  Stage II from Sembawang Hill Circus to  Mandai

Road  will  begin  in the first quarter  of  1976,

whilst  Stage III from Jalan Sembawang  Kechil  to

Admiralty Gate will start in the first quarter  of

1978. When fully completed by the end of 1978, the

road  will be a dual carriageway with two  traffic

lanes  in  each direction. I hope this  will  keep

Members   happy,  but  this  is  all  subject   to

resettlement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a hint that medical charges may

be  further  increased. This is  not  the  first

time  that the charges have been increased ;  in

fact  the  medical charges have  been  increased

too  often.  There  is no  doubt  that  cost  in

hospitals, clinics, etc., have gone up.  But  in

this  particular matter, we have to  think  very

carefully  before we increase  the  charges.  If

the  increases  are too great,  it  will  affect

those  in  the lower income group very badly.  A

person  suffering from a cold  or  some  disease

may have to visit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



the Outpatients Department two or three times. The

lower  income  group will suffer a great  deal  if

they  have to go to private clinics for treatment.

I  am  afraid that tile people in this  particular

group  have a tendency to go to tile quacks or  to

those Who call themselves doctors though they  are

not medically qualified in any way. The net result

is that we may have people deformed or worse after

the   treatment   received  from   these   quacks.

Therefore, these people have no choice but  to  go

to  Government clinics or hospitals for treatment,

causing greater headaches to the doctors and staff

in  the hospitals. I would request the Minister to

reconsider this question of the proposed  increase

in medical charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this particular subject, I would again like

to raise the problem of our nurses and doctors who

are  being  worked to the bone in  the  hospitals,

giving  the  public and perhaps even foreigners  a

very  poor  impression of tile Government  medical

service.  This subject may be very stale,  but  in

fact, it is repeated so often that no wonder there

is  an  exodus  of medical personnel to  countries

like Canada and Australia. We must try our best to

retain these people as we need them so badly here.

We  should not close an eye to their problems  for

it  will  result in dissatisfaction and emigration

to  other countries by our doctors and nurses whom

we  need  so  badly in our own country.  Something

must  definitely be done for them.  Otherwise,  if

nothing is done we will have this problem year  in

and  year  out.  The  result  will  be  a  chronic

congestion  in  the hospitals, overworked  doctors

and dissatisfied medical staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though a certain amount of publicity has

been  given  to  the zoning of  hospitals,  it  is

insufficient.  My  contention  is   that   greater

publicity should be given to this matter  so  that

it  will  ease the confusion in the minds  of  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the new General Hospital that is being

built  in the grounds of the Out-ram Road  General

Hospital would he built in such a way that it will

not in-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



convenience the sick, the aged and the  disabled.

In  the present layout, patients have to walk long

distances   from  one  section  to   another   for

treatment. Take the example of a person who has  a

dislocation.  He  has to report at  the  Emergency

Unit,  then  to  the  X-ray  unit,  then  to   the

Orthopaedic  Unit, then to X-ray Unit  again,  and

back   again  10  the  Orthopaedic  Unit.   Making

patients walk to and fro for long distances is not

going  tor  had  to be awakened to attend  to  the

hospital  or  a  well-run hospital, especially  to

those  who are already in agony. No doubt at  this

point  I may also mention one fact which has  been

taxing  our minds. Let us hope that the  extension

of  the  hospital will be well planned so that  it

will not inconvenience the sick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, may .I ask what is the procedure for

treatment  of children at outpatient  clinics?  In

some cases school children who go to these clinics

are  not required to pay, and in other cases  tile

same  children are required to pay. Payment  seems

to he at tile discretion o, the clerk in charge at

the counter



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treatment at the Alexandra Hospital requires

particular  attention, especially after  midnight.

There  was  an  occasion when  the  clerk  in  the

Emergency  Unit was in deep slumber  and  it  took

quite  an  effort to wake him up. Then the  doctor

had  to be awakened to attend to the patient. This

might  have taken as much as half an hour. Surely,

in the Emergency Unit, half an hour is a very very

long  time in which to save a person's life  which

sometimes  can be decided in a matter of  minutes.

Furthermore,  in  the  same  hospital  as  far  as

medicine  is concerned, the patient was not  given

any  medicine. He had to go back the next  morning

for   his  medicine  because  the  dispensary  was

closed.   This   caused   further   inconvenience.

Something   should  be  done  to   alleviate   the

suffering  of the sick. They should not be  forced

to go back to the hospital again and again just to

take a bottle of medicine or some pills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there have been cases in some hospitals

where  wrong medicine had been given. As a result,

I know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



of  a patient who has developed an allergy even to

panadol. Such mistakes would not have occurred  if

the doctors had not been overworked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a case of a person who was warded

in  the  Singapore General Hospital.  A  few  days

later  he was transferred to another ward. On  the

day  he  was transferred, his wife went  to  visit

him.  At  the ward she was told that he  had  been

discharged and had gone home. This lady was  happy

that  her husband had been discharged and went  on

her  way home. At the bus stop she met her mother-in-law  who  was also on her way to see  him.  She

told  her  mother-in-law  that  her  husband   had

already  been  discharged. But  her  mother-in-law

said that she came from home and had not seen him.

So they decided to go home. When they reached home

he  was  not to be found. Subsequently, they  were

worried  and telephoned the hospital. The hospital

staff failed to assist them and requested them  to

go  to the hospital. Later, at the hospital,  they

finally   learnt   that  the  patient   had   been

transferred to another ward. Sir, I want  to  know

why  these  two women had to be inconvenienced.  I

hope   the   hospital  staff  could  give   proper

information and not cause people to panic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that patients in third class

wards  of Kandang Kerbau Hospital are not  treated

properly. I have received complaints that they are

treated very badly by some of the staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, may I answer the Member for Anson point by

point?  Firstly,  with regard to  the  raising  of

medical charges. As stated in the Addendum to  the

Presidential Address, increases in medical charges

have  become  necessary because of the  escalating

costs. Costs have increased from 5% in 1952 to 25%

in  1974. This will continue to escalate as prices

of medicine, equipment, staff, follow inflationary

trends.  However,  the increase  in  charges  will

remain nominal. For example, C class patients  are

now  charged $3 a day for food, medical  care  and

stay  in hospital. But the actual cost per day  of

maintaining a patient is more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



than  $40.  Therefore, even  if  the  charges  are

increased  to  $4  or  $5 per  day,  it  is  still

nominal.  Increases in cost must be by  taxpayers.

It is only fair, therefore, that those who use the

services should bear part of the cost in the  form

nominal  fees.  This  is consistent  oft  repeated

policy that in Singapore is for free. This prevent

wastage.



5.30 p.m



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of patients resorting may I say

this.  In  considering  any  increase  fees,   the

Government  is concerned as the Member  for  Anson

its  effects  on the lower in-up. In  fact,  if  a

patient  cannot pay even the nominal fee there  on

for  the fee to be waived, as been done all along.

Therefore,  there is no reason for any  person  to

quacks  because  of the increase medical  charges.

Attendance has, in fact, continued to increase  at

all our institutions and outpatient



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the question of loss of medical

staff,  the  Member for Anson said it  as  due  to

staff  being overworked, and so on. He  also  said

that it is a stale subject as it is often repeated

from  year to year. I agree with him that it is  a

tale subject. To me it sounds like playing an  old

gramophone  record  again. I  have  answered  this

question in my reply to the Member for Bras  Basah

last  week . I stated quite clearly that  positive

Steps  have  been taken to attract as  well  s  to

retain more doctors in the service. May I say that

there has been no exodus of doctors, as stated  by

the  Member for Anson and predicted by the  Member

for  Kim  Seng  last year. As far  as  nurses  are

concerned,  they  too  have  benefited  from   the

implementation  of  the National  Wages  Council's

recommendations.  Their  working  conditions  have

also improved by shorter night duties. They now do

three  night shifts at a stretch instead of  seven

hitherto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the zoning of hospitals which has been

introduced  recently, the Member complained  about

lack of publicity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



Publicity  was  given   prior   to   the

implementation   of  the  zoning   of   hospitals.

Information  for the public was given through  the

radio,   television,  press  releases  and   press

conferences.  General  practitioners   were   also

informed  separately  by  circulars  and  hospital

staff were briefed. But, of course, whenever a new

system is introduced there is bound to be teething

problems.  It  is too early to say how  successful

this  zoning  will  be. But it is  important  that

zoning is implemented, otherwise the position will

arise  where  certain hospitals are  over-utilised

and others under-utilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the complaint of the Member for Anson

about patients having to walk long distances, thus

causing  inconvenience, and also matters  relating

to  the running of the hospital, I agree with  him

that the present layout of the Outram Road General

Hospital  leaves much to be desired.  Members  may

know that this Hospital was built more than half a

century  ago  and  over the years other  buildings

were  added  on  without any systematic  planning.

This  is one of the reasons for the building of  a

new   Singapore   General  Hospital   which   will

eventually replace the present Outram Road General

Hospital.  The  Member for Anson is  also  worried

about  the  designing  of the  proposed  Singapore

General  Hospital. I can assure him that this  new

General  Hospital  is very carefully  planned  for

maximum  efficiency as well as for the convenience

of  patients and those who work in it. We have had

the  benefit  of  the expertise  of  international

consultants   as   well  as  experienced   medical

administrators and Heads of Unit in  the  planning

and designing of this Hospital. We have a Hospital

Planning Committee working on it, and I personally

chair  a  steering  committee which  oversees  the

development of this new Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised a complaint about

someone who had a dislocation and in attending the

Emergency Unit of the General Hospital he  had  to

walk all the way to the Orthopaedic Unit for an X-ray. I do not think this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



is true because the Emergency Unit itself has an X-ray  machine, and therefore there is no  necessity

for  an X-ray to be taken in the Orthopaedic Unit.

An  X-ray can be taken and is being taken  hi  the

Emergency Unit itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to charges for school children who

attend outpatient dispensaries, the answer is that

school children who attend outpatient clinics  are

required  to pay a nominal charge of 50 cents  per

attendance.  However,  school  children  who   are

referred to the Institute of Health for subsequent

follow-up examination arising out of screening  in

schools do not have to pay any charges. That is  a

different matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the allegation of staff found asleep

on   duty  at  the  Emergency  Unit  of  Alexandra

Hospital  and  had  to be awakened  to  attend  to

cases,  I say that this is a very serious  matter.

Any  staff  in the Emergency Unit found asleep  on

duty  will have to face disciplinary action. I  am

also surprised that the Member has not thought  it

fit  to write a complaint to me so that the matter

can  be investigated and action taken if there  is

negligence of duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other complaint is about patients who after

treatment in the Emergency Unit had to go back the

next  day  to  get the medicine. Let me  tell  the

Member for Anson that after any treatment given at

the  Emergency  Unit,  the patient  will  get  the

medicine straightaway because medicine is  stocked

in the Emergency Unit itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the allegation of wrong medicine

being  given to the patient, and allergy developed

as  a  result,  I say again that this  is  a  very

serious  allegation. May I invite  the  Member  to

give  me  the particulars of the case so  that  an

investigation can be carried out and action  taken

against the particular staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the complaint about a husband having

been  warded in one hospital and later transferred

to another hospital and the wife on a visit to the

husband  was told that he had been discharged  and

had gone home. On the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



way  back  she met her mother-in-law who  was  not

aware  of the patient's discharge and transfer  to

another hospital. First of all I do not know about

the case. If details were given to me I would have

investigated  the case: to find  out  who  was  at

fault. There may be many explanations as to how it

all  happened. Usually before a transfer is  made,

the   next-of-kin  will  be  informed.   In   this

particular case I do not know whose name was given

when the patient was admitted, the mother-in-law's

name  or the wife's name. So if it was the mother-in-law's  name, then the mother-in-law would  have

been informed and she would have known about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I mentioned that the husband was transferred to

another  ward. When the wife could  not  find  her

husband,  she asked the staff. The hospital  staff

told  her that he was already discharged.  On  the

way  back home she met her mother-in-law  who  was

also going to see her son. She told her mother-in-law that he was already discharged and, therefore,

both  went home. However, when they went home they

were   surprised  that  he  was  not  there.  They

therefore  telephoned the hospital, but the  staff

told  them  that  they  had  to  go  back  to  the

hospital.  Later they found out that he  had  been

transferred to another ward. The question  is  why

cause  such inconvenience to people? The  hospital

must have a record of the transfer of patients.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, if the particulars are given to me, I shall

get  the  other version. Usually before  transfers

are  made,  the next-of-kin would be  informed.  A

transfer  of  a  patient cannot  be  made  without

informing  the next-of-kin. Of course, it  depends

on  whose name was given on admission as the next-of-kin.  Unless the next-of-kin's name  is  given,

the hospital would not be in a position to inform.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to records, there are records kept of

transfers. Anyway, I am in no position to go  into

the  details  of this case at the moment.  If  the

Member would write in, I am sure he will be  given

a  satisfactory answer. If anyone is found  guilty

of  negligence of official duty, then disciplinary

action will be taken against him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to tile matter about bad treatment

of  third  class  patients in the  Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital,  I  think  a general allegation  is  not

helpful.  If  there  are  particular  cases  where

nurses  are  rude  or patients are  neglected,  if

details  are given then they will be investigated.

In  fact,  any  complaint,  not  necessarily  from

Members  of Parliament only but also from  members

of  the  public,  is  seriously  looked  into  and

investigated.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister himself must see what happens

in  the  hospital.  To  do that,  he  must  pay  a

surprise  visit to the hospital. He must  not  let

the  staff know in advance of his visit, otherwise

everything will appear efficient and properly run.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> For the information of the Member, I do make

visits without announcing in advance.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, 1 beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CBA 1107.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Outpatient Clinic at the General

Hospital  can  something be done  to  ensure  that

appointments  with patients if made  are  promptly

kept?  Quite often, patients for whom appointments

are  made to see the specialist are kept for hours

at a time through no fault of the specialist. This

is  the result of poor coordination between  those

who  do  tile  paper work and  those  who  do  the

practical work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there was a case where a patient whose

appointment  was at 9.45 am, was kept waiting  for

more than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



two  hours  before he could see the specialist  in

the Orthopaedic Unit. This

is  simply because tile specialist had either gone

out  to  conduct certain lectures or had to attend

to some other business. The patient, together with

many others, had to wait for two whole hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only those who made the appointment could

foresee   the   doctor's  timetable,   then   this

unnecessary waiting could have been avoided. Those

patients could have spent the two hours usefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors at the OPD are overworked. They

sometimes  have  to  attend  to  as  many  as  100

patients  per  day so much so that they  sometimes

prescribe the wrong medicine. The doctors are  not

to  be  blamed. They can only work  to  a  certain

level  with  efficiency. Beyond  that,  efficiency

drops. One cannot he at his peak of efficiency  at

all  times, especially when a doctor has to  treat

more than 100 patients per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly something could be done to alleviate

the  work  of the doctors at tile OPDs, they  are

human  too. They too require a certain  amount  of

rest. They can work with optimum efficiency for  a

certain period. Furthermore, if these doctors  are

overworked,   we   are   just   encouraging   more

resignations.  In certain outpatient  clinics  the

staff is so inadequate that the amahs are asked to

carry  out some of the minor duties of the nurses,

like  taking  temperature. Surely an amah  is  not

qualified in any way to attend to a patient.  Such

things  would  not  occur if there  is  sufficient

staff in the outpatient clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these clinics the doctors may he

overworked  to  such an extent  that  they  become

careless. There was the case of a girl who went to

the  OPD for treatment. Although she was suffering

from  severe  pain  she was told  that  there  was

nothing wrong with her and was told to go back  to

work.  At  the  office  tile  head  of  department

noticed  her condition and wrote a note and  asked

her to go to the OPD once again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



At  the  OPD  the  doctor just gave  her  a  day's

medical  leave. It was 3.00 p.m, then but she  was

told to go off. The girl had no choice but to  see

a  private doctor who examined her thoroughly  and

he  finally managed to cure her. This carelessness

would not have occurred if doctors at the OPD  are

not overworked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some doctors at the OPD just give a quick

examination  of the patients and ask them  to  buy

Panadol.  If  a patient is charged a fee  for  the

treatment, proper medicine must be given to  them.

If the treatment is not effective, they have to go

to  a  private doctor. In this way, they will have

to  spend  more money. Can the Minister look  into

the matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I take the first

point about the appointment system. With regard to

appointments,  both the doctor and patient  should

keep  to their time of appointment. Unfortunately,

in practice, there have been a number of instances

where  the  times allotted could not  be  strictly

adhered  to.  This  is because consultations  with

some  patients may take a longer time than  usual.

There  are  also  instances where because  of  the

number  of emergency cases which the doctors  have

to  attend to, it is not possible for them to keep

their   appointments  at  the   scheduled   times.

Nevertheless,  studies  are  now  being  made   to

computerise  and  to  assign  more  staff  to  the

various  outpatient  clinics in  order  to  reduce

inconvenience of waiting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's allegation that

doctors  at outpatient dispensaries are overtaxed,

may I say that the average number of patients seen

by  a  doctor  at  the  outpatient  dispensary  is

between  80  and 100 a day. This average  has  not

changed  over  the  years.  It  is  accepted  that

attention to individual patients could be improved

if  the  doctor had fewer patients  to  see.  Each

doctor  has his own duty and will be well occupied

in his own way, since he is a professional man who

looks after the patient in his own way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present workload of 80 to 100 patients a day

cannot be said to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



unreasonable. Of course, there are occasions when,

as  in  outbreaks  of  flu, epidemics,  etc.,  the

workload   of   the  doctors  at  the   outpatient

dispensaries can be considered to be  very  heavy,

as expected. But in normal times it cannot be said

that their workload is heavy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the allegation that amahs have been

asked  to  do simple nursing duties, this  is  not

permitted at all. This is yet another instance  in

which  the  Member  has not submitted  a  specific

complaint so that an investigation could be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that proper medicine is prescribed at

the outpatient dispensaries.

The  Member has quoted the case of a girl who  had

to  go to a private practitioner because she could

not  get a medical certificate or treatment in the

outpatient  dispensary. Again it  is  only  proper

that the details of this matter should be given to

me.  But  may  Is  say  this in  general?  Medical

certificates a the not issued on demand but on the

condition  of  the  patients.  If  there   is   no

justification in giving medical leave,  a  medical

certificate will not be issued.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister in reply

said that tile doctors are not over worked. May  I

suggest that times taken to determine how long  it

take a doctor to see a patient. From these we  can

calculate   and   tell  whether  the   doctor   is

overworked or not. A doctor usually takes only two

or three minute to examine a patient. As a result,

the patients are not properly examined.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, whether a doctor can s

80 or 100 patients a day is, in fact, professional

matter. Of course, common sense tells us that  not

every case is same. Some cases take a longer  time

while others do not. On the average a professional

doctor has been able attend 80 to 100 cases a day,

and the average has been maintained for number  of

years. If a case can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



diagnosed  within a short time, I do not  think  a

longer examination would reveal anything more than

what  was  already done in the shorter  period  of

time.  The professional doctors tell me that their

workload  is reasonable; and that is that,  unless

the  Member can give examples to show in what  way

the workload is too heavy for the doctors.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am not very satisfied with the Minister's

reply.   I  suggested  that  times  be  taken   to

determine how many patients a doctor can see in  a

day.  By  taking these times we can calculate  the

average number of patients a doctor can see  in  a

day   so   that  the  patient  can  be  thoroughly

examined.  Anyway  I do not want  to  prolong  the

debate, and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -
