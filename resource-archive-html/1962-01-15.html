<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr David Marshall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A ministerial statement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A ministerial statement comes after

Question time under the Standing Orders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 4</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PEOPLE'S ASSOCIATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Commission of Inquiry)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether   it   is  the  Government's  intention   to

recommend   the  appointment  of  a  Commission   to

investigate and report on the political  aspects  of

the  employment,  activities and  dismissal  of  the

staff  of  the People's Association, both  paid  and

voluntary,  from  its formation  up  to  date,  with

particular  reference to the stoppage  of  work  and

dismissal of employees of the Association since 20th

July, 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

four   Commissions  of  Inquiry  which   are   being

considered. The first is to inquire into the  causes

of  the  agitation over the Chinese middle  schools'

conversion from the 3:3 to the 4:2 system which  led

in  particular to the organisation of  an  attempted

boycott   of   the   first   Secondary   Certificate

Examination   in  December  last   year   and   with

particular reference to the Communist cadres  behind

the scenes who are responsible for it all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is to investigate the events which

developed into open insubordination and defiance  of

the  authority  of  the Board of Management  of  the

People's Association by some 130 workers out of  480

workers  of  the  Association and to  establish  the

connection between these persons, their leaders, and

leading  members  of the Barisan  Sosialis  who  had

recruited  these  leaders whilst they  were  on  the

Board of Management of the People's Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is the Commission asked for in the

motion  by  the Member for Anson and the Member  for

Upper  Serangoon  to  which the  Government  agrees,

provided that all statements and allegations made in

this Assembly by the two movers of the motion and by

any other person who speaks in support of the motion

be  undertaken to be given in evidence  on  oath  by

such persons before the Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth is asked for in item 13 of the Order

Paper,    to   inquire   into   the   content    and

administration  of the education policy  other  than

vocational  and technical education,  including  the

question  of  the six-day week. This  Commission  of

Inquiry will, in response to a letter dated the 19th

of  December  from  the  Member  for  Anson  to  the

Minister  for Education, also include the  terms  of

the  Member  for  Anson's letter,  an  inquiry  into

political activities and machinations in primary and

secondary  schools,  the  extent  thereof,  and  the

persons and organisations responsible therefor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will not be possible at any one time to

have  more  than one Judge available  to  conduct  a

Commission   of  Inquiry.  It  is  the  Government's

intention  to  proceed with the first Commission  of

Inquiry as soon as a Judge is available, and then in

turn with the other three.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Prime Minister recognise

that  there is a distinction between what is  sought

in respect of the People's Association, particularly

where  it  is requested that the Commission  inquire

into the political aspects of the employment,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



activities  and  dismissals,  and  could  the  Prime

Minister  give  us an indication as  to  when  these

Commissions of Inquiry would be appointed? Would  he

consider  some person other than a Judge in  respect

of some of them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the subjects of the four

inquiries  are matters where it is more than  likely

that  serious  charges of persons and  organisations

being politically partisan will be made. I think, if

the  Commission of Inquiry is to have any  value  at

all  in commanding respect for its deliberations and

for  its  recommendations, it will be  difficult  to

find   persons  suitably  qualified  who   are   not

politically  coloured in one way  or  another  other

than members of the Bench.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, in

the  matter of education policy, surely  it  is  not

really   appropriate  or  necessary  to   seek   the

chairmanship  of a High Court Judge. We  are  rather

anxious   to  ascertain  when  the  Prime   Minister

considers it possible for the Commissions of Inquiry

to start their investigations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would agree with the Member

for  Anson that in the terms of the motion  in  item

13,  it might be possible to have someone other than

a  member  of the judiciary to conduct the  inquiry.

But  since that motion was first introduced, he  has

written a letter dated the 19th of December  to  the

Minister  for Education. I know of the  contents  of

this letter only today after I had drafted the reply

to  the  answer  to Question No. 1. The  Member  for

Anson  has asked for the first limb in the terms  of

his motion in item 13. But the second limb-political

activities and machinations in primary and secondary

schools   - if I had used this word "machinations"  it

might be said that there again we are out to pin the

Barisan  Sosialis and their comrades down, but  this

is by a fair and impartial Member of the Opposition.

I  would  hate to have it said that the findings  of

the  Commission are valueless because the member who

presided  over  the  Commission was  not  completely

disinterested in every party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



political sense of the word. I think it will serve a

useful  purpose  to have these machinations  brought

out into the open.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Can I ask a supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker.

Would  the Prime Minister consider then leaving  the

first  part  of  that  motion  to  a  commission  of

educationists  and public persons,  and  the  second

part  of  the motion to be attached to the terms  of

reference  of the Commission which will be inquiring

into  the  question of the boycott  of  the  Chinese

school examinations? Then we would have two separate

inquiries  into really one political field  and  one

education field.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is quite a different turn

in  the presentation of the request for a Commission

of  Inquiry. If the Member for Anson will  write  in

those  terms  to  the Minister for Education,  I  am

quite  sure  we  will  be quite  happy  to  consider

breaking  up the two terms of reference, one  purely

on the content of the education and the other on the

political activities which can go in with the school

boycott.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is one question which has been

asked - the time the Commission will start.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The first Commission, namely,

the  one on the agitation of school children and the

persons responsible for it, my latest information is

that   the  case  will  be  ready  for  presentation

sometime  in  February. I hope  the  Judge  will  be

available to commence deliberations in February.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>WATER RATIONING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Suspension during public holidays)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Thio Chan Bee</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether  water  rationing  in  Singapore,   in   his

estimation,  is likely to go beyond March  7th,  and

whether he will suspend water rationing during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



the  public holidays of Thaipusam, Chinese New  Year

and Han Raya Puasa.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the opportunity that this question offers me, I will

incorporate my ministerial statement in my reply  to

the  Member  for  Tanglin. The brief  reply  to  his

question is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If it is to he a ministerial

statement,  the  Prime Minister has  to  wait  until

after Question time. Do I understand there is to  be

a ministerial statement? If there is, then the Prime

Minister  can  say that he will answer the  question

when he makes the ministerial statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you will, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I  shall  then  wait  my turn  at  the  end  of  the

questions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>NEW FREE-PISTON GENERATING MACHINERY IN ST. JAMES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>POWER STATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Thio Chan Bee</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether   he  is  aware  that  the  new  free-piston

generating  machinery installed  in  the  St.  James

Power Station is no longer functioning properly, and

what  steps will be taken to avoid any danger  of  a

sudden  shortage of electricity leading to blackouts

and rationing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it is not a question of

the  St.  James Power Station no longer  functioning

properly because the new plant has not yet been  put

into commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tender for the construction of a Free Piston Gas

Turbine  Generating  Plant at the  St.  James  Power

Station was accepted by the previous City Council in

March  1957  to replace the obsolete  and  worn  out

steam  plant  which was then no longer  serviceable.

Construction and installation was completed  towards

the  end  of  1959, but the City Council  has  not - I

repeat - has not yet taken over the plant  as  it  has

not  passed the reliability test because  of  faulty

materials and the technical modifications necessary.

Defective   parts   are  being   replaced   by   the

manufacturers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



free  of  charge.  The  plant  is  expected  to   be

available for full commission by September 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the maintenance of electricity

supplies,  the Pasir Panjang Power Station Extension

Scheme is now in progress and a seventh 25,000  K.W.

turbo generator is scheduled for completion in  June

this  year. Furthermore, a new power station to meet

the  needs  of  industrial expansion is  also  being

built  and  a  World Bank loan is being  sought  for

this.  The consultants for this project are  already

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first phase of the new station is for plant

capable of generating 60 M.W. which is scheduled for

commission in 1965. With these developments,  it  is

not  expected that there will be any sudden shortage

of  supply in the future. On the contrary, our total

generating plant, once installed, should  enable  us

to  meet  our expanding needs, including the  Jurong

Industrial Development project. However, I  may  add

that the failure of the free-piston plant has been a

great disappointment. The new plant was intended for

peak  loads  and  there  have been  anxious  moments

lately  on this account during peak periods.  It  is

possible that these may recur again between now  and

when  the extension scheme in Pasir Panjang is ready

in  June  this  year.  It is doubtful  if  the  City

Council  should have agreed to install a free-piston

plant.  They were advised in 1957 that such a  plant

had  not been proved and tested on such a scale  and

that St. James was to be the biggest of its kind  in

the world, and the present City Electricity Engineer

was opposed to this project. But, however, as I have

stated we have not as yet taken over the plant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, is the difficulty with the St.

James  Power  Station  not really  one  of  improper

supervision which has led to the present position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, from time to time, I have

been  troubled by the faults of what has been  going

on.  In fact, the City Electricity Engineer had been

sent  to  the  New Hebrides in order to restore  his

confidence in the free-piston engine - I was  told - not

because of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



improper supervision but because this was the  first

time that a free-piston engine was installed on such

a  scale  and not by the original patentees  of  the

free-piston   engine.  I  do  not   understand   the

technical intricacies of the term "free-piston", but

I  am  told that it is something quite new. It is  a

gas  turbine and it was developed by the French.  In

1957,  Mr Chan Kum Chee - I think he was the Chairman

of the Public Utilities Sub-Committee - was persuaded,

in  spite  of  The  views of  the  City  Electricity

Engineer,  to  undertake this project. Tenders  were

called  for to install a free-piston engine although

it  had  never been attempted on such a large  scale

and  the tender was given not to the original French

patentees but to an English firm which was going  to

manufacture  under  licence. It had  sent  the  best

qualified men to supervise and install this  machine

and  there  had  been an endless amount  of  trouble

since  the trial test. The City Electricity Engineer

lost  confidence in the machine. To restore it,  the

World  Bank  team, which was out here at  that  time

studying our request for a World Bank loan  for  the

industrial  project  we had in  mind,  recommended - I

think    the    gentleman's   name   was    Monsieur

Shereschewsky; the Minister for Finance is not  here

but  I think it was Monsieur Shereschewsky -  that the

City  Electricity Engineer, Mr Fuiczek, be sent  to

the  New  Hebrides where they had installed a  free-piston  engine which works. Well, he has  seen  that

one work. I am told he is quite convinced that given

time  and the necessary modifications and materials,

ours  will  work and it is hoped that  by  September

1962  it  will work. But it has nothing to  do  with

supervision.  It  was the best  that  the  firm  had

available  and  the pity was that it  was  not  good

enough  because they did not invent the  free-piston

engine.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is it not correct that the work was

undertaken sometime in 1958 for the first time  when

the  P.A.P. was in power in the City Council  under

the  guidance  of Mayor Ong Eng Guan  and  the  work

really started then? If so, could the Prime Minister

not inform this House -  from the files in his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



possession  he  will  surely  know - that   this   has

resulted from improper supervision rather than  from

an improper decision of the City Council?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg to differ, much as I

would  like to explain things away in such  an  easy

and  facile manner. I think I must be quite fair  in

saying  that I am not suggesting that Mr  Chan  Kum

Chee made an improper decision in giving the tender.

All  I  am saying is that he was advised not to  try

something new and he went on to try it. The  tenders

and  all were already completed when the P.A.P. came

into  the City Council in December 1957. The project

was one which was already on the cards as far as the

City   Council   which  the  P.A.P. inherited   was

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If the Prime Minister has looked into

the  files -   and  I expect he has looked  into  them - would he not agree with me that it was not Mr Chan

Kum  Chee who made the decision but that it was  the

City Council as a whole that made the decision?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not dispute that in the

ultimate  analysis  it was the  City  Council  as  a

whole,  but it was he, as the Chairman of the Public

Utilities  Sub-Committee, who recommended this  over

the  views of the City Electricity Engineer.  As  it

turned out, he was wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if only the Prime

Minister will look a little deeper into those  files

he  will find that it was done on the recommendation

of the then Electrical Engineer. Mr Fuiczek, who is

now  the present Electrical Engineer, was merely  an

employee of that Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I will have further research

done  on  the  files for the benefit of all  Members

concerned  in order that history can do justice  and

accurately apportion the blame which I am  sure  the

manufacturers shoulder fairly and squarely.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Prime Minister has said that, as a

to  state (a) the total number of workmen as at 30th

September,  1961; (b) the total number of unemployed

registered  by  the  Labour Department  as  at  30th

September,  1961; (c) the total number of unemployed

receiving  Public  Assistance  allowances,  and  the

total amount of such allowances paid out to them, in

1959,  1960 and 1961 respectively; and (d) the total

number    of   registered   unemployed   who    were

successfully  assisted  in  finding  jobs  in   1961

compared with 1960 and 1959.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

answer  to  (a), the returns showing the  number  of

workmen  in employment on 30th September, 1961,  are

now  being  processed  in the Mechanised  Tabulation

Section   of  the  Statistics  Department  and   the

tabulated figures are not expected until the end  of

January 1962. In view of this, it is regretted  that

the figures cannot be made available until then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards (b), the record in the Labour

Department  shows  that  on  30th  September,  1961,

53,028 were actively seeking employment. It must  be

noted  that not all of them are unemployed. Some  of

them  have  registered themselves with the  hope  of

finding better employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards (c), the total number of unemployed

persons  as  heads  of households  receiving  public

assistance allowances and the total amount paid  out

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



them in 1959, 1960 and 1961 are as follows:



<pre>

 1959 - total  number of  unemployed            7,264

        receiving public assistance



        total    amount   of   public      $3,050,880

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Can we take the next question together?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If it is convenient. Question 6 will

be taken together.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Finance whether equal pay for equal work and  parity

in terms of service will be extended to all women in

the Civil Service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> The reasons, as far as I can make

out,  are  historical. This grade of  officers  have

been  paid less than their male counterparts as  far

as  recorded history goes. This period includes,  of

course,   the  period  of  office  of  the  previous

Government  when the colleagues of the  hon.  Member

were  in  office.  Nothing was  done  then  even  to

examine  whether there was any justification  for  a

perpetuation of this differentiation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government received a memorandum last November

from  the People's Action Party Women's League.  The

memorandum  draws attention not only  to  the  women

teachers,  principals, lecturers and  Inspectors  of

Schools  but to all grades in the civil service.  It

is under close study in the Ministry of Finance. The

examination of the ramifications of this subject has

not  been completed. I therefore do not wish at this

juncture  to anticipate what the final outcome  will

be. All I can say is that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



People's Action Party has stated quite clearly  that

it supports the principle of equality for women.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> This principle will be implemented

to  the  extent that circumstances and the resources

of the State permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will realise that the implementation

of  equal pay and parity of treatment for the  whole

of   the   civil   service  amounts   to   a   major

administrative   and  political  reform   of   great

significance. The importance of the subject  demands

that  it  be treated with due care and deliberation.

It  is not merely a matter of arguing the merits  or

demerits of individual grades of officers.  We  have

to  study what the effects would be not only  within

the  civil  service  but in  other  sectors  of  the

economy.  We  have  also  to  study  precedents   in

countries  which have effected this  reform  to  see

just  how and how far similar measures can be  taken

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

whether  the Parliamentary Secretary is  aware  that

this  question  has been studied and  considered  by

"men" Governments since 1948. It has been a question

of negotiations between the Singapore Teachers Union

and  the  Government since 1948, and the  women  are

beginning to lose confidence in all the studies that

the   Government   has  been   making.   Would   the

Parliamentary Secretary he kind enough to give us an

idea of when he thinks, very roughly, the Government

will come to a decision?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I cannot answer that now, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is the Parliamentary Secretary

conscious  that  the reasons he has  given  seem  to

suggest  that it is the desire to bury  the  subject

under the soot of time? If not, would he indicate if

there is, in fact, a Committee, or an individual, or

a number of individuals, or just nobody studying the

issue, but it is being carried benevolently in mind?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> There is a Committee, Sir.

status for men and women so far as work and pay  are

concerned, and have a long time ago implemented that

principle?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question really gives some

information to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He  may

or  may  not know. Therefore, it is out of order  on

that  score.  But a supplementary question  can,  of

course, put it in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware

that  the problem is one of urgency because  of  the

fact  that the City Council employees have now  been

amalgamated into the Government service; and as  the

City Council have accepted equality in pay, does  he

say  that  it  will  take him years  to  study  this

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> The City Council is a very small

institution,  and it is difficult to implement  this

in a matter of a few months or so. It will take some

<div align="center"><b>PROPERTY TAX ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Amending legislation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  whether he will introduce a Bill  to  amend

the  Property  Tax  Ordinance  for  the  purpose  of

exempting vacant property from property tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> I have been asked to reply. During the

debate  on  the Second Reading of the  Property  Tax

Bill,  the  Minister explained the reasons  why  tax

would  be  levied on vacant property. May I  refresh

the  hon.  Member's  memory to what  he  said  then?

[Hansard, 29th December, 1960, col. 904]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Today we know that there is a shortage of

housing.  It  is very difficult to get accommodation

at reasonable rents. There is no excuse



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



whatsoever  for  any large number of  houses  to  go

vacant for any long period of time. If that happens,

it merely means that the landowners are charging too

high  a rent. This being the case, it is only  fair,

taking the long-term view of their net income,  that

they  should be taxed during the periods when  their

property is vacant.'



<br><br>The  Minister  also  said that  "where  there  is  a surplus  of  housing  and many  houses  are  vacant,

although the rents charged are reasonable ... there

would be a case for reconsidering the position." The

position  today does not differ very much  from  the

time the Property Tax Bill was introduced; just over

a year ago. There is, therefore, no reason to exempt

vacant property from property tax.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the

Parliamentary  Secretary realise that  the  property

tax  on vacant property does hinder developers  from

developing?  I have given reasons before  and  so  I

shall not waste the time of the House now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> This was dealt with during the

debate on the Budget, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all that he

said  was that he would like to see me in the C.P.A.

Room and have a chat over it. Would you take that as

an answer to the question, Mr Speaker, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether he is aware that when the  schools

reopened on 2nd January, 1962, some classes  had  no

teachers  and the children were told that a  teacher

would be available only after two weeks, and whether

he will make a statement on the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

recruitment  of  new  teachers for  the  opening  of

schools  each  year is a massive annual  event.  The

recruitment of more than 1,300 new teachers for  the

reopening  of  the new school year on  2nd  January,

1962,   was  officially  begun  with  advertisements

published  in  the  local  newspapers  calling   for

applicants on 26th October, 1961. A record number of

11,713  application  forms were  issued,  and  6,542

completed    forms   were   returned.   Twenty-three

selection  boards were then constituted to interview

5,370 candidates. The process of calling up hundreds

of  those  considered suitable, replacing those  who

have   since  decided  not  to  accept  appointment,

getting  them to sign the various requisite  papers,

having  them medically examined, and issuing letters

of   appointment  and  posting  orders,  are   time-consuming factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Mountbatten is fully aware, all

this volume of work was done within two months.  But

for  the  devotion and loyalty of the staff  of  the

Ministry   and  the  long  hours  put  in   by   the

Establishment arid Inspectorate staff, principals of

schools and lecturers of the Teachers' Training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



College,   I  think  we  should  consider  ourselves

fortunate that only 85 vacancies were left  unfilled

when  the schools reopened on the 2nd of this month.

However,  by  the  10th, only 33 vacancies  remained

unfilled.  Of the 33 unfilled vacancies, eight  have

been   given  up  to  today  to  accept  offers   of

appointment.   Seventeen,  now  working   in   other

Ministries,  are waiting to be released  from  their

present  jobs,  and another eight to  be  found  who

would be willing to be posted to island schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that more time could be given to

processing of future applicants and to complete full

posting of new teachers to schools for the beginning

of  each school year, it is proposed to advertise in

August  this  year for 1963 recruitment of  teachers

instead  of  waiting till October, i.e. two  months

earlier than was done last year.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development whether he  will  introduce  a

Bill  for the purpose of (a) protecting and  helping

occupants  of  existing unauthorised huts,  and  (b)

controlling  the  further building  of  unauthorised

huts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I do not consider it either

feasible  or  desirable to legislate to protect  the

occupants of existing unauthorised huts, as to do so

would  be tantamount to condoning the acts  of  law-breakers  and giving official encouragement  to  the

erection of more unauthorised huts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already mentioned several times in

this   House,  to  queries  from  Members   of   the

Opposition,  that  Government  will  take  steps  to

control  or  regularise unauthorised  houses.  As  a

first  step,  I have already set up a  Committee  to

consider the disposal of mandatory orders which have

obtained  over the past years in respect of existing

unauthorised  structures.  This  Committee  is   now

examining  the circumstances of each case  and  will

recommend the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



action  to  be taken for the retention or demolition

of  each unauthorised structure. In the case  of  an

unauthorised  structure which cannot be  recommended

for  retention, the occupants will be given a  final

extension  of time to find alternative accommodation

before proceeding with demolition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question, a

Committee of officials has gone into the question of

tightening   up   and   providing   more   stringent

legislation  for centralised control of unauthorised

structures in the future. A Bill will be drafted for

this  purpose as soon as the Committee has completed

its deliberations and submitted its recommendations.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

Minister  aware  that hundreds of unauthorised  huts

were  going up in Kampong Amber at the time  of  the

P.A.P. mayorship?  Almost all  of  them,  with  the

exception  of  56,  I think, were given  numbers  as

authorised,  and  it has been said  that  they  were

authorised for political reasons. Would the Minister

consider  looking into the question? And if existing

huts,  which  are not authorised but deserve  to  be

authorised  as  they conform more to  the  law  than

those  that have been authorised, would the Minister

rectify the position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I am leaving the decision of

authorisation  or  regularisation  of   unauthorised

houses all over Singapore to this Review Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Will the Minister indicate whether

the  Review  Committee will hear the occupants  and,

furthermore,  whether he will give consideration  to

the  question  of  offering  alternative  sites   to

persons whose houses have to be demolished?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, what the Member for Anson is

asking  the  Government to do is to give alternative

sites  to those people who have erected unauthorised

structures on lands that do not belong to them. Sir,

the  Government cannot undertake to do this sort  of

thing.  As regards hearing the occupants,  when  the

Review Committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



has   advised  all  the  occupants  of  unauthorised

houses, if they have legitimate complaints to  make,

I am sure their views will be listened to.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, it is

admitted  that  those who erect unauthorised  houses

are  transgressing the law. But this is a matter  of

humanity in respect of people who have no homes. All

I  ask is: would the Government consider, if it  has

land  available, offering alternative sites to those

whose homes will be demolished?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at this

<div align="center"><b>WATER SITUATION IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to bring the House up to date regarding the position

of  water supplies. The necessity to ration water is

determined by the rainfall and the water  stocks  in

all our reservoirs. In spite of 11.23 inches of rain

in  December,  rainfall for the year 1961  has  been

below  average and our stocks, in spite  of  partial

rationing, are 40 per cent short of total capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainfall for 1961 amounted to 71.32 inches as

against  a yearly average over the last 86 years  of

95.7  inches, the shortfall being 24.48 inches.  The

shortfall  for 1960 was 34.15 inches,  and  we  are,

therefore, starting the year 1962 in only a slightly

better position than we did in 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levels and capacity of all our reservoirs are

below normal, particularly those in Johore. In order

to  improve the Johore stocks and to take  advantage

of  the  rainfall distribution, more  water  is  now

being  drawn  off  from  the  Singapore  reservoirs.

However,  present total stocks in all the reservoirs

are as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<pre>



 MacRitchie, shortage        219.6 million



 Peirce, shortage            101.3 million



 Seletar, shortage           75.2 million



 Gunong Pulai, shortage       615 million



 Pontian, shortage          1,351 million



</pre>



<br><br>The  total capacity of all these five reservoirs  is

5,856  million, and we have at the present moment  a

shortage  of  2,362  million. In  other  words,  the

present  capacity is only 60 per cent of  the  total

capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that we have started 1962 with

depleted water stocks. It remains to be seen if  the

remaining  period of the current monsoon will  bring

sufficient  rainfall to make up this deficiency.  Up

to  the present, the monsoon has not brought as much

rain as we had hoped and expected. I am advised that

it  would  be imprudent to lift rationing altogether

as  then  there  would be the danger  of  having  to

reintroduce it more severely later in the  year.  We

can better decide on when to stop the rationing when

we  know  our  exact position after  the  North-East

Monsoon is over in a few weeks' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since Friday the 5th of January, a less

stringent  water rationing programme  was  put  into

effect by which there is rationing only twice a week

in  the  mornings, instead of three times a week  in

the  mornings and afternoons. The only exception  is

in  Zone  7  because, being an industrial  area  and

including the Harbour Board, it is rationed  once  a

week on Sundays only. If the rain continues for  the

remainder  of the monsoon to fall as heavily  as  it

has  fallen  in the last few days and our capacities

are  brought  up  to normal, we can probably  resume

full supplies by the end of this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of discontinuing rationing on public

holidays,  such  as  Christmas,  will  continue  for

Thaipusam, Chinese New Year, Han Raya Puasa and  all

the  other  holidays if rationing is still necessary

by then.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not know

whether  the  Prime  Minister  is  aware  that   the

standpipes  are  made differently.  Some  standpipes

cannot be conveniently let running. They are made in

such  a way that unless you press the nob water does

not flow. That is good because it ensures no wastage

of  water.  But there are some standpipes where  you

just  turn  on the tap and water flows, and  if  the

last  man takes the water and does not turn it  off,

the  water runs until some good Samaritan  goes  and

turns  it off. This happens in quite a lot of  areas

in  Singapore. Is the Prime Minister aware that this

is  happening? Would he consider taking steps to see

that  water  is  not wasted and that  the  taps  are

installed in such a way that water is not wasted  by

the standpipes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is

a   city  full  of  capable  and  apt,  particularly

ingenious, people. I have been assured by the people

who contrive these mechanical devices that there  is

almost  no conceivable method of manipulation  which

can  be  fashioned or modelled which someone cannot,

with   equal  ingenuity,  contrive  to  keep   under

pressure and water flowing for a small charge. If we

spend  our time in creating more business for  those

who  make these counter appliances, then I am afraid

the problem would still remain unsolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Mountbatten might like to

put  this  picture in perspective.  The  consumption

from the standpipe is seven million gallons per day,

about  ten per cent of the total consumption of  the

whole  of  the island. Our water shortage last  year

was  something quite out of proportion to the saving

that  could conceivably have been brought  about  by

preventing  wastage. I am not suggesting that  there

is not one or two million gallons of waste everyday.

But  I  would be grateful if, apart from just  vague

and   broad  suggestions,  something  concrete   and

positive  could be brought to the attention  of  the

Water  Engineer.  It  has been  suggested  that  one

decisive  method  to  enforce economy  is  the  coin

system.  If  somebody has got to put a coin  into  a

meter before the water begins to run,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



then  we  can be almost certain that there  will  be

somebody  to receive every ounce of the  water  that

drips  out before the coin runs out. However,  I  am

told - my  colleagues and I - that it is an  unsocialist

practice to sell water. Therefore, the plan  is  not

being  proceeded  with, if someone can  contrive  to

give  consumers of water an incentive to be  at  the

receiving  end of the tap to ensure that nothing  is

wasted,   the  Water  Engineer  would   be   greatly

indebted,   and,  I  am  quite  sure,   a   suitable

commendation would be given and awarded.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer

to  that  is  the  usual question of education.  The

Government has tried to educate the public by having

posters all over the place to tell them not to waste

water. Would the Prime Minister consider looking  at

those  posters  and consulting the audio-visual  aid

experts? Sir, any audio-visual aid expert will  tell

him  that  the  posters are asking people  to  waste

water.  I will not go into details, but the  posters

pyschologically,  influence  the  people  to   waste

water -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Mountbatten is

very  fond  of  entering into a debate  at  Question

time.  She is not entitled to do so. If she  asks  a

simple, straightforward supplementary question, I am

sure the Prime Minister will try and answer.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> May I ask whether the Prime

Minister  has  seen the posters that  are  meant  to

educate  the public not to waste water, and  whether

he is satisfied with them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> After hearing the somewhat

gruesome explanation of the autosuggestion contained

in  those pictures, I am quite happy I did not go to

the S.P.A.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I got the impression from the

Prime Minister's statement that until our reservoirs

reach  their normal capacity, that is to  say,  they

are  increased by another 40 per cent, there  is  no

hope  of  rationing being lifted.  Would  the  Prime

Minister agree with me that, on that basis, it would

take us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



at  least another three or four years, even so  only

if there is rainfall greater in extent than there is

consumption   of  water?  If  that  is   a   correct

assumption, how then does the Prime Minister hope to

build up his 100 per cent capacity?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As I was saying, every year we

fill  up  the  stocks  over the  monsoon  period  of

November,  December, January and sometimes  part  of

February.  With the 5,800 million gallons  in  hand,

and  the annual rainfall, we are then safely through

the  whole  year without any question of  rationing,

provided  of course nothing catastrophic happens  to

the rainfall. Last year, 1961, we started off with a

shortfall of 34 inches of rain. May I just refer  to

the  exact  figure? The shortfall in 1960 was  34.15

inches.  We started off the year with about  50  per

cent  of  our water stock. It was in the expectation

that  the rainfall for the year 1961 would be normal

that  neither  the Water Engineer nor  anybody  else

considered taking any steps at all. But by June,  it

became  obvious that the rainfall was already  short

for  the  first half and was likely to continue.  We

ran  into  a  drought. There was water rationing  by

August.  I  could lift it straightaway  without  any

serious difficulty. But we would all be running  the

risk  that if the rain does not come as normal, that

means  95.7 inches, the yearly average for 86 years,

but  is  as low as either in 1960 or 1961,  then  by

August we may be in trouble. Whereas if we hold  the

control  on probably by the end of January,  if  the

rains continue in the last few days as they have - the

rainfall being sometimes on one day three inches  in

one  continuous fall of 24 hours -  then we can safely

say  that  we  have done all that human  beings  can

possibly  do in such a situation before we open  all

the  taps. I think we shall be reproaching ourselves

if  we  lift  it  imprudently and at a  later  stage

enforce inconvenience on everybody, and everybody is

buying containers, pots, kettles and pails all  over

again.  People  have got used to  the  time  of  the

rationing - the cycle is twice a week now for mornings

only   - and it is more than likely that if the  rains

continue as they have, we shall safely do away



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



with  rationing for the whole year by the  beginning

of February. I am not saying that I expect the water

stocks to be completely 100 per cent before we  lift

rationing.  But  the moment there is  an  indication

that  we  are not going to run into another  drought

without reserve, we shall lift it.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Prime.  Minister took the question  of  the  posters

quite  lightheartedly, may I  remind  him  that  the

Ministry of Culture spends a great deal of money  on

posters  to educate the public? Since his  attention

has  been  drawn  to the fact that  the  posters  do

produce the opposite effect, could I ask him to have

a look into the matter so that public funds will not

be  wasted on posters that have the opposite  effect

to what the Government wishes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am troubled to think that I

am leaving the hon. Lady under the impression that I

have  in  any way agreed to her suggestion.  I  have

done  nothing  of the sort. I invite  her  to  bring

forward  any evidence to prove that the sight  of  a

tap  dripping autosuggests to the mind of the looker

that  he should leave his tap dripping. I think that

is  a  proposition which first needs  substantiation

before  all the logical consequences flow  from  her

argument.

Speaker, Sir, in the absence overseas of the  Member

for  Joo Chiat, I rise to move the motion*

standing in our joint names.



<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The motion reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee)

is  guilty of abuse and breach of privilege in that

he  did on 18th day of December, 1961 in this House

wilfully  and dishonestly make false and  malicious

statements of and concerning the Member  for  Anson

(David Marshall), to wit:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) "Sir, we saw during those days how the

Member   for  Anson,  when  he   was   Chief

Minister,  was chased from pillar  to  post,

allowed   the  administration  to  collapse,

allowed the whole apparatus of State  to  be

regarded with contempt by people who  should

have been taught a lesson. The result of his

feeble, weak, vacillating policies was  that

ultimately  when the Communists mounted  the

effort  against  him, he was  reduced  to  a

quivering, whimpering, half-demented ---"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) "It is quite unnecessary for me to conjure

up imaginative events when they are recorded

in  newspaper  accounts, when everyone  knew

that  when  the  major  effort  was  mounted

against him, he fell sick."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) "And in Singapore, one degree north of

Equator,  where  the temperature  is  always

above  80 degrees, the Member for Anson  had

to   go   around  in  woollen   suits,   and

eventually ---"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) "Quite unlike the Member for Anson, Sir,

who tries to avoid unpleasant decisions,  we

stand up to the challenge, Mr Speaker, Sir.

We  do  not  scoot  like cowards,  like  the

Member for Anson."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegations of the motion make it sufficiently

obvious  that  the  matter  concerns  a  breach   of

privilege, or affects the privilege of the  Assembly

within  the  meaning of paragraph  (7)  of  Standing

Order No. 93.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not consider it appropriate to amplify at this juncture and would suggest that the motion be referred

to the Committee of  Privileges where it can be investigated

and reported on to  the Assembly in due course.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The relevant Standing Order is

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, a number of notices of amendments

have been received from the Member for Anson and the

my  Ministry require time to scrutinize and consider

these proposed amendments. I therefore propose under

Standing  Order  No.  23 (1)  (b)  that  the  Second

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this short Bill is to amend

the  Criminal  Procedure Code to give a commissioned

officer  of the local forces in Singapore  the  same

power   as   is  at  present  held  by   a   Queen's

commissioned  officer  in  the  armed   forces,   or

seconded  to  the  local officers in  Singapore,  to

disperse  an unlawful assembly on his own  authority

when the public security is manifestly endangered by

such assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, under the provisions of the Criminal

Procedure  Code,  whenever it is necessary  for  the

public security that an unlawful assembly should  be

dispersed  and  it  cannot be  otherwise  dispersed,

except  by the use of military forces, the  Minister

for Home Affairs or a magistrate or the Commissioner

of  Police or the Deputy Commissioner of Police  may

require:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any commissioned or non-commissioned officer

in  the  British armed forces, subject to the  prior

consent of the United Kingdom Government to the  use

of such forces having first been obtained; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any commissioned or non-commissioned officer

in  any  local  force in Singapore to disperse  such

assembly by military force and such officer can then

take action to disperse the assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when, the public safety is manifestly

endangered by any such assembly and when none of the

four authorities mentioned above can be communicated

with,  only  a  Queen's commissioned officer,  which

term   does   not  include  a  locally  commissioned

officer,  can proceed to disperse such  assembly  by

military force on his own authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will, therefore, be seen that there is an

anomaly  in the present provisions of the  Ordinance

in that in one set of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



circumstances  only  a Queen's commissioned  officer

can  disperse an unlawful assembly, but  in  another

set of circumstances, any officer can do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason for this anomaly appears to be

that  when the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 132,

was  enacted in 1955, there were no regular officers

of  the  local  forces;  nor  until  1957  were  the

volunteer  officers  liable  to  be  called  out  to

perform  internal security duties. In  view  of  the

fact  that  our  local forces are now  very  largely

officered  by  local personnel, it is  necessary  to

remove this anomaly and this is what this Bill seeks

to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  amendment sought is a legitimate and proper one

in  the  circumstance of our having our own military

forces,  and  so  far  as  I  am  concerned  in  the

Opposition,  I  support it without question.  But  I

rise  to  inquire  whether there is,  in  fact,  any

definition  of  "local forces"  in  order  to  avoid

misunderstanding  on the subject when  we  speak  of

officers of a local force?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the term

"local  officer"  refers  to  any  officer  in   the

Singapore Military Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Ong Pang Boon].

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have here the

Singapore Military Forces Ordinance and I  can  find

no  definition of the term "Local Force". I am quite

sure  there is no intention to mislead, but I  would

draw  the attention of the Minister to the fact that

the  term  "Local  Force" could  be  interpreted  as

including, say, the Police Force, which he certainly

does  not  seek.  I would inquire  whether,  in  the

circumstances, he would agree to amending it to  "an

officer of the Singapore Military Forces".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The proper way to do it is for the

hon.  Member to move the amendment and the  question

can be posed, and if the Member is satisfied, he can

withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Of course, the hon. Member will have

to have the assent of Members present because he has

not given any notice of the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

then I formally seek leave of this House to move  an

amendment  to  read  "or of the  Singapore  Military

Force".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon. Members

that  the amendment be moved? No dissentient  voice?

The amendment may be moved. Yes, Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I move, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 9, to leave out "Local", and

insert "Singapore Military".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it must be obvious now that what

I  seek is merely to limit it to what I am sure  the

Minister intends, because from his opening speech on

the  Second Reading, it was obvious that he did  not

intend  to seek authority for each and every  member

of  the  Police Force or any other force  that  this

territory   may  have  to  have  these  considerable

powers.  He  merely sought, quite  thoughtfully,  to

place  the officers of the Singapore Military Forces

on  the same basis as Her Majesty's officers, and in

that I fully support him. The amendment is merely to

clarify and to give precision to what is intended.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>CUSTOMS (DUMPING AND SUBSIDIES) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I have the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

recommendation that the Bill be proceeded  with.  My

Parliamentary   Secretary  will  move   the   Second

Reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1954, a World Bank Mission recommended

the  introduction  of  anti-dumping  legislation  to

protect   industry  in  Singapore   against   unfair

competition.  Now  the  United  Nations   Industrial

Survey  Mission  in its Report has again  made  that

recommendation. The Mission is convinced that  there

have   been  some  instances  of  exports  of  other

countries  being  dumped into  Singapore  at  prices

below cost, and that there have been other instances

in which the exports of industries in Singapore have

been discriminated against. Therefore, without anti-dumping legislation, any country can set up  a  high

tariff  wall against Singapore's products  and  dump

its exports into Singapore at unfair and destructive

prices.  This  very vulnerability is psychologically

unhealthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, anti-dumping legislation for Singapore

has  the  advantage  of  strengthening  the  State's

bargaining position against that of other  countries

in  trade  matters. It may also be  advantageous  in

negotiations  for  trade  arrangements  with   other

countries  for  mutual protection  of  each  other's

goods.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation of Malaya already has an anti-dumping Ordinance, and similar legislation for

Singapore is desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New legislation is considered necessary in this

instance, because the Control of Imports and Exports

Ordinance is not suitable for the purposes  outlined

above,  and the existing Customs Ordinance does  not

provide  for  levying of import duties on  items  on

grounds   of  dumping.  With  the  new  legislation,

adequate countervailing duties can be levied without

the  time-consuming processes provided for  in  that

Ordinance.  The purpose of this Bill  is  to  ensure

that industries in Singapore are not choked off by a

flood  of  goods dumped into the State at uneconomic

prices.   Manufacturers  had   complained   to   the

Government   that  there  were  instances   of   new

industries  that have been established in  Singapore

which  suffered  almost instant  death  because  the

prices  of  imported products were reduced  just  as

these factories commenced production. I am not in  a

position  to  say  whether these complaints  of  the

manufacturers are well founded or not. There was, at

the  time  when these alleged offences occurred,  no

proper  machinery  for  the  investigation  of  such

complaints. The Bill sets out in clause 7 two  tests

for  the imposition of countervailing duties.  These

are that the effect of dumping is such as either  to

cause  or threaten material injury to an established

industry   in   Singapore  or  to  retard   periodic

establishment of industries in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House that the powers given under

this Bill will be used with care and discrimination.

In  an  entrepot economy such as ours, import duties

should  be  introduced only when it  is  established

beyond doubt that the gain to the State in terms  of

employment,  national  income  and  economic  growth

outweighs  any possible loss to the entrepot  trade.

The  mere existence of this Bill may itself make any

action   unnecessary   for   importers,   and    the

manufacturers abroad whom they represent would  know

that  any  attempt  to destroy Singapore's  economic

growth by unfair



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



economic practice can be frustrated with ease.  This

factor  alone will serve as a constant  reminder  to

everyone - a  reminder  which I  trust  will  make  it

unnecessary to enforce the provisions of this  Bill.

In the Federation where a similar Ordinance has been

enforced for some years, there has been no instance,

to  my  knowledge, where countervailing duties  have

had  to be levied. It is my hope that our experience

in Singapore will be equally happy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs (Dumping and Subsidies) Ordinance,

1961,  does  not in any way contravene  the  General

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Under Article VI  of

the  General  Agreement on Tariffs  and  Trade,  any

contracting  country is permitted to protect  itself

against  the  flooding of its market by products  of

another  country at less than normal  value.  It  is

also permissible to impose countervailing duties  to

offset  any bounty or subsidy given to the  exported

products of another country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Singapore has a century - old tradition of being a free port. Again and again,

we  have  often  heard legitimate requests  for  the

imposition of duties to protect the establishment or

even  the  survival of existing industries,  and  we

have  repeatedly resisted these requests until  very

recently,  because we are conscious  that  once  you

introduce  the  thin  end of  the  wedge  and  start

imposing duties on imports, that tradition which  is

of  such  value  to  us  will slowly  evaporate  and

Singapore will lose much of its trade and goodwill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, Sir, every attempt to

impose   duties  on  imports  should  be   carefully

scrutinised  and  no responsible  government  should

attempt to introduce measures to that end unless the

case  for such measures is overwhelming. Is the case

for the provisions of this Bill overwhelming?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Reading of this Bill is moved by the

Parliamentary  Secretary and he  tells  us  that  he

knows of no single instance in which the Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



was utilised in the Federation. He tells us that  he

knows  of  no single instance in Singapore  where  a

complaint of dumping was justified because  they  do

not  have  the machinery to prove what a fair  price

is.  In  those circumstances, it must be obvious  to

this House that the conditions do not exist for this

Bill or for the need of this power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary goes on further to say that he hopes - no doubt he has every reason to hope - that the powers here would never be used. In those circumstances, Sir, the powers should never be sought. They are great powers which are given to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara without the

advice    of    any    Committee.   We    appreciate

constitutionally that it means the Cabinet, but  the

Cabinet can take these decisions without the  advice

of  any Committee in whom we can place reliance that

they  should  view  these matters  from  the  purely

economic aspect. We who survive by virtue of serving

our  neighbours  should never place ourselves  in  a

position  whereby our Government could in  a  moment

wangle or otherwise utilise these provisions against

a neighbouring State. In fairness to the Government,

Sir, they have put in provisions whereby orders made

under  this  Bill  when  it is  made  law  would  be

submitted  to  this House so that this  House  would

have  scrutiny  of government conduct  in  each  and

every  instance.  I must say, Sir,  that  that  very

fact,  to  my  mind, takes away the sting  from  the

provisions which lead to the exclusive discretion of

the Cabinet the decision whether to impose duties or

not on the whole range of goods which come into this

area.  But  I  do  deplore  - and I  speak  not  as  a

businessman but as a citizen who is conscious of the

life-blood  of  this  country  in  its  service   in

commerce - the action of the Government in seeking  to

introduce  a  Bill  which gives powers  of  imposing

duties  where the need for such a Bill has not  been

made  out, and it is frankly admitted that there  is

no such need.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I listened with

astonishment  to  the outburst  by  the  Member  for

Anson. He said that the Government had admitted that

the  need  for  introducing the Bill  has  not  been

established. I think it may be that he misunderstood

what   the   Parliamentary   Secretary   said.   The

Parliamentary Secretary made the point that  in  the

past  the  Government had received  complaints  from

manufacturers  that goods were being  dumped,  as  a

consequence  of  which factories had  to  be  closed

down.  All that the Parliamentary Secretary said  is

that  in  the  absence  of  suitable  machinery  for

investigation,   it  was  not   possible   for   the

Government - and he was not referring to  the  present

Government but to previous Governments - to  establish

whether  or not these complaints are true. They  may

be  true,  they may not be true. Until  a  full  and

thorough  investigation  has  been  made  with   the

backing  of  the  law, it is not  possible  to  draw

definite conclusions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Anson's contention that no

case  has  been made out for the necessity  of  this

Bill,  surely,  Sir, the opinion of experts  of  the

World Bank is not to be set aside very lightly,  and

they  made this recommendation as early as 1954.  No

doubt  when the Member for Anson was Chief  Minister

of  the  State  of  Singapore  - before  that  he  was

Minister for Commerce  - he must have seen and studied

the recommendations of the mission despatched by the

World  Bank.  Weighty reasons were adduced  in, the

Report. I do not think such opinion could be lightly

dismissed  as  unworthy  of  consideration  by   any

government.  But  more  recently  we  have  had  the

opinion  of  another mission of industrial  experts,

despatched by the United Nations this time, and they

urged  with some emphasis that it was high time  the

Government  implemented the  recommendation  of  the

World Bank made as far back as 1954. This is one  of

the  principal reasons why the Government  today  is

seeing this Bill through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone, of course, is aware of the importance of

the  free port status of Singapore and no one in his

senses would want that free port status



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



destroyed. The Member for Anson did suggest  in  his

remarks  that  in a moment of anger  the  Government

might   impose   retaliatory  measures   against   a

neighbouring State wherby in that way we destroy the

free port status of Singapore. Sir, I can assure the

hon.  Member  that the Government  never  makes  any

important   decision,  in  fact,  never  makes   any

decision in a moment of anger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also under some misapprehension as to the

contents  of  the Bill. He seemed to  be  under  the

impression that this Bill empowers the Government to

levy import duties on - to quote his own actual words - "the  whole range of goods". This Bill does not give

the  Government  any  such powers.  The  powers  are

limited  to  the  levying  of  import  duties  on  a

restricted class of commodities. They are defined, I

think, in clause 7 of the Bill. They refer to  goods

which are manufactured in Singapore or are about  to

be  so  produced in the State. Therefore, when those

goods  are  not manufactured or where  there  is  no

immediate  prospect  of  their  manufacture  in  the

State, the powers given in this Bill do not apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, while we have been able in the past century

or  more  to grow or prosper because of the services

being performed as a free port and the emporium  for

South-East  Asia,  it  is  now  getting  obvious  to

everyone  that  this trade is an entrepot  trade  by

itself. If we are not able to expand fast enough  to

provide increasing employment and a growing national

income for our rapidly increasing population, we are

therefore compelled - and by "we" I do not mean merely

this  Government, I say the country as  a  whole  is

compelled - to ensure its future livelihood  by  other

means. One of the principal measures open to  us  is

to  rely  on ourselves and our resources to  produce

those  goods  which  we are now  importing,  and  to

produce, if possible, new goods which we can  export

to  other countries, thereby yielding income to  the

State  and  providing employment for our population.

This  is a task of considerable magnitude. The whole

of our future



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



prosperity and well-being will depend on whether the

country as a whole can achieve success in this

endeavour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House is one of those very

necessary  measures which we must take if we  decide

to accept accelerated industrialisation as a serious

objective of our endeavours. Many other things  will

have  to be done. Perhaps some of these will require

greater  efforts,  amounting to  sacrifices  on  our

part, if we are to succeed in the great effort  that

lies ahead of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all we can say at this moment is this: that the

Government must have these powers to ensure that the

new  industries which are established  in  Singapore

can  have  reasonable security against dumping  from

foreign sources. At the same time, we must take into

account the demands of the free port, and where  any

particular instance of a request for the levying  of

countervailing duties arises, the Government will be

in  a position to make the necessary calculations of

profit  and  loss to strike a proper balance  sheet,

and, after all relevant factors have been taken into

account,  to  make  the  proper  decision   in   the

interests of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<div align="center"><b>WAR RISKS (GOODS) INSURANCE (WINDING UP) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members of this House may wish  to  know  the

brief history of the principal Ordinance which  this

Bill  proposes  to  wind up. The War  Risks  (Goods)

Insurance  Ordinance was introduced in 1941  with  a

view  to insuring goods in Singapore (then a British

Colony),  against certain risks in time  of  war.  A

similar  Ordinance with the same intention was  also

introduced in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The War Risks (Goods) Insurance Ordinance required

persons  and companies holding stocks of  goods  for

sale  worth  $10,000 or more to take  up  War  Risks

(Goods)   Insurance  policies.  The  policies   were

obtainable   from  those  insurance   companies   in

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya  which  were

accredited  agents of the Board of  Management.  The

latter  body was set up under the provisions of  the

War Risks (Goods) Insurance Ordinance. It controlled

and  managed  the funds collected from  premiums  on

insurance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



policies  for  goods insurable under the  Ordinance.

The  policies covered the goods against damage, loss

and  seizure through enemy action. Goods  that  were

insurable included rubber, tin, clothing, provisions

and other merchandise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1946, the Board of Management under the

Ordinance  was reconstituted to register claims  and

to pay compensation to those cases that were proved.

Since 1947, no claims of payment under the War Risks

(Goods) Insurance Fund Ordinance have been reported,

and  it  is  apparent  that no  further  claims  are

expected.  It  is,  therefore,  necessary  that  the

principal Ordinance be wound up. However,  in  doing

so,  no  further  expenditure  of  public  money  is

expected to be incurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House is a straightforward one

and  the  provisions  in it are  mainly  procedural.

Clause  4  provides that within a further period  of

three  months from the coming into operation of  the

Ordinance,  the Board of Management can continue  to

apply  the  Fund  in  the  payments  of  outstanding

claims. Should there be a dispute in respect of  any

claims,  the amount of the claim shall be paid  into

court  or other arrangements made, as deemed fit  by

the  Board  of Management, after obtaining  approval

from  the  Minister. At the end of  the  three-month

period from the coming into operation of this  Bill,

the  unexpended balance and assets of the  Fund  (if

any) shall be deposited with the Accountant-General,

and shall be disposed of as directed by the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong  and the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,  as

provided  for  in  clause 5 of the  Bill.  Clause  6

requires   that  the  accounts  of  the   Board   of

Management be audited by the Director of  Audit  and

published  in  the  Government  Gazette.  After  the

publication  of the Board's accounts, the  Board  of

Management shall be wound up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite appreciate

the desire of the Government to wind up this fund. I

am  completely in sympathy with it. I rise merely to

seek clarification of certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



seemingly  contradictory aspects of  the  Bill.  You

will see that in clause 3, all actions are barred as

from  the  date  of  coming into operation  of  this

Ordinance,  both against the Government and  against

any member of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, however, suggests that if there is any

disagreement  in respect of claims, monies  will  be

paid  into  court, which does suggest that  one  can

then   make  a  claim  in  court  contrary  to   the

provisions of clause 3. It may well be that  I  have

misunderstood the purpose of these clauses. I  would

like a clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would furthermore inquire as to what is the

extent  of  the  fund at the present moment.  Surely

this House is entitled to basic information when  it

is  sought to wind up a fund. What is the  total  of

the  claims outstanding? Furthermore, Sir, they seek

indemnity  provisions  under  clause  10.  You  will

notice that fortunately clause 10 does not come into

operation forthwith. But by virtue of the provisions

of  clause  1,  sub-clause (2), it  will  come  into

operation  at  a later date. It is my  earnest  hope

that  the  Government will not seek its introduction

without giving an opportunity to all those who  seek

to  make  claims, to make them before that indemnity

applies. But in any event, Sir, this House again  is

entitled to know. You are seeking to give indemnity.

Are   there   any  claims  at  the  present   moment

outstanding? Are there any claims anticipated?  What

is the true position?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply, Mr Ramaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 4 is not

in  contravention of anything in clause 3. Clause  4

only  provides that within a further period of three

months  from  the  coming  into  operation  of  this

Ordinance,  the Board of Management can continue  to

apply   the  fund  in  the  payment  of  outstanding

claims - not new claims. Since 1957, there  have  been

no claims filed, and I do not know whether there are

any  outstanding  claims  still  unsettled.  If  the

Member  for Anson wants to know, I shall be prepared

to let him know the facts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do I understand that under the

circumstances, the Second Reading of this Bill will

then stand adjourned to a later date?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not what the Parliamentary

Secretary has said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Ramaswamy].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<br><br>4.23 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The figure "1961" in page 1, line 5,

will, as a matter of course, be altered to read

"1962".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 3 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary has informed this House that there  is  no

conflict between the provisions of clauses 3 and  4,

because  clause 4 deals with outstanding claims  and

clause  3  deals with fresh claims.  Sir,  will  you

please look at clause 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...no suit, action or other legal proceedings

shall lie, be instituted or maintained...'



<br><br>Maintaining   a  suit  is  with  reference   to   an

outstanding claim. Now, Sir, it deals "in respect of

any  claim or award.... debt or liability incurred".

Let   us  turn  to  clause  4.  Clause  4  does  not

necessarily  mean a claim in a court of  law.  There

may  be the payment of outstanding claims which  may

refer  to claims which have been made to the  Board.

How is the Board then going to pay money



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



into  court when, by clause 3, it is completely shut

out   from   all  jurisdiction?  I   do   urge   the

Parliamentary Secretary - and I say this in  no  nasty

spirit  of criticism -  That he should take this  Bill

back.  I  do  appreciate his position and sympathise

with  it.  Perhaps he could have the State Advocate-General reconsider the point. There seems to  be  no

urgency  about it. But I do say, Sir,  that,  as  it

stands,  it seems to shut out completely all  claims

of  any  character except such as the  Minister  may

wish  to  pay. The proviso of payment into court  is

not  applicable,  and furthermore  an  indemnity  is

sought without giving this House information  as  to

whether  there  are  any  outstanding  or  potential

claims.  The Parliamentary Secretary has  been  good

enough  to say he will give me this information.  He

misunderstands the whole procedure,  if  I  may  say

with  respect, Mr Speaker. Firstly, the information

is  necessary in order that we should decide on  the

merits  of  this Bill. Secondly, it is a matter  for

this House and not for the individual concerned that

the information should be made available.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though I may not

be  a  lawyer, I am advised that clause 4 refers  to

outstanding  claims and clause 3 just  prohibits  or

denies anyone to put in fresh claims.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it has been some time

since  I last dealt with the subject and, therefore,

I  am speaking very much from memory. But in general

the  position is that payments out of this fund have

been  going on for a very long time, since more than

14 years ago, if my memory serves me right. In fact,

nearly  all  the  claims made  under  the  principal

Ordinance have been settled. I would say, therefore,

for  a large number of years no new claims have been

made  for  payment. Nevertheless, as a precautionary

measure,  it will be necessary to set aside  certain

funds  and  assign  it to the Accountant-General  to

meet  some  odd claims that may by chance have  been

overlooked in the past and submitted in the  future.

This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



Bill  has been vetted by the State Advocate-General,

and  I assure you that it is perfectly in order  and

will  meet all contingencies that may arise  in  the

future.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may we go back? It

is very elementary. Clause 3 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... no suit, action or other legal proceedings

[notice  the words "other legal proceedings"]  shall

lie, be instituted or maintained...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintained either in respect of existing

outstanding  claims  we are  told  there  are  none.

Right, then, no suits can be brought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, however, says the Minister can pay the

money  into court. Sir, how is anybody going to  get

the  money out of court if no legal proceedings, not

merely  suit  or action, or other legal proceedings,

may be instituted or maintained? I am just trying to

draw to their own attention, Sir, the fact that  the

Ordinance  shuts out what they seek  to  do.  It  is

inconsistent and illogical and should be taken  back

and redrafted. I move the deletion of clause 3.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member can vote against the

Question "That clause 3 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 to 9 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 10 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister

inform  us  whether  there are any  actions  covered

within the ambit of clause 10 or whether any actions

are anticipated?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That clause 10

stand  part of the Bill," and, therefore, the debate

should  be on the principle of it. Perhaps the  hon.

Member  for Anson can convert that inquiry  into  an

argument on principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I appreciate your advice, Mr

Speaker.  I say that we should not pass this  clause

unless a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



need  is shown for it or unless this House  can  be

given  information  which  satisfies  it  that  the

Government  is  justified in seeking  indemnity  in

respect  of  claims by citizens  who  are  lawfully

entitled to them at this juncture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

tell  this  House  that this  Bill  does  not  only

operate  in  Singapore alone. A similar Ordinance - I

do  not  know  whether it has been  passed  in  the

Federation  or  not, but this is a Pan-Malayan  War

Risks  (Goods) Insurance. This clause 10  does  not

only  affect claims from Singapore, but it may also

affect  claims  from the Federation. Therefore,  we

cannot ignore the provisions there.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am at a loss to understand the

Parliamentary Secretary, Sir. Do I understand  that

he  now  says there is no need for this  clause  in

Singapore,  but  there is a  need  for  it  in  the

Federation, and we should, therefore, copy it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I do not say so, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12 ordered to stand part of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members can observe from the Explanatory

Statement,  this Repeal Bill seeks to wind  up  the 1946  Rehabilitation Loan Ordinance, 1947,  and  to

close  the  accounts arising from it. The principal

Ordinance   was   introduced   to   sanction    the

expenditure  of  $50 million raised during  1946-47

under the provisions of the Loan Ordinance, 1946.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $50 million was raised to meet financial

expenditure arising out of the Japanese  occupation

of  Malaya,  as well as to meet the expenditure  of

the    economic   rehabilitation   of    Singapore.

Expenditure for the said purposes has been incurred

and   there  is,  at  the  moment,  a  balance   of

$9,439,381.  Out  of  the  balance,   it   is   the

considered  estimation  of the  Accountant-General,

Singapore,  that  only about  $1  million  will  be

sufficient to meet future outstanding claims. To be

exact,  the  estimated amount is  $1,117,563.  This

estimated expenditure will meet outstanding  claims

which  include  arrears  of  pay,  gratuities   and

pensions   to   volunteers  and  their  dependants;

arrears  of  pay  to Government servants  who  were

interned;  claims for services rendered  and  goods

supplied  prior  to  occupation; pensions,  retired

allowances, gratuities, and other similar payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As only very small yearly expenditure for these

claims is envisaged in future years, little purpose

is  served in keeping alive the Rehabilitation Loan

Appropriation  Account. I therefore move  that  the 1946  Rehabilitation Loan Appropriation  Ordinance, 1947,  be  wound up by this Repeal  Bill  which  is

before  the  House.  In winding  up  the  principal

Ordinance, however, provision has been made in  the

Repeal  Ordinance  to transfer all  the  unexpended

balance of monies to the Development Fund and  also

to  meet  all  future outstanding claims  from  the

Consolidated Fund of the Annual Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will note that this Repeal

Bill  is  a relatively simple one and has  received

the recommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Again, Mr Speaker, I rise on a

matter  of  principle  and  draw  attention  to  the

provisions of clause 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`notwithstanding the provisions of .[the principal

Ordinance] ... all expenditure of moneys  ... shall

he deemed to have been lawfully incurred.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why should the Government seek to shut out

inquiries   that  may  be  necessitated  into   this

expenditure? Why the need for this particular clause

that  "all  expenditure of moneys raised  under  the

provisions of the Loan Ordinance ..... shall be deemed to

have  been  lawfully  incurred"?  I  would  like  to

inquire,  Sir,  what  is exactly  intended  by  this

provision? Whether it is feared that there would  be

an  inquiry into any misappropriation, or,  if  not,

why is it necessary?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, surely my Parliamentary

Secretary  has fully dealt with this point,  namely,

that  this  particular loan was raised in  1947  for

specific  purposes,  mainly in connection  with  the

reconstruction  that was necessary  to  rehabilitate

the   country  after  the  period  of  the  Japanese

occupation. Certain amounts of money have to be  set

aside  yearly  to  meet those items  of  expenditure

listed out by my Parliamentary Secretary. No further

expenditure is required other than that, and  it  is

quite useless to set aside permanently the sum of $9

million  when  a sum of just over a million  dollars

would be sufficient. There is no question whatsoever

that  the money has been mis-appropriated. Certainly

it  was  not  mis-appropriated during  the  term  of

office  of  the  present Government,  but  I  cannot

speak,  of course, for the terms of office of  other

governments.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ramaswamy, in reply?

Anson,  I  wish  to give information about  this  $1

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated outstanding financial expenditure

will be $1,117,563 as I stated on the Second Reading

of  the  Bill.  The arrears in respect of  pensions,

retired allowances, gratuities, etc, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



the period 1942 to 1945 is $109,981; the arrears  of

pay, gratuities and pensions to volunteers and their

dependants - $150,000;   the   arrears   of   pay   to

Government   servants  who  were   interned - $l0,000;

claims  for  services rendered  and  goods  supplied

prior to the Occupation - $500,000; back-pay to  non-interned    Government   servants - $12,582;    Malaya

Unallocated    Account    - $300,000;   expenses    in

connection  with the Malaya Overseas Agency - $20,000;

maintenance    allowances   during   the    Japanese

Occupation for dependants of Government employees ex-Malaya - $15,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the particulars of expenditure in the

outstanding claims. As the Minister has said,  there

is   no  point  in  keeping  these  accounts  alive.

Therefore, I beg to move that this Bill be approved.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary need not

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have asked a

simple question and I am quite sure the

Parliamentary Secretary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



genuinely misunderstood me, but neither he  nor  the

Minister  has  really answered it. I  will  try  and

spell it out very simply, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 says that all moneys spent shall be

deemed to have been lawfully spent. That is the gist

of  it.  I  have  no complaints to  make  about  the

transfer  to  the  Development  Fund.  It  is  quite

proper.  I  am  not making any complaint  about  the

exact proposed expenditure of public moneys of which

they sought to give details. I merely draw attention

to  this requirement of the clause, that all  moneys

which  have been spent shall be deemed to have  been

lawfully spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if they have been lawfully spent, the

Government  should not fear and should  not  require

any  such  indemnity. If there is a suggestion  that

they  have  not been lawfully spent, we  should  not

give   this   indemnity  unless  we  have   a   full

explanation and a full exoneration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister seeks to make it a political issue by saying, "I am not responsible for the misappropriation of other governments." Fair enough. But he is responsible for protecting the misappropriation of other governments. He himself is responsible. This is a P.A.P. measure which seeks to shut out all enquiries into past expenditure from this Fund. I am asking why? It is an unusual

request - why, just why?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the form of the Bill is a

standard  one. In particular, where the loan  raised

in  1947  specified  that the  moneys  raised  under

section 3 of that Ordinance should be disbursed  for

certain objectives in winding up the loan, I  regard

this as no more than the necessary step. There is no

question   at   all   that  there   has   been   any

misappropriation  of the moneys  raised  under  this

Ordinance   or   under  any  other  Ordinance.   The

Constitution  lays  down  quite  clearly  that   the

Director  of Audit has full powers of investigation.

Indeed  it  is  his constant duty to  see  that  all

expenditure  incurred by the Government is  lawfully

incurred and properly accounted for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stamp (Amendment No. 2) Bill provides that the

Commissioner  of Stamps may refund  any  stamp  duty

which  was overpaid provided that a claim is  lodged

with  the  Commissioner within six months  from  the

date  of  overpayment.  The  Commissioner  is  given

discretion to entertain a claim which is made  later

than six months after the date of overpayment if  he

is satisfied that the circumstances are exceptional.

Provision is also made to enable the Commissioner to

demand  repayment of any duty which  may  have  been

erroneously refunded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Mr Speaker, Sir, that under the

Stamp  (Amendment) Ordinance, 1961 (No. 24 of 1961),

the annual duty payable on a Certificate to Practice

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill reduces this duty from $500

to  the original $50 with effect from the same date,

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend subsection (3) of section

6  of  the  Civil  Law Ordinance  by  exempting  any

contract  or  agreement  which  purports  to  be   a

contract  or  agreement for the sale or purchase  of

rubber  from  the gaming and wagering provisions  of

the  Ordinance.  The intention of  the  Bill  is  to

remove  uncertainty prevailing in the rubber  market

as   to  the  validity  of  rubber  contracts.  This

uncertainty  arose from a decision of the  Court  of

Appeal in the case of Mizrahie versus Stanton



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



Nelson.  In  this case, one of the  two  grounds  on

which  the appellant based his appeal was  that  the

contracts  which  the plaintiffs as  rubber  brokers

entered  into on his behalf with third parties  were

in  no  sense  genuine contracts for  the  sale  and

purchase   of  rubber  but  were  merely  colourable

transactions  entered  into  for  the   purpose   of

enabling  him to gamble in differences and  as  such

unenforceable  under section  6  of  the  Civil  Law

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations were made to both the Singapore

and Federation Governments that amending legislation

was  necessary to restore confidence in  the  rubber

market and to remove any doubt as to the legality of

rubber contracts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's economy is founded largely on the

rubber  trade  and today she is the world's  largest

rubber  market.  In 1960, trade in rubber  accounted

for  about  37  per cent of her total trade.  It  is

essential,  therefore, that nothing  be  allowed  to

jeopardise the effectiveness of the Singapore rubber

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment would render forward

contracts  for the sale or purchase of unascertained

rubber    by   description   legal   and   therefore

enforceable.  Legitimate hedging operations  can  be

carried on without fear that such contracts would be

declared void. At the same time, reckless and  undue

speculation   would  be  curbed  as   the   relevant

contracts become enforceable and no defence  can  be

brought on the grounds that such contacts are gaming

contracts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar legal provision is contained in the

Federation of Malaya Rubber Exchange (Incorporation)

Act,  1961, which will soon come into force  in  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention here that the present Bill is

linked to the Rubber Dealers (Amendment) Bill  which

will be considered by the House at a later stage.  I

should  say  they are complementary to  each  other,

having the same objective of restoring confidence in

the Singapore rubber market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stanton Nelson case brought to light two

matters    which    require    clarification     and

rectification if the confidence of the rubber  trade

is to be restored. The first of these will be met by

an  amendment to the Rubber Dealers Ordinance.  That

amendment,  however, will introduce a definition  of

"purchase"  for  the purpose of the  Rubber  Dealers

Ordinance, which requires the purchaser of  specific

rubber to hold a licence, but not of purchases under

forward contracts. A doubt has been expressed  that,

in  view  of  this definition of "purchase"  in  the

Rubber Dealers Ordinance, the amendment proposed  by

sub-clause (3) of clause 6 might be construed to  be

limited  to  contracts for the purchase of  specific

rubber  only.  It  is, therefore,  proposed  to  add

"either for immediate or future delivery" at the end

of sub-clause (3) to remove this doubt in order that

all  contracts, whether for the purchase of specific

rubber  or  of  rubber for future delivery,  may  be

removed from the category of wagering contracts  and

thereby rendered enforceable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend section 2 of the Rubber

Dealers Ordinance by providing a definition  of  the

word  "purchase"  with  the  intention  of  removing

uncertainty  prevailing in the rubber market  as  to

the  validity of rubber contracts. This  uncertainty

arose  from the decision of the Court of  Appeal  in

the  case of Mizrahie versus Stanton Nelson. In this

case,  one of the two grounds on which the appellant

based  his  appeal was that as he  did  not  hold  a

licence  under  the  Rubber  Dealers  Ordinance   to

purchase rubber, the forward rubber contracts  which

the plaintiffs as rubber brokers entered into on his

behalf with third parties were illegal and void.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Court expressed no opinion as to

whether the contracts were null and void because the

appellant  did not hold a licence under  the  Rubber

Dealers  Ordinance, sufficient doubt and uncertainty

have  been  created which affect confidence  in  the

Singapore rubber market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it stands, it is not clear whether the word

"purchase"  appearing in section 2 of the  Ordinance

refers  to  all purchases or only to such  purchases

completed by delivery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed definition makes it clear that only

purchases  of specific rubber completed by  delivery

will  need  to  be  covered by a  licence  and  that

forward  contracts for the purchase of unascertained

rubber  by  description do not require a licence  on

the part of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



purchaser.   It  is  understood  that  corresponding

amending  legislation  is being  considered  in  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know how

many  Members of this House are really conscious  of

the  radical  principle involved in this  Bill.  Mr

Speaker,  there are in Singapore business firms  who

indulge  in  the  purchase  of  forward  rubber  for

legitimate means for satisfying the requirements  of

purchasers  in  the  United  Kingdom,  U.S.A.,   and

elsewhere.  It is a perfectly healthy  business  and

vital for our economy. There are others who use this

as  the grand gambling game. Mr Speaker, by putting

a  small  deposit  you can purchase  forward  rubber

three  months forward, and during those three months

hope  to  make a fortune if it rises by  one  cent - I

think you are supposed to make more than $1,000 on a

25-ton  contract,  and  so on  it  goes.  I  am  not

speaking  in  vacuo, Mr Speaker. I know  of  actual

cases  where even housewives who do not know a  bale

of  RSS.1  from  a tin of rubbish, purchase  forward

contracts  at  the  instigation  of  rubber  brokers

seeking  to get their commission, being promised  an

El Dorado of wealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Bill seeks to legalise large-scale gambling. I would like to put it a little differently, Mr Speaker. If there is a legitimate business in dealings in rubber, every firm can easily take out a licence and pay for it. There is no difficulty at all there. It is a question of a formal application for the purchase of a licence, and its annual fee is a very moderate sum. Even big

firms may wish to indulge in gambling - if they  want

to, it is their own affair. But I do urge this House

and  I do plead with this House not to open the door

to  large-scale  gambling for small people  as  this

Bill would. It has been proved in the past. Sir, the

rubber  brokers cannot really be blamed  very  much.

They  are  there to make profits, and  if  they  can

persuade you to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



buy  rubber  even  if they know  you  are  going  to

lose - they  hope  you  will  make   - they  get   their

commission.  It is a question of the effect  on  the

ordinary  citizen. There are many of  them  who  had

been involved in this grand gamble and who have  had

their  fingers burnt and who have not had the  money

to  go  to court like Mizrahie had and fought it  to

the  end. Those people were cornered and pauperised.

Let  us recognize that the rubber brokers have  very

little  mercy  when it is a question  of  owing  the

money  on  these contracts. They seek not to  extort

but  to compel payment of what is their lawful  due.

But  I  say  with  respect, Mr Speaker,  that  this

Government, which calls itself socialist,  that  all

of  us, who have any respect for the principle  that

we  should  seek to protect the common man  from  an

unhappy propensity, to gambling in so far as  it  is

legitimate,  instead of bringing up  this  Bill,  we

should   instead   make   it   definite   that   all

unascertained rubber by description is  included  in

the  word  "purchase" and is not excluded.  That  is

what we should do in order to protect the small  man

from  an  organised business which seeks to  make  a

profit  out of its commission. Also at times let  us

remember that brokers, jobbers themselves, in  their

own  names  or through the facade of their  friends,

purchase rubber in the hope of its going up or  sell

rubber in the hope of its going down; and then  when

they   are  caught  they  seek  to  unload  on   the

unsuspecting victim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know if the Government is really

conscious  of what it was doing in this  matter,  or

whether  it was merely seeking to please its friends

and  did  not  understand the extent of the  dangers

which it seeks to unleash upon the people. But I  do

plead with the Government to reconsider this Bill, a

Bill which authorises gaming on a tragic and ruinous

scale.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Anson may have a good case if only he will  put

it  in  proper perspective and refrain from  grossly

exaggerating  or  distorting the  picture.  Now,  of

course, there is gambling in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



the   rubber  market.  There  is  gambling  in   any

extensive  producing market. There may  be  isolated

cases  of  private  individuals who  gamble  in  the

rubber  market. They may gamble in the stock market.

They  may gamble in any other markets or indulge  in

various forms of gambling. Is it seriously suggested

that  just  to  protect a small  number  of  foolish

people - I do not agree with the Member for Anson that

this  is  an  extensive social  menace - in  order  to

prevent  a  few  foolish people from  getting  their

fingers burnt in transactions of which they have  no

understanding, we are to put the rubber market in  a

straitjacket?  That is what it amounts  to,  because

the  real  difficulty is how you are to  distinguish

the  small  operator  from  the  big  operator,  the

business  operator  from the non-business  operator.

One  certain criterion is set out. Once you  have  a

Government board that controls transactions, then  I

say  the  functioning of the rubber market,  if  not

reduced to a standstill, will certainly cease and be

crippled.  The  volume of operations in  the  rubber

market  is  tremendous. This is the  largest  rubber

market  in  the  world. By and  large,  transactions

conform  to certain standards of commercial  ethics,

and  the volume of downright gambling undertaken  by

ignorant people is simply marginal. But to say  that

this Bill unleashes on the people a new danger,  and

at  the  same time say that this has been  happening

all the time is surely inconsistent. If we unleash a

new  danger, it means that housewives may enter  the

rubber  market, and by introducing this Bill we  are

inviting  housewives to do so. I do not  agree  that

the  remedies proposed by the Member for Anson  meet

the  case.  The purpose is quite simple.  It  is  to

ensure that contracts in forward purchases, dealings

in  what  is  called paper rubber  can  be  enforced

legally,  and, indeed, if such were to be the  case,

then  perhaps there would be less temptation on  the

part of people not familiar with the workings of the

rubber market to try their luck there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the problem posed to the Government as a

result  of the decision of the court case,  although

simple in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



principle,  involves  quite a  number  of  intricate

issues;  and  one of the reasons why the  Government

has  taken such a long time before it presents  this

Bill  to  the  House  is that we  have  carried  out

consultations  not  only with the  rubber  trade  in

Singapore but also with our opposite numbers in  the

Government of the Federation. The solution that they

have  arrived  at after long months of  deliberation

are the two Bills which are now before the House. As

I  have  said,  their  purpose  is  to  ensure  that

transactions  in the largest rubber  market  in  the

world have a proper legal standing.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ramaswamy, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Anson  says  that common people and  housewives  all

deal  in rubber contracts. I beg to differ from  his

view. Only people who know the rubber trade deal  in

these  contracts.  Maybe there  are  a  few  foolish

people  who  venture into this kind of  business.  I

would like to tell the House that the Federation  of

Malaya  has  also  passed similar legislation  which

will come into force very soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that these two Bills - this one as

well  as the Civil Law (Amendment) Bill which I have

just moved - only enable legitimate hedging operations

to  be  carried out without fear that such contracts

would   be   declared  void.  Reckless   and   undue

speculation   would  be  curbed  as   the   relevant

contracts become enforceable and no defence  can  be

brought  on  the  grounds that  such  contracts  are

gaming   contracts.  Therefore,  the  Bill  protects

genuine   rubber   dealers  who  deal   in   forward

contracts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Ramaswamy].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In page 1, line 5, to

leave out "1961" and insert "1962". That will be

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, the Minister for

Finance has indicated that rubber purchase and  sale

in  this  territory is vital for  our  economy,  and

quite  rightly, as it is one of the largest  centres

of  the rubber trade in the world. I am glad to hear

it.  The question is, what difficulty will there  be

on  the part of a legitimate rubber dealer in taking

out  a  licence? None at all. That the Minister  has

not  answered. If you make it necessary for a person

to  take out a licence before there can be any  sale

of  rubber to him or any sale of rubber by  him,  it

would  be  deemed to be enforceable; then you  would

protect the common man from being made the victim of

the  rubber broker. I am not seeking to limit in any

way  the rubber trade. All I am seeking to do is  to

limit  the  rubber trade to legitimate traders.  Let

them gamble if they will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary completely misunderstands the Bill, if I may say so with respect. It does not protect anyone from gambling losses. It does not only protect legitimate hedging of purchase and sale, but it also protects all gambling transactions as well as legitimate transactions. And it is Unnecessary. All I ask this Government to consider is that it should leave it at

the  position where a licence is required before you

indulge  in  the  purchase and sale of  rubber.  The

Minister has said, "How can you exaggerate  so  much

as  to say that we are opening the floodgates  of  a

grave  danger when you say it has existed  already?"

Again  he  mis-understands  me,  Mr  Speaker.   The

Mizrahie decision in the court of appeal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



is  of  a  character which has considerably lessened

this  activity.  Now we are going to  wipe  out  the

Mizrahie  judgment. The floodgates  are  there.  The

poor  man, the simple man who is going to  be  told,

"You  are  earning $200 or $300 as a teacher.  Come,

give  me  your life savings of $5,000, and  in  five

days  I  will give you $50,000." Maybe you can  make

$50,000. But, on the other hand, the probability  is

that  you  will lose it. And there is no protection.

But if the same teacher were to be told, "Take out a

licence  first.  Become a rubber dealer,"  he  would

think twice. All I am asking the Government to do is

to leave the protection of the Mizrahie judgment for

the commoner, by making it necessary for dealers  in

rubber to have licences. I do urge the Government to

see the justice of that request.

<div align="center"><b>POLITICAL NEPOTISM - COMMISSION OF INQUIRY</b></div>



<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, in moving the

motion*  standing in my name, it would be appropriate

to  make  a  word  or two in explanation.  The  first

matter  is  the question of the meaning of  political

nepotism. I want no misunderstanding on this  aspect.

What  I  seek, Mr Speaker, is not a re-hash of  what

has   transpired  before.  Nepotism  is   favouritism

towards   one's  relations.  Political  nepotism   is

favouritism arising from political relations.  It  is

in  this  sense, Mr Speaker, and in this sense  only

that the words are used in this motion.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly calls upon the Government to

appoint  a  Commission of Inquiry consisting  of  at

least  one  High Court Judge and two  retired  Civil

Servants  to  investigate  political  nepotism   and

improper  political  interference  with  the   Civil

Service  and  employees of Statutory bodies  and  to

make recommendations.

<hr size="2" noshade>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter - in his speech on the Privileges Bill

the  Prime  Minister indicated that he was under  the

impression  that  I  brought up this  motion  at  the

request of the Barisan Sosialis. This is not correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have for a long time been troubled by a growing

impression,  perhaps from minor things in  themselves

inadequate,  but  cumulative,  leaving   an   unhappy

impression  that the P.A.P. Government  is  utilising

its position and its ministerial responsibilities  to

plant P.A.P. men in key positions. When the strike of

the  People's Association employees took place, which

the   Government,  like  good  capitalist  employers,

refuse to term a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



strike  because the workers have no union, it became

apparent   that  a  vast  number  of  the   People's

Association employees were P.A.P. members  and  that

they  were  indulging  in  political  activities  in

community  centres  with a view to  shepherding  our

people  and  our  youth  towards  the  P.A.P. as  a

political    Party,   interlanded   with   perfectly

legitimate activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was because of this that I tabled my motion. As

you  are aware, Mr Speaker - unfortunately I  am  the

only representative of my Party in this House -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I agree with you. And as you are

furthermore  aware, Mr Speaker, a  motion  requires

not only a proposer but a seconder before it can  be

accepted for discussion in this House. Therefore, it

has been one of my trials at various times since  my

election   to  seek  the  assistance  of  Opposition

Parties in this Assembly and the assistance  of  the

independent  Member for Joo Chiat to second  motions

of mine.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. To put the record straight, it

is  not a question of a seconder being required, but

it  is  a question of a supporter under the Standing

Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Indeed the word is "supporter". It

is   somewhat  colloquially  better  understood   as

seconder.  But  the Standing Orders require  one  or

more  supporters. In fact, Mr Speaker, in the  case

of  one  Opposition Party, it was made clear  to  me

that  they would refuse to support or second - not  a

question  of supporting in the House but  supporting

in  writing any motion which is not brought up by  a

Member of their own Party -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That seems to be quite

irrelevant to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If I might explain. Sir, my field is

limited  and that is why I obtained a seconder  from

the  Barisan  Sosialis, which fact  gave  the  Prime

Minister the impression that the motion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



is  not mine, but that of the Barisan Sosialis. What

I  am  seeking  to do is to remove the suspicion  of

any - how  shall  I  say it?  - family dispute  in  this

matter.  I would like to assure this House  and  the

Members on the Front Bench that in truth and in fact

this motion is my motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at no time prior to seeking by letter and

receiving by letter agreement to support this motion

have  I  been  in  communication  with  the  Barisan

Sosialis or received information from them  on  this

particular aspect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd October, I forwarded the motion to the

Clerk  of  the Assembly together with a question  to

the  Prime Minister on the same date. It was  tabled

for  the  16th  November, and if you  remember,  Mr

Speaker,  it was very pertinent to this  motion.  It

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To ask the Prime Minister to state the number of

persons  appointed since 1st June 1959 by  Ministers

to  public  bodies, the names of such  persons,  the

offices  to  which  they were appointed,  and  their

political affiliations, if known.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was good enough to send me a list of 527 persons appointed by the Ministers to various public bodies since 1st June, 1959. I ask

the  House to appreciate that the list which is  now

printed  and which they have is the list of  persons

appointed by Ministers in pursuance of their  powers

and does not include a list of employees employed by

various  statutory  bodies, and therefore  does  not

include the vast numbers of P.A.P. members who  were

taken   into   the   employment  of   the   People's

Association, or a list of the employees of the  Work

Brigade.



<br><br>The  Prime Minister, however - though he gave me  the  list - did  not  give  the party affiliations  of  the  persons  appointed by the Ministers. If you remember

the reply to the question - in order not to misquote  -

I quote in full:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The number of persons appointed since June, 1959,

by  Ministers to public bodies is 527.  Their  names

and  the  offices to which they were  appointed  are

given  in  the  list tabled in this Assembly.  Their

political  affiliations, if any, are of no relevance

to  the  duties they perform. Some are known  to  be

members, and some are publicly reputed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



be   members,  of  both  the  Government  party  and

Opposition political parties in this Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have sought assistance to

ascertain  who amongst these 527 shown in  the  list

were  P.A.P. members and I shall give you a detailed

analysis.  But  before I do so, I want  to  make  it

quite  clear that it is not my suggestion  that  the

Government should not appoint a member of its  Party

to  public office just because he is a member of the

Party. Quite naturally, it can and does happen  that

a  member  of the political Party in office  is,  by

virtue of his own merits, worthy of appointment to a

public  office.  I  recognise  that  those  who  are

prepared  to  go through the travail  of  dedicating

themselves to the ideals of a political Party  often

are  sincere  in their dedication to public  service

even  though  I  may not agree with their  political

views or their political conduct. But what I do say,

Mr Speaker, Sir, is that the number involved is  of

such a character that it legitimately raises a query

as  to whether, in fact, such appointments were made

not  merely on merit but took into account the  fact

that the persons in question were P.A.P. members  in

pursuance of a policy to seek control of all aspects

of public life for party ends. That is the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as to the list given by the Prime

Minister, I shall be giving the numbers of those who

were   P.A.P. members  at  the   time   of   their

appointment,  which is a material time  to  consider

what  the Government had in mind. The fact that some

of  them  have  since defected  is  not  a  relevant

consideration.  The question is,  were  they  P.A.P.

members at the time of their appointment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may take the list in the order in which it

was  sent  to  me - and I trust I  will  not  try  the

patience of the Assembly - this is somewhat important.

The  first  is the Ministry of National Development.

The  Board  of  Management  of  Nature  Reserves - one

P.A.P.  Assemblyman out of five trustees  appointed.

The   Board   of  Trustees,  Singapore   Improvement

Trust - one person appointed, not a P.A.P. member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



The  Housing and Development Board - Chairman and  one

other  member were P.A.P. members out of a total  of

five   appointed.  The  Board  of  Architects -   nine

persons appointed, no P.A.P. members. It seems  that

there are no architects amongst the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is the Ministry of Finance. The Malayan

Board of Income Tax and Income Tax Board of Review - I

can  trace  no  P.A.P. members.  The  Property  Tax

Valuation   Review  Board - I  can  trace  no   P.A.P.

members.  The  Industrial Promotions Board - only  one

member  appointed, not a P.A.P. member. The Economic

Development Board - one member is a P.A.P. Assemblyman

out  of  six appointments to the Board. The Property

Tax  Advisory  Committee - all six members,  including

the  Chairman, appointed to this Committee were  and

are P.A.P. Assemblymen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is the Ministry of Culture. The National

Theatre  Fund Committee - this Committee consisted  of

one  Chairman and nominees from various bodies.  The

Chairman  was a P.A.P. member of this Assembly.  The

Committee  was dissolved in February.  The  National

Theatre  Trust - the Chairman is a P.A.P. Assemblyman,

and  there is one other P.A.P. member out of a total

of  11 members. The National Library Board - no P.A.P.

member that I can trace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is the Prime Minister's Office. The Rent

Conciliation Board -  11 are P.A.P. members out of  30

appointments  to  the  Board.  Of  these  11  P.A.P.

members,  8 were P.A.P. Assemblymen, none  from  the

Opposition  Parties. The Urban  and  Rural  Services

Consultative Committee - everyone of the  15  members,

including  the  Chairman of this  Committee,  was  a

P.A.P. Assemblyman. Four of these appointments  were

revoked on 21st July. 1961, the day after the debate

in this Assembly, and these four are all now Barisan

Sosialis Assemblymen. The Board of Management of the

Malay  Settlements of Jalan Eunos, West Coast  Road,

Ayer  Gemuroh  and Sembawang - I can trace  no  P.A.P.

member, and it seems obvious that the Malays can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



protect  themselves  from P.A.P. infiltration.  The

Light Dues Board and the Pilot Board - I can trace  no

P.A.P. member.  The Singapore Telephone  Board - only

one  P.A.P. member  out of five  appointments.  The

Omnibus Services Licensing Authority - I can trace  no

P.A.P. member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour. The Panel of Advisers to

the   Juvenile  Magistrate's  Court   - three   P.A.P.

members  out  of 15 appointments. The Parole  Board,

Gimson   School   - one  P.A.P. member  out  of   ten

appointments. The Probation Committee -  I  can  trace

no  P.A.P. member. The Advisory  Committee  of  the

Singapore  Amateur Sports Council  - all  members  are

nominees  of sports organisations, and I could  find

no   P.A.P. member  except,  I   understand,   the

Secretary, but I wish to make it quite clear that  I

make  no  issue  of  this as he himself  was  not  a

nominee of the Government but a nominee of a  public

sports  body. The Board of Visitors, Social  Welfare

Homes and Institutions  - five P.A.P. members of  whom

three are members of the Assembly out of a total  of

35  appointments. One of these, Mr Speaker, Sir, is

an Assembly woman on the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health. The Leprosy Board - one

P.A.P. Assemblyman out of four members. The Midwives

Board   - no  P.A.P. members that I  can  trace.  The

Nursing  Board - the Chairman is a P.A.P. Assemblyman.

The  Pharmacy Board - no P.A.P. affiliation that I can

trace.  The  Trafalgar Home - I can  trace  no  P.A.P.

member. The Woodbridge Hospital Visitors - two  P.A.P.

members out of 15 appointments. The Medical Advisory

Council - one  P.A.P. member out of  13  appointments;

that one had been previously appointed, and I am not

suggesting  that  his political  affiliation  was  a

factor  in  his  appointment. The  Poisons  Advisory

Committee  - only one out of five appointments. Again,

he  is a person who seems eminently fitted to be  on

the  Committee, and I am not suggesting that in this

particular  case his political affiliation  affected

his appointment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Law. The Muslim and Hindu

Endowments Board - two P.A.P. members out of eight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education. The Education Finance

Board  -  no  P.A.P. member  that  I  can  trace.   The

Education Advisory Committee - 3 out of 16 are  P.A.P.

members,  one  of them an Assemblyman.  The  Lembaga

Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa - the Chairman and five other

members are P.A.P. members including one Assemblyman

(six out of a total of 14 appointments).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs. The Board of

Visiting Justices - I can trace no P.A.P. members. The

Hotels Licensing Board - the Chairman and three others

out  of  a  total of nine appointments  were  P.A.P.

members. The Chairman resigned; the present Chairman

is  not,  in so far as I can trace, associated  with

any   political  Party.  The  Pawnbrokers  Licensing

Board - two  P.A.P. members out of six  appointments.

The  Singapore Citizenship Committee of  Inquiry - one

P.A.P. member   out  of  four  appointments.   The

Reformative Training, Singapore Advisory Committee - I

can trace no P.A.P. member. The Cinematograph Appeal

Committee - out  of  19  appointments.  14  were  from

amongst  P.A.P. members, including the Chairman  and

the  Vice-Chairman of the Board. The Hindu  Advisory

Board - the  Chairman is a member  of  the  Opposition

(that  is  the  second), but I can trace  no  P.A.P.

members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An omission from the list, as I have indicated,

given to us by the Prime Minister is the omission of

any   reference  to  the  Board  of   the   People's

Association  which,  by  law,  includes  the   Prime

Minister  as  Chairman and one of his  Ministers  as

Deputy Chairman, and another Minister as well as the

Director  of Social Welfare as members, but requires

the  Chairman to appoint other members. How many  of

the members of the Board are P.A.P. members?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My information is that this Board was constituted

in  1960 and the People's Association took over  the

management and the running of all existing community

centres and is now in charge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



of  about  60  community centres, and of  these  the

overwhelming  membership of  the  Board  are  P.A.P.

members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know from information from the Prime

Minister  that  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the

employees are P.A.P. members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the Work Brigade, I am informed

that  the  Camp Supervisors who supervise  all  nine

camps are, all three of them, active P.A.P. members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject of the employees, I regret

to inform the House that I am reliably informed that

it  has  been the practice of the P.A.P. to  levy  a

monthly payment from employees in Government service

and  in the service of statutory bodies who obtained

their  employment  as a result  of  intervention  by

Ministers,  P.A.P. Assemblymen or  P.A.P.  Branches.

This  so-called  voluntary contribution,  which  was

collected by P.A.P. officials, was allocated to  the

P.A.P. welfare fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of employees so affected, in so far as

I   can   ascertain - and  they   include   car   park

attendants - as in June 1961 are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a allegation to make

against the Party which is governing, and this alone

should  merit  a Commission of Inquiry to  ascertain

the  truth  or otherwise. If the procedure  has  not

been  stopped, it must forthwith stop and the public

are  entitled  to the full truth. It is  a  terrible

thing  that the Party in power should take advantage

of its powers of patronage to inflict a private levy

on  public employees for Party finances, or  by  its

conduct to suggest that it would only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



take  into its employment those who are prepared  to

contribute to the Party's finances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter, Mr Speaker. I am reliably

informed  that the funds of the People's Association

have  been utilised by the P.A.P. political  machine

for purposes of hiring buses in order to send P.A.P.

members  and supporters to political rallies  during

both the Hong Lim and the Anson by-elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would not wish this House to consider that the fact that some of them were sent to Anson is in any way a factor in my bringing up

this  motion. At the time I brought it up,  although

we  knew  that  the  P.A.P. sent its  supporters  by

buses, we did not know that the P.A.P. was utilising

public  funds  for the purpose. But  whether  it  is

Anson  or  Hong  Lim or any other  election,  it  is

grossly  improper for a political Party  to  utilise

public  funds entrusted to the Government or to  its

members in this fashion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the subject of the motion by the Member for

Anson  and the Member for Upper Serangoon is for  an

inquiry consisting of at least one High Court  Judge

and   two  retired  civil  servants  to  investigate

political    nepotism    and   improper    political

interference with the civil service and employees of

statutory bodies. Sir, there has been no mention  of

the  civil  service whatsoever. May I  ask  in  what

respect  the  subject which has  been  touched  upon

comes  within  the ambit of this motion?  I  am  not

trying  in  any way to conscribe the scope  of  this

debate.  In fact, on reading serious the  motion,  I

was under the impression that there were going to be

serious   allegations  made  as  to   misdemeanours,

corruption,  and  so on. Therefore,  beforehand,  we

moved  an amendment taking into account the  serious

nature  of  these allegations, that we would  accept

this  motion provided evidence would be let. I would

very  much  like a ruling on this. If  there  is  no

evidence  whatsoever,  not  even  an  allegation  of

political    nepotism   and'   improper    political

interference with the civil service and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



employees  of statutory bodies, then the wording  of

this motion must be definitely enlarged to cover the

subject of the Member for Anson's present speech.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order, I take it, is

whether  or  not this allegation - that  public  funds

were  used for paying for buses to bring members  of

the  People's Association to rallies - is  covered  by

this motion. Is that it, Mr Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have been here only for a

few  minutes,  Mr  Speaker.  As  I  understand  the

allegation, the impropriety, which is the subject of

censure  in  this motion calling for an inquiry,  is

political  nepotism, improper political interference

with,   first,  the  civil  service,   and   second,

employees  of statutory bodies. There  has  been  no

statement  of fact coming within the ambit  of  that

subject.  If  it  is  alleged that  there  has  been

misappropriation or misuse of funds, then I say, let

it be stated there.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Anson has

touched on what he calls political nepotism. He  has

given  a  definition which might not be accepted  by

the  Assembly.  I  take it he will  be  touching  on

improper  political  interference  with  the   civil

service  and  employees of statutory bodies.  But  I

must  say that his allegation now - that public  funds

were  used  for improper purposes by  the  Party  in

power - does  not  seem to be covered  by  the  motion

itself.  Therefore, that allegation must be  out  of

order if we are to debate the motion of which notice

was  given, unless the Member can assure me that the

allegation comes within the ambit of the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged, Mr Speaker, I did not

think  it  was necessary to spell it out. But  if  I

might,  Mr  Speaker, the Chairman of  the  People's

Association   is   the  Prime   Minister.   I   have

alleged - and  it  will remain to be  proved - that,  in

fact,  the  majority of the Board  are  P.A.P. men.

Therefore, they utilised the People's Association



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



funds,  which are for public purposes, for political

nepotism in order to support their own candidate  by

sending  their men at public expense to  his  rally.

Sir,  it  is  political interference in the  use  of

public  funds for party political purposes, and  the

nepotism is favouritism towards their own members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Has the Member finished?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> My explanation, Sir, but I have not

finished my speech.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would like to hear the Prime

Minister again on his point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  a  result  of this motion being tabled  in  this

Assembly  before  the  first sitting  of  the  Third

Session,  we  had  a discussion, albeit  informally,

consequent  upon which we moved the Privileges  Bill

under  a Certificate of Urgency. We expected serious

allegations  to be made and wished to do  the  right

thing  in the circumstances. Sir, although the  Bill

is  in Select Committee, you will recall that it has

been agreed -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister is leading

into  a  debate. I would like to ask him whether  or

not  he  considers that the allegation of misuse  of

public funds by the People's Association Board comes

within  the  ambit of item 11. That is the  point  I

wish to decide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I need

hardly  explain to you, with all your experience  in

the  interpretation of words, that the  first  thing

one  looks  at is to give every word its normal  and

ordinary meaning. We have come here ready to  listen

to  charges  of political nepotism; in other  words,

patronage   for   an   improper  purpose,   improper

political  interference, seriously alleged,  in  the

civil service and employees of statutory bodies;  in

other  words,  we are tormenting or otherwise  doing

improper things to them. All I have heard so far  is

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



quite  proper,  correct  and  legal  appointment  of

members  to  statutory boards,  be  they  P.A.P. or

otherwise.    They    are    quite    correct    and

constitutionally impeccable appointments  of  myself

and  my  colleagues,  as managers  of  the  People's

Association  Board  of  Management  passed  in  this

Assembly. I now hear a charge that we have  misused

or  misappropriated public funds in our capacity  as

statutory  trustees of the People's Association.  If

that  is  seriously alleged, then I say,  "Put  that

down,"  and  the  Member for Anson  will  have  full

opportunity to justify it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Hon, the Prime Minister

will have an opportunity of going on that tack. What

I  have  to  decide is whether or not the allegation

does  come within the ambit of item 11. I will  give

the  Member for Anson one more chance to satisfy  me

that it does.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the matter was

raised on a point of order by the Prime Minister. In

so  far  as I can see, he has not stopped to justify

that  point  of  order  on that  particular  aspect,

although it has been taken up by you. I will try  to

explain  it, and if I might try to do it once  more,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politicians in the P.A.P., in Government, have

utilised  public  funds for  the  support  of  their

candidate. And I say, Sir, showing their favouritism

towards  their  Party members and  improperly  using

monies  with  which they were entrusted  for  public

purposes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid the Member for

Anson is surely stretching the meaning of the words.

To  my mind, "political nepotism" does not imply  an

improper   use   of  public  funds,  and   "improper

political interference" does not, to my mind,  imply

the  improper use of public funds. Therefore, I rule

that those allegations are out of context in so  far

as  this motion is concerned. Of course, it is  open

to  the Member for Anson on another occasion to move

another motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I suggest, Mr Speaker,

Sir, that if the Member for Anson wishes now to move

an amendment, I have not the slightest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



objection  to  his  expanding  the  scope   of   his

allegations, but it must be spelt out seriatim.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, I cannot allow that because, as I

have  always stated, an amendment must restrict  the

debate  on  any  motion. This  allegation  certainly

expands the ambit of the motion and, therefore,  any

attempt   to  amend  it  on  those  lines  will   be

completely  out  of order. The other alternative  is

for  the  Member for Anson after his speech  to  ask

leave  to  withdraw the motion, and then to  put  in

another motion which will cover all his allegation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I would ask merely

this.   Is   not  political  interference   in   the

utilisation  of monies for the purposes  of  one  of

their  candidates political nepotism? Is  that  what

you have ruled?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have made my ruling.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I shall go on

with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not think it appropriate to refer to the amendment until it is made, although it would be simpler if you would permit that I should

deal with it. Could I have your ruling on that, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the Deputy

Prime  Minister  will,  in  due  course,  move   the

amendment. If he will, then I would suggest that the

debate   should  from  now  on  cover  the  proposed

amendment  so that any Member wishing to speak  will

speak  not  only  on  the motion  but  also  on  the

amendment.  And there can be one vote taken  at  the

end of the debate - one vote on the amendment, and one

vote  on  the  motion as amended,  if  it  has  been

amended.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, your ruling will therefore

mean  that  every Member will have only a chance  to

speak only once?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is the ruling, unless any Member

wishes  to dissent. It is not a ruling which  I  can

impose   on  Members,  but  it  is  only   for   the

convenience of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No dissenting voice? Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, I

think I have made it clear that there have been what

I  consider  indications of abuse of  the  power  of

appointment. I have indicated Mr Speaker,  that  to

my mind and there certainly are  - how shall I put it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I recognize the existence not only in myself but in

the people of Singapore a belief that there has been

improper  interference with  members  of  the  civil

service. And the purpose of this motion, Sir, is  to

protect  the public service from the abuse of  power

entrusted  to  Ministers. It  is  a  very  important

principle, and that is why it is important  that  we

appoint a Commission of Inquiry to investigate  into

these  fears and suspicions, to ascertain and report

on  the  truth, and to make recommendations for  the

future protection of our civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask for two retired civil servants to be on

the  Commission because it is my view that our civil

service  has been trained along the right  lines  of

integrity    and    independence   from    political

interference. And they are the best people to advise

the   Commission  on  means  to  protect  the  civil

servants from any infringement of that tradition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the further issue of political interference,

you  will  appreciate, Mr Speaker, that it  is  not

appropriate, except before a Commission appointed to

investigate,  to make allegations with reference  to

individuals,  nor is it permissible  under  Standing

Orders   to  make  allegations  with  reference   to

Ministers' private conduct outside this Assembly. To

my  mind, the conduct of officers in Radio Singapore

gives cause for genuine concern as to the extent  of

ministerial   interference   in   the   departmental

discharge  of  responsibility. It is also  generally

believed that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. has interfered with little respect  for  the

civil   servant  in  all  fields  of  civil  service

administration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of order. We

have come here to listen with seriousness to what we

expected  to  be  grave charges  and  not  to  vague

allegations of political policy of interference,  or

giving  orders to officials of Radio Singapore.  Let

these  allegations of misdemeanour or misconduct  be

spelt out seriatim or let them be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Anson

is entitled to say what he is saying under the terms

of  the  motion. When the Prime Minister speaks,  he

can  point out what he is now endeavouring to  point

out on a point of order. It is a matter for debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. Purely as

a  matter  of privilege, these are allegations  made

against  the conduct, albeit indirectly, anonymously

and  collectively, of each and every Minister in the

Government.  Nine  of  us are  responsible  for  the

affairs  of  State,  and  exercise  the  powers   of

patronage  formerly exercised by the  Governor,  the

Mayor  and the Chief Secretary. Sir, we are prepared

to  answer  any  charge of any misdemeanour  in  any

place under anybody.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This is not a point of order. If the

Prime  Minister is rising on a matter of  privilege,

then  I say, if he wishes to pursue the matter as  a

matter  of privilege, he must move a motion in  that

respect,  because I am not here to judge whether  or

not   there  is  any  truth  or  otherwise  in   the

allegations.  We  are  now  debating  a  motion   on

political nepotism and a Commission of Inquiry.  The

Prime  Minister will be entitled to argue this point

when it comes to his turn to speak. I cannot see how

the  Member  for  Anson is out of  order  under  the

Standing  Orders by saying what he  is  saying.  Mr

Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, I seek further

elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A very simple point. An

accusation   is   being  made   which   is   to   be

investigated, as I understand it. I am asking from a

man  who is eminently knowledgeable in these matters

to  follow the simple rules of justice, namely, that

an  accusation must be made specifically; where,  in

what respect, in what department, at what time,  was

there impropriety, mis-demeanour, improper political

interference. If a man is charged -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That certainly is not a point

of order for the Chair. That is a point of argument.

The Prime Minister was possibly rising on a point of

elucidation. As the Member for Anson sat  down,  the

Prime  Minister is entitled to ask for  elucidation,

"Will the Member for Anson give specific cases?" But

it is not a point of order for the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is curious, Mr Speaker, Sir. We

are  here  on matters of principle. Mr  Speaker,  I

seek   to   speak  on  the  general   disquiet   and

dissatisfaction on the part of the public. It is not

merely  allegations that I make or allegations  that

another  person  makes  that  I  seek  to   have   a

Commission of Inquiry to investigate. I seek to give

an  opportunity to the people at large, to the civil

service, to make their complaints in proper form  to

a  tribunal  which  will hear them  impartially  and

which  will  adjudicate. That is the  simple  issue,

Sir,If  we accept the fact that there is disquiet,

it  may  be that it is without reason. I am  not  so

much  seeking to condemn the Government-if you  will

notice  the issue-as seeking to have the appointment

of  a Commission of Inquiry to investigate a general

disquiet  throughout the country with  reference  to

the  conduct  of  this Government in the  particular

field  of  interference with the civil  service  and

with   employees  of  statutory  bodies.  The  Prime

Minister   says  that  I  have  not  made   specific

allegations.  I have already made some.  It  may  be

that with reference to some other matters, I will be

able, in due



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



course,  to implement what I have said here, because

I can assure the Prime Minister and other Members of

this  House that there is nothing which I have  said

here  which I am not prepared to repeat and,  within

my  ability in so far as I can, to amplify before  a

tribunal if and when it is appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the amendment, it is a curious

amendment.  The first is a simple and  factual  one.

They delete the two civil servants. To my mind,  Mr

Speaker,   a  retired  civil  servant  is  eminently

desirable to assist, not so much in the question  of

condemnation,   but  in  the  question   of   future

protection  of  the civil service from  attempts  to

interfere  by the overbearing Ministers. I  do  urge

the  Government to recognise the value of having two

retired civil servants attached to the tribunal  for

purposes    of   assisting   in   the   making    of

recommendations.  I  am very happy  to  notice  that

though  there  is an amendment, it  does,  in  fact,

incorporate  the spirit of my motion  and  that  the

Government does accept. But, Sir, you will notice  a

limitation which may well not have been intended. It

seeks  to limit the investigation of this Commission

only  to  the  allegation made  in  this  House,  to

investigate  all  allegations  and  those  who  have

voiced  those allegations. It may well be that  that

was not the intention, and I hope that it is not the

intention  to  limit  the  Commission's  powers   to

investigation  of allegations of nepotism  that  are

made in this House and to shut out the cvil service,

the  employees  of statutory bodies and  the  public

from   making   their  appropriate  representations.

Furthermore,  Sir,  it says the Commission  will  be

held  provided all Members will undertake to  repeat

these allegations before the Commission and to  give

evidence of such allegations on oath or affirmation,

notwithstanding any provisions in any Standing Order

or written law. Sir, in so far as I am concerned,  I

am very happy to give that undertaking. But it seems

to  me a little absurd, if you will permit me to say

so,  Mr Speaker, to incorporate it in an amendment.

If   one  person  is  not  prepared  to  give   that

undertaking,  it does not mean that  the  people  of

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



should be deprived of a Commission, the principle of

which is conceded by the Government. It is perfectly

true that Members are protected from being compelled

to  repeat outside what they have said here.  But  I

think, Sir, if we at times recognise that if we give

Members   the   credit  for  having   a   sense   of

responsibility  and  accepting  the  fact   that   a

Commission of Inquiry would be called and they would

be  subpoenaed  to it, and if they  refuse  to  give

evidence,  then they will be placed  in  an  acutely

embarrassing  position vis-a-vis the  Government.  I

can  find  no  merit really, Mr  Speaker,  in  this

amendment  except that the Government, seemingly  to

save  face rather than accept my motion, has  sought

to  amend  it so that it seems that we are accepting

its  own amendment. I do urge the Assembly to accept

the motion as it stands, a simple motion which seeks

merely    to    investigate,   report    and    make

recommendations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr    Speaker,    Sir,   speaking    of    personal

relationships, the leaders of the P.A.P. have always

credited  me  highly. It is a sorry  matter  that  I

should  have  inevitably parted ways  with  them  on

political lines. I know the Prime Minister  is  very

angry  over  the  motion on political  nepotism.  He

takes  it  to  mean that we of the Barisan  Sosialis

want  to have a bout of Siamese boxing with him.  In

fact,  we  have no intention of hitting out  at  the

P.A.P. on  questions  which  do  not  concern   any

political principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain here why I signed as the seconder

of  this motion. There are two reasons which led  me

to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is because, after the 13 Assemblymen of

the Barisan Sosialis have left the P.A.P., those who

were  serving in Government departments or statutory

boards  and  who were not satisfied with the  Right-wing

inclination or political line  of  the  P.A.P.

leadership  were oppressed by the P.A.P. in  respect

of  their livelihood, and so lost their jobs.  Among

those  who were forced to leave their jobs were  the

community  centre district leaders of  the  People's

Association,  centre leaders and assistant  leaders,

members of the Work Brigade, car park attendants  in

the   Vehicles  Registration  Department,  temporary

clerks   in  the  Citizenship  Registration   Board,

photographers  and  typists  in  the   Ministry   of

Culture,   and  even  receptionists  in  the   Prime

Minister's office. They were sacked as from 21st  of

July  last  year. The Government did  not  give  any

reason  to  explain the mistakes they  had  made  in

respect of their duties. The Government also did not

point  out  where  their ability did  not  meet  the

duties  they  shouldered. They  were  sacked  merely

because  they  would not attend  the  P.A.P.  Branch

Committee  meetings to support the Central Executive

Committee  of  the P.A.P. which had already  changed

its  political  nature. They were a  group  of  very

efficient people, as, for instance, the team leaders

of  the  People's  Association and community  centre

leaders.  The  Prime Minister had praised  them.  He

said  that  if the work of rehabilitating  the  over

10,000  fire  victims  at Bukit  Ho  Swee  had  been

carried out without the help of these people, and if

it  had depended only on the help of the police  and

troops,  then  there  might  very  well  have   been

violence and disturbances. These people had  loyally

supported the P.A.P. for many years. In carrying out

their duties they did not haggle over the length  of

time. They wholeheartedly served the people. But  on

the 21st of July, they were sacked. On the contrary,

the  Government is paying about $1,000 salary  every

month   to   the  former  Labour  Front   Organising

Secretary, Mr De Cruz, George Thomson and the like.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the P.A.P. is carrying out a kind of

unprincipled political oppression and divesting  the

right   of  these  people  to  serve  in  Government

departments and statutory boards, why then should  I

cover   up   the  P.A.P.'s  practice  of   employing

personnel for Government departments?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the Barisan Sosialis has

acquired new evidence which shows that the P.A.P. is

continuing to exploit its position in power to carry

out  improper  actions  in  respect  of  the  public

services.  Mr Speaker, Sir, here is a  letter  from

the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home

Affairs.  It  was written on the 27th of  September,

1961, to Mr Chang Yuen Siang, who was a team leader

at  the  Paya  Lebar Work Brigade camp. This  letter reads:



<pre>

`Comrade Yuen Siang,



  Chai  Chee  and  Ang  Chee are Executive  Committee

members  of  the  Toa Payoh Branch. They  had  their

supper earlier in order to go to the Branch to carry

out  their  work. When they leave, please take  over

their work. It is my hope.



                                 Yours faithfully,

                                     Chee Seng.'

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to table this

letter in order to comply with the procedure. It was

on  the 4th of October, 1961, that the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs  wrote  a

similar letter to the camp leader of the Paya  Lebar

Work  Brigade  camp requesting him  to  release  two

P.A.P. members who were working in the Work Brigade

so  that  they could leave the camp and  have  their

supper earlier in order to enable them to go back to

the P.A.P. Branch to work. From what I know, in July

last  year, the Paya Lebar camp of the Work  Brigade

had  withdrawn all leave papers of its members, that

is to say, it disallowed members of the Work Brigade

to  leave the camp at night at any time they  liked.

But  these two letters explained that if the members

of  the Work Brigade were members of the P.A.P. and

they were also executives of the Branches, then they

would have a special privilege to leave the camp and

go to the Branch to work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have another piece of

evidence. Let me give a copy of this evidence to the

Clerk  of the Assembly. This evidence is in a letter

written  by  the  Chairman of the P.A.P.  Toa  Payoh

Branch  to  the camp leader of the Paya  Lebar  Work

Brigade. This letter reads as follows:



<pre>

`Comrade Yuen Siang,



 Your  members,  Choo Chua Tee and Cheng  Mao  Shih,

were absent from the camp on Monday because they had

gone to the Toa Payoh Branch of the P.A.P. that  day

to  help paint the table tennis table. So I hope you

will  excuse  them  and give them their  pay  during

their absence.

                                Kim Yuen Chee,

                         Toa Payoh Branch Chairman.'

</pre>



<br><br>There  is  also  the seal of the  Toa  Payoh  Branch

Publicity Section. It was dated the 8th of November,

1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether this can

be  considered as a sort of political  nepotism.  So

long  as a person is a member of the P.A.P., and  at

the same time he is a member of the Work Brigade, he

need  not go to the Work Brigade camp. He can absent

himself  and  still get his pay on  the  day  he  is

absent from work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, here again, I do not wish to

talk  too much. My Party has indicated to me clearly

the  importance  of  the  neutrality  of  the  civil

service.  The  Central Executive  Committee  of  the

Barisan Sosialis has, by a majority, agreed that  we

must stop and correct the practices of the P.A.P. in

engaging employees for the public service.  We  must

do this in order to maintain neutrality in the civil

service.  Otherwise, all talk of neutrality  is  but

humbug.  Because of these two reasons I have  signed

as a seconder of the motion tabled by the Member for

Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the amendment moved by the Deputy Prime

Minister, it is my opinion that I should endorse the

views  of  the  Member  for  Anson.  I  feel  it  is

absolutely unnecessary to move such an amendment. In

the  meantime, I feel that to add this amendment  to

the  original  motion is an act to  restrict  people

from  ventilating their views, doubts and suspicions

of Government policies. Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



table  copies of the two letters I have  quoted.  I

shall  produce the originals, if necessary,  to  the

relevant Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the letters handed in to the Clerk.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I expected

the  Member  for  Anson  or  the  Member  for  Upper

Serangoon  to divulge startling details of political

nepotism, but actually what we have heard is nothing

but a general ramble on certain appointments we have

made,  particularly to statutory boards and  certain

temporary posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say this quite clearly: that the

Government,  in order to carry out its policy,  must

certainly  have  the means to be  assured  that  its

policy  is  going  to be carried out.  Part  of  the

system  of  administration  and  the  execution   of

policies  of  the  Government is left  to  statutory

boards. It is natural and stands to reason that when

some appointments are made to these statutory boards

we  should  include people who we  believe  will  do

their best to see that our policies are carried out.

Certainly  the Member for Anson does not expect  the

Government  to  appoint him to any of the  statutory

boards like the Housing and Development Board or the

Income  Tax  Board.  Let me put  a  simple  instance

before him. The House is fully aware of the previous

Board  constituted  under the Singapore  Improvement

Trust.   Under  that  Board,  little  was  done   in

accelerating or building cheap houses. Since we took

over, we have placed people in the Housing Board who

we  know  are  sympathetic - although not  necessarily

members of the P.A.P. - to the policies of the  P.A.P.

and  who are sincere and honest in carrying out  our

policies. It is because we have done this that today

the  Housing and Development Board can claim to have

put  up  the biggest number of houses for  1961 - more

than  at any time in the life of the previous S.I.T.

Now assuming that we had no control over the Housing

and  Development Board, where would these houses  be

today? Assuming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



that  we  had no control over any other  Board,  the

policies  of  the Government could be sabotaged  and

jeopardised. It is not enough for us  to  put  up  a

Five-Year  Development Plan or an election programme

and  say  that  we  will do this and  that  for  the

people,  if we do not have the means to ensure  that

these   policies  are  going  to  be  carried.   The

execution  and administration of these  policies  is

left  in the hands, to some extent, of the statutory

boards  and  it is necessary - desirable,  in  fact - to

place  in  them  people upon whom we  can  rely  and

people  who we know for sure are sympathetic to  our

policies  and  our plans and who will  honestly  and

sincerely  spend a considerable part of' their  time

to see that they are carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add this. By the term "political nepotism",

I  have  the impression that favours are granted  to

people because of their political affiliations.  But

let  me  tell  the  House that the majority  of  the

Members  of the statutory boards do not receive  any

emolument whatsoever. They do not receive  a  single

cent. And let me tell the House too that many of the

members  who are on these boards and whom  we  trust

have  spent a considerable amount of their time  and

energy   to   attend  meetings  because   of   their

dedication  to public service. They have volunteered

but  they have not been compelled to become  members

of  these  boards. The House and the  public  cannot

expect  us  to appoint Members of the Opposition  to

these  boards. Instead of executing the policies  of

the Government, we will find that they will be using

these boards to sabotage our development plans. That

i3 the natural conclusion: What is the grumble? What

is the fuss that the Member for Anson has kicked up?

He  read out a list of statutory board memberships - a

list  which  had  been given to  him  by  the  Prime

Minister - and  tried to examine how many  members  of

these  boards  are P.A.P. members. From  his  speech

today,  he  has acknowledged that in many  of  these

boards there are very few P.A.P. members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the difficulties that we

face  in  this country is the paucity of people  who

are  prepared to dedicate their time in  the  public

service without receiving any reimbursement for  the

time and energy they spend in the public service. Is

it  not  natural, therefore, that we  should,  as  a

first recourse, look towards people whom we know and

who  are prepared to come forward and serve on these

public  boards; and if these persons should also  be

members of the Party, are they not more reliable? In

fact,  many of those whom we have appointed to these

statutory  boards have been appointed not solely  on

account  of  their  party affiliation  but,  as  the

Member  for  Anson  has acknowledged,  there  are  a

number  sitting on these statutory boards  who  have

been recognised for their merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has suggested that there has

been  improper political interference with the civil

service.  Does  he suggest then that  any  political

Party which comes into power should draw a clear-cut

line  between the Government and the civil  service?

Are  not  the  policies  of  the  Government  to  be

executed  through  the  civil service?  If  stopping

corruption  in the civil service means  raising  its

efficiency, if insisting upon the civil  service  to

be  more  polite  and more prompt  in  their  public

relationship   with  the  people  is   regarded   as

interference,  then I say that such interference  is

warranted.  Members of the House  will  accept  that

even civil servants are not infallible and they  are

not robots. They are not machines on which you press

a  button and orders are carried out. They are human

beings  with  human failings. With several  thousand

civil servants, is it not possible that there  is  a

minority   whose   efficiency  is   suspect,   whose

integrity  may  also  be suspect?  In  fact,  it  is

customary   for   me  to  receive  letters    - albeit

anonymous  and  which  I  therefore  do  not   treat

seriously - alleging inefficiency and  corruption.  In

fact,  Mr Speaker, Sir, you yourself could be aware

of  letters appearing in the daily Press complaining

of  inefficiency in some departments  of  the  civil

service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



They appear periodically in the Press. Therefore, it

is   up   to  the  Government  to  see  that   these

inefficiencies  are removed. How  would  you  expect

them  to be removed? Should the Minister himself  go

and  do the job of the civil servants? It is humanly

impossible.  Therefore,  we have  appointed  certain

Assemblymen  to some Ministries to ensure  that  the

civil  service is always kept on its toes, that  all

complaints  of  inefficiency and any  allegation  of

corruption can be immediately investigated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have in my amendment deleted

the  appointment of civil servants on the Commission

of Inquiry. Sir, the reason for that is very simple.

If  you  put  civil  servants  on  a  Commission  of

Inquiry - whether  they  be  retired  or   not - it   is

tantamout to asking civil servants to sit  upon  the

heads of the Government or to sit upon the heads  of

elected   leaders  of  the  country.   That   is   a

contradiction  which  must not  be  allowed  to  get

through. Another reason is this. Any recommendations

or  any  conclusions arrived at by such a Commission

which   includes  civil  servants  will  always   be

suspect,  because however the Commission  makes  its

findings, there will be people who are bound to  say

that  the  civil servants are prejudiced against  or

biased  for the Government, and it is solely in  the

interest of a fair judgment being arrived a by  such

a  Commission that we are prepared to appoint a High

Court  Judge  to  constitute  this  Commission.   As

everybody knows, the Judiciary is independent of the

Executive.  Allegations  which  are  made  must   be

specific. No Commission can spend its time listening

to  fairy  tales  or stories. The Commission,  which

will  consist of a High Court Judge, will  have  its

patience  sorely  tested if  it  has  to  listen  to

general   ramblings  all  round.  It  is   therefore

important  that  such a Commission must  investigate

specific allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Members of this House are called

honourable  Members. It stands  to  reason  that  if

honourable  Members are prepared  to  make  specific

allegations in this House, then they are also honour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



bound to put them down in writing and to produce the

evidence before such a Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Therefore, I have inserted in

my amendment a clause saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`provided that all members who have voiced these

allegations  in'  this Assembly  will  undertake  to

repeat these allegations before the Commission'.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  I  know  full  well  that  under  the Privileges  and  Immunities Bill, which  is  now  in

Select Committee, no Member of this Assembly can  be

compelled to attend a Commission of Inquiry. Now, if

we  were  to  stick  solely to laws,  to  rules  and

regulations,  any Member in this House  today  under

the  pretext of privilege could utter anything under

the sun and utter any falsehood.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Therefore, I say to hon.

Members  of this House that it is not enough  for  a

person to stand on a soap-box and say certain things

and  before  a Judge say other things, knowing  full

well that what he says on a soap-box will be treated

quite  lightly and he may get away with it.  But  if

you  say certain things on oath before a Judge, then

there is also the possibility of being charged  with

perjury. Therefore, I have included that proviso  in

this amendment. I ask hon. Members who are going  to

speak  on  this motion, if they are going to  speak,

let  them  undertake to repeat all their allegations

before the Commission on oath.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move an amendment,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from the word "Inquiry" in line 2 to the end and there to insert -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"of one High Court Judge to investigate all

specific  allegations  of  political  nepotism   and

improper  political  interference  with  the   Civil

Service  and  employees of Statutory bodies  and  to

make recommendations, provided that all members  who

have  voiced these allegations in this Assembly will

undertake  to  repeat these allegations  before  the

Commission  and to give evidence of such allegations

on  oath  or  affirmation before such  a  Commission

notwithstanding any provision in any standing  order

or written law giving protection or privilege to any

Member of this Assembly.".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly calls upon the Government to

appoint  a  Commission of Inquiry consisting  of  at

least  one  High Court Judge and two  retired  Civil

Servants  to  investigate  political  nepotism   and

improper  political  interference  with  the   Civil

Service  and  employees of Statutory bodies  and  to

make recommendations.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from the word "Inquiry" in line 2 to

the end and there to insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"of one High Court Judge to investigate all

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out." And as has been agreed,  the

debate  shall proceed to cover both the  motion  and

the  amendment, and the Question, if necessary, will

be put at the end of the debate.



<br><br>7.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me

straightaway make it quite clear that I  am  against

the   amendment  for  two  reasons.   Firstly, the

amendment  seeks  only  to  have  investigated   any

allegations  of  political  nepotism  made  in  this

Assembly;  secondly, the proviso,  to  my  mind,  is

completely  objectionable,  in  that  it  seeks   to

hamstring  Members of this House  into  agreeing  to

something which the law says nobody can  hamstring

them into.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There is no law yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think that is most improper, Mr

Speaker, Sir,I am surprised that the Leader of  the

House,  instead  of  protecting  the  privileges  of

Assemblymen, seeks, by virtue of this amendment,  to

destroy it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should have thought that the

Government having conceded that there should be such

a  Commission - and they must have thought  about  the

matters carefully -  then they would have decided that

the  wider  the scope of the Commission, the  better

for the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have very often heard from a

number  of people whose opinions should be respected

about the P.A.P. Government, about what it is doing,

about  what  it  is  not doing, and  about  all  the

difficult  and hard things the P.A.P. Government  is

doing.  We hear all these things. They have  been  a

matter of market talk and coffee-shop gossip for the

last  two years. But as responsible Assemblymen,  we

do  not  bring such talk and such gossip  into  this

Assembly  and  voice them because we are  not  quite

sure  whether they are correct or not. But from  the

point of view of the Government, the important thing

is  not, I venture to suggest, whether what  I  have

been  told is correct or not, but that it  is  being

said. If more than one person is saying it, if quite

a  lot  of persons are saying it, then it becomes  a

matter  of  importance for the Government  to  clear

itself.  I  hope  this  Commission  will  clear  the

Government, Mr Speaker, Sir. But if the  Government

puts  restrictions  on the Commission,  then  people

will  doubt whether the Government is honest in  its

statement that it wants a Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Anson has been quite fair

in  his  motion. What the Government want  is  this:

they want allegations to be made here, and only  for

those allegations to go to the Commission. They also

want the persons who make allegations to go and give

evidence. But what we want in this Assembly  is  not

for Assemblymen to go and give evidence, because  we

Assemblymen are not the ones who can give  evidence.

The  people who know and who suffer the difficulties

are  the people outside. This Commission is intended

to   protect   those  persons  who  go  before   the

Commission and give their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



evidence,  not  to  protect  Assemblymen.  A   civil

servant might have a just grouse against a Minister.

But under the rules governing the civil service,  he

is  not entitled to talk; he is not entitled to open

his  mouth. This Commission will give him scope, and

I hope that -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Am I to understand now that

the  wording of the motion is such that the idea  is

to  have a Commission in which civil servants can go

before  it  and  have  a grouse?  I  was  under  the

impression that a serious allegation has  been  made

against  the misconduct of the Government,  and  the

Commission  is  to investigate such misconduct;  not

for  the  civil  servants just  to  have  a  general

grouse - a Complaints Bureau!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the motion here,

the motion as moved by the Member for Anson:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly calls upon the Government to

appoint  a  Commission of Inquiry consisting  of  at

least  one  High Court Judge and two  retired  Civil

Servants  to  investigate  political  nepotism   and

improper  political  interference  with  the   Civil

Service  and  employees of Statutory bodies  and  to

make recommendations.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if this Commission were

appointed!, the first thing it would do, I take  it,

would be to meet and put out a statement through the

Press  and the radio, inviting anybody who can  give

any  evidence on this particular matter to  send  in

either  written statements or to appear  before  the

Commission.  Now,  I  may  be  silly  in  this,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  Who can better give  evidence  about

this   than   the  civil  servants  themselves   and

employees  of  statutory bodies? What  evidence  the

Member  for  Anson  can  give - he  is  not  a  civil'

servant - and  what  evidence the  Member  for  Farrer

Park,  can give, Mr Speaker, Sir, would' be  purely

hearsay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is not even hearsay.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Oh, yes, I have heard a lot, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I  am not going to repeat  it  here,

because I am not quite sure of the facts. I  am  not

going to make any statement in this House which,  to

my  own  knowledge,  is  not  true.  And  the  Prime

Minister  is  not going to bamboozle me into  making

statements  which  I do not want  to  make  in  this

House. The best persons to make those statements are

the  civil  servants. And if the Prime  Minister  is

really sincere in getting the name of his Government

cleared, then let it be an open Commission, not with

these  restrictive provisos attached to it - we  shall

only  investigate what has been said in  this  House

and  then  only if the Member alleging  it  will  go

forward and say it. No, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  do  not

support the amendment at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am often surprised to find

the  finer  instincts of the Member for Farrer  Park

carried away `in the wrong direction. Not only do  I

share the same democratic and liberal training  that

he   underwent,  but  we  went  through   a   harder

school - that of the smear and Siamese boxing.  And  I

say   this  to  him - this  is  my  frank  and  honest

opinion - that  if  we  work on  the  basis  that  the

Opposition   is   honourable  (we   call   ourselves

honourable in this Chamber), then we shall waste the

time  of  the Judges, their secretaries,  the  court

ushers, and other people who give valuable time  for

a  public cause. You do not appoint a Commission  of

Inquiry just because somebody bellyaches and wants a

Commission  of Inquiry. You appoint a Commission  of

Inquiry because there is a prima facie case for  it.

The   Member  for  Hong  Lim  made  some   fantastic

allegations. We forced a Commission of Inquiry  upon

him  in  order  to  clear ourselves.  I  would  have

thought,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that  particularly  our

erstwhile  colleagues in the P.A.P., the 13  Barisan

boys,  would have known better than to believe  that

the P.A.P. is not prepared for the closest scrutiny.

This  is  basic  and fundamental. If  one's  conduct

bears political scrutiny under any magnifying glass,

then  one can stand up in any form, unblemished  and

undislodged.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



For  that reason, I say to the Member for Anson when

he  mentioned  all  those  appointees.  So  what?  I

supplied him with the names of those appointees  and

their political affiliations. I am proud they are my

friends.  I  supplied him with a list in this  House

when  the Member for Hong Lim was casting all  kinds

of serious aspersions on the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we appoint a Commission of Inquiry, just a

roving Commission -  let us hear whether there is  any

rumour, let us hear whether there is any truth - I say

this. This is Commission number 4 on the list, as  I

answered  earlier in the afternoon. The  Member  for

Farrer  Park knows there are five Puisne  Judges  in

the  High Court. One Puisne Judge will have  to  sit

down  and  spend no less than about 30 sitting  days

discussing  and  listening to  evidence  and  cross-examination.

He  will probably spend  another  week

sifting  the evidence and writing a report.  We  are

not  doing  this for fun. It costs public money  and

effect.  As  the  Member for Hong Lim's  allegations

cost  effort. It costs him a lot of effort and  many

other things beside. It costs us some effort too  to

dig up a few things.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It cost you Hong Lim!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is all right. But I would

rather lose a thousand elections than go under false

pretences.  That is the quality of this  Government.

The  Member for Upper Serangoon is the man who  came

back from Israel, and I want him in the witness  box

for very important reasons. He alleges nepotism when

he  is  the  man  who practised it in  the  People's

Association. We sent him off to Israel  on  a  youth

training course in order that he could come back and

the  better  discharge his duties  in  the  People's

Association. I am prepared to give evidence on  oath

and  cross-examine him under oath. He came back  and

told  me  that  he  had been to see Histadruth,  the

Israeli  trade union organisation, and  the  Israeli

Labour  Party. He says the way to do it is  just  to

ignore all these things and pack the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



whole   thing  with  your  party  men,   the   whole

Government.  I  say  this in this  Chamber.  I  will

repeat  it  on  oath. He will have to repeat  it  on

oath.  I  am  not  meaning this for the  Member  for

Anson. As the Minister for Culture has just told me,

"If we start talking about vague allegations and  `I

have  heard  it said in the market place  that  some

chaps are certifiable.' " But does that mean that we

should  have  a Commission of Inquiry to investigate

whether it is true that some chaps are certifiable?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Maybe the Prime Minister!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Or an hon. Member of this

House? For we should all be coin pos mentis in  this

House.  Quite frankly, I say this. We put down  this

amendment. I expected some fierce allegations to  be

made  after the fashion of the Member for Hong  Lim.

And  we  say, all right, let them say whatever  they

like.  But  let  them go up before this  Commission,

take the oath, and repeat it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was really not interested in the Member for

Anson,  because, after everything is said and  done,

he  does not really fight Siamese style. Once  in  a

while  he does land a blow below the belt, but  then

he  apologises'  for it. But the  Member  for  Upper

Serangoon is brought up in a different tradition. He

claimed  certain  property in  the  Upper  Serangoon

Branch as his - sewing machines, printing presses  and

other  furniture. He removed them. We  said  it  was

theft.  He brought an action. He went to the  Police

Court. There he discovered, for the first time, that

if  he  gave evidence on oath and claimed  that  the

property  was his he would have to go  to  a  Judge,

because,  being  a member of the Government,  if  he

took bribes from his constituents and never reported

them -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to me as though there

must  be another Commission of Inquiry. Is all  this

relevant to the motion?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is relevant. A man claimed

property  belonging to the P.A.P. He  stole  it.  We

said   he  stole  it.  We  claimed  it.  The  police

impounded  it.  He claimed it in the Civil  District

Court.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is that political nepotism or

improper  political interference, or  does  it  come

within the amendment? I cannot see how it does.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

at  pains  to explain the obvious. I must apologise,

for  sometimes I assume the obvious. We  are  making

this  proviso in the amendment, that a man who makes

his  allegations  here must repeat them  before  the

Commission,  because we have experience  of  people,

making  charges  lightheartedly. In particular,  the

Member for Upper Serangoon had made a serious  claim

that certain property was his when he stole it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have no brief for the Member for

Upper  Serangoon though he seconds my motion. But  I

would draw the attention of the Speaker to the  fact

that  there is a Standing Order which precludes hon.

Members  from  making reference to  the  conduct  of

Members  outside this House except on a  substantive

motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Standing Order is Standing Order

46, which refers to the personal conduct of Members:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not  be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose.'



<br><br>I   do  suggest  to  the  Prime  Minister  that  his

allegation that the hon. Member for Upper  Serangoon

stole  something is a serious allegation,  which  is

not within the ambit of this motion. If he wishes to

make an allegation, then he should make it by way of

a  motion. If the Member for Upper Serangoon  wishes

to  take it up, then it is a matter probably for the

Committee of Privileges.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for  Upper Serangoon having claimed  certain

property  which we said he stole. But what I  wanted

to  point  out  to  you, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  is  the

obvious,  why  we  have  moved  this  amendment.  He

claimed it. When he went to court, he dared  not  go

into the witness box to claim it. And he surrendered

the  property.  Why? Because he  discovered  in  the

course  of the proceedings that if he had gone  into

the  witness box on oath and sworn that the property

was  his, then he would have been charged for having

received gifts without consideration as a member  of

the  Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, people  make  all

kinds  of  fantastic statements. But when they  know

that   they  have  to  repeat  them  on  a   certain

formalistic ritual, they think twice. I am  prepared

to  meet  the  Member for tipper Serangoon.  I  have

nothing  personal against him. This  is  all  highly

political.  But I will tell him this,  through  you,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  Political  or  not,  there  are

certain standards of honour and conduct. When a  man

incites me to nepotism and I check him, and he comes

here and moves a motion and says that I am guilty of

nepotism, then I say I want that man in the  witness

box.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is your tragedy, Mr Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed. And I have paid so

bitterly and dearly for it, as indeed all those  who

make mistakes must pay. But I am suggesting that the

Member  for Upper Serangoon is making a grave  error

of judgment for the things he said. I did not bother

to  listen to his rigmarole because I thought  if  I

stayed  behind I might act as an inhibition to  some

of the more flamboyant things he would say. I wanted

him to say everything he wanted to say in order that

it  could stand up to the test of close scrutiny. We

say  by  all means have this Commission of  Inquiry.

The  Member  for Anson  - I really was  not  concerned

about  him  - knows just how far he can go. He  is  as

well trained as the Member for Farrer Park. He says,

"I was told, this and that."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



Generally - there  is  the  "generally".  There  is  a

general belief. The Minister for Culture informed me

as  to  the wrong estimation of one's sanity and  so

on. [Interruption] I do not want to be ruled out  of

order, Mr Speaker, Sir. There is cunning behind all

this  calculated insanity. But the Member for  Upper

Serangoon  blunders into this. I say  here  and  now

that  he  incited me to nepotism when he  came  back

from  Israel. We sent him on a training course,  and

he  said the whole approach was wrong. In fact,  you

could  never  implement anything through  the  civil

service.  Sack  the  whole lot. Appoint  all  P.A.P.

chaps, then you can implement it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister will give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think it is

necessary to clarify certain points which the  Prime

Minister has raised. Perhaps the Prime Minister  was

too  excited. I did not say the things he  mentioned

just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is important. Cher sie

hua wo ping mei yu na yang chiang. [Certain things I

did  not  say].  Say exactly in that way.  But  many

things  were more or less like that. That is on  the

record, it may not appear in the translation. But  I

repeated it for the purpose of memory. Iu i sie  hua

wo  ping mei yu na yang chiang. But more or less, he

was inciting me. And I say a man who has the perfidy

to  ask  me to do something which I was against  and

then comes to this Chamber and acts as a seconder to

a  motion  calling for a Commission  of  Inquiry  to

investigate  wrongs which he  - very  fortunately  for

me - failed to get me to commit  - I say that takes  the

cake.  What I would like to do is to meet him  under

Queensberry  rules, Mr Speaker, Sir,  - on  oath   - in

order that the truth can be ascertained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



We  have appointed all these chaps to various posts.

So  what? What is wrong with it? But when the Member

for Anson says - and I was watching the Member for Nee

Soon  very  closely - that  I,  as  Chairman  of   the

People's  Association, wrongly used or  misused  the

funds  of  the People's Association to bring  P.A.P.

members to Anson and Hong Lim rallies, then  I  say,

he puts it down in writing, he produces his witness,

and we shall question the witness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has not been one single word on the real nub

of  this motion, which is what the Member for Farrer

Park   has   talked  about - political  nepotism   and

interference  with  the civil service.  With  people

trained in the English democratic traditions, it  is

a   very  serious  matter  when  you  intimidate  or

otherwise undermine the morale and integrity of  the

civil    service   by   unlawfully   or   improperly

interfering with it. Not a single word of that  from

the  Member for Anson, let alone from the Member for

Upper  Serangoon. Strangely enough, I  do  not  know

whether  this is a failing of the Member  for  Upper

Serangoon  or  whether he reflects  the  13  Barisan

Members. As I understood his ten-minute speech which

I  heard before I left the Chamber in order that  he

would  not  be inhibited, what he was bemoaning  was

not  the  fact  that he got all these various  chaps

jobs  in the People's Association but that after  we

discovered he was up to no good, we got him out  and

we  got rid of his chaps. That was the complaint.  I

should  have  thought  the proper  wording  for  the

motion by the Member for Upper Serangoon would  have

been that "This House condemns the P.A.P. Government

for not allowing all those persons  - community centre

leaders,   assistant  leaders,   watchmen   and   so

on - recruited by him and the Member for Nee  Soon  to

carry on and act, not at the behest of the Board  of

Management's rules, but, I would say,  to  the  tugs

and  pulls of the chaps who installed them in  their

jobs." They are two different matters entirely.  The

Member for Anson is worlds apart from the Member for

Upper  Serangoon. They signed the same  motion,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, but they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



were   talking   of  two  completely  and   entirely

different things in two different languages.  And  I

want  to  say,  in brief, that we are  prepared,  as

indeed any government which desires to maintain  its

integrity as a matter of honour is prepared, to have

any  Commission  of  Inquiry or  any  scrutiny  into

anybody's  conduct.  For only in  that  way  can  we

justify acceptance of the fact that whatever we  do,

be  it  right  or be it wrong, is not  for  personal

advantage and personal interest. But I say, when  it

comes to a thing like this - and we have gone through

all  this rigmarole with the Member for Hong Lim and

whatever that Commission of Inquiry achieved or  did

not  achieve - that  is a debatable point - a  year  has

since  elapsed and we have heard no more' about  all

these wild allegations. They have stopped.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN RECRUITING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1875 there was

passed  an Ordinance [Foreign Recruiting]  which  is

still on our statute books to control recruiting  in

the Colony for the service of Foreign States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3 of the Ordinance reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any person is, within the limits of the'

Colony, obtaining, or attempting to obtain, recruits

for   the  service  of  any  Foreign  State  in  any

capacity, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara may by order in

writing,  signed  by the Minister,  either  prohibit

such  person from so doing or permit him  to  do  so

subject  to any conditions which the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara imposes.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then section 4 of the same Ordinance reads as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Yang di-Pertuan Negara may by general order

notified  in the Gazette either prohibit  recruiting

for the service of any Foreign State, or impose upon

such recruiting any conditions which he thinks fit.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And section 5, which is the last `section, is the

punishment section for any violation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's orders set forth in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruiting under this Ordinance, Mr Speaker, Sir,

could  be  either  recruiting  to  a  foreign  civil

service, or perhaps recruiting to an army.  This  is

still  on  our  statute  books  and,  therefore,  it

becomes  pertinent  to inquire how  this  particular

section  3 is to be worked. Under section 3  of  the

Ordinance,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, it is  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara who, by order signed by the Minister,

prohibits   or   permits.  We  know,  Mr   Speaker,

constitutionally, the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  never

acts on his own. He either acts on the advice of the

Cabinet or on that of a particular Minister  and  it

would   seem   on   some   occasions,   under    the

Constitution,  on the advice of the  United  Kingdom

Commissioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 72 (1) of the Singapore (Constitution)

Order in Council, 1958, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of this Part of this

Order,  defence and external, affairs shall  be  the

responsibility  of  the  Government  of  the  United

Kingdom.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 74 (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of the United Kingdom may,

whenever it is of the opinion that the discharge  of

its   responsibilities  for  defence  sir   external

affairs  so  requires,  request  the  Government  of

Singapore,  by  a  communication  made  through  the

United  Kingdom  Commissioner, to  take  any  action

specified in that communication or to discontinue or

refrain from any action which is so specified;  and.

subject to the provisions of subsection (8) of  this

section, the Government of Singapore shall, as  soon

as  may  be, comply with any such request except  to

the   extent  that  the  Internal  Security  Council

decides,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions   of

subsection  (7) of this section, that  the  subject-matter  of  the  `request is a  matter  of  internal

security and not of defence or external affairs.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then section 74 (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the United Kingdom Commissioner is satisfied

that the provisions of the preceding subsection have

not been complied with, he may, by writing under his

official seal, so inform the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

and advise him to make an Order giving effect to the

request of the Government of the United Kingdom; and

the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara shall  make  an  Order

accordingly.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 74 (4) of that Ordinance reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every Order made by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

under this section shall have the force of law,  and

shall be published in the Gazette.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Recruiting Ordinance, from 1875 up

till  the  date this Constitution Order  in  Council

came  into force, regulated recruiting in so far  as

such  recruitment  took  place  in  the  Colony  for

service in a foreign State. The question now arises,

Mr   Speaker,  Sir   - and  on  this,   perhaps   the

appropriate Minister could tell the House - who is the

Minister  who  advises  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara

under   section   3   of  the  Foreign   `Recruiting

Ordinance?  Is it the Minister for Home Affairs,  or

is  it  the  Hon, the Prime Minister or  is  it  the

United  Kingdom Commissioner? The matter is of  some

importance at this stage, Mr Speaker, Sir,  because

there  are  attempts being made to  recruit  in  the

Colony -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Colony?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - in the State of Singapore, and there

should  be a categorical statement made by  somebody

in  charge  of these affairs as to what  the  proper

position  is  with regard to foreign recruiting.  If

that  matter  is  under the control  of  the  United

Kingdom  Commissioner, then a categorical  statement

should  be  made to that effect. If that  matter  is

within  the  ambit of any ministerial  portfolio,  a

ministerial statement should be made to that effect.

But whatever it may be, it does appear. Mr Speaker,

Sir, that under section 4, some general order should

be  put  out  in  the  Gazette to  comply  with  the

provisions of the Foreign Recruiting Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are there any Members wishing to

speak before the Ministerial Bench replies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you see some

hesitation on the part of the Front Benches  of  the

Government not because an answer is not there to  be

given,  but because the problem is, how do  we  give

the answer? Do we talk about anti-colonialism, or do

we  talk  about  law? Having heard  the  Member  for

Farrer Park talk law, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



have decided that the matter should be answered in a

purely  legal and proper manner and the  appropriate

Minister  who  should answer the Member  for  Farrer

Park is the Minister for Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law feels that behind the jargon of the law, really what it means is: do you really

seriously object to people enlisting members of  the

Barisan Sosialis who want to volunteer to go to West

Irian?  Do  we really and seriously feel that  their

loyalty to Singapore will be undermined if they  are

engaged in the anti-colonial struggle?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think the Member for Farrer Park

has  acutely and subtly posed the problem. It is not

a  question of portfolio because the Cabinet as such

act  together,  and the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  can

only act on the advice of the Cabinet as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to draw the attention of

the  Member  for Farrer Park to section  74  of  the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order  in  Council,  which

specifically spells out the powers over defence  and

external  affairs  in  the  hands  of  the   British

Government.  If there is any doubt as to  where  the

matter   rests,  whether  it  is  internal  security

encroaching   upon  defence -   this   is   purely   a

hypothetical  case  and  I am  not  suggesting  that

somebody  who  wants to go to West  Irian  to  fight

Dutch  colonialism is necessarily a  danger  to  the

security of the State of Singapore. In fact, I would

think  that  there  is no better  guarantee  of  the

security  of the State of Singapore than  to  engage

all   the   anti-colonial  fervour  and   zest   and

enthusiasm in something really worthwhile, something

which  I  had  the honour to sign in  a  declaration

jointly  with the First Minister of the Republic  of

Indonesia,   to   which   my  former   Parliamentary

Secretary was a witness. He stood solemnly by as  we

declared  and he solemnly supported that West  Irian

should  go  back to Indonesia. But the crux  of  the

matter  is:  has  the U.K. Commissioner  raised  the

question  as  one which infringes upon their  rights

under the Constitution and therefore requiring us to

take action? The answer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



is  no  because, being wise colonialists, they leave

well  alone. If chaps want to sail to West Irian,  I

say  to  them  that the British Navy will  not  stop

them.  I think so. I have not received any assurance

from  the  Commander-in-Chief, Far Eastern  Station,

but  I  have  a  good hunch that if they  want  five

blasts  of the whistle to send them off, I will  try

and  arrange it, so that they can get a proper send-off to the best landing beaches in West Irian.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What about yourself?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir, I will not go myself

because,  like  a  good democrat, I  feel  that  the

matter  should  be settled by peaceful negotiations.

Not that I am adverse to a bit of bloodshed. I think

sometimes  bloodshed  is inevitable  when  you  meet

recalcitrant - [Interruption]. No, even my own,  if  it

becomes  necessary. But in this case, it is such  an

interesting and exciting exposition of  the  art  of

brinksmanship - I  think  it  will  all   be   settled

peacefully. More is the pity when I think of it, all

the  untapped  valour  and bravery  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  and  the  three girls  whom  they  marched

forward, Sir,I really admire them, Sir,I was  away

when I read all this. The last time they fought  for

Chinese  culture and education - wrongly fought,  they

used  school kids. Now they want to down  the  Dutch

and  liberate West Irian, and they put  three  girls

forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Sir, the short answer to the Member for Farrer

Park - I am sorry. That is why I really do not want to

answer this. I do not want to say anything in  reply

because, apart from giving him a purely legal answer

at  which  he already. I imagine, has a very  shrewd

guess, I have to touch upon the basic reality  which

the  camouflage  of  legalistic argument  is  really

intended    for.    I   say   foreign    enlistment,

notwithstanding the fact that the Treasurer  of  the

People's  Action Party has assured me that  we  have

got  enough funds to pay for the first 100  passages

to West Irian - the Barisan Sosialis Committee members

immediately, first passage, also to volunteer -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> One-way ticket!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Or two if they can come back.

Why  not'?  But  if the U.K. Commission  raises  any

objection,  I am prepared to risk the reputation  of

my  Government in standing up to British colonialism

in  supporting Dutch colonialism. We stand for anti-colonialism.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In Singapore too?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In Singapore too; everywhere

in South-East Asia, anywhere in the world -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But after anti-colonialism is

over,  we stand for an independent, democratic  non-Communist socialist society. That is where the sheep

and  the  goats part; that is where anti-colonialism

ends  and  nationalism begins, or Communism  begins;

and  this  is  the threshold where we  are  at.  The

Member for Anson is gleeful because - [Interruption].

I am happy, Sir, that he went up to Kuala Lumpur and

had a chat with the Prime Minister of the Federation

of Malaya -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

[Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I can see nothing to laugh about,

Sir,I  do  object  to the fact that  the  personal

conduct of a Member should be referred to. Not  that

I am ashamed in the least to have had lunch with the

Prime  Minister  of  the  Federation.  That  was   a

confidential  meeting  and  I  consider  it  grossly

improper  on  the  part  of the  Prime  Minister  to

divulge it here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why do you not tell me -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order has been taken. It

is personal conduct of the Member for Anson, and the

Standing Orders are quite clear on it. It cannot  be

referred   to   except  on  a  substantive   motion.

Objection  has  been taken and,  therefore,  I  must

insist that no further reference be made.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Member asks us to

withdraw  any  aspersion from a  reference  of  that

kind. There is no aspersion -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is no aspersion alleged.

It  is the personal conduct of a Member which cannot

be  referred to under our Standing Orders.  That  is

all there is to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is no personal conduct,

Mr  Speaker, Sir. This is a public figure - a former

Chief  Minister. I hear all this from my  colleague,

the Minister for Culture. He told me that the Member

for  Anson  went  up  with him in  the  same  plane,

together  with the whole of the Malaysian delegation

from Sarawak, and they all -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

must  keep  order. That is personal conduct  and  he

must not refer to it. The objection has been taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at some

other  time and at some other place, I think I  will

question  that ruling; but on a night such  as  this

when we are all getting a bit hungry, I will let  it

pass.  But,  nevertheless, let me make  this  point,

which  I was on the point of clarifying. We  are  on

the  threshold of either a nationalist non-Communist

socialist Malaya or a Communist one, and we  support

anti-colonialism anywhere provided that is where  it

is  going to lead to. If it is going to lead to some

other dead-end  - and I say those who want to go to  a

dead-end, God bless them. But that does not mean  we

do  not support West Irian because, as far as we can

see,  that  leads  to,  for  a  long  while  yet,  a

nationalist Indonesia. What history has in store for

us and our neighbours we do not know, but West Irian

belongs  to  Indonesia and we  support  it   - foreign

enlistment notwithstanding. The Singapore Government

gives  a firm and categorical assurance to all those

who  wish to volunteer that we will stand up for the

anti-colonial  rights  of  all  those  who  wish  to

sacrifice life and limb for a sacred cause.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has just

been  a suggestion that there is recruitment  going

on  in this country for the military purposes of  a

foreign  nation. I think we want to put the  matter

in   proper   perspective.  That   is,   in   fact,

inaccurate.  I  have  read  in  the  papers  of   a

statement  issued by the Indonesian  Consul-General

who  has  stated  merely that he  has  noted  these

applications  for service overseas, that  they  are

not  being  utilised at the moment, but  that  they

would  be  considered in due course.  That  is  not

recruitment,  Sir. That is no more  than  a  polite

K.I.V., as if the Member for Farrer Park writes and

tells  me  that  he is referring my letter  to  his

client  for consideration. It means nothing at  all

and I do not think it is fair to imply -  though I do

not  know  if the implication is intended - that,  in

fact,  the Consul-General for Indonesia is  in  any

way  transgressing any of our laws. To my mind,  he

seems  to  have  acted with complete propriety  and

constitutionality. There is no suggestion really of

recruitment. Insofar as the volunteers -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It might be useful for the

Member  for  Anson to know that the  Consul-General

for  Indonesia  Is  in no danger of  being  charged

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I know that the Consul-General for

Indonesia  is  in  no  danger  of  being  convicted

whatever the P.A.P. may do, because in law  he  has

not recruited. Insofar as the citizens of Singapore

are  concerned - how shall I say it?   - they  wish  to

express  a certain emotional reaction and it  is  a

ceremonial  gesture  on a ceremonial  occasion,  as

Churchill once said. Surely we cannot take them  to

task,  nor  shall we make fun of them  even  though

they  be  women. I say, Sir, that there is  nothing

here  to  take objection to in any way that  I  can

see.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I think the Member for

Anson has completely misunderstood the intention of

the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no quarrel with the Consul-General for

Indonesia. If he wants to invite people to fight in

the  campaign to liberate West Irian, so be it.  In

this  great anti-colonial struggle fully  supported

by  the  Barisan Sosialis - indeed, Sir, last Sunday,

they  had  a  tremendous mass meeting, I  am  told,

whereby  they  had  to rally all the  unions  under

their charge to effect a decent turn-out, which  it

never  had until then  - our quarrel is not with  the

Consul-General for Indonesia. We say that there  is

an  anti-colonial struggle to liberate West  Irian.

The Barisan Sosialis say, "Yes, they must." We say,

"Let  West  Irian return to Indonesia  by  peaceful

negotiations." But at that mass meeting, they said,

"No, we must fight." Mr Lim Ching Siong said, "The

example   of   West   Irian  clearly   shows   that

constitutional methods of opposing colonialism  are

ineffective. We must use arms." So be  it.  He  has

set the pattern for behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson said, "This is just a

ceremonial  gesture appealing to  the  emotions  of

man".  That  may  be his view. He  may  be  a  very

emotional  man who believes in ceremonial gestures.

But  the Barisan Sosialis are neither emotional nor

ceremonial.  Behind  them they have  the  organised

ranks, the Communist underground and the open front

organisations. They have said openly and' in public

at a mass meeting that West Irian must be liberated

by  force,  and  that  they do  not  believe  in  a

constitutional  effort  to  win  independence  from

colonial rule. Quite naturally, Sir, it follows, as

day  follows  night, that Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis, particularly the leaders in the Assembly,

feel very strongly about the issue. If they do  not

feel  strongly  about the issue, then  they  are  a

bunch of hypocrites. If they do feel strongly about

the issue -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the word

"hypocrites"  was used in reference to  Members  of

the  Assembly and it has been ruled in the past  as

being unparliamentary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I hasten to say that I have

never  called them hypocrites. I said  if  they  did

not  believe in what they publicly stated, that they

must  liberate West Irian by force, then  they  were

hypocrites.  I  assume,  of course,  that  they  are

honourable gentlemen and they' believe in what their

Party says and that there is no doubt that they will

be  the  first contingent to land on the  shores  of

West Irian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In that happy event, I think

this  House would want me to strike medals in  their

honour.  And in this gallant anti-colonial struggle,

if  any  of  them falls a victim to the  machine-gun

fire  of the wicked Dutch colonialists, then I  have

no  doubt  that my Ministry will release  sufficient

funds to build a monument to his memory.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose this is all related

to foreign recruiting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, we have before this House

a motion in support of the anti-colonial struggle in

West  Irian. I am very glad indeed that  the  Member

for  Farrer  Park  has  brought  out  certain  legal

obstacles  that might stand in the way. The  Barisan

Sosialis  are great anti-colonial fighters,  but  if

they  think that the law enacted in 1875  stands  in

their  way,  we  will sweep it  aside  and  pass  an

amending legislation to repeal it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we await with great interest these

gallant, brave anti-colonial fighters. What do  they

have to say? Will we perhaps have the opportunity to

go to Clifford Pier to see them off on a tongkang or

a  junk,  because the President of the  Republic  of

Indonesia -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I tried to indicate that the

Minister  was perhaps going very far away  from  the

topic  we  are discussing. I think he has  made  his

point.  Let us come back to the question of  foreign

recruiting as raised by the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I will wind up by saying. I

wish them goodbye, good luck and adieu.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Just a few words, Sir, about

goodbyes.  I am sure that when the time  comes,  the

people  of  Singapore will say, "Goodbye  and  good.

riddance to the P.A.P.".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There are two volunteers now.

Are you going to West Irian?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Finance said

something  about our last week's rally.  We  do  not

have to rebut every time that the P.A.P. try to  be-little  us.  `There are witnesses there.  There  are

pictures  which show the' thousands that are  there.

We  do not have to carry the people there. They come

along  by themselves. But there is one thing I  want

to  make  clear  for the record. He  said  that  our

Secretary-General stated that we support the use  of

force to liberate West Iran because that was the way

it should be. Well, we never said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> How is that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We have said repeatedly that we

support a peaceful solution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Then why volunteer?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We quoted the case of Goa, that

in  this  particular case, it was the  intransigence

and  obstinacy of Western colonialism  that  blinded

them  to  the  writing on the wall and, under  those

circumstances,  when colonialism refuses  to  leave,

refuses to budge and still wants to cling on to  the

last pound of flesh, then it will have to be ousted,

just  as  the  P.A.P. when the time  comes  will  be

ousted  by the people of Singapore. If in this  West

Irian issue, force has to be used as a result of the

obstinacy of Dutch colonialism -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You will go there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - then for the cause of the

struggle against colonialism, we support it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Will you go then?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the Minister for Finance

would  care to come along with us, we would go along

as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Coward!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> You can go there

alone.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> When the Member for Farrer Park

spoke on the' adjournment, he did not indicate

whether he wished to be the recruiting officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Barisan Sosialis can do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
