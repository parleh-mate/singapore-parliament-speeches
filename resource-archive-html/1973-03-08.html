<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[26th  February,  1973], "That Parliament  approves

the  financial  policy of the  Government  for  the

financial  year  1st  April, 1973  to  31st  March,

1974.". -[Minister for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Minister for Finance  has  once

again presented a painless Budget in this House. He

also  announced in his Budget Statement seven items

of  tax  reliefs and a surplus of $20 million.  All

this goes to show that Singapore is in a very sound

financial  position.  This  is  a  budget  that  is

welcomed  by  all  the people of Singapore,  and  I

hereby support the financial policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government is now concentrating its

efforts on industrialisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



and  urbanisation  in order to catch  up  with  the

technologically  advanced  countries.  It  is  also

concentrating    its   efforts   on   technological

developments  as  a  means to further  develop  our

economy.   All   this   is   very   well    because

circumstances  are such that we have  to  catch  up

with the other advanced countries. But I would like

to  take  this opportunity to remind the Government

that  we  should  not overlook certain  aspects  of

development  that have taken place in some  Western

countries. The development of their technology  and

economy  have  brought about certain  shortcomings.

There  is  also  the evolvement of  escapism  as  a

result  of  excessive  material  development.   The

spiritual aspect of human life must be looked into.

Creativity,  the emotions of human  beings,  should

also  be developed together with technological  and

material development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the process of urbanisation and

industrialisation in Singapore, the Government  has

taken various steps to control social pathology and

other   shortcomings.  These   shortcomings   which

accompany  material  and technological  development

are  air pollution, environmental pollution,  noise

pollution,    industrial   accidents,    industrial

diseases, traffic congestion, and a host of others.

The  abuse of the mass media is also one aspect  of

the  shortcomings. People are more  concerned  with

their own material enjoyment than the interests and

welfare of the country. In other words, the  people

are  becoming more and more selfish. They take less

and  less  interest  in  the  people  around  them.

Degradation and decadence, therefore, set in. As  a

result of this phenomenon, crimes are mounting  and

anti-social  activities  are  increasing.  We  have

gangsterism, blackmail, juvenile delinquency, and a

host of other anti-social activities. On top of all

this,  there  is  the problem of drug  abuse.  Drug

trafficking is going on in Singapore. Young  people

are sporting long hair in spite of the Government's

attempt to discourage it. It is regrettable that we

can  still  see in this corner of the  world  young

people  taking  drugs,  sporting  long  hair,   and

engaging  in  activities outside the ambit  of  the

law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to create a healthy and wholesome

social atmosphere and environment, we must not fall

into  the  wake  of  some technologically  advanced

Western   countries.   Over  and   above   economic

development, the Government should pay attention to

cultural development. The people must be inculcated

with a sense of belonging. They must be educated in

the effort to make Singapore a clean and pollution-free  city. I do not think that campaigns like  the

"Tree  Planting Campaign", "Anti-Mosquito Campaign"

and "Family Planning Campaign" have been adequately

carried  out.  I  hope  that  the  Government  will

allocate  more funds to step up these campaigns  in

order  to avoid the by-products and the ill-effects

of  industrialisation. Sir, although we  cannot  be

assured  that  the ill-effects of industrialisation

can  be totally eradicated, I am sure that with all

the efforts put in, we can reduce them to a certain

extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the prosperity and economy of

Singapore are developing at a pace far greater than

our   neighbouring  countries.  This  brings  about

unemployment   in   those  countries,   and   these

unemployed   people  are  therefore  pouring   into

Singapore. This may cause an "explosion" in future.

I  would,  therefore, propose to the Government  to

encourage   Singaporeans   to   invest    in    our

neighbouring countries. Encouragement  should  also

be given to our technicians and technocrats to help

in  the  development of our neighbouring countries.

This  will not only help those countries  to  solve

their  unemployment  problem  and  to  raise  their

standard  of living, but will also ultimately  help

us  to  check the danger of a potential "explosion"

from occurring in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, even with an enlightened

leadership,  Singapore cannot function without  the

sincere  co-operation of the people.  If  there  is

such  a co-operation, I am confident that Singapore

will have a brighter future.



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I must congratulate the hon. Minister for

Finance for his pain-less



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



Budget.  It  was  a Budget  which  was  quite

rightly  described by a newspaper as  one  "with  a

heart".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who comes from the manufacturing sector, I

note  with concern the fact that earnings from  the

manufacturing sector as measured by  the  GDP  have

declined  in 1972 to only 20.1 per cent as  against

25  per  cent in 1971 and 27.5 per cent in 1970.  I

also  note from the Minister's statement  that  the

manufacturing investment commitments  fell  sharply

from  $716  million  in 1971 to $252  million  last

year.  While it is accepted that this drop  may  be

due  in  part  to  investment  commitments  of  the

petroleum   refining  industry  as  well   as   the

shipbuilding and repairing yards, this alone  could

not account for the big drop in investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Minister has

mentioned  in  his  statement that  the  future  of

Singapore is correlated to its being considered  an

ideal   off-shore  manufacturing  base  for  multi-nationals and their subsidiaries, and that  special

efforts will be made to attract more investment  to

come  to  Singapore.  While  paying  attention   to

attracting more investment to come to Singapore, it

is  also  necessary to make a study of the possible

causes   of   this   decline  in   investment   and

manufacturing earnings. While we like to  encourage

new  multi-national firms to come to Singapore,  we

must not overlook the existing ones, especially the

local  industries that are now established  in  the

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year, manufacturers in Singapore have

been  faced  with increased costs  in  many  areas.

There  were taxation and other increases which  may

have    directly   and   sharply   increased    the

manufacturing and production costs. These may  have

contributed   to   the  decline  in   manufacturing

earnings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to suggest to the

Minister to look into some of these factors  which,

in  fact,  are  causing hardship  to  some  of  the

existing  industries,  and  which  may  have   also

deterred   would-be  investors   from   coming   to

Singapore. In addition, the high increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



in production cost has either deterred  the

expansion  programme of many manufacturers  or  has

driven  some  of them to transfer their  operations

and or expansion to neighbouring countries. Some of

these factors are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Increasing cost of raw materials

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Increase in freight charges

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Revision of PSA tariffs

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Revision of PUB electricity tariffs

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Revision of the water rates and the

introduction of the block system of charging

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Additional cost of anti-pollution measures

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Increase in land rentals, leading to increase

in assessments

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Increase in assessed land values leading to

higher assessments

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Increase in workmen's compensation premium,

resulting   from   the   higher   compensation

payable, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Increase in CPF contributions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is justification for some of these

increases,  for  example,  the  increase   in   CPF

contributions. But I think it is the  duty  of  the

Government,  if we are to encourage the  growth  of

industries in Singapore, to exercise better control

over  some  of  the other increases. While  we  are

trying to compete in an extremely competitive world

market,   it   may   not  be  possible   for   many

manufacturers, especially the local industries,  to

bear  all these increased costs within such a short

space  of  time. Obviously it is very difficult  to

determine  the  extent of these increases  in  real

terms  of  costs, or how they will directly  affect

the  cost  of production of the various industries.

Nevertheless,  these increases in  terms  of  costs

will  make  our products less competitive  and,  if

they  are for the local market, manufacturers  will

have  no choice but to pass these increases  on  to

the consumers, thereby causing inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, this is a vicious cycle. Some of the

increases,  which  I  have  mentioned  above,   are

completely  outside the control of the  Government,

but the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



other  increases,  such  as  in  land  rentals,  in

assessed  land values, in additional cost of  anti-pollution  measures, and in the revision  of  rates

for  public utilities, can and should be controlled

and  coordinated  if  we are to  maintain  or  even

increase  our  rate of industrialisation.  I  would

therefore  like to urge the Government to seriously

look  into the matter before the activities of  our

manufacturing sector are affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point I would like to

raise  concerns assistance to local  industries  to

increase their exports. In June last year,  at  the

annual   dinner  of  the  Singapore  Manufacturers'

Association,  the  Minister for  Finance  indicated

that  he  would  be  prepared to consider  granting

income  tax concession to locally-owned  firms  for

participating in approved trade fairs, exhibitions,

and  trade  missions,  and which  are  not  already

enjoying  export incentives or other incentives.  I

am  therefore a bit disappointed that no  statement

to  this  effect  is  made in  his  Budget  Speech.

Although  our  exports of industrial products  have

grown  substantially over the last 10  years,  they

are  mainly  due  to the exports of  multi-national

companies,   with  the  electronic  and   petroleum

industries  accounting for 53.8  per  cent  of  the

total  industrial export in 1970. This  shows  that

our  locally-owned  industries accounted  for  only

46.2  per  cent  or  less than half  of  the  total

industrial  export. Even then these export  figures

of  local  industries are confined to  only  a  few

industries,   like  shipbuilding   and   repairing,

textiles, food and veneer products. The other local

industries show a much slower rate of growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government intends to stimulate the growth

of  local industries, a great deal has still to  be

done  to assist them to broaden their base  and  to

diversify. One of the more important factors is  to

encourage  a higher growth of exports. I  therefore

feel that special consideration should be given  to

local   manufacturers  at  this  stage   of   their

development.  One  way  is to  give  a  double  tax

deduction concession. I appreciate that no  blanket

concession can be given. I would therefore like  to

suggest  that  the  Treasury  or  the  Income   Tax

Department should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



work  closely with those concerned to work out  the

criteria, so as to avoid abuse by individuals.  But

because  of  a few individuals who may  abuse  this

privilege, there is no excuse to penalise  all  the

others.  The types of expenditure which  should  be

considered  for  double taxation relief  are  those

which  are  normally incurred, i.e, travelling  and

hotel  expenses, freight for exhibits, construction

cost  of  display stands and participation fees  in

trade   fairs   and  entertainment   supported   by

receipts, subject to certain limits. I am confident

that  officers from the Income Tax Department  will

know how to draw up criteria to avoid abuse and, if

need  be,  I would even venture to suggest  that  a

realistic   limit  be  set  for  such  double   tax

deduction concession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to commend the Government

for  the  recent increases in the salaries  of  top

civil servants. I understand that not more than 322

officers are affected, which is a very small figure

compared  to the approximate 50,000 civil  servants

we have in Singapore. In line with the Government's

thinking,  we should not pay too much attention  to

material  wealth,  and  that  we  should  pay  more

attention  to  culture, paintings,  music,  etc.  I

would like to suggest that, in order to retain some

of  our  more  promising technical  and  scientific

officers   in  the  public  sector   and   in   the

universities,  statutory boards and  the  technical

institutes,  more  funds  should  be  provided  for

equipment  and  research in order  to  provide  job

satisfaction   to   this  category   of   important

personnel.  To start with, I would like to  suggest

that  maybe we should put aside for this purpose  a

sum  of  $2  million which is only half of  the  $4

million set aside for the increased salaries of the

322  officers.  This  $2 million  will  give  added

incentives   and  job  satisfaction  to   the   few

thousands  who are manning and performing  yeomen's

services  in the universities, technical institutes

and the technical divisions of the public sector. A

man, especially an educated person, needs money  to

live,  but given a sufficient salary he also  needs

something to live for.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that there is a provision of $120,000

under  the  Ministry of Science and Technology  for

applied research. There is also a similar provision

of $100,000 under the Ministry of Health. But these

amounts  are  insufficient to enable a  proper  and

intensive research to be conducted. I would like to

suggest,  for the consideration of the  Government,

that  this  sum  of  $2 million  be  added  to  the

research  grant  of  the Ministry  of  Science  and

Technology  for  equipment and research,  and  that

this  grant be given more readily to those research

workers  in  the  public  sector.  What  music  and

culture  is  to  the society, research  is  to  our

scientists  and  engineers. I hope  the  Government

will  not  overlook this important aspect  and  the

needs of the very important sector of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to comment on

the salary scale of the technical officers who,  to

my mind, have been overlooked. This important class

of  technicians is in great demand nowadays.  While

we  are  building up our Industrial Training  Board

and  our technical colleges, we have a greater need

for this category of people, since more of them are

required  as teachers and instructors. The  present

salary  scale of 5465-1030 per month  will  not  be

able  to  keep  good and experienced staff  in  the

technical   institutes  and  in  our  schools.   In

industry  such people are employed as  supervisors,

and  they  are given a much better salary scale.  I

would therefore like to suggest to Government  that

a  more  realistic salary scale be implemented  and

that the scheme of merit increments should also  be

applied to this grade of technical officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to comment on, Sir,

is merely to echo the sentiments of most Members of

Parliament in this House and the public  at  large.

This  is  in regard to the tax relief for taxpayers

who  support  dependent parents  and  grandparents.

While  this tax relief is most welcome by all,  the

amount  of  tax deduction of $300 per dependant  is

indeed on the low side.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



In   addition,   the   relief   should   be   given

irrespective  of  whether or not  the  parents  are

staying  with the taxpayer, provided genuine  proof

of support is given.



<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in his Budget Statement the Minister

for  Finance has briefly described a survey of  our

economic  performance in the past, which  indicates

that the current financial year will be better than

the  last  one.  There  is economic  progress  with

reduced  taxation, and there will be a  surplus  of

$20 million. This undoubtedly reflects our economic

stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recently has raised the salaries

of  Government officers in the Superscale in  order

to  retain them in our public service. This is  one

way  to  reward officers for higher performance.  I

hope  that this policy will also be implemented  in

respect  of  the  other  categories  of  Government

officers, because without their help the Government

cannot achieve its objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the two considerations, one to encourage and

to reward an officer for the work he has performed,

and  the  other  to prevent capable  officers  from

joining  the  private sector,  I  must  stress  the

importance  of the first consideration. Whether  it

is a country, a society or an individual, it is not

possible   to  survive  on  material   alone.   The

spiritual  aspect and value need to be  encouraged,

which  will  make the people lead fuller  and  more

meaningful   lives.  Therefore,  the  revision   of

salaries of Government officers in order to  retain

their services so that they may not be attracted by

the  private sector, together with better treatment

accorded to them, should be regarded as a  kind  of

reward  and an acknowledgement for the right spirit

of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Finance Minister, medical

facilities  and  services will be strengthened  and

improved  in the coming financial year.  Living  in

this  tense  and industrialised metropolitan  city,

there is an increasing need for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



medical  services and care. Any measure to increase

and   improve   this  service  will  be   welcomed.

Therefore,  a community-sponsored institution  such

as  the  Chung  Hwa Hospital should get  Government

support.  Medical reliefs know no  boundaries.  The

authorities  should  also give  adequate  training,

management,  study and financial aids to  modernize

and develop Chinese medicine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new budget policy will no doubt give relief

to  taxpayers who support parents and grandparents.

Though the amount of tax relief is very small, this

however   reflects  the  valued  concept   of   the

Government in preserving our good tradition. I hope

that the Government will also pay attention to  the

smaller families, which are the trend, particularly

those  living  in flats. However,  due  to  limited

space  in these flats, taxpayers may not have their

parents and grandparents living with them. And very

often,  we find that children of taxpayers  do  not

also  live  together with their parents. After  all

the  amount  of relief for support of  parents  and

grandparents does not seem too generous. Therefore,

there  should  be no qualification of residence  to

the claim for such tax reliefs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the current international

monetary crisis and inflation, the presentation  of

a  progressive budget for Singapore is a creditable

achievement.   I  hope  that  with  the   judicious

administration  of  the Finance  Minister  in  this

coming year we may achieve the targeted 15 per cent

growth  rate of our economy, as he had remarked  in

concluding his speech.



<br><br>2.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to congratulate the Finance  Minister

for  his  lucid  presentation of  the  Budget.  The

growth  rate  of 13 per cent in our  GNP  has  been

greeted with applause, especially in the context of

a   turbulent   world  economy.  The   Government's

financial   position  is  excellent  and   a   boom

psychology  prevails  in the  banking  sector,  the

property  market  and, until  recently,  the  Stock

Market.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close examination of the financial statistics,

however,  reveals  evidence of distortions  in  the

economy which are hidden in exciting growth  rates.

Instead  of euphoria, I think we need to pay  close

attention  to  a  number of what I consider  to  be

potentially  disruptive  factors.  First,  as   the

Minister  rightly pointed out, is  the  problem  of

inflation.   The   turmoil  in  the   international

monetary  system  is one major  factor  to  contend

with.  Unless  we  can  apply proper  monetary  and

exchange  controls,  we shall  continue  to  import

inflation in two ways:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) via higher import prices, because of

inflation  in  the advanced countries,  which  will

affect  our cost of living and costs of production,

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) via uncontrolled speculative short-term

capital  which swamps our property market  and  the

Stock  Exchange.  Every time  the  U.S.  Dollar  is

devalued  and  other currencies are  up-valued,  we

have  to  decide on our exchange rate,  keeping  in

mind four factors:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to preserve our competitive edge in the major

trading blocs;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to keep the cost of living from being pushed

up by higher import prices;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to maintain full employment at a good rate

of growth; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) to ensure a healthy balance of payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an unsettled international monetary arena, a

small   country  like  ours  must  apply   exchange

controls  on the import of speculative  capital  or

else  we  shall be overwhelmed by excess  liquidity

and  unhealthy inflation. It would not be necessary

to control export of capital as long as our economy

remains  vibrant. Besides, this would be unwise  as

it  would  be  a deterrent to inflow of  productive

long-term investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent move by the Monetary

Authority   of   Singapore  to   increase   reserve

requirements of banks to 9 per cent is a  necessary

one  to check excessive growth of money supply  and

corresponding  inflation.  However,  I   fear   the

measure will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



ineffective,  and  I  think it  is  discriminatory.

Foreign banks are still free to bring in funds from

abroad.   This  will  place  local   banks   at   a

disadvantage.  Moreover, we  should  stipulate  the

absolute  levels of foreign funds held by banks  as

well   as   maintain  the  higher  reserve   ratio.

Otherwise  with the increased inflow of  funds,  no

matter what the reserve ratio, the money supply can

be  extended indefinitely. Paradoxically,  Sir,  we

seem  to have better control over our hawkers  than

over our bankers and stock brokers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major factor that would need to be

considered  in checking inflation is  the  property

market.  The boom is induced in part by the general

level   of   economic  activity,  but  is   greatly

exacerbated by speculation, fuelled particularly by

the  inflow of hot money. The unhealthy boom in the

property  market has severely penalised the  middle

and  lower-middle income groups, the executive  and

the  professional  people. It has also  contributed

significantly  to the Stock Market boom  as  shares

were  re-valued  in  the light of  higher  property

prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe Government should restrict

ownership  of  residential properties to  Singapore

citizens   and  permanent  residents,  except   for

designated enclaves. Proxies may still be  used  to

buy  up property but severe penalties could he laid

down. Countries like Switzerland have already  long

had  such  restrictions. In addition, all  property

transactions should be allowed no more than a  rate

of  return  of  15  per  cent  a  year  (with  some

flexibility  for escalation of building  costs).  I

prefer  this to a capital gains tax because capital

gains tax is expressed in terms of percentage,  and

you  can always jack up the price to get more,  and

paying  the Government taxes at the same time.  But

if  you  specify the rate of return, then, in  this

way, you can control the market better. In this way

investment  in  properties  will  not   be   unduly

profitable,   speculation  will  be  dampened   and

legitimate  home-owners  given  the  chance  to  be

owners of property.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area where inflation needs to be

checked   is  the  Stock  Market.  I  welcome   the

Securities   Industry  Bill  and  the  accompanying

controls  on Stock Market activities. As the  Prime

Minister and other Ministers have pointed out,  the

get-rich-quick mentality will prove detrimental  to

our  productivity and work ethos.  The  regulations

must,  however, be designed in such  a  way  as  to

control  speculation which hurts the small investor

while  providing a smooth capital market for  long-term investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this year inflation will hit the

lower  income groups through the increase in import

prices  and  the cost of services.  I  believe  the

National  Wages Council should build in a component

of  cost-of-living adjustment, particularly for the

lower   wage  earners.  We  can  well  afford   the

adjustment, Sir, provided the rate of inflation  is

higher in the advanced countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also applaud the substantial allocation to

Social  Services -- an increase of almost  50  per

cent.  In  particular, the accelerated Housing  and

Development Board programme will benefit the lower-income group. Housing constitutes a major pillar of

social   stability.   Besides,   improved   housing

conditions  and better recreational facilities  for

the working class will contribute substantially not

only   to   their  stability  but  also  to   their

productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the move by Government to provide

tax   reliefs  for  the  support  of  parents   and

grandparents. However, as the last but one  speaker

said,  the  relief  should be extended  to  include

those  parents and grandparents who are not  living

with  the claimant. Extended families living  under

one  roof, Sir, have become impractical in one  and

two-room flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, in the longer run, I believe three

major   areas   need   attention.   Firstly,   real

development  would  require  that  our   industries

upgrade  or acquire higher technology. On  the  one

hand,  with  rising wage costs and  the  increasing

drive    of    other   developing   countries    to

industrialise,  our low technology industries  will

face stiff competition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



On  the  other hand, it  is  difficult  to

induce   the   middle-   and   higher-technology

industries  to come out here as these  are  not  so

pressed by escalating production costs in their own

countries.  I note with concern the figures  quoted

by   the  Minister.  As  he  stated,  manufacturing

investment  commitments fell from $716  million  in

1971 to $252 million last year. This, Sir, reflects

the difficulties I have mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I also welcome the setting up of the

Industrial  Training  Board.  Together   with   its

activities   to   encourage   the   formation   and

transmission  of  skills for our workers,  enabling

them  to  be more productive with a higher standard

of  living, Government should also look closely  at

the training of executive, managerial and marketing

personnel,  especially in the  foreign  firms.  For

without    the    development   of    skills    and

organisational  know-how, we  shall  never  achieve

real  development.  Rapid  development  also  makes

skills  obsolete fast; hence in the years ahead  we

would   have   to  have  a  number  of  re-training

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as we develop rapidly, we shall have to

face  problems  of  phasing  out  the  cottage-type

industries.  As  long as land is  available,  these

industries can be, and are, re-sited. However,  the

process  must  end inevitably for we  have  limited

space.  Government would need to study the problems

of  these  industries, balancing  equity  with  the

efficiency needs of our country. Perhaps  a  system

of outright subsidy can be implemented to encourage

change  to  more desirable trades before  costs  of

production  push them out. For the  low  technology

industries, like textiles and electronic  circuitry

assembly, the safety valve against the shortage  of

labour  and rising wage cost may be to employ  more

married  women.  Factories  can  be  more  suitably

located  in housing estates and more creches  built

to help working mothers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with these observations, I give

my  full  support  to  the  Government's  financial

policy as outlined by the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I welcome the Budget Statement  made

by  the  Minister  for Finance.  According  to  the

Minister,  our  economic growth rate  in  the  past

financial  year  was 13 per cent and  our  external

trade  growth  rate was 11.7 per  cent.  Judged  by

international  standards, it  is  very  creditable.

Sir,  this fine economic performance reminds me  of

the time when we separated from Malaysia and of the

time  in  1971  when we were faced  also  with  the

problems  of  British military  withdrawal.  During

those   times,   we   were  faced   with   economic

difficulties. But with the co-operative effort, the

diligence  and  patriotism of our  workers  coupled

with  the co-operation of the employer, we  managed

to overcome our economic problems and difficulties.

Instead  we were able to achieve economic  progress

and peaceful industrialisation. In spite of the low

wages  there  were  very  few  industrial  disputes

originating from the workers, resulting in  a  more

stable  economic  situation. Our  present  economic

progress  and  achievements have been  due  to  the

efforts and contributions of people of all walks of

life,  but  the  performance and  attitude  of  our

workers,  in  particular in the past, should  merit

particular mention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Budget Statement, the Minister

announced  that  there  will  be  tax  reliefs  for

taxpayers'  dependent  parents,  grandparents,  and

handicapped children. This is very encouraging. The

fact that the Government can do this is evident  of

our   economic   progress  and   the   Government's

understanding  of our unique Asian  family  system.

Here,  I  would  like to advance a suggestion  that

since  we  may  have a more rosy prospect  for  our

future  economy  in view of our present  favourable

economic progress and national effort, the  quantum

of  tax  reliefs  should also be increased  in  the

coming  financial year in respect of the  taxpayer,

his  wife,  and the first and second children.  The

present  tax relief measures (for taxpayer: $2,000;

earned income: $1,000 maximum; wife: $1,000; 1st



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



child:  $750; 2nd child: $500) were implemented  in

1961.  At  the moment our economy and  standard  of

living  are  much  better than those  of  1961.  So

comparing  the present economic situation  and  per

capita  income with those of 1961, it is  necessary

that  we  increase the quantum of tax  reliefs  for

personal income, earned income, wife, and  for  the

first  and  second children. This  is  particularly

necessary in view of the fact that in recent  years

the  Government  is  encouraging  the  raising   of

quality  of  our citizens and promoting  the  small

family system, which is a very correct policy.  So,

in  order  to match this policy, we must  give  the

first and second children more tax reliefs as  this

will  have a great promotive effect on Government's

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years, we have achieved economic

progress  and brought about prosperity and material

enjoyment  for our people. But, on the other  hand,

there  is  also a fact which we must pay  attention

to,  that  is, there is a trend for some people  to

pay  more  attention  to money gains  and  material

enjoyment.  In  addition  to  this,  there  is  the

intrusion of decadent Western culture. As a result,

some  people go for a life of pleasure,  easy-going

and  living  a  more decadent way of life,  heading

towards  hedonism.  This  is  very  dangerous   and

detrimental  to  our  nation  building  and  higher

performance,  because all the present  achievements

have  been  brought about by the good qualities  of

our   people,  their  diligence,  thriftiness,  and

through  their patriotic efforts and so on.  So  we

must  not  let  all  these deleterious  effects  to

corrode  the  healthy spiritual  condition  of  our

people.  Otherwise, we will be at a great loss  and

the  country  will also suffer. In order  to  avoid

this,   I   hope   the  Government  will,   besides

developing  the  economy,  pay  attention  to   the

inculcation in our people of a healthy attitude  of

life.   This  can  be  achieved  through   cultural

education  and  activities  and  by  providing  the

people with the necessary healthy mental pabulum in

order to enable them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



to  create  and enjoy a healthier and fuller  life,

both  as an individual and as a group. In order  to

achieve the above objectives, the Government should

systematically promote various healthy cultural and

educational  activities and  further  organize  and

liaise with community cultural organizations.



<br><br>3.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

in  support of the motion standing in the  name  of

the  Minister for Finance. In so doing, may I  also

be  allowed  to express my thanks to him  for  that

portion  of his Budget Statement delivered in  this

House  On  26th February, 1973. We have the  unique

advantage  this year of first reading a portion  of

the  Financial Policy Statement in the local press,

and  later  listen to the remaining  instalment  in

this  Chamber. Sir, the result of and the  reaction

to  this unprecedented arrangement may not be quite

the  same  as what the hon. Minister had  expected,

but  I  find  this  innovation  rather  refreshing,

because  the  conventional  procedure  would   have

involved  the hon. Minister in what would otherwise

be  a  laborious  exercise in  this  Chamber;  hon.

Members will then read about it in the local  press

the  following day, I hope without distortion,  and

finally,  dwell  further into the verbatim  report,

yet another day later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever uncomplimentary thoughts hon.

Members  might think aloud in this House  over  the

new arrangement, I think their grouses ought to  be

more  than  submerged  by  the  very  tranquilising

Statement, including that portion published in  the

press, of course. That no new tax was introduced is

welcome,  and  the  new  tax  reliefs  are   indeed

consoling,  in  that it goes to prove  that  humane

gestures   are   still  possible   when   financial

consideration permits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now invite hon. Members' attention to

the  penultimate paragraph of that portion  of  the

Minister's  Statement in this Chamber-I  think  the

distinction here is necessary for hon. Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



might  mistakenly refer to the other  portion

published  in the press in advance. As one  of  the

many people directly concerned with the climate  of

labour-management  relationship  in  the  Republic,

albeit for only a short period of time in my  case,

I  find  it  fitting that the Minister devoted  his

last comments to acknowledging the importance of co-operation and collaboration between management  and

labour,   for,  given  all  the  other  ingredients

required  to  maintain and accelerate our  economic

growth,  it is, in the final and crucial  analysis,

the  understanding  between management  and  labour

that holds the path to success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estimates for FY 1973-74 provide for 77 new

posts as against the deletion of two in respect  of

the  Ministry  of  Labour. These  new  appointments

represent  roughly  30  per cent  increase  to  the

overall staffing position in the Ministry, a fairly

high figure percentage-wise, but unfortunately this

percentage  is derived from an already small  base.

Last  year  we had, from the Minister down  to  the

peon,  267 posts. As the Minister for Education  is

so  fond of quipping in the Members' Room, he  said

that  one  of  his departments is  larger  than  my

Ministry.  Unfortunately,  we  do  not   count   on

building an empire. We are more dependent on -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Quality!



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> - quality of work. I do not

think I should burden the House further as to  what

transpired in the Members' Room. May I be permitted

to  proceed?  Of the new posts, the  net  increase,

really,  is  only 49. It is because 18  posts  were

transferred from the Public Health Division to form

the  new  Industrial  Health Unit  which  was  also

successful in securing another 10 of the new  posts

provided,  thus making a total of 28  in  this  new

Unit.  The Industrial Health Unit is a new  section

performing   duties,  which   hitherto,   was   the

responsibility  of the Ministry of  Health.  Hence,

the net effective increase is, as I have mentioned,

only 49 or about 20 per cent. Of these,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



25  are assigned to the Ministry's headquarters, 15

for  the  expanded Statistics and Research Section,

five  for  the Work Permit Office, two allotted  to

Industrial  Relations Unit and the  remaining  two,

both  of  whom are not field officers which  we  so

badly need, to the Factory Inspectorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, the existing number of established

posts  in both the Factory and Labour Inspectorates

are  grossly inadequate. The situation  is  further

aggravated  as  both  the Inspectorates  have  been

operating below the establishment strength for many

years  now.  With  a  rapidly expanding  industrial

sector, and the many new commercial establishments,

it  has  been  extremely hard-pressed for  the  two

short-handed  sections in having to cope  with  the

increasing   workload.  The  officers   have   been

stretched to the limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of illustration, may I enlighten

the House with some statistics as an indication  of

the  workload that these two sections have to bear.

The  Factory Inspectorate, operating with a reduced

capacity,  conducted a total of 11,076  inspections

during  1972, close to doubling the previous year's

figure  of  6,368. The Inspectorate had stepped  up

its   enforcement  action  on  industrial   safety,

resulting  in a total of 234 prosecution  cases  in

court as against only 52 in 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Inspectorate is in no happier

situation  as  far as personnel is  concerned.  Its

present  establishment  strength  of  20  has  been

stagnant  for  the  last decade. Despite  this,  it

carried out 6,425 inspections, an increase of 2,248

over 1971. Prosecutions in court trebled from 33 to

100  cases.  It must be pointed out that  with  the

very  limited  personnel, enforcement actions  will

have  to  be sufficiently stringent to serve  as  a

deterrent  not  only to the defaulting  party,  but

also  as  a  reminder to others.  The  Ministry  is

conscious of the fact that legal action has  always

been our last resort, and in most cases unpopular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety and health campaign organised by the

Ministry last year was intended as a means of  mass

education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



and  persuasion,  but regrettably  this  method  of

persuasion  has not proved sufficiently  effective.

The   total  number  of  accidents  in   both   the

industrial  and other sectors rose to  a  new  high

figure of 10,675 in 1972, of which 186 were fatal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accidents do not happen, they are caused; as

Members  will  agree. In some of  the  factories  I

visited,  the working environment left much  to  be

desired. In a night visit to one factory.  I  found

no  less than half a dozen accident traps,  one  of

which   is  deadly.  There  are  many  causes   for

accidents  -  poor housekeeping in  the  production

areas,  inadequate safety precaution and equipment,

tidak-apa  attitude  of the  management,  and  most

important, ignorance, negligence, carelessness  and

even   defiance   on  the  part  of   the   workers

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glaring example of the combination of these

factors  can  be seen in the building  construction

industry.  Many  of  the accidents  which  occurred

could have been prevented. It is a common sight  to

see   workers  precariously  clinging  on  to   the

scaffolding,  instead  of using  the  safety  belts

provided. For these acts of sheer defiance, I  hope

the  workers will realise that they may have to pay

very dearly in the end, even with their lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will appreciate that the enforcement

action  in  this  particular respect  is  extremely

difficult,  in  view  of  the  environment  at  the

construction  sites. Compliance is only  effective,

for  as long as the Ministry's enforcement officers

are  present. Further, due to the shortage of  this

category of workers, any discipline imposed by  the

more   enlightened   and  the  more   conscientious

contractors  or  site overseers are  futile,  as  a

worker can easily down tools in protest, then  walk

across to the adjacent site and find himself a  job

almost immediately. Perhaps, a solution might  well

be the formation of a co-ordinating body comprising

those   parties   concerned,  such  as   engineers,

contractors and developers, to iron out  a  unified

standard or code of practice to be adopted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



by all, so that it will prove to the defaulting

workers that it does not pay to play merry-go-round

or to shift around from site to site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is, in the meanwhile, considering

revising  the  existing regulations concerning  the

issue  of licences for building operations, with  a

view  to  incorporating more stringent measures  to

compel compliance with the safety standards. But  I

must  warn that the Ministry shall not hesitate  to

invoke punitive measures and actions against  those

recalcitrant defaulters. At least one  licence  for

work   at   a  construction  site  was  immediately

cancelled when found to have been lacking in safety

standards.  The licence was reinstated  later  only

after  a  written assurance was made to the  effect

that there would be full compliance with the safety

regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, many of the accidents could have been

prevented had there been proper planning and layout

of  the factory buildings concerned. I am given  to

understand  that plans for factory  buildings  were

only  submitted  to the relevant authorities  since

October  last year, not earlier. Certain  dangerous

production   processes,  which  can   trigger   off

accidents,  were  not separated  or  isolated,  and

sufficient  precautions were not  taken  to  ensure

safety.   In   some  factories,  the  fire-fighting

equipment provided were nothing more than ornaments

merely   for  the  purpose  of  satisfying  certain

regulations  of  the authorities. In  an  interview

with  a  group of workers in a certain  factory,  I

found  that,  to  my  dismay, none  of  them  could

operate   the   fire   extinguisher   which    was,

incidentally,  strategically hung at its  location.

In  some factories, the nozzles, which should  have

been attached to the hose-reel, were removed by the

management and kept under lock and key for fear  of

theft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a rather frustrating experience during a

visit to a factory. I witnessed a number of workers

flushing the floor with jets of water from a  hose-reel which was installed solely for the purpose  of

fire-fighting.  Shortly  after,  my  attention  was

drawn to a thick and voluminous

black   smoke  emitting  some  distance  away.   On

enquiry, I was told that a fire broke out  at  that

moment in a nearby factory. On rushing over to  the

fire-site,  I was confronted by a rather hysterical

plant  chemist  who  complained that  although  the

workers  did try to operate a hose-reel, there  was

no  water at all. Nobody knew where or how to  turn

on the water supply!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must apologise to the House for having to

burden  hon.  Members  with these  rather  detailed

accounts.  I only hope to reiterate the point  that

had  everybody  taken a little  more  interest  and

concern,  it  would have been a very  much  happier

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new influx of foreign workers swelling

the  ranks  of our industrial workers, we  must  be

conscious  of the fact that these foreign  workers,

inasmuch  as  they  contribute  positively  to  our

economic well-being, are not properly inducted into

our  philosophy of life, or orientated to  the  new

system  of  work. We will have to carry them  along

with  us  in  the same pace and discipline  in  our

march towards our goal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I say that our strife for a better

living  need  not be accompanied by  pain,  sorrow,

miseries  and sufferings of those who  pioneer  the

efforts.



<br><br>3.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

much  has  been  said  with regard  to  the  Budget

Statement  by  the  Minister  for  Finance,  and  I

appreciate  the depth of feeling expressed  on  the

many  issues. To my mind, Sir, the Budget Statement

was  tolerable; tolerable because it was  good  for

some but a vacuum for those who need most.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe it was Oscar Wilde who said that

"discontent is the first step in the progress of  a

mind  or  a  nation". I can assure you,  Sir,  that

after  waiting  for  more  than  15  years  for  an

egalitarian society, the lower income strata of our

Singapore  society  is  becoming  well  and   truly

discontented. It would seem that from the moment of

the  original proposition of egality, so many years

ago,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



men  in power and authority have developed the fine

art  of  paying lip-service to an ideal which  they

support in theory but rarely in practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A close scrutiny on price movements of all

commodities shows a clear rising trend  of  between

15  to  20  per  cent  on the  average.  This  most

certainly will affect the lower income groups  more

than  the others. It is disappointing to note  that

the  Minister  has taken no steps to  relieve  this

situation.  The rising trend continues, and  action

must be taken to ensure that, in fact, it will  not

continue and stifle any possibility of a reasonable

living  by  these people. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  view

with  concern  that  despite  the  efforts  of  the

Consumers' Association of Singapore, pay-rises  won

over  the  past  few  years by  the  NTUC  and  its

affiliates have been diminishing more and  more  in

value  because of the consistent rise  in  consumer

items.  CASE  recognises the need for  constructive

action  and calls upon the Government to  alleviate

the  heavy  burden  on workers, especially  in  the

lower income brackets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, any policy which is designed to assist

the  lower-paid worker must attack the problem from

a  number  of different directions, but  of  course

always  aiming  towards one common objective;  help

for  the  lower-paid. But help for  the  lower-paid

would mean that those who are more highly paid will

need  to pay more. I do not think it would be right

to  pretend that it is solely a question  of  being

kind to the lower paid. There may be a price to  be

paid,  and  this should be borne by those  who  can

afford  to  bear  it.  In these  times  of  growing

interdependence and complexity within  our  economy

it  is  right,  certainly  in  my  view,  that  the

Government should regard a fairer price  system  as

part  of  the  process of regulation  and  control,

which  is  its responsibility. The Government  must

seek  changes in the system which will  favour  the

weakest  among  us.  The  basic  principle  of  our

Government  must  be  to protect  and  promote  the

interests of the underprivileged in our society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumers' Association of Singapore is

painfully  aware of the increase  in  cost  to  the

consumer of a wide variety of goods and services, a

reduction in our living standards, and once again a

burden on those less able to bear it. CASE is doing

its  utmost to make life bearable for the consumer,

but   Government  is  committed   to   assist.   In

assisting,   the   Government  is  fulfilling   its

responsibility to the citizens of our land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no apparent solution as to how to beat

the  price hikes. Rigid control is not the  answer,

although in certain instances, it may be. Sir,  the

answer  lies  in education and subsidies:  consumer

education   by   organisations   like   CASE,   and

Government  subsidies for essential commodities  to

cushion the pockets of the consumers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, again the Minister for Finance

burdens  the lower-income workers by ignoring  them

under  the  tax  policy and changes in  the  Annual

Budget  Statement. What relief does a  worker,  who

earns  $3,000 or less a year, obtain if he supports

dependent  parents,  grandparents  and  handicapped

children?  Why  is  the  Government  widening   the

disparity that at present exists in our society  by

not   compensating  these  people?   I   urge   the

Government  to  rethink  its  policies   with   the

objective  of  substantially  narrowing   the   gap

between the haves and have-nots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, the lower-paid workers are

painfully  disturbed  by the rapidly  deteriorating

bus  transport system. They are bounced around  and

harassed  by  vehicles that constantly break  down,

leaving    them    stranded   on    the    streets,

apprehensively watching full busloads pass by  them

while  waiting for an empty bus. I do believe  that

the  Minister  for Finance should  have  considered

this most urgent requirement of public transport in

his Annual Budget Statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suppose in his anxiety to mechanise and

improve  work methods for higher growth rates,  the

Minister for Finance in his Annual Budget Statement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



did  not consider the still rising  trend  of

accidents   in   industry.  No   realistic   budget

provisions have been made. Notice, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that   here   again  the  lower-paid  workers   are

penalised. Occupational health and safety  must  be

stressed due to the constant increase in the number

of  industrial  workers and  the  upward  trend  in

industrial accidents. Government functions in  this

field should include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the education of the workers in occupational

health and safety;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) constant vigilance to ensure that progressive

techniques  of  guarding  of  machinery,  etc, be

employed to safeguard the workers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) provision for better legislation and stricter

enforcement; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the creation of enthusiasm among workers and

employers  alike in high standards of  occupational

health  and safety as a direct contribution towards

productivity and prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should also be consideration for pre-employment medical examination of workers, testing

their  fitness  for  employment,  as  an  essential

feature  of any form of preventive action  designed

to  protect their physical and mental health.  This

medical examination should be conducted with a view

to  adapting the worker to his work and at the same

time  to preventing any deterioration in his health

that might be connected with his job. Whether it is

directed  towards vocational selection  or  towards

appropriate  guidance, the aim of  fitness  testing

should be to seek a balance between the man and his

work  in  order  to provide better protection  with

less strain on the worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fitness of a worker can correspond to only

one phase in the relationship between his state  of

health  and  his  work, both of  which  are  highly

subject  to  change, any assessment of fitness  for

employment  is constantly subject to review;  hence

the need for periodic medical examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of rehabilitation of injured or sick

workers  should  also  be  the  business   of   the

Government. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



World   Health   Organisation   in   1968   defines

"rehabilitation" as "the combined and  co-ordinated

use  of medical, social, educational and vocational

measures  for training or retraining the individual

to   the   highest  possible  level  of  functional

ability."  Our sick and injured workers  when  well

again  need  to be of use to the society  they  are

living  in, and the Government should make  efforts

to provide them with this need.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am glad that  the  Minister  for

Finance  has given us another painless  Budget.  In

this  new  Budget,  there  are  no  new  taxes   or

increased  taxation. On the contrary, the  Minister

even  announced seven items of tax reliefs. We  all

know  that  Singapore  is a small  country  without

natural  resources and quite heavily populated.  It

is  also  in  a turbulent region. In spite  of  all

this,   we  have  made  achievements,  and  it   is

something  that we should be proud of.  Of  course,

all  these  achievements are  attributable  to  the

enlightened  leadership, the  co-operation  between

the  Government and the people to ensure that these

hard-earned achievements will continue to grow.  We

must  also  enhance  our  concerted  efforts,  work

harder  to ensure that we have a better future  for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, economic development is a matter of great

concern   to   every   developing   country.    The

formulation and implementation of economic policies

determines  the success or failure  of  a  national

economy,  which in turn will affect the future  and

the destiny of a people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget statement, an extensive and

comprehensive review has been made of  the  economy

of  Singapore. The Minister for Finance pointed out

that  there was a growth rate of the GNP of 13  per

cent last year against an annual growth rate target

of  15 per cent. He pointed out that this shortfall

of  2  per cent was the result of external  events,

the international monetary crisis, and the internal

factor, i.e, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



completion   of   the  British  military   pullout.

Although  we  can  do  nothing about  the  external

factors,  something can be done about the  internal

factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has also pointed

out  in  his Budget statement that the contribution

to   total  GDP  by  the  manufacturing  industries

accounted for 23.5 per cent in 1972, an increase of

20.1 per cent compared with 25 per cent in 1971 and

27.5  per  cent in 1970. The growth  rate  has,  in

fact,  slowed down. The Minister also  pointed  out

that   this  was  because  of  stagnation  in   the

investment    of    petroleum    industries     and

shipbuilding.  In spite of all this,  he  does  not

show  any  pessimism over these two  industries.  I

would  like  to  quote  from the  Budget  Statement

[Hansard, Vol 32, No. 10, col. 466]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For these two industries our locational

advantage   will   continue   to   favour   maximum

development. The future of Singapore is  correlated

to   its   being   considered  an  ideal   offshore

manufacturing  base for multi-nationals  and  their

subsidiaries. In our overseas investment promotion,

the  Economic  Development  Board  (EDB)  will  not

overlook   the   smaller  but  no  less   important

manufacturing firms. To encourage them to diversify

their activities to Singapore, my Ministry will  be

prepared  to invest equity up to 50 per cent,  with

the  option  for  them to buy  back  a  substantial

portion  later. The EDB will identify  these  firms

and the Development Bank of Singapore Limited (DBS)

will manage our investments. A fund of $100 million

will  be  provided for this purpose to serve  as  a

catalyst   to  use  to  best  advantage  our   vast

expenditure on training.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the short supply of trained personnel,

there  has  been a slowdown in our high  technology

industries. On this matter, the Minister said [col.

467]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government will continue to allocate a large

part of its resources to technical education. Since

1962,  and  more  actively  in  recent  years,  the

Government  through the Economic Development  Board

has  been  engaged in a multiple-programme approach

to    develop   industrial   training   in   modern

manufacturing   skills.  Besides   the   Industrial

Development  Scholarship Scheme, we  now  have  the

Overseas  Training  Programme, the  Joint  Training

Programme,  the Apprenticeship Training Scheme  and

the   Training  Subsidy  Scheme  for  sophisticated

industries.   The  Government  on  its   part   has

earmarked $8.7 million for industrial training  for

the next financial year.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



I  endorse  this approach of the Government  as  it

aims to enhance and to diversify our industrial and

technological  skills, and  at  the  same  time  to

provide  opportunities for our  people  to  acquire

skill  and industrial training. Under this  policy,

the  EDB  will play a very important role  although

there was some blunder previously. Henceforth,  the

EDB  must pay special attention and exercise  great

caution so that the people will not be let down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The era of industrial revolution first began in

Europe.  It  is therefore quite natural that  there

are  technological and scientific  advancements  in

Europe and America. It goes without saying that  we

have  to learn from their experience and expertise.

However,   we  should  not  overlook  the  existing

industrialised  countries in  our  region,  because

their   technology  is  not  entirely  lacking   in

development for us to learn. We need not go too far

away  to  learn  when we have some good  neighbours

from  whom we could learn. I hope that the EDB will

be  able  to  identify these industries and  firms,

instead of taking the wrong concept that "the  moon

shines brighter in foreign countries". There should

not be any discrimination between local and foreign

investors. I can quote a case. There was a  visitor

from  Euro-America and he was well received at  the

airport and taken to the hotel by officials of  the

EDB.  He was treated as a guest of honour.  On  the

other  hand,  a  prospective  investor  from   this

region,  with  an earning power in  terms  of  $100

million, requested to see senior EDB officials, but

he  was turned down. When it was realised that this

prospective  investor,  who  was  a  man  of   high

potential,  was  about to leave for a  neighbouring

country, the EDB then sent men out to get in  touch

with him. This idea of "foreign worship" should  be

discarded.  We  should give fair treatment  to  all

genuine investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, investors from advanced countries who

come  to Singapore with the intention of exploiting

our  facilities for their own selfish  ends  should

not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



welcomed. Some of these selfish investors had  been

given  the  best  terms  for  their  investment  in

exchange  for the technological training that  they

could  give to our technical personnel.  But  after

several  years, facts have shown that we  have  not

reaped  the  expected benefits from such investors.

As   regards   overseas  training  schemes,   joint

training  schemes and so on, what are the  criteria

for  such  agreements, and what  are  the  expenses

involved? How many people have benefited from these

training schemes, and what are the results of their

training? What is the price that we have  paid  for

all  this?  Is it justifiable? Although  we  are  a

developing  country, and needing  foreign  aid,  we

must  realise  that such aid must be given  on  the

basis  of mutual benefit. We should not allow  lop-sided  co-operation. We must ensure that the  money

from our people are spent wisely on the development

of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, we should also pay adequate

attention  to the existing industries in Singapore.

We should give them whatever aid that is necessary,

and  also  to  the ancillary industries  which  are

useful.  It  is  only with such encouragement  that

there can be adequate co-operation, better division

of  work and full exploitation of resources between

local industries and their ancillaries to make them

the mainstays of our industries, and be competitive

in international markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An enlightened leadership, political stability,

and a progressive society with a hardworking people

have  already  created great confidence  among  the

industrialists of many countries. We must take full

advantage  of this climate of confidence  to  study

the  changes and trends prevailing in international

markets.  Although  we have made  mistakes  in  the

past, we should not continue to make such mistakes.

We  must  be  extra  cautious  in  our  development

planning  and its effective implementation.  It  is

only  then that we can hope to be able to reap  the

desired  objectives and benefits in  the  years  to

come.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one

of the magical ingredients that helped Singapore to

make   rapid  economic  progress  is  the  vigorous

promotion  of  wise economic, social and  political

policies,   which  have  brought  about   political

stability,  racial harmony, industrial  advancement

and  a secure livelihood for the people as we  have

witnessed  today.  Just  over  a  decade   ago,   a

turbulent    political   situation   with    racial

animosity,  industrial unrest and mass unemployment

was  the  order  of  the day.  However,  under  the

dynamic  leadership of the present  Government  and

with  the  unanimous  support of  the  people,  our

Republic has made significant improvements  in  the

various fields. We should be proud of ourselves  to

belong to a nation with such great promise for  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, the world is

rapidly changing and it appears difficult to  grasp

with  certainty  the  way  the  world  changes  and

develops.  But what one can predict is  that  peace

will triumph over war. Peace and righteousness will

be credibly extended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once China played the role of an extremist in

world drama; now she approaches her foreign affairs

with  a  moderate  attitude. This  trend  in  world

affairs is favourable to our foreign policy of non-alignment.  Our  foreign policy  is  based  on  the

principle  of "making as few enemies  but  as  many

friends  as  possible." By this principle,  we  are

able  to  befriend more and more countries and  our

national prestige is growing day by day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can forecast that there will be increased

economic  involvement by China in South-east  Asian

countries.   Therefore,   we   should   take   this

opportunity  to  increase  trade  between  the  two

countries   by  organising  more  and  more   trade

missions to China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, trade has become universally

necessary  for progress. It is a melting  pot  into

which  distance and differences, self-interest  and

even  mutual dislike are being tossed and remoulded

into mutual beneficial business arrangements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



Evidence   of   this   mutual   beneficial

arrangement  is  seen  in the  trading  partnership

which  comes  into being between erstwhile  enemies

and  between capitalists and communists. Therefore,

there  should  be  even  more  beneficial  business

arrangements  between Singapore and  China,  and  I

quote the Minister for Finance [col. 450]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With the better opening up of China to

international trade, there is the possibility  that

Singapore  can  serve as a base for  multi-national

firms   for  manufacture  and  exports  to   China.

Conversely,  China  may  find  Singapore  a  useful

outlet for its products.'



<br><br>I am in full agreement with the Minister that there

will  be  greater  economic,  social  and  cultural

involvement   by   China  with   South-east   Asian

countries,  and  we should take  advantage  of  the

geographical   position  of  Singapore   which   is

situated in the centre of the trade routes  between

the East and the West.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 70's trade and industries will become more

competitive  and complex, and there is  a  need  to

step  up our exports and to improve the quality  of

our  manufactured  goods.  We  will  not  be  in  a

position  to  meet  this challenge  to  export  our

manufactured  goods and other cargoes economically,

unless  we  can reduce freight charges and  in  the

meantime increase the number of our own ocean-going

vessels.  The need for increasing and strengthening

our  merchant fleet has become very evident and  it

is  a  step in the right direction for the Minister

for Finance to have given a $50 million loan to the

Neptune  Orient  Lines  for the  purchase  of  more

ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the income tax relief, the

rates  of income tax and tax relief in our  country

are  virtually the same as those of ten years  ago.

The personal reliefs for the tax-payer and his wife

remains   at   $2,000   and  $1,000   respectively,

notwithstanding the well-known fact that  commodity

prices and the cost of living have all gone up over

the  past ten years. In these circumstances,  there

should be a corresponding increase in personal  tax

reliefs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new tax relief was announced by the Finance

Minister  in  his  Budget  speech.  Taxpayers   who

support their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



aged  parents or grandparents can now claim  a  tax

relief  of  $300  per person. In my  opinion,  this

amount  is  inadequate. The people of  our  country

bear   the  responsibility  of  maintaining   their

parents,  irrespective of whether they are Chinese,

Malays   or   Indians.  This  is   their   ethnical

tradition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our income tax system, though

based  on the principles of the British system,  is

quite  different  from it. The  British  Government

allows  a  wide scope of tax relief for maintaining

close relatives. It is not confined only to parents

but  is extended to cover other close relatives  as

well.  The tax relief, however, is based on certain

principles  set  out  by the government.  By  these

principles, tax relief is only allowed  in  respect

of  dependent relatives who are physically weak, in

old  age,  widows  or divorcees without  their  own

income or the means to support themselves. This  is

a  logical principle we must follow. I am, however,

of  the opinion that the amount of relief should he

increased  to $750 per dependent parent,  making  a

total  of  $1,500 for two dependent  parents.  This

increase  is reasonable and will hardly affect  the

revenue.  Not all taxpayers have dependent  parents

to  support.  Some  of  their  parents  might  have

already passed away while others may have means  to

support themselves, thus leaving a small number  of

taxpayers who qualify for this tax relief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to say

something  about government-private joint  ventures

in  industrial development. I trust that  all  hon.

Members  are  aware  that  it  is  mainly  due   to

Singapore's  excellent geographical  location,  the

hard work of its people and the wise leadership  of

its   government,  that  Singapore,  as  a  country

lacking  in  natural resources  such  as  gold  and

silver,   has   been  able  to  develop   into   an

economically strong and prosperous country within a

short  period of a few years. On this basis, it  is

worthwhile  for  us to encourage government-private

joint  ventures in industrial development in  order

to further consolidate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



social  construction and welfare services  in

the  State.  This  is  not only  a  proper  way  of

nurturing  the  national  capitalists  through  the

business  channel, but also serves  to  enrich  the

coffers of the State from the profits derived  from

the  joint  ventures which contribute immensely  to

social  welfare projects. Although it will  be  too

naive to speak of the doctrine "From each according

to his ability, and to each according to his needs"

at   the   present  moment,  nevertheless,   as   a

democratic  country  it is fitting  that  Singapore

should be developed into a welfare State, where the

helpless aged and those born handicapped are  taken

care of. By investing in some major industries, the

Government will be able to earn large sums of money

annually for its various welfare projects  as  well

as helping these industries to improve and succeed.

It   will  contribute  immensely  towards  revenue,

social  construction,  the  nurturing  of  national

capitalists  and the welfare of the  people.  Since

this  one  single  move will serve  several  useful

purposes, why not do it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while supporting the Government's financial

policy   as   presented  in  the  Budget,   may   I

congratulate  the  Minister  for  Finance  who  has

acquitted  himself creditably, and may I also  hope

he  will  remain in the same Ministry  for  a  long

period   to  present  us  next  year  with  another

painless budget which will continue to reflect  his

ability  to  take  the  nation  along  the  highway

towards economic progress.



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampung Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Budget Speech on the

country is stable; the administration is efficient.

With all the favourable conditions created for  the

foreign investors and due to the difficulties faced

by other developing countries such as rising labour

costs  and inflation, these investors have come  to

Singapore  to  establish  their  factories.  As   a

result,  the Jurong industrial estate has become  a

great  industrial centre. Sir, with the  successful

result  of industrialisation and building industry,

our growth rate over the last six years has reached

more  than  10 per cent every year. This is  indeed

praiseworthy and deserves our acclaim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years the Government has

acquired land for development purposes, causing the

available land for residential use to decrease.  We

have  built more and more housing estates, but  the

demand  for Housing Board flats is ever-increasing.

Sir,  although our per capita income is $3,680  per

annum, the rising cost of living, especially in the

rising prices of property and land, has caused many

more people in the middle income group to apply for

Housing  Board fiats. The Government  is  acquiring

land for its urban renewal programmes, while owners

of  private  properties are  recovering  their  old

buildings  in order to demolish them and erect  new

high-rise buildings so as to get more profits. This

has  resulted in a greater number of the middle and

lower income groups living in very congested areas.

The  houses are crowded and are small and dark with

poor  amenities. From the inside, you  cannot  tell

the  day  from the night. You can hear the children

playing  and the groans and moans of old  folks  in

these  houses. Sir, these people who live  in  such

horrid  conditions  are very uncertain  about  what

sort  of  future  their children  will  have,  even

though  they  can  see all the beautiful  buildings

around them. We must build more low-cost housing to

improve the living conditions of our people. It  is

only  through  living  under reasonable  conditions

that we can cultivate the right concept of life and

proper national consciousness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



on  the  part  of  our people. We  should  not,  in

striving for economic prosperity, neglect those who

live in poverty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the home-ownership scheme,

arrangements have been made for people  to  utilise

their  Central  Provident Fund contributions  as  a

deposit payment for Housing Board flats, which  are

now  better designed. This is indeed a move in  the

right  direction  because, with  this  arrangement,

people  will feel more secure and happy  that  they

can  have a spot of their own on our little island.

But  one  of the conditions of this arrangement  is

that the applicant must pay 20 per cent of the cost

as  a  deposit. Unfortunately, people like hawkers,

taxi  drivers, odd job labourers, who do  not  have

any  regular employment, do not contribute  towards

the  CPF  and  therefore they  will  not  be  in  a

position  to  pay  their 20 per  cent  deposit  for

Housing Board fiats. The amount of deposit may only

be  $1,000  or $2,000, but it is simply beyond  the

reach  of these people. They can only hope to  rent

the  flats.  As we all know, the waiting  list  for

renting  of flats is much longer than that for  the

purchase  of flats. Mr Speaker, Sir, when they  see

their  neighbours move into their  newly  purchased

flats, they are filled with remorse and regret  and

a  painful  feeling.  I hope  the  Government  will

consider their plight and rectify this situation by

exempting them from paying the 20 per cent deposit,

so  that  they may also apply for the  purchase  of

Housing Board flats and they should be given longer

terms of monthly repayment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few months, prices of land and

property have been escalating. Many people  in  the

middle  class are in a tight spot. Terrace  houses,

which  used  to cost $30,000 to $40,000,  now  cost

between  $80,000 and $90,000. These  people  simply

cannot afford such a high price. They cannot  apply

for Housing Board flats because the combined family

income  exceeds $1,500 per month. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

increasing the salaries of Government servants  and

for the people is a step in the right direction  at

the right time. However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



it  is over-simplifying the issue to  assume

that  by doing this they will not go to the private

sector.  We know the Housing Board and the Port  of

Singapore    Authority   are   providing    housing

accommodation  for their staff,  and  I  hope  that

other   statutory   bodies   and   all   Government

departments will do likewise to provide housing for

their  employees, as this is more necessary than  a

salary increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps we have been devoting our full

attention  to industrialisation, urban renewal  and

economic growth, so much so that we have overlooked

the  development of our cultural and social values.

We  are becoming more and more capitalistic in  our

outlook and in our way of life. Many of us seem  to

spend all our waking moments either in making  more

money or indulging in various activities which  are

non-productive and decadent. All these will  go  to

loosen  our  social and moral fabric  and  cause  a

lowering  of our social discipline. As we can  see,

there  are  many  restaurants, night-clubs,  coffee

houses, etc, which have many singers from overseas.

All these are female gold diggers in disguise. They

are  here to earn our money and to weaken the  will

of  our young people. Sir, in the last few years we

have    seen   many   talent-time   contests   over

television, and in our various community centres we

have  singing contests. But it is very rare  indeed

to see winners of these contests appearing in these

grand shows. What we see on the TV are merely  gold

diggers   from  abroad  in  the  form  of  gorgeous

females.  This  is an abnormal development  of  our

society.   We   must   strive   to   increase   our

productivity  and  economic  growth.  We  encourage

foreign capital and foreign investors to come in to

set  up factories. We also welcome specialists  and

technical  personnel from abroad.  But  we  do  not

welcome  these  merry-land  females  who  cause  an

obstruction in our progress and a reduction in  our

foreign exchange. Sir, we must not allow an  influx

of  these overseas female singers to monopolise our

television. We should encourage more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



of  our  local  singing talent to  perform  in  the

various television programmes and shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides extra-mural technical, industrial and

trade   courses   conducted  by   our   educational

institutions,  such  as  the  Extra-mural   Studies

Department  in  the  University of  Singapore,  the

Nanyang  University and the Adult Education  Board,

similar  educational  and instructional  programmes

can  be  shown on television so that our people  in

their  hours  of  leisure  may  be  able  to  learn

something from these good and educative programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has said that l972

was   a   year   of  high  international   monetary

instability.  In June 1972, the Pound Sterling  was

forced to float. The United States of America, as a

result  of its chronic balance of payments deficit,

was  forced  to devalue its currency.  Despite  all

these  difficulties  and  uncertainties,  we   have

managed  to achieve a growth rate of 13  per  cent.

This  is  indeed a great achievement.  In  our  new

Budget,  we have no new taxes. On the contrary,  we

have seven reliefs or exemptions of tax, and we are

going  to enjoy a surplus of $20 million.  This  is

indeed  a  Budget which is welcomed by people  from

all  walks  of life. Unfortunately the  income  tax

relief of $300 for those who have to support  their

parents is too low. It should at least be $750  per

dependant. Moreover, children between the  ages  of

16  and  21  years are in an age of high school  or

university  education, and therefore  the  economic

burden  on  the parents is fairly heavy.  I  wonder

whether it would be possible to give some allowance

to tax-payers who have to support their children in

the higher educational institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the wake of economic

progress,  we should also enhance the consciousness

of our people so that they will be prepared to meet

the demands of changing situations, new targets and

needs and to strive for these objectives. On behalf

of  the  people in my constituency, I  support  the

financial policy of our Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

we  all  know,  owing to the total rundown  of  the

British    army   and   the   world-wide   monetary

instability, we disappointingly fell short by 2 per

cent  in  our targeted 15 per cent annual  economic

growth rate. This prompted the Finance Minister  to

explain at length the cause of this shortfall, when

he presented his annual Budget in Parliament at the

end of last month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the Finance Minister knows

much  better than I that to sustain a 10  per  cent

economic growth rate is a tremendous goal that most

countries  find  difficult to  reach;  and  that  a

target  of 15 per cent growth rate is a high ideal.

During the 1960s, our average economic growth  rate

was  9.5 per cent. In 1971, it was 15 per cent. Our

leaders  hoped that we could sustain this rate  for

1972,  and  that nothing should be less  than  this

unusual figure. However, in spite of the fact  that

we had suffered a loss of earnings from the British

military expenditure, which was roughly 3 per  cent

of  the  GNP,  we can still manage  to  achieve  an

economic growth rate of 13 per cent. This indicates

very   clearly  that  what  we  Singaporeans   have

performed is an economic miracle. A month ago, when

there was a storm of world-wide monetary crises, an

English  magazine  pointed out  that  although  the

Singapore   Government   had   not   announced    a

revaluation  of  its  currency,  it  was  in   fact

revalued between 1 and 2 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to point out that,

in its painless Budget which handed out several tax

reliefs  instead of introducing any new taxes,  the

Government  decided  to  appropriate  the   biggest

amount  of  money to building more housing  estates

for  the  middle and lower income groups. Prior  to

the  l960s, there were already those who repeatedly

mentioned  that with no natural resources Singapore

would  be  faced with two fundamental  difficulties

which  no  one  could overcome. The  first  is  the

problem  of  mass unemployment; the second  is  the

question of accommodation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



for half a million of the poorer  people.

Now,  under  the  able leadership  of  our  present

Government over the last 14 years, coupled with the

efforts    made   by   our   hard-working   people,

unemployment is no longer a problem today  and  the

problem of accommodation for half a million  people

is  also nearly solved. At present, we are well  on

the  way  to  a total accommodation of  our  people

through our "Tenants' Ownership Scheme".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, the fact that the rate of

building has been increased, from 45 minutes to  30

minutes per unit, may be commended in three ways:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Housing and Development Board has

built  and planned to build more and more  one-room

and  three-room flats to accommodate those  middle-lower class people who have not been able to find a

decent  house  to live in since the 1950s  so  that

thousands of hawkers, workers, trishaw-riders, taxi-drivers  and  low  paid shopkeepers  may  have  the

opportunity  to quit the slums and  move  into  HDB

flats with provision for water and electricity, and

to  enjoy a relatively hygienic and modern  way  of

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the monthly rental for a one-room flat

is  $20;  one only need to pay $30 for an  improved

type  one-room flat. The rentals for  two-room  and

three-room   flats   are  slightly   higher.   This

relatively low rental does not necessarily  reflect

the  actual cost of the HDB flat. Jr, other  words,

the  Government has to subsidise $20 for a one-room

flat  per  month and $15 for a two-room  flat.  The

lesser the number of rooms, the more the Government

has to subsidise the cost of the building, and vice

versa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in encouraging the people to purchase

HDB flats by using their contributions, which is  a

very  rare practice in the other countries  of  the

world,  the  Government is helping the people  from

the  middle  and lower income groups to purchase  a

three-room, four-room, or even a five-room flat. In

comparison  with the expensive private houses,  the

HDB  flats seem to appeal more to the masses.  That

is  why  there is a long queue for the purchase  of

HDB flats.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister mentioned in his Budget

Statement that the greater demand for accommodation

from  the  people  is being duly attended  to.  The

Government  also expresses the need to  improve  it

further.  One  way of doing this is  to  raise  the

building  target  from 20,000 to 30,000  units  per

year.  In  point  of fact, in this island  Republic

where  the price of land is rocketing, people  from

the  middle-lower income group would find  it  more

difficult  to  buy  a semi-detached  bungalow  from

private  developers. It may be compared to  winning

the  $400,000  lottery.  Nowadays,  even  a  senior

Government  officer finds it difficult  to  own  an

ideal  detached bungalow. I do not know about  most

of  the Members of Parliament here! The outcome  of

this  trend  will be that only a minority  of  rich

people are able to live in such bungalows built  by

private  developers,  while  the  majority  of  our

people will have to settle for HDB fiats under  the

right policy of our "Tenants' Ownership Scheme". We

can foresee that in the 1980s, modern HDB satellite

towns  will  be  erected  everywhere.  It  can   be

anticipated that by then about 80 per cent  of  our

total population will be housed in the HDB kits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I would like to stress the

importance of improving the environment of the  HDB

flats. Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to say a few words

about  my  impressions of a recent  visit  to  some

tenants of these HDB flats. I remember that as soon

as  I  walked up the stairs of a block of  one-room

flats,   I   immediately  saw  groups  of  innocent

children playing poker on the staircase, or playing

hide-and-seek along the verandah, or helping  their

parents  to  look after their younger brothers  and

sisters,  and  so forth. I hardly saw  any  primary

school  students, who live in these flats, spending

their   time  reading  books  or  magazines.   Only

occasionally  did  I  find  some  secondary  school

students reading books. There was a young man  from

a  family of nine. He was keen in studies,  and  he

wanted me to make a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



suggestion  to  the Government that  pavilions  and

arbours should be built in housing estates in order

to provide students with a quiet and suitable place

to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to their innocence or under the influence

of   traditional  and  religious  teachings,   some

parents have more children than they can afford  to

care  for.  As  a  result,  the  second  generation

suffers,  despite the fact that their parents  work

hard  during their whole life. There was a  middle-aged woman with more than a dozen children, and she

approached  me for help. From her facial appearance

and  the  way  she  tried hard to calm  herself,  I

realised very deeply her grievances and sorrows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I crossed a crowded car park and

paid a visit to the three-room and four-room flats,

the situation changed entirely: both the adults and

children  were staying indoors; all the doors  were

fastened  as if they lived in a separate world.  On

one  occasion,  only  after knocking  at  the  door

rather   loudly  did  an  old  woman  answer.   She

explained  smilingly that since only  she  and  her

grand-children were at home, she would not open the

door  to let anybody in, unless it was someone they

recognise.  She then went on further asking  me  to

persuade  the  Government to remove the  gas  meter

from  the house so that the whole family could have

more  security and comfort. She repeatedly stressed

that life had been better ever since they moved out

from  their  atap  dwelling  to  these  HDB  flats.

However, she said that there were too many ears and

too many people, and one single act of carelessness

could cause an accident and might even lead to loss

of life. Moreover, should any one be careless about

leaving  the door open, one would certainly  invite

thieves.  She considered it wiser to keep the  door

shut and to stay in and to enjoy the TV. It is just

like  what the old Chinese proverb says, "A scholar

has no need to go outdoors to know of the world".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that the present Government

leaders, who have always devoted themselves to  the

nation and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



the  people,  would certainly agree  with  me  that

these busy, crowded, and noisy housing estates have

to be improved upon a good deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quite understand that in our new Budget, the

reason  for  the  Government  to  appropriate   the

largest amount of money to build more HDB flats  is

to  meet the demand of the people which exceeds the

supply.  I  can  anticipate further  that  the  new

housing  estates  would  certainly  have  a  better

environment than the present ones. I am pretty sure

that  the  Government will continue to allot  money

for  the  improvement of living conditions  of  the

people  in housing estates. On this account  may  I

suggest  at least two steps in which the Government

could  improve the environmental conditions of  the

housing estates in future?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the creation of a caretaking system. For a

housing unit of 500 to 600 families, we may appoint

an  elderly  caretaker  to deal  with  the  general

affairs  of  the  estate.  Only  when  this  system

materialises, will the elder tenants of  the  flats

feel  safe  to  use  the lifts in  their  high-rise

flats.  Moreover, the tenants may be  able  to  get

someone  to help in case of accident. Besides,  the

caretaker  can also play the role of  bringing  the

tenants  together,  promoting mutual  understanding

among  the  tenants, and encouraging them  to  love

their  way  of  life in the HDB flats,  which  will

eventually  help shape their social  consciousness.

All  these  point to the fact that a caretaker  can

play a very important role indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, this is not a question of money, but

a  question of system. In the latest issue  of  the

HDB's organ, Our Home, there is much discussion  on

the  problem of security guards and their salaries.

It  seems to imply that because there is a lack  of

funds, the HDB authorities could only get a limited

number  of men to maintain security in the  housing

estates.  However,  if  we compare  the  job  of  a

caretaker with that of the security guard, the duty

of  the former tends to be positive, while that  of

the  latter tends to be rather negative. If, in the

words



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



of an old Chinese saying, "One cannot have both the

fish  and the bear-palm at the same time", I  would

rather  choose the caretaker, because  his  job  is

more  practical and more applicable to the  present

situation in the housing estates. I would  like  to

know  what  the authorities concerned think  of  my

opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the HDB authorities should do what they

can  to develop the limited open grounds around the

housing estates into parks or sports grounds, so as

to  enable the old and the young to have a  bit  of

fresh  air,  or to engage in a game of  basket-ball

after  a  day's  hard  work. This  is  particularly

important  to  the tenants of the crowded  one-room

flats.  To tell you the truth, Sir, my constituency

has  not got even a full basket-ball court; it  has

only  half a basket-ball court. That is why at  the

end of last month, twelve young citizens approached

me  on  the matter of basket-ball practices, and  I

had   to  get  permission  from  the  Bukit   Merah

Community  Centre for them to use its court.  Other

facilities, like sports centres, cultural  centres,

conference or meeting rooms, etc., are what I  have

in  mind, and for the realisation of which we ought

to make a yet greater effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is some truth in the proverb which says,

"A  fool will be wise on a thousand thoughts", then

I hope that the suggestions I have put forward will

be  looked  into by the authorities concerned,  and

that  they  will take positive steps  to  implement

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I shall close my speech with two famous

lines  from  a  famous Chinese  poet,  from  Tu  Fu

Selected Poems, translated by Rewi Alley:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would be possible to build an immense house

with thousands of rooms,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all who needed could take welcome shelter.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the

Suspension now. I will take the Chair again at 5.05 p.m.

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.05 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Budget statement delivered by the

Minister for Finance on the 26th February came as a

relief  to the people of Singapore in the midst  of

soaring  prices.  I would like to congratulate  the

Minister on one particular aspect and, that is,  he

has taken heed and accepted the views of Members of

this   House  expressed  last  year  and  has  made

adjustments in regard to the collection of taxes. I

hope  that this year he will again listen  to  what

Members  have to say and to bear them in mind  when

drafting the next Budget statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember that the topic of soaring

prices was a favourite subject during the past  two

Budget  debates. I believe that this time  it  will

also  be  a hot topic for discussion. This  is  not

because we enjoy harping on an old tune but because

we  come from constituencies in which the lower and

middle  income groups predominate, and also because

prices are still soaring in recent months. In fact,

prices  have  gone up by 10 to 20 per  cent.  Since

wool  must  ultimately come from sheep,  the  brunt

will  have  to  be  borne by the middle  and  lower

income  groups  who are finding it  more  and  more

difficult  to  make ends meet. So I hope  that  the

Minister for Finance will make efforts to check the

soaring prices or at least to control the prices of

some  daily necessities to ensure that there is  no

profiteering by unscrupulous merchants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the economic boom and the influx of

foreign  capital, there has been an excess flow  of

currency  in  Singapore. Capital is  increasing  in

Singapore, and this is not without its ill-effects.

For   example,   our   share  market   has   become

overheated,  and I am therefore glad to  note  that

the  Government is taking remedial action  to  cool

the  overheated share market to ensure  its  proper

functioning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter concerns the prices of land and

houses.  As a result of soaring prices in land  and

houses  in recent years, wage earners in the income

group  of $1,003 a month find it impossible to  own

houses built by private developers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third ill-effect of this excess capital in

Singapore is that factories are finding it more and

more difficult to get workers, and domestic help is

also  difficult to obtain. Provision shops,  barber

shops, workshops and farms too find it difficult to

get  local  labour,  and  they  have  to  rely   on

labourers  from  other  countries.  Although  these

labourers and workers are welcome, they bring along

with  them  their unwelcome bad habits, which  have

ill-effects  on our own workers. As a  result,  the

standards of morals and ethics in Singapore are put

to   a   severe   test  in  the  light   of   rapid

industrialization   and  urbanization.   Thus   the

inevitable  concept of money in command has  become

the  value which has taken root in the minds of not

only  the  older  generation but also  the  younger

generation. This is one aspect detrimental  to  our

development which we must try to check and  prevent

it from becoming worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance seems to have over-emphasised the importance of commerce and industry

at  the expense of agriculture. I certainly do  not

have  the audacity to expect the Minister to  raise

the  status  of agriculture to the same footing  as

commerce and industry. But agriculture deserves due

attention.  Experts have expressed  the  view  that

countries  which do not produce the food that  they

require will suffer dire consequences in the  event

of  a  cut-off  of  supply  from  foreign  sources.

Therefore,  I  would  like  to  point  out  to  the

Minister  that  our farmers deserve  some  form  of

economic  and  financial aid  from  the  Government

which  they  are not getting. They  often  live  in

extreme  difficulties. The pig  farmers  provide  a

good  case in point. Firstly, they suffer  a  sharp

drop  in  the  price of pigs. Secondly,  they  were

manipulated by middlemen, when there was  an  over-production of pigs. Yet under those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



circumstances,  the  Ministry of  Finance  did  not

extend a helping hand to the poor farmers. In  many

cases, the smalltime farmers had to "close shop and

call  it  a  day".  In  the case  of  the  big-time

farmers, although they managed to pull through  the

difficult period, they suffered heavy losses. Then,

they  were  faced with the rising prices of  animal

feed, it was argued that that was due to the  rise

in  the  cost of raw materials. But now, prices  of

raw  materials  have come down but  the  prices  of

animal feed still remain almost the same. What  has

the  Ministry  of Finance done to help  these  poor

farmers?  The farmers work and toil the whole  year

round  but  they  are still on the brink  of  semi-starvation.  The world seems to be  too  harsh  and

unfair to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to fishing. The

Government is encouraging deep-sea fishing.  It  is

regrettable  that in spite of earlier talk  on  the

development  of  deep-sea fishing, nothing  further

has developed beyond that. While the population  is

increasing,  there is no increase in our  catch  of

fish.  We  have to rely on foreign supply.  We  can

produce  at  most  only one quarter  of  the  total

consumption.  This is an unfavourable  trend  which

should not be allowed to continue if we are not  to

rely  too  much  on foreign supply.  Because  over-reliance  On foreign supply will not only  cause  a

loss of foreign exchange but also expose its prices

to  foreign manipulation. The development of  deep-sea   fishing  will  make  available  to   us   the

inexhaustible resources of the ocean and open up  a

new  avenue  of  employment and an outlet  for  our

surplus  capital. Sir, I hope that  positive  steps

will be taken to develop deep-sea fishing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my speech will be incomplete without any

reference to education and teachers. In his  Budget

statement,  the Minister for Finance said  that  in

order to provide some incentive to teachers and  to

raise  their morale, the Government has decided  to

give them opportunities for promotion. This is  all

very  good.  But  what is the  actual  position  in

regard to its implementation? The effect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



is    just   the   opposite.   According   to    my

understanding, this is the first promotion exercise

for teachers, and therefore many qualified teachers

have put in their applications. Some 4,000 to 5,000

teachers  are said to have applied. By  right,  the

Ministry concerned should have set certain criteria

for  the short-listing of applications, instead  of

giving  the important job of short-listing  to  the

computer.  What  happens to this computered  short-listing? We find that, as a result of this, in some

schools not even a single teacher was called up for

interview, whereas in other schools as many  as  20

to 30 teachers were called up for interview. Again,

some  senior teachers with many years' service were

not  given  the opportunity of an interview,  while

junior teachers in the same school have been called

up. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, can you really say that in

a  school with a few tens of teachers not even  one

teacher  is  eligible for an interview?  What  will

parents and students think of such a school? Again,

in  the  same  school, senior assistants  were  not

called  up  for interview, whereas junior  teachers

were  called  up. This can only cause friction  and

suspicion among the teachers. Senior assistants can

very  well turn round and say, "Well, if you  think

that so-and-so, a junior, is better than I am,  for

an  interview,  you can ask him to  take  over  the

burdensome administrative work. Why should you  let

me  remain as a senior assistant?" So how  can  the

morale  of teachers be enhanced? I am pointing  out

all these matters in order to draw the attention of

the  Minister to the fact that, instead of  raising

the  morale and improving the relations  among  the

teachers, there have been suspicion and low  morale

because  of  the  poor  recruitment  and  promotion

exercise.  Many teachers are changing  their  jobs.

The  Ministry of Finance should probably review the

system of promotion exercise and make provision for

a better and more reasonable exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding my criticisms, I still support

and  endorse  the Budget statement of the  Minister

for Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, while congratulating the Minister for

Finance  for  his  painless and considerate  Budget

statement,  I  wish to draw the attention  of  this

House to some rather pressing issues affecting  the

livelihood of our people. I have no doubt that  the

Minister  is  aware of these issues and,  with  his

usual skill and application, will try to work out a

solution to these issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I wish to point out is the urgency of a

solution to these issues, for there seems to be the

beginning  of  a  series  of  inflationary   spiral

resulting   in   widespread  misery   and   general

discontent. The recent rise in the cost  of  living

has  caused some measure of anxiety among the lower

income group. To say the least, the cost of food is

about  20  per cent higher than it was  six  months

ago. For the rich, this rise means nothing. For the

middle class workers, this may mean a reduction  in

their monthly savings. For the poor or lower income

workers, this means tightening their belts.  It  is

no exaggeration to say that a worker, earning $10 a

day or $300 a month, with a wife and three children

and living in a Housing and Development Board flat,

is  left with about $4 a day for food for the whole

family  after deducting other standard  expenditure

such  as  rent,  water and electricity,  bus  fare,

school  fees, children's pocket money, books,  etc.

The answer seems to be either to raise their income

or to lower the cost of living, or perhaps to both.

How  can this situation be improved? I do not know.

But  I  do  know  that it is a  situation  that  is

becoming  more  and more difficult  for  the  lower

income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is that recently the cost of an ice-water drink has gone up from 5 cents to 10 cents.

What  the reason is, one cannot understand. Whether

it  was  the  payment  of the 13th  month  pay,  or

whether  it  was the decrease in the value  of  the

American  dollar, or the decrease in the  value  of

money,  one does not know. Singapore seems to  have

been  affected  as a result of the  crisis  in  the

international monetary world. If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



Minister  assures that the external situation  does

not affect us, it should be reassuring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is the conservation of water. The

campaign  to save water has been on for some  time.

Disincentives to water wastage, such as  increasing

the  charges  in  PUB bills, have been  introduced.

From  the  reports of daily consumption,  it  would

appear  that  the  campaign is  not  producing  the

desired effect. I hope the Minister will review his

campaign and adopt more effective measures  to  cut

down  our  water  consumption.  Whatever  the   new

measures may be, it appears that very much  depends

on  the  success of motivating the public  to  save

water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that puzzles the public is that while

the  Government  asks for the co-operation  of  the

people  to save water, its workers turn on hydrants

at  full blast to clean drains and markets.  Whilst

admitting  that  drains  and  markets  need  to  be

washed, one wonders whether ii is necessary to  use

so  much  water. If the water used is  not  potable

water  but  effluent water then it should  be  made

known to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As water conservation is an urgent matter, I am

sure   the   Minister  will  review  his   campaign

periodically until success is achieved.  Also,  the

facilities for the storage and supply of water must

be  enhanced. We must not always depend on  foreign

supplies.  In  that  respect, the  Minister  should

devise ways and means to improve the situation.



<br><br>5.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I, on behalf of the constituents

in  Sembawang, express our support for  the  Budget

statement given by the Minister for Finance on  the

26th February, 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note that, as was the case

last  year,  there  are no new taxes.  Furthermore,

there  is a surplus of $20 million. This is evident

that  our country has continued to enjoy prosperity

and  stability. We managed to achieve a growth rate

of  13  per  cent, despite the complete rundown  of

British



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



armed  forces  and  the  consequent  reduction   of

military  expenditure. What  are  the  reasons  for

this?  To  my  mind,  there  are  several  reasons.

Firstly,  we have a capable and dynamic Government,

actively   pursuing  and  implementing   wise   and

effective  economic policies, such as a  full-scale

industrialisation    programme.    Secondly,    the

political  stability and social peace that  prevail

in our country have done a great deal to strengthen

the  faith  of  foreign investors in  our  country.

Thirdly, the diligence of our people. Fourthly, the

sincere co-operation between labour and management,

resulting  in  industrial  peace,  has  raised  our

industrial production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards external trade, a record level of

$15,680    million   was   achieved   last    year,

representing an increase of $1,645 million,  which

is  a  very  substantial amount. This reflects  the

important   role   that  our   country   plays   in

international  trade. Although many  countries  are

attempting at direct trading, this is obviously not

an  easy task because they lack good docks, godowns

and   other   harbour   facilities   required   for

international  trade.  More  important,  they  lack

efficient  administration and workers with  a  high

degree  of  social discipline. It can  be  expected

that  in  the next 10 years we will become a  great

centre  for  international  trade.  I  recall  that

towards  the  end of last year the Prime  Minister,

during  a  visit to the European countries,  called

upon those countries to regard Singapore as a great

centre  for  international  trade.  Obviously,  the

prospects are excellent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one thing that deserves mention here is the

new tax relief for the support of aged parents.  It

is  an  extremely wise measure. Although the relief

of  $300 per annum per dependant is not much, it is

a  symbolic gesture. I do hope that the amount will

be increased from year to year. The significance of

this  concession is very important. It goes to show

that the Government has given heed to the views and

opinions  of the people of our country.  When  this

news  was  announced, it won the  wide  acclaim  of

people from all walks of life.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, there are several other measures for

tax   concession.  For  example,  for  those   with

handicapped children above the age of 16 years, the

relief  will allow these unfortunate ones to  enjoy

more  warmth in the family. The relaxation  of  the

limit on premiums for life insurance policies  will

benefit  many  people in the middle income  groups.

The  reduction of stamp duties on marine  insurance

is another example of these wise measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of the people in a rural

constituency, I am naturally concerned about  their

welfare. I notice that the provision for urban  and

rural  services  this year amounts  to  $3,250,000,

which  is  exactly the same as that for last  year.

There  is no increase. I think this amount  is  not

sufficient. There are many rural areas  which  have

yet  to  be  improved in respect of roads,  drains,

street  lighting,  water and electricity  supplies.

All  this  requires a great deal of money.  I  hope

that   the   Minister   concerned   will   consider

allocating a greater amount for public works in the

rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, during the debate on the President's

Speech  and also on the Budget, I had made  similar

requests.  I  am  afraid that my requests  had  not

obtained any results. I shall therefore again  call

upon the Minister to reconsider these requests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Estimates, we note

that although the Ministry of the Environment is  a

relatively new Ministry, it has been allocated  $36

million. This shows the importance of the Ministry,

whose   main   task   is  to  prevent   water   and

environmental    pollution.   Singapore    is    an

industrialised country. We must not make  the  same

mistake  which other industrialised countries  have

made  by polluting the environment. It is therefore

absolutely necessary that the Government allocate a

large sum of money for anti-pollution measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government intends to raise the building

target  from  20,000 to 30,000  housing  units  per

year.  There is a crying need for more  houses  and

fiats.  We  know  that there are 60,000  to  70,000

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



on  the waiting list for Housing Board flats. If we

continue  to build Housing Board fiats at the  rate

of  20,000 per year, then these unfortunate  people

will  have to wait for at least two or more  years.

The fact that the Government is going to build more

flats per year will mean a reduction in the waiting

time between the application and the allocation  of

flats. This is indeed a measure most welcome by our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it cannot be denied that our

Government  has  looked  after  the  interests  and

welfare  of the lower income groups. We have  built

many  hawker centres. All these hawker centres  are

suitably  situated  and are  provided  with  modern

sanitation.  No doubt the land provided  for  these

hawker  centres fetches a very high price, but  for

the sake of improving the welfare and livelihood of

these  hawkers, it is worthwhile to pay this price.

The  Government is also going to spend  $5  million

for  the construction of hawker centres and markets

in  the  next  financial year. This is indeed  good

news.  I am sure the hawkers will be able to  carry

on    their   trade   in   better   and   healthier

surroundings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is also going to spend $37

million  for the development of education. This  is

absolutely   necessary.  As  a  result   of   rapid

development, industries have sprung up resulting in

a  shortage of skilled and semi-skilled workers. At

the  moment, the main concern of foreign  investors

is  not whether the labour force is stable but with

the   availability  of  skilled  and   semi-skilled

labour.  In  order  to  solve  this  problem,   the

Government should allocate this amount to carry out

a   full-scale   technical  education   development

programme  to train a large number of artisans  and

unskilled people so that they will be equipped with

the  necessary  skills. The Minister has  mentioned

various schemes, such as overseas training schemes,

joint  training  schemes  and  apprentice  schemes.

Naturally all these are very good measures. But  in

order  to obtain optimum results, emphasis must  be

given to the practical aspects, i.e, on-the-job



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



training, by sending apprentices  to  work  in

factory sites so that when they eventually take  up

a job, they will be fully trained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance also

mentioned  that for last year there is a  reduction

in  the  investment  figure  for  the  shipbuilding

industry.  This is something which we  should  take

note  of. As a result of rapid development  in  the

shipbuilding and ship-repairing industry  over  the

last  few  years, we have become a centre for  this

industry  in South-east Asia. We must try our  best

to  maintain this superiority. But why is  there  a

reduction   of   investments  in  the  shipbuilding

industry?  We  must try our best to  find  remedial

measures. As far as I know, one of the reasons  for

the  reduction  of investments in the  shipbuilding

industry  is  the  scarcity of suitable  sites  for

shipyards. If that is the case, we should  open  up

more  tracts  of  land  for  the  construction   of

shipyards.  I  know  that  in  Naval  Base  in  the

Sembawang  constituency, there is a  big  tract  of

land  suitable  for  building  shipyards.  We  must

immediately  open up this piece of land  and  other

suitable  pieces of land so that more  people  will

come and invest in our shipbuilding industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we have also satisfactorily developed

tourism.  780,000 tourists visited  Singapore  last

year,   enabling   us  to  earn  foreign   exchange

amounting to $400 million. In order to attract more

tourists  to  come to our country, we should  spend

more  money on developing tourist resorts. We  must

encourage  more  cultural and art activities  among

our  multi-racial society, because  all  these  are

attractions  to the tourist. The Tourist  Promotion

Board  should lay out better plans so that  we  can

become a great tourist centre in South-east Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the new Budget is a healthy and

progressive  one. Owing to its many good  measures,

it  will certainly ensure that the rate of economic

development  will be maintained and  will  progress

further.  As  long  as  our  people  march  forward

together  and co-operate with the Government,  hard

work  with  a  high  degree  of  discipline,  I  am

convinced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



that  1973 will prove to be a prosperous year,  and

we  will be able to raise the standard of living of

our people in all fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support wholeheartedly

this Motion.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Encik Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I rise to join other hon. Members in congratulating

the  Minister  for Finance for his popularly  known

painless   Budget  statement  which  outlined   the

Government's financial policy. I do not  intend  to

speak  on the economic aspects of the Budget, which

have  already been dealt with by many  Members  who

have spoken in support of the Motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget speech, the Minister for Finance

revealed  that  the average per  capita  income  in

Singapore is now $3,687. With a growth rate  of  15

per  cent  in our Gross Domestic Product  for  1972

over  1971, the economic indicators show  that  our

Republic is now in a better position to devote more

attention  to  the  subject  of  leisure  and   the

development of culture as an integral part  of  the

social and economic development of our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By culture, I do not mean only the fine arts,

such  as  music,  drama and  dance.  Rather,  I  am

referring  to  all  that  are  concerned  with  the

quality  of  life. This is where effort  should  be

made in ensuring that, among Singaporeans, the  art

of  living  should be one which is  Singaporean  in

character and recognised by others to be such.  The

way  towards  this  may  be one  involving  a  long

process but the end result, when recognised  to  be

successful,  would be a most satisfying  one;  that

is,  when  we  Shave  Singaporeans  who  are  well-mannered;  always  civic-minded; always  courteous;

friendly  in disposition; well-disciplined;  imbued

with  the  values and ideals which are positive  in

character; endowed with a healthy body and an alert

mind;  possessing  a well-rounded  personality  and

endowed with creative sensibilities which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



can be further developed through an exposure to the

fine arts, such as music, drama and the dance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural activities must, therefore, be

channelled    towards    producing    Singaporeans,

especially Singaporeans of the future who are  able

to retain their national identity regardless of (or

rather   in   addition,  able  to  withstand)   the

onslaught  of unknown influences which must  surely

come in the 21st century of urbanised living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems there will be and must be successfully

surmounted,  especially in areas which concern  the

mass media (which are powerful instruments and  can

be  used either for good or for evil), science  and

technology   or   what  may  be  called   technical

civilisation, and, of course, youth, in  many  ways

the key to the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the environment we live in, both in

physical  and  social terms, should  be  one  which

contributes  to the building of a stable,  creative

and all round personality in our citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a policy of cultural development

should  be  on  the  basis  that  culture   is   an

inseparable part of daily life and go side by  side

with  life-long  education. Hence,  all  manner  of

cultural activities, which would include all manner

of  activities  where there is social inter-action,

should  be  made accessible to all. In this  sense,

Sir,  the fine arts (music, drama and dance) should

not  be confined to only the elite. It is only with

individual   participation  at  all   levels   that

cultural activities can be of benefit and  help  in

the  task  and the process of nation building.  Our

leaders  have  stressed  the  importance   of   the

development of culture in nation-building, and  now

is  the  moment  to give serious attention  to  the

implementation  of a cultural policy  towards  this

end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a means of the democratization of culture, if

I  may  use this term, the mass media has a crucial

role  to  play  in  the diffusion  of  culture  and

constitutes    an    invaluable   instrument    for

communication  between  the policy-makers  and  the

general public, so that there will be understanding

of  the  common  objectives which are  national  in

character.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, what is needed for the coming

decade is that more attention should be paid to the

building  and  strengthening of the  infrastructure

for  the  development of culture, which we  already

have either to a greater or a lesser degree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for attention to be paid to cultural

development on a global scale is realised today, as

it  is,  for  example, by UNESCO  which  has  begun

during  the  last few years to concentrate  on  the

problems  of culture, as it did on the problems  of

education and science during the last 25  years  of

its existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tempo of urbanisation increasing day by

day  in our Republic, we owe it to our citizens and

to posterity not only to create material wealth for

them,  but also to provide them with the means  and

with   every  opportunity  to  live  a  happy   and

meaningful  life,  and  as proud  citizens  of  our

Republic,  in  dignity and in friendship  with  our

neighbours and friends abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have pleasure in supporting

the Motion.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Government and the Minister for Finance should

be  congratulated  again  for  presenting  a  third

painless  Budget  to this House on  26th  February,

1973. I am sure all the workers, employers and  the

people of Singapore are happy that there is no  new

taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of the fact that there is no new

taxation,  prices  of  food  and  commodities  have

increased  from 25 per cent to 100 per  cent!  Even

the  hawkers are doing the same thing. For example,

a  small glass of ice-water was five cents, and  we

now have to pay 10 cents. A sarabat hawker has also

increased the price of a glass of coffee or tea  by

another  five  cents, like the  coffee-shops,  even

though he is not paying any stall rental, light and

water. A bowl of kway-teow was 30 cents, now it  is

50  cents; a stick of satay was 10 cents, now it is

15 cents; a plate of mutton briyani



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



was  80 cents, now it is $1.20. With all this,  you

will  still  find that the quantity and quality  of

the food have gone down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not objecting to a reasonable

increase of prices of food and commodities, but  at

the  rates they have increased from 25 per cent  to

100  per cent, it is indeed very painful to all the

workers, especially those earning less than $200  a

month.   The  wage  increase  recommended  by   the

National Wages Council was 8 per cent, of  which  4

per  cent  had to be deducted for CPF contribution.

For those earning less than $200 a month they could

get 6 per cent wage increase and 4 per cent to CPF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will appreciate that the

wage  increase a worker could get was  from  8  per

cent  to  10 per cent, and 4 per cent was  deducted

for CPF. Yet the increase in the prices of food and

commodities  went up from 25 per cent  to  100  per

cent.   There  is  a  National  Wages  Council   to

recommend   to  the  Government  on   annual   wage

increases,  but there is no Council  to  guide  the

reasonable  increase  in the  prices  of  food  and

commodities.  Unless  the  Government  is  able  to

enforce and control reasonable increases in  prices

of  food  and commodities comparable to the  annual

wage  increase  recommended by the  National  Wages

Council, it is quite definite that the workers will

demand   higher   wages   or  high   cost-of-living

allowances to meet the increases in prices of  food

and commodities. How can you expect the workers  to

accept  8  per  cent  to 10 per  cent  annual  wage

increase  when prices of food and commodities  went

up from 25 per cent to 100 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget statement is indeed painless, but

the  prices  of  food  and  commodities  which  the

workers  have to pay daily are really very  painful

and quite unbearable, especially those in the lower

income  bracket. The Government must  do  something

about  it and the sooner the better and as soon  as

possible, because we do not want to be faced with a

labour  situation like in the United Kingdom  where

the workers have to resort to strike action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a well-known fact that a good number

of  hawkers are making a good monthly income.  Some

popular  stalls  like chicken  rice,  satay,  fried

hokien  mee  and  turtle soup  can  easily  make  a

monthly  profit  of $1,000 or even more.  Some  are

earning  more  than  Members of  Parliament!  I  am

wondering how many hawkers are paying income tax. I

understand that some well-to-do hawkers  own  cars,

houses, and are partners of some finance companies.

If  hawkers keep on increasing the prices of  their

food,  workers and their unions may  have  to  find

ways and means to live within their monthly income.

Perhaps  the time has come for workers  to  request

their employers to enter into a joint venture in co-operative  canteens to supply food  and  drinks  at

reasonable  prices at various offices  and  factory

worksites. The Government and the NTUC can play  an

important  role in these co-operative canteens  for

the  workers in the private and public sectors.  It

is  unfair  to request the workers to refrain  from

demanding  higher wages for the sake of  industrial

peace   and  national  interest,  whereas  hawkers,

sundry  shops,  provision  stores  and  other  food

suppliers  can increase their prices  at  any  time

they   like   without  any  concern  for   national

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time the Government considered forming

a   National  Council  to  give  guidance  on   the

increasing   prices   of  food   and   commodities,

including  non-edible items, if we want to  achieve

industrial peace with justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak on the

fantastic increase in the prices of flats,  terrace

houses  and semi-detached houses. Prices are  still

rocketing.  Perhaps this is due to the manipulation

of  big  financial investors. Also, rich foreigners

from   Hong  Kong,  Taiwan,  Indonesia  and   other

countries are buying these flats and houses without

hesitating to pay the high prices. They  know  very

well  that  prices  of flats, houses  and  land  in

Singapore  will never come down and will always  go

up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote a few advertisements

from  the  New  Nation's "Houses & Land  For  Sale" column:



<br><br>New Nation 3-3-1973



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) "Tanglin Area, luxurious maisonette flat

facing  swimming  pool.  Due  completion   July     1973. $250,000".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) "Cairnhill Court Apartment. First Floor

nearing completion. Price: $180,000".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) "New Luxurious 1st Floor Flat at Jalan Datok. G. Block $83,000".



<br><br>New Nation 5-3-73



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) "TWO SEMI-DETACHED HOUSES at Katong Sea View Palace. Price: $220,000 each".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government must do something to stop the

fantastic  increase  in prices  of  flats,  terrace

houses and semi-detached houses. I believe some  of

the  big  financial investors deliberately jack  up

the prices to make big profits. I would suggest  to

the  Government to limit the number of construction

projects  by the private sector in building  multi-storey  flats, terrace houses, semi-detached houses

and   office/shopping  complexes,  and  to  further

increase  the  building target of HDB  multi-storey

units to, if possible, 40,000 units a year so  that

the  long  waiting  list for  HDB  flats  could  be

eliminated. All HDB flats are meant for the workers

and  the people of Singapore so that they can  have

decent accommodation, whereas private sector flats,

houses and office/shopping complexes are meant  for

big  profit  by  the financial investors.  The  HDB

flats  are  built  for national  interest,  whereas

private  building projects are meant for individual

and   sectional  interest.  Sir,  in  view  of  the

fantastic  increase  in the  prices  of  flats  and

houses  in  the private sector, may I  request  the

Government  to increase the family combined  salary

limit  from $1,500 to $2,500 to enable more workers

to purchase or rent the Housing Board flats?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> There will be more parking of Mercedes cars!



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Sir, I am glad the Government

approves tax relief for taxpayers who take care  of

their aged parents, grandparents and handicapped



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



children.  I  must congratulate the Government  for

taking  the  right  step to encourage  the  younger

people to love and care for their aged parents  and

handicapped    children.   It   is    our    social

responsibility to do so and to make them happy. The

tax  relief of $300 a year for each dependant  will

take  effect  from 1-1-74. I would  appeal  to  the

Minister  for Finance to give further consideration

to  increase  the tax relief to $750  a  year.  The

amount  of  $300  a  year  for  each  dependant  is

inadequate.  The tax relief for a  first  child  is

$750 a year. Surely, to care for an aged father  or

mother  could  be costly and definitely  cost  more

than  a  child,  especially when  an  older  person

requires  more  nourishing food and  medical  care.

Also,  an  older person falls sick more easily  and

more frequently because of old age and weak health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one calls a doctor to attend his aged father

or mother at home in case of emergency, the medical

bill  will be from $15 to $25. Therefore,  the  tax

relief  of  $25 for that particular month  will  be

just  enough to pay for the doctor's bill.  If  the

aged parent has to be admitted into a hospital  for

further medical treatment, then the $25 will not be

enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with the Minister for Finance

that  our  success  and  progress  is  due  to  the

effective  tripartite co-operation between  labour,

management  and  Government.  I  am  sure  we   can

maintain  our  present  healthy  climate   in   our

industrial  relations and to work harder  for  more

success  and  progress.  Sir,  employers  are  well

protected  by the labour legislation and they  have

the  managerial  rights  to  reorganise,  transfer,

promote   and  dismiss  employees.   It   is   most

regrettable that there are still some unenlightened

employers who are abusing these rights and use them

in  a  subtle way to victimise their employees  who

are  actively interested or participated  in  union

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a small American oil company in Singapore is

doing such a silly thing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



The   Management  of  this  company  recently  gave

promotion   to   a   foreign   executive   from   a

neighbouring country and deliberately preferred not

to  give it to its Singaporean executives who  have

the  experience,  qualification  and  seniority  of

service.  I  understand this  same  Management  has

decided  to give another promotion post to  another

foreigner  from a neighbouring country rather  than

promoting its local executives who are capable  and

qualified  for  this  promotion.  Sir,  the   local

executives of this small American oil company  have

decided  to  form  a union after a general  meeting

among   themselves.  They  have   submitted   their

application and Union Constitution to the Registrar

of  Trade  Unions for approval and registration.  I

believe  because of this move to form a union,  the

Management  is  deliberately  depriving  the  local

executives  from  promotion and preferred  to  give

them to non-Singaporean executives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not objecting to the Management prerogatives

to  promote the right person for the job. What I am

strongly  objecting to is that the  Management  did

not  give  consideration to  local  executives  and

using  promotion as a weapon to victimise employees

who want to form a union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unless the Management of this company stops

this  kind  of  unfair labour  practice  by  subtly

victimising the local executives, just because they

want to form a union, this issue will be brought to

the Ministry of Labour and made known to the public

through  the  press  in due course.  This  type  of

foolish  and  unenlightened  employers  should   be

punished by law if it is proven true that they  are

victimising   their  employees  for   trade   union

activities.  The Government must put  an  immediate

stop  to  this kind of subtle way of victimisation.

Such foolish employers are provoking employees into

industrial  action and should not be  tolerated  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my

colleagues in this House in giving full support  to

the  Budget statement presented by the Minister for Finance to Parliament on 26th February, 1973.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I am very appreciative of  the  very

generous support which has been given to the Budget

statement which I made, although there were one  or

two  Members who did not perhaps give it quite  the

same  welcome  as the others. One Member  suggested

that  the  Budget statement was tolerable.  Another

Member  apparently took exception to the manner  in

which  I presented my Budget statement. Perhaps  he

may  have  been  unfortunate in not  receiving  the

first portion of the statement, which was given  to

the  Clerk  of  Parliament on Friday afternoon  and

should  have  been  in  the post  for  delivery  on

Saturday  morning. Nevertheless, if there had  been

any delay, I would like to extend my apology to the

Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that I would not be doing

justice to all the various speakers today if I were

to  reply  in  a very cursory manner  to  the  many

valuable suggestions which they have made.  I  have

taken copious notes but I am afraid that I may have

lost  some of the finer nuances of the comments  of

those speeches which were translated from Mandarin.

I   propose   therefore  to  give  their   recorded

statements my very close attention when they appear

in  Hansard. The remarks which I make now are  only

in very general terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the matters which were brought up, the one

which  had  the most popular reaction was  the  tax

relief  for  parents,  deductible  from  assessable

income.  The  comments of some Members extended  to

requests  for  tax relief not only to children  but

also   to   the  taxpayers  themselves.   On   this

particular matter, all I need say at this moment is

that, in giving tax relief for parents, a principle

has  been  established which, I think, is  probably

the  most difficult part in giving the tax  relief,

and that if the amounts are required to be revised,

they  will  be  given consideration  in  subsequent

reviews of tax reliefs for taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one comment I should make, and

that  is  in  respect of parents being required  to

stay with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



taxpayers. The Asian concept of the extended family

is  of a family living together. It really does not

help in establishing the kind of conditions that we

want to have the taxpayer living in a Housing Board

flat  and  his parent living perhaps  in  a  Social

Welfare  Home  for the Aged. This is certainly  not

the  intention of giving the tax deduction. If  the

Housing  Board flats are too small for the extended

family,  then perhaps our planners in  the  Housing

Board  should try and plan bigger flats.  In  fact,

they are already doing this. The one-room flats are

now giving way to the two-room, three-room and even

four-room fiats. I suppose, if necessary, it can be

even  further increased to five-room  flats.  I  am

sure the cost of such replanning would be very much

more  than  if  I just agreed to increase  the  tax

relief from $300 to a higher figure. I think it  is

very  desirable  that this extended family  concept

should  be  encouraged.  The  reason  is  that  the

parents  are required to be taken care  of  not  by

some  social welfare workers but by their immediate

and affectionate relatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next comment which was rather general was on

the  cost  of living and the effects of  inflation.

Many  Members  were  eloquent  on  this  particular

topic,  and  I  do  not  need  to  single  out  any

particular  Member.  I  am very  conscious  of  the

effect upon our citizens of inflation in Singapore,

and  I thought I had devoted quite a lot of my time

in  my  Budget statement to the measures  which  we

intend  to  take  to  bring down  the  inflationary

spiral.  The most effective economic measure  would

be to reduce the money supply of the economy from a

level  of  24-30  per cent last year  to  something

which  would  be more in keeping with our  economic

growth.  I  would say round about 15  per  cent  or

less.  This  is,  of course, a method  of  approach

which would be somewhat different from perhaps  the

approach of Members of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir took it from the

point  of  view  of the Consumers'  Association  of

Singapore  which looks at the prices of commodities

and tries to establish some control or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



regulation to bring down the prices. This  kind  of

approach  is valuable to some extent and, in  fact,

the  Government  has  tried and  had  succeeded  in

keeping  down  the  prices of certain  commodities,

like  sugar  until very recently,  and  some  other

essential  foodstuffs.  The  Government  is   still

keeping a very close eye on the costs of all  these

commodities  in  relation to the prices  which  are

being charged by manufacturers or by importers. But

this is only effective to the extent that the costs

are not imported costs. If inflation is rampant  in

some  other countries and we have to buy from  that

country, then there is no way in which we can bring

the  inflation down to within the limits which  are

considered  desirable. In the case of  rice,  where

there  is  a  shortage,  particularly  because   of

weather  conditions,  as I  have  mentioned  in  my

Budget  statement, there is no way in which we  can

bring  down the price to a level at which  it  was,

say,  two  years ago. To that extent, the  cost  of

living  must increase if we use the cost of  living

index  which was designed previously for low income

families.  The effect of the increase in the  price

of  rice  and basic commodities must result  in  an

escalation of the cost of living, in the  same  way

as when the price of rice was very low there was  a

reduction in the cost of living for the low  income

groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the view of the economist, which is not

necessarily  always  the  kind  of  view  that   is

accepted by the person who suffers from the effects

of inflation, is that it is not possible to control

or  regulate prices in the way that has been  tried

and  found  unsuccessful. This is by price  control

which  merely means, as has been evidenced  in  the

recent  sugar crisis, that the commodity disappears

from  the  shops and the housewife  has  to  beg  a

favour  from the shop-keeper in order  to  get  her

usual supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another theme which Members played upon has been

the need to offset the effects of industrialisation

and avoid copying the methods or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



fashion  and  the way of life of the West,  and  to

spend more on cultural and other projects. There is

a  lot  to  be  said  for  turning  away  from  the

capitalistic,    materialistic   and    unspiritual

attitudes,  which  the modern urban  industrialised

society  normally  cultivates, into  more  cultural

projects  and  in  scientific and other  worthwhile

activities. This has been recognised already in the

Budget  to  the  extent that 50  per  cent  of  the

Expenditure is allotted for social development. The

distribution of the SO per cent between culture and

other  activities, like education, medical services

and  so  on, is a matter of judgment. I  hope  that

perhaps  we have achieved some balance. Of  course,

this  is  a  matter  on which the  views  of  every

ordinary citizen of Singapore would be valuable. In

fact, to the Economic Division of my Ministry,  the

amount  which has been spent for social development

has  given rise to some concern because we want  to

be   able   to   devote  to  economic   development

sufficient  funds to generate a surplus which  will

make  it  possible  for us to spend  money  on  the

social side of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another comment which is related to this is about

foreign workers and importation of foreign singers.

There  were  more luxuriant descriptions  given  to

these  people. The fact is that we do have quite  a

number  of foreign workers. But the plan, which  my

Ministry is trying to set up or develop, will  call

for  a reduction of these workers and it should  by

1975  result  in  a  very much less  dependence  on

foreign workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were comments also on the effects of

foreign    industrialists    as    against    local

industrialists. I would like to assure Members that

there  is no question of favouring one against  the

other.  The allocation of resources to industry  is

sufficient  to  take  care  of  both  the   foreign

industrialists  whom we welcome as  well  as  local

industrialists whom we want to promote,  and  whose

interest, in fact, is the reason why we have  begun

industrialisation.      The      intention       of

industrialisation is that finally our industry  and

commerce shall largely be in the hands of  our  own

entrepreneurs and workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also comments on the increase in

salaries  for  top civil servants, and  there  were

suggestions  that this revision should be  extended

to  technicians and other categories of workers.  I

would like to say that the principle which we  have

accepted  is that of being able to recruit  and  to

maintain the standard of the civil service. In  the

case  of  technicians, we recognise that they  have

certain  values, and in the scheme for daily  rated

workers   and   so   on  we  have   given   special

consideration to the pay which should be  given  to

craftsmen  as  well as technicians. On  the  higher

scale, of course, it is very much more difficult to

develop  a  technician  than  even  a  professional

engineer.  We would certainly spend very much  more

money   on   developing  as  many  technicians   as

possible.  In order to attract the young worker  to

become  a  more  highly  skilled  worker,   it   is

essential  that  technicians  be  adequately  paid.

Therefore,  there  is  no  question  that  wherever

necessary  the salary scales will be so revised  as

to enable us to recruit and maintain technicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the kind of general comments which

were  made.  In the case of many Members,  I  think

they  got  down  to rather more specific  instances

related to particular Ministries. I do not propose,

in  my  reply  to the Budget statement  debate,  to

touch on all these matters because they are matters

which  Members  will  be debating  again  when  the

Estimates  under various heads of expenditure  come

up  for consideration in Committee of Supply. On  a

fairly  general kind of question, e.g, the idea  of

improving  the housing programme which I have  also

mentioned  in  my  Budget statement,  most  Members

welcome  the  Plan for Government to  increase  the

number of housing units to 30,000 per year. Whether

the target should be extended beyond this to 40,000

is  also a matter of the constructional capacity of

the  industry and the availability of  supplies  of

materials,   cement,  steel,  sand   and   so   on,

sufficient  enough  for  40,000  units   per   year

construction.  If it is possible to  increase  this

rate, the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



will  need  no  urging  to increase  the  level  of

construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to private housing and the very escalated

prices, the comment was that some consideration  be

given to stimulating and perhaps making more easily

available  private housing to our own  citizens.  I

think   Members  should  be  aware  that   if   too

restrictive conditions are imposed, the effect  may

be  that  there  would be a lesser supply  of  such

private  housing,  even of the  terrace  and  semi-detached type of housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two comments were made on why I did not

touch on buses in my Budget statement. In a general

way, the question of transportation in Singapore is

of interest, but the plans for a mass rapid transit

system have not yet developed in any positive sense

to   enable  me  to  give  any  statement   on   an

alternative to the buses. I think the bus  services

have  been  working  somewhat better  perhaps  than

under the old system before they were rationalised.

But I recognise that there have been quite a lot of

deficiencies  in  the way of breakdowns  and  other

unsatisfactory practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also comments on my omitting

agriculture  and fisheries. I am not  unsympathetic

to  the need to give assistance to agriculture  and

fisheries,  but the problem really is in  what  way

can  this  be  done  in  an  island  as  small   as

Singapore.  Nevertheless, I  think  sufficient  has

been  done  by  the  Ministry of Law  and  National

Development  to  increase the  production  of  both

these  industries  by 10 per cent  over  last  year

which is very creditable, and we ought to recognise

the  contribution which our farmers and  fishermen,

whether   deep-sea  or  off-shore,  have  made   to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to make any detailed comment on

Education, which has been dealt with in some detail

as  far as the training of workers is concerned. On

water conservation, which the Member for Anson  has

raised,  and  on  environmental  pollution,  hawker

centres,  tourism  and labour, these  are  problems

which  can  be raised and answered by the Ministers

responsible for those subjects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have generally covered most of the

comments,  but I would like to end this debate  by

saying,  as  I  have said in my Budget  statement,

that  the  need for collaboration between  workers

and management requires to be emphasised if we are

to  maintain  the progress we have made  over  the

last  few  years. It is somewhat easy  for  us  to

forget  that  only ten years ago we have  a  large

scale unemployment problem and that the effect  of

the  jobs  which have been created since then  has

raised the standard of living of the family  unit,

if  not  of  the individual worker.  But  this  is

better  than  if we continued to have large  scale

unemployment  and  to have had some  workers  paid

much better while others arc totally unemployed. I

hope that the National Wages Council



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



will  find a satisfactory solution to the  problem

of  dividing the benefits which have been obtained

from our rapid growth rate of 13 per cent for last

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of

the Government for the financial year 1st April,
