<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>PETROL PUMP PRICES AND POWER SUPPLY</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  what  measures  are in place  to  ensure  that  for

sectors  where  there  is little or no competition,  such  as

local  oil  retailing and power supply, consumers'  interests

will  not be compromised by the tardy downward adjustment  or

non-adjustment of prices.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry what measures

can be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>

taken to address the apparent oligopolistic behaviour of  oil

companies in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry,  in view of the fact that crude oil prices  in  the

international  markets have fallen sharply in recent  months,

and  that there is supposedly free competition among the  oil

majors  in  Singapore,  why  have local  retail  pump  prices

remained at such high levels.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to

answer Question Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> MTI's study shows that petrol

pump prices have moved in tandem with crude oil prices in the

past, but with a time lag.  I would like to refer Members  to

charts   (Cols.  1405-1408)  1  and  2  circulated   earlier.

Historically, the fluctuation of petrol pump prices  is  also

not  as  sharp as crude oil prices, because crude oil is  not

the  only  cost  component of running a petrol  station.   In

fact, the proportion of crude oil price in the pump price  is

about  20%.  Looking at the charts, we can expect pump prices

to fall further if crude oil prices do not rise again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI has found no evidence of price fixing by the oil

companies.   Because the industry structure is oligopolistic,

and  the  supply chain is long, price movement  tends  to  be

sticky and the companies prefer to compete on free gifts  and

loyalty benefits.  Nevertheless, MTI is studying how  we  can

introduce  more competition into the petrol retail  business.

In   the  UK,  'white  pumpers',  which  are  petrol  pumping

facilities  annexed to supermarkets and commercial buildings,

have  brought  more  players  into  the  market.   They  have

injected more competition into the UK market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI will work with the Ministry of National

Development to study the feasibility of allowing such  "white

pump" sites,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>

but  without  compromising on fire safety  and  environmental

requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power supply sector will be liberalised later

this  year.   There will be additional electricity  retailers

besides  Power Supply.  These new retailers can  compete  for

the  larger consumers with customised competitive electricity

products.  Market forces will exert pressure on the retailers

to   innovate,  provide  better  service  and   keep   prices

competitive.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  whether  the Ministry of Trade and  Industry  would

consider taking other measures to stimulate competition among

the  oil  companies  in  Singapore,  such  as  introducing  a

competition  law or supporting CASE's call for oil  companies

to display their petrol prices at pylon signages?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> MTI is studying the

practicality of introducing a competition law for  Singapore.

It  can  introduce  more competition but it  can  also  cause

rigidity  in certain industry categories.  So we are  looking

at  the  pluses  and  minuses of such a competition  law  for

Singapore  and weighing the pros and cons.  For some  of  the

FTAs  that we are negotiating, having a competition law  will

be a subject for negotiation also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should require petrol pumps to

display  prices on pylons, I believe this is something  which

is better for CASE to raise, because we should not require it

by  regulation  that  they must display  their  prices  in  a

particular manner.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like

to  ask  the  Minister whether there could be possible  price

collusion  amongst the generating companies in  future  which

may influence pool prices instead?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

soon  be tabling legislation on the regulatory structure  for

increased competition in the power market.  This will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>

incorporate competition requirements and the power  companies

are  not  allowed to collude to fix prices.   The  regulatory

agency  will  have  the responsibility to ensure  that  price

collusion is detected and not allowed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, I

would  like  to ask the Minister whether he is aware  that  a

certain petrol company is offering as much as 10% discount on

petrol  price  and,  by offering 10% discount,  it  is  still

profitable, ie, there is still room for adjustment of  petrol

price.  In other words, it seems to be overpriced.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact

that  some  companies offer discounts shows that there  is  a

competitive dynamic at work and we should encourage more such

competition  by informing consumers that such  discounts  are

available to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> The

Minister speaks about introducing more competition.  Does his

Ministry  accept that if the Ministry reduced  this  3/4-tank

rule  that forbids Singaporeans getting cheaper petrol, there

would  be  much more competition and there would  be  greater

incentive  for  the  petrol companies  to  bring  down  their

prices?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the 3/4-tank rule addresses a completely different problem. Any

petrol  retailer in Singapore is free to import crude oil  or

refined  oil from any source outside Singapore.  There  is  a

3/4-tank rule because we in Singapore tax petrol at different

rates from those in Malaysia.  In fact, until recently, there

was  a  subsidy of petrol prices in Malaysia.   If  we  allow

motorcars  to  bring  in full tanks from Malaysia,  this,  in

fact,  gives consumers a chance to evade the taxes which  are

imposed in Singapore and this would have a negative effect on

our road usage policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister then saying that this

3/4-tank  rule was introduced simply to get in  more  revenue

for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>

the Singapore Government at the expense of Singaporeans?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the 3/4-tank rule was introduced to ensure the effectiveness of a

policy  designed as part of an overall programme  to  control

the use of cars and roads in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, would the Minister

be reviewing the PUB charges and other related charges in the

light of oil prices coming down?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

answer the question about PUB charges later on because  there

are other questions pertaining to this subject.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

ask  the  Minister, based on the charts, it does not seem  so

much that the petrol pump price lags behind movement in crude

oil  prices.   It is just that it has been static  and  moves

upwards  when  the  prices go up.  That  appears  to  be  the

pattern anyway.  So what would be the timeframe for any study

that the Ministry undertakes to introduce greater competition

in the industry structure at the retail level?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may

draw Members' attention to the charts, it is not true that it

is a straight line going upwards.  There are ups and downs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> It is not that it is a straight line

going  upwards,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, but  more  that  it  is  a

relatively less volatile line.  If I look at the chart, it is

quite  evident  that it has been quite flat,  notwithstanding

the movement upwards.  And the greatest movement seems to  be

when price moves up at retail petrol pumps.  The key question

is:  will  there be a timeframe for this review to  introduce

greater competition at the retail level?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our

statisticians have looked at the charts and have  not  found,

on  the  basis of the charts, the conclusion which Mr Iswaran

has  drawn,  that  the charts only move  up  and  are  sticky

downwards.  In fact, they reflect a certain evening out of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>

the  volatility.   We  are  looking  at  the  possibility  of

introducing more players into the market by studying  whether

we   can  introduce  "white  pumps"  into  Singapore  without

compromising on safety.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRICITY TARIFFS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Lowering)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether his Ministry will take immediate action  to

lower  electricity  tariffs  for industrial,  commercial  and

domestic  consumers as international crude  oil  prices  have

fallen substantially in the recent months.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in August

last  year,  I  explained in Parliament that our  electricity

tariffs are reviewed quarterly based on fuel oil price at the

time  of  review.   Changes in fuel  oil  prices  are  passed

through  to  consumers.   If oil price  increases  after  the

review, Power Supply would have under-collected.  If, on  the

other hand, oil price decreases, Power Supply would then have

over-collected.  Power Supply is allowed to recover its under-collected  revenue or, alternatively, is required  to  return

over-collected revenue to consumers in subsequent quarters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last tariff adjustment was made in August last year

based  on fuel oil price of US$24 per barrel.  To reduce  the

impact  of  last August's tariff increase, Power  Supply  had

agreed  to recover its under-collected revenue over a  longer

period  than  the usual three months.  For large non-domestic

consumers, the collection was made over five months,  ie,  by

end  of  last  year.  For residential and small  non-domestic

consumers, it was made over eight months, ie, the recovery of

the  under-collection would only be completed by  March  this

year.  If Power Supply had been allowed to recover its under-collected  revenue over the usual 3-month period, the  tariff

increases in August last year would have been much higher and

more severe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel oil prices had subsequently increased to a high of

US$28 per barrel

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>

in  October  2000.  Fuel price averaged US$25 per  barrel  in

November  2000 before easing to US$21 per barrel in  December

2000.   As  a  result,  Power  Supply,  which  had  kept  the

electricity   tariffs  unchanged  since  August   2000,   has

continued to under-collect.  The revenue under-collected from

residential  and small non-domestic consumers is larger  than

that  from  large non-domestic consumers because  the  tariff

increase  in August 2000 was lower for residential and  small

non-domestic  consumers.  In other words, we  had  chosen  to

smoothen the volatility over a longer period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, Power Supply had applied to raise

the  electricity tariffs further based on the high  fuel  oil

price  in  October  2000 which was US$28 per  barrel.   Power

Supply  subsequently revised the tariff adjustment  with  the

easing fuel price.  PUB has assessed and accepted the revised

adjustment.   With  effect  from February  2001,  electricity

tariffs  for large non-domestic consumers will be reduced  by

0.15 cents per kilowatt hour on average.  However, in view of

Power Supply's substantial under-collection from domestic and

small  non-domestic consumers, there is still a need  for  an

upward  adjustment of 1.41 cts/kwh for these consumers  until

April  this  year.  If not for the easing of fuel oil  price,

this  increase for them would have been even  more.   But  if

fuel  oil  price continues to fall, electricity tariffs  will

eventually fall.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I wish to thank the Minister for the very detailed answer but

I  have  a few queries. Firstly, will the present formula  of

having a quarterly review be reviewed because it seems like a

long  stretch  to wait for three months to do  an  adjustment

and, especially in the environment now where we are seeing  a

falling  of  oil  prices, there should  be  a  more  frequent

review?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, this formula that the Minister explained

seems to be causing a lot of lumpiness in the calculation and

computation of trying to recover the past losses.  I want  to

ask whether this formula can also be reviewed and whether the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>

Government actually imputes into it a profit element for  the

power  companies  because,  if  that  is  so,  it  means  the

Government is actually protecting these companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last question is, in view of this situation, will the

Government introduce more competition in the industry, as  he

mentioned   earlier,   to  allow  for   private   electricity

producers?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Leong has

raised  a  very fundamental question of how we  overcome  the

problem  of price volatility.  The stock market goes  up  and

down,  day  by  day,  and  we  do  not  want  the  day-by-day

volatility to be passed on directly to consumers.  So we  try

to  even  them out.  In the case of petrol pumps, the evening

out  is  over  such  a long period that when  prices  do  not

respond immediately to price drop in crude prices, members of

the  public are upset.  But we also recognise that if we pass

all  the volatility, you also create great disturbance in the

market.  If you look at the public transport companies,  they

have fuel equalisation funds.  In theory, Power Supply can go

into  the  futures  market.  But they can also  guess  wrong.

There is no simple solution to this.  And what we are working

towards is letting the market settle the price structure.  In

other words, if you are a company which is very dependent  on

energy  and you want stable electricity prices, you negotiate

for  that.   You go into a long-term contract.   If  you  are

comfortable with month-by-month volatility, then that is what

you  get.   We  will be able to do this once the  electricity

market in Singapore is deregulated which we intend to do  for

big consumers later this year and for everybody in one or two

years' time.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE GENERAL HOSPITAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Hike in consultation fees for specialist-outpatient clinics)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health how does

his Ministry (i) justify the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>

big  hike  of  70%  in the consultation fees for  specialist-outpatient clinics (SOCs) at the Singapore General  Hospital;

and  (ii) ensure the affordability of specialist care to  the

lower-income Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Health (a)

what  is the justification for the Singapore General Hospital

(SGH)  to  increase  with effect from 1st December  2000  its

consultation charges at specialist-outpatient clinics  by  as

high  as  up  to 70%; and (b) what productivity  and  control

measures are put in place by his Ministry to prevent, in  the

future,  spiral increases in operation costs and  charges  by

SGH  and other Government-linked hospitals with no regard  to

the affordability of the average Singaporean.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  can  I  be  permitted to take Question  Nos.  5  and  6

together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me put the recent SGH specialist

outpatient fee increases in perspective. The 70% increase  in

consultation fee applies only to private patients  on  repeat

visits  to  the  senior consultants, the  most  senior  grade

specialist in the hospital.  In absolute terms, the  increase

is  from $32 to $55.  The rate of $32 before SGH's recent fee

revision  was  close to the charges of GPs and therefore  not

reflective of the actual cost of specialist care rendered  by

a   senior  consultant.   Therefore,  the  relatively  larger

increase  is to better reflect the actual cost of  specialist

care as well as to close the fee differential for initial and

repeat visits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 70% increase in consultation fee does not apply

across-the-board.   For private patients on  initial  visits,

the  SOC consultation fees were raised by $13 to $18 and  now

range  from  $60  to $80, depending on the seniority  of  the

doctor.   This is an average increase of 30%.  If we look  at

the  total  bill size, which includes prescription and  other

investigations  which patients are more concerned  with,  the

increase for private SOC patients is about 12%.  As the  last

time SGH revised its SOC fees was in June 1997, the recent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>

fee revision should therefore not be deemed excessive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While fees for healthcare services would have to be

revised  regularly, my Ministry will ensure that the cost  of

subsidised  healthcare remains affordable.   We will  provide

heavy  subsidies to moderate fee increases so that healthcare

continues  to remain accessible and affordable to the  middle

and low income Singaporeans.  In this recent fee increase  by

SGH,  the consultation fees for subsidised patients, for both

initial and repeat visits, were raised by $4 to $21.   So for

subsidised patients, whether they see the consultant for  the

first  time  or  for  repeat visits, they  pay  $21  for  the

consultation fee.  This increase is reasonable given that the

last  time  SGH revised its subsidised SOC consultation  fees

was  way  back  in  1993.  As for the  total  bill  size  for

subsidised SOC patients, the increase was kept to about 8%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGH's fee revision is unavoidable, given the economic

recovery and the need for SGH to keep up with the increase in

its  operating cost, contributed largely by manpower, medical

supplies    and   medical   equipment.    Nonetheless,    our

restructured hospitals will always be mindful of the need  to

moderate the increase in healthcare cost.  As such, they have

undertaken  various  productivity and cost  saving  measures,

including  bulk  purchasing  and e-procurement  of  supplies,

implementation  of  electronic  medical  records  system  and

skills   redevelopment  programmes  to  deliver   more   cost

effective and efficient healthcare services to Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans who still cannot afford to pay even the

highly  subsidised rates due to financial hardship, they  can

always  apply  for Medifund help. I would like  to  give  the

House  my  assurance  that  no Singaporeans  will  be  denied

essential medical care because of their inability to pay.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the

Minister  whether he has a breakdown on the cost  of  running

specialist  outpatient  clinics,  whether  the  increases  of

charges could have been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>

spread out in stages and whether part of the cost could  have

been defrayed or absorbed by the hospitals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fee structure of

our  SOCs is a little out of sync and therefore we have taken

this  opportunity  to try and re-align  it  correctly.  As  I

explained  earlier, the SOC fee is structured accordingly  to

whether  you  see  a  senior  consultant,  consultant  or   a

Registrar.  So it is structured based on the seniority of the

people you see.  It is also structured on whether you see the

consultant for the first time or for repeat visits.  Based on

this  structure,  we  have a set of  fees.  For  the  private

patients, the higher end of this structure will be  when  you

see  the senior consultant for the first time and that  would

now  cost $80.  If you see the Registrar for a repeat  visit,

which  is  the other end of the structure, it will  cost  you

$35.  So that is the range of fees.  And to see a consultant,

as  a private patient, paying this range of fees from $80  or

$35,  I think, is a reasonable reflection of the actual  cost

of the consultant rendering the service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a subsidised patient, we also follow this structure.

But because of the very heavy Government subsidy, we charge a

single  rate of  $21 to see a consultant and we do not  vary,

whether by senior consultant, consultant or Registrar, and we

do not vary whether it is an initial visit or a repeat visit.

So  for  subsidised patients, every time they go to the  SOC,

the  consultation  fee  is  a  flat  $21.   But  for  private

patients,  we  adopt  this structure to  better  reflect  the

costs.  For the subsidised patients, as I have explained, the

fees  have  not  been revised since 1993  and  even  in  this

revision, we have raised it by only $4.  $4 over $17 is a big

percentage  increase,  $1 over $17  is  a  6%  increase.   So

raising  it by only $4, is already an increase of  24%.   But

$21, I think Members will agree with me, is a very affordable

cost  to  pay  to see a senior consultant in the restructured

hospitals.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether the reason

for  the hike in specialist outpatient clinic charges  is  to

address the cost of running such clinics

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>

or  to  address the long waiting times?  If it is the latter,

could  other  avenues,  such  as  administrative  policy  and

efficacy  improvements  be sought first  before  raising  the

charges?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It is related because we are under

recovering.   Because  it is relatively  inexpensive,  people

will come to see the specialists. When a specialist's cost is

just  slightly above a GP's, Singaporeans will all  troop  to

see  the  specialist instead of going to the GP.  I think  we

have  to  have  a  sensible structure  so  that  there  is  a

differentiation in the fee structure between a specialist and

a  GP.   But,  at  the  same time, we know  that  costs  have

increased and in running a healthcare system, 60% of the cost

is  manpower  cost, and the public sector is  losing  doctors

very   rapidly.  We  have  to  adjust  the  pay   and   other

remuneration structure for the public sector doctors and that

goes  into the cost.  The Government subsidises this  portion

but part of that cost increase will have to be recovered from

the fee increases.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Do I understand, when the Minister talks

about  private patients, he is referring to patients referred

by private medical practitioners?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Under our system, if you have stayed

in  a  B2 or C class ward in a hospital, and you later return

to  the  SOC  for follow-up treatment, you are treated  as  a

subsidised  patient.   If you visit the  polyclinic  and  the

polyclinic's GP refers you to a specialist, you  are  treated

as a subsidised patient.  If you go to the SOC on your own or

you are referred to by a private sector GP, then we treat you

as a private patient.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Ministry realise that this may

put specialist care out of reach to about 40% of our people?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Anybody who wants to be treated as a

subsidised patient can easily go to a polyclinic, be seen  by

the  GP there and if his condition requires specialist  care,

the GP will refer him to the specialist outpatient clinic and

he will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>

treated  as a subsidised patient. So I do not know  where  he

got  the 40% from.  Today, if you go to a polyclinic and  you

are  suffering  from a major ailment and you need  to  see  a

specialist, the GP will refer you to a SOC, and you  will  be

treated as a subsidised patient.

<div align="center"><b>WATER SUPPLY IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Plans to achieve self-sufficiency)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry in

relation  to  the supply of water to Singapore,  whether  his

Ministry  has any plans to achieve a breakthrough in  gaining

greater self-sufficiency.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry what is the Government's water strategy in the  face

of  an  imminent  threat of water cut-off from  the  external

supply  sources  and  what is the progress  of  the  proposed

seawater desalination plant projects.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Question No. 7,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

permission,  I would like to answer Question  Nos.  7  and  8

together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> There is no threat of water

cut-off from Malaysia. Our water agreements with Malaysia are

for  the  long  term.   In fact, we are  negotiating  for  an

extension to the water agreements, and for an increase in the

long-term supply of Malaysian water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ensure that our water strategy is robust by

diversifying our sources. This includes both local sources as

well  as sources outside Singapore. To maximise water  yield,

we  have invested heavily in pollution control to protect our

local  catchments.   As a result, 50% of  our  land  area  is

currently used as catchments.  Over the next 10 years, we can

increase  this further to 65%, which will increase the  yield

proportionately.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also invested heavily in infrastructure to

collect  and  treat  all  water  used  in  Singapore   before

discharging  it into the sea. Because this water  is  already

being  treated to a very high standard, it is a huge untapped

source  of fresh water for Singapore. With further treatment,

most of this water can be re-used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-use of treated water is not new. In countries

with  long  riverine  systems, upstream communities  use  the

water and discharge the used water after treatment back  into

the  river. Successive downstream communities then reuse  the

water several times, before the river finally flows into  the

sea.  Examples include the Mississippi, the Thames, the Rhine

and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we recycle only about 5% of our water for

industrial  use. We will do much more.  The Ministry  of  the

Environment is doubling the capacity of its industrial  water

plant  in Jurong to meet the needs of new industries in  Tuas

and  on  Jurong  Island.  Until recently, the  constraint  to

greater  recycling  was  cost.   This,  happily,  is  falling

rapidly.   New technology is producing superior  filters  and

membranes,  and this is significantly reducing  the  cost  of

micro-filtration  and  reverse  osmosis.    It   has   become

economically  attractive to recycle used  water  on  a  large

scale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have built a demonstration plant at the Bedok

Wastewater  Treatment Works, to treat used  water  to  ultra-clean  standards.   It has now operated  for  more  than  six

months.   The treated water is purer than PUB water  and  far

exceeds  WHO  drinking water standards.  We  are  ramping  up

production of this ultra-clean water, which we call  NEWater,

for  those industries which require large quantities of high-grade  water,  such as wafer fabrication plants.   Within  10

years,  NEWater to our industries can easily meet 15% of  our

total water demand in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To diversify our water sources further, PUB will proceed

with  the  seawater desalination project.  We will install  a

desalination capacity of 30 million gallons per day by  2005.

PUB  expects  to  call  tenders  for  supply  of  desalinated

seawater

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>

by the private sector in the second half of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these developments, our long-term supply of water

will be more diversified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rivers, reservoirs, drainage systems and water

treatment works should all be managed in an integrated manner

to  optimize  the use of our water resources.  They  are  all

parts  of the same water cycle.  The Government has therefore

decided  to  restructure  the PUB  by  merging  the  Drainage

Department  and  Sewerage Department of ENV  with  the  Water

Department  of  PUB.   The restructured PUB,  which  will  in

effect  be  the  water authority, will be  placed  under  the

Environment Ministry, instead of MTI.  This will take  effect

from  1st April 2001, subject to the legislation being passed

by  this House.  This will close the loop for water and allow

us  to  take  full  advantage of advances in water  treatment

technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI will establish a new statutory board called the

Energy  Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) to take over  the

regulation  of the electricity and gas industries which  come

under PUB today.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I understand

that  25% of our water could be collected locally.  With  two

metres  of  rainfall a year in Singapore, it is  1.2  billion

cubic metres of water and our annual requirement is only  480

million cubic metres.  Why is it not enough to collect  water

locally?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have got to

look at the Member's calculations.  As far as I can remember,

even  if we were to collect every drop of rain that falls  in

Singapore, it is still not enough to meet our needs.  That is

why we require fairly large catchments in Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister when does he

expect  us  to be able to be self-sufficient in  water?   And

what  other contingency measures do we have to meet the water

problems?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, our objective is not to

become  self  sufficient in water.  We have good  water  from

Malaysia, which we expect will continue for a long, long time

to  come.  Of course, we supplement those sources with  local

supply by various technological means.

<div align="center"><b>FALUNGONG MEMBERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs if he will inform the House as to  the  actions

taken,  and  the  reasons for the actions, against  Falungong

members in the recent public demonstration on New Year's Eve.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  what view the Government takes, and the Government's

policy, on the followers of the Falungong living in Singapore

and  whether  the Government considers them a threat  to  the

peace and security of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, may I

take Question Nos. 9 and 10 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the Falungong society

was  registered as a society in Singapore in July 1996, under

the  name of "Falun Buddha Society (Singapore)".  As with all

other  registered  societies, the Falun  Buddha  Society  can

carry  out its activities as long as such activities  do  not

contravene any of our laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question by Prof. Chin, on New Year's Eve,

acting  on  information  received,  the  Police  arrived   at

MacRitchie  Reservoir Park.  There they observed an  assembly

of  about  60 persons.  Having ascertained that the  assembly

had  gathered  without a permit, the assembly was  warned  to

disperse.   Some  of them then dispersed.   Subsequently,  15

persons  were arrested by the Police for holding an  assembly

without  a permit.  On 2nd January this year, the 15  persons

were charged in the Subordinate Courts for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>

offences  under  section  4(1)(a) of  the  Miscellaneous  Act

(Public  Order  and  Nuisance) (Assemblies  and  Processions)

Rules [holding an assembly without a permit] and section  186

of  the  Penal  Code  [obstructing a public  servant  in  the

discharge of his public functions].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these matters are now pending in the Subordinate

Courts.   I  have  been  informed by  the  Attorney-General's

Chambers  that the accused persons have indicated  that  they

would  be making representations with respect to the  charges

preferred.  For these reasons, it will not be appropriate for

me to go into further details of the cases today.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I do not intend to go into the facts

of  what took place at MacRitchie Reservoir.  Again, I regret

it  is the Minister of State who is answering these questions

on  policy.  Will the Minister of State tell us, in the first

place,  what  is  wrong for members of  any  society,  be  it

cultural  or  athletic society, to gather together  somewhere

and  sing songs or put up messages promoting arts, sports  or

whatever  it is?  And why was it necessary for the Police  to

declare this illegal?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I am not sure whether the

question is related to the Question before the House, because

Mr  Jeyaretnam surely cannot be saying that the assembly that

took  place at MacRitchie Reservoir was an innocuous assembly

where  they gathered just to sing songs and it is a  cultural

event.   If  any group wants to meet and assemble,  they  can

apply  for a permit under the Miscellaneous Act (Public Order

and  Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules, and indeed

these  have  been given.  On the ground, the  Police  has  to

assess what is the objective and whether or not there will be

potential  law  and order and breach of peace problems.   But

the  key point really is that in this event that took  place,

no  application was made for a permit.  And when  the  Police

went  there, they clarified that with the group and therefore

they have breached the law.  I think that is the basic point.

They have breached the law.  Police had to act and the matter

is now before the court.  Let us see what the court says.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the Minister ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister of State saying ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Jeyaretnam. Mr Sin Boon Ann has

the floor.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

of  State whether the Government will move to act against the

Falungong  society if they are perceived to have a  political

agenda, other than just an exercise group.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, of course, this is a

hypothetical  question.  The point  right  now  is  that  the

society is a registered society and there is no reason to act

against  the society.  Indeed, the society issued a statement

saying that it did not have prior knowledge of the event  and

that  it  would not condone any of its members breaching  the

law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Will the Minister of State tell us why

were  the  facilities  of rooms that  were  offered  to  this

society to conduct classes suddenly withdrawn?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> What facilities is Mr

Jeyaretnam talking about?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Were they not given facilities in

community centres to conduct their classes?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, if Mr Jeyaretnam knows

what happens on the ground, Falungong practitioners gather to

do  their qigong exercises in many locations in Singapore, in

parks  and  other  places.  As to what  individual  community

clubs conduct, it is up to the community clubs.  If they feel

that  there is no necessity to conduct an activity, it is  up

to the community club to decide.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

of  State whether the Falungong society has ever applied  any

permit to conduct public demonstrations or the like?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The society has applied for

various permits before.  Over the last few years, they have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>

conducted  some  activities which have  been  approved.   For

example,  they have applied for permits to give lectures  and

talks on qigong exercises, and these have been approved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Will the Minister of State confirm that

these  facilities were withdrawn after the People's  Republic

of China started the crackdown on their members in China?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as I have said, it is up

to  the  community clubs to decide whether or  when  to  hold

whatever activities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister of State was there

a  direction sent by the Chairman of the People's Association

to these community centres to withdraw these facilities?  May

we have a direct answer?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Not that I know of, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Could you find out?

Minister  of  State  how  many  of  those  involved  in  this

particular demonstration were Singaporeans and how many  were

non-citizens?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, out of the 15 Falungong

practitioners  who were arrested, two were  Singaporeans  and

the rest were non-Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May we have an assurance from this

Government that it will not take orders from Beijing?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Surely Mr Jeyaretnam cannot

expect  an answer.  We are a sovereign country and we act  by

what is in Singapore's interest.

steps  and precautions is his Ministry taking to prevent  the

Mad  Cow  Disease  or bovine spongiform encephalopathy  (BSE)

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (AVA)

and  the Food Control Department (FCD) of the Ministry of the

Environment (ENV) have taken several steps to ensure that our

food supply is free from BSE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore was among the first countries in the world to

impose  restrictions  on  beef and beef  products  from  BSE-affected  countries.  Only countries that  can  certify  that

they  have  been  free from BSE for at least  six  years  are

allowed  to export beef and food containing beef to Singapore

either  directly or through third countries. Food  containing

beef  in  this case include sausages, canned beef, beef  soup

stocks, instant beef noodles and gelatin.  Why the six years?

The  6-year period was determined from the incubation  period

of the disease in cattle, which can be up to five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA checks all consignments of beef and beef products at

the  point  of entry. It also works closely with the  Customs

and  Excise Department to detect smuggling of beef  and  beef

products.   ENV conducts regular checks on the  retailers  to

ensure  that  the  processed food  containing  beef  or  beef

ingredients are imported from the BSE-free countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA and ENV will continue to closely monitor the BSE situation around the world to prevent BSE from entering our food supply.

(a)  how many Education Officers have been disciplined by his

Ministry or referred to the police, from 1996-2000;  and  (b)

how  many of these cases related to the molestation or  abuse

of students.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K. Wong) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

from  1996 to 2000, a total of 186 discipline cases involving

Education Officers were handled by the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these 186 cases, 17 were referred to the police. Of

these  cases referred to the police, eight were cases related

to  students comprising six cases of alleged molest  and  two

for improper use of corporal punishment on students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of cases dealt with by the Public Service

Commission or my Ministry's own disciplinary proceedings  are

not  related  to  students.   For  those  cases  related   to

punishment.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, notwithstanding the small

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Yes, in fact, students are encouraged to

teachers and staff members.  But having said that, all  these

things  are not foolproof.  With all the screening, with  all

<div align="center"><b>TEACHER-TO-STUDENT RATIO IN SCHOOLS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Noris Ong

Chin Guan -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. To ask the Minister for Education, in view of the

prevalence  of  and  growing demand for  private  tuition  in

Singapore,  whether his Ministry will consider (i)  improving

the   teacher-to-student  ratio  in  our  schools,  and  (ii)

extending the current amount of teaching time in our  schools

so that students can receive more attention and coaching from

their teachers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Question No. 13, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, demand for tuition in Singapore is driven by  a

number of factors, the most significant being the aspirations

parents have for their children.  Parents often want to  give

their  children more than what schools provide.  However,  as

parents,  we  should  be  mindful  of  the  impact  that  our

expectations have on our children's learning experiences  and

stress levels.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong suggested that we should consider raising the

teacher-to-student ratio and the amount of teaching  time  in

our  schools so that students can receive more coaching  from

their  teachers.   It  is not more time in  school  that  our

students  need.   The  Third  International  Mathematics  and

Science  Study  (TIMSS)  1999  found  that  the  total   time

Singapore  students spend in school yearly is  close  to  the

international average.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools currently provide adequate time and

attention  to pupils to learn their academic subjects  fully.

Teachers  give remedial classes to those who need  help  with

their  school  work.   At  the primary  level,  the  Learning

Support  Programme (LSP) and the Encouraging Achievement  and

Better Learning (ENABLE) Programme give additional support to

pupils who are identified to be weak in language and numeracy

skills, or are underachieving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On past occasions, we have received calls from some

Members  of this House that schools should in fact  do  less,

and  avoid  overloading  the  students.   We  have  cut  back

curriculum,  wherever  possible,  to  provide  students   and

teachers   with  time  for  a  more  well-rounded  education.

Curriculum  content was reduced by 10-30% in 1999,  and  more

emphasis  given to the development of critical  and  creative

thinking  skills.   At  the  same  time,  we  reinforced  the

importance of co-curricular activities to develop core skills

and values among our pupils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools therefore offer a holistic and broad-based

development of the individual.  There are parents  who  still

<div align="center"><b>RETAIL TRADERS IN HDB ESTATES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry whether his Ministry has any data on how the  retail

traders are faring in the Housing and Development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>

Board  estates  and  if anything can be done  to  help  these

traders if they are faring poorly.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, retailers in

HDB  estates have seen modest improvement in sales after  the

Asian  crisis.   This  is in line with the  recovery  of  the

overall retail trade.  Sales of HDB retailers fell by 12%  in

1998, but picked up by 1.2% in 1999 and 3.3% in the first  10

months of 2000, lagging behind overall growth in retail sales

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance varied among retail segments and shops.

While  shops  selling  telecommunications  equipment  enjoyed

brisk  sales, provision shops, supermarkets as well as  watch

and jewellery retailers generally did not fare well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the problems faced by HDB retailers include keen

competition,  limited  selection  of  merchandise,  lack   of

economies  of  scale,  and the inability  to  utilise  modern

technology   and   methods  of  business  management.    Many

consumers  prefer  to  shop  at larger  one-stop  malls  than

patronise  smaller HDB retailers.  As a result, a  number  of

small retailers have experienced a squeeze in margins.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a short-term measure to help its shop tenants cope

with  the  increase in business costs, HDB  will  extend  its

rental  rebates  for another year to 31st December  2001,  at

half  of  the levels last year.  It will continue to  stagger

the  rental  increase  to  market levels  for  assignment  of

tenancies, subletting cases and for tenants who are  renewing

their  tenancies for the third time.  Shop lessees  can  also

apply  to  convert to shorter leases to reduce  the  cost  of

servicing their mortgage loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the longer term, the Singapore Productivity and

Standards Board (PSB) and Retail Promotion Centre (RPC)  work

closely together to help HDB shops upgrade and increase their

productivity  through various programmes.  This includes  the

promotion  of  franchising  and economic  groupings  to  help

overcome  size constraints.  The Retail Operation  Assistance

Programme (ROAP) will help

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>

shops  to spruce up and keep track of stocks.  To-date, about

1,200 HDB retailers have signed up for this programme.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether the

presently  available  Retail Operation  Assistance  Programme

that he mentioned is successfully taken up and whether such a

programme  will  be  further improved and  more  aggressively

promoted?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Since February last year, MTI

has  made  PSB  the  lead agency to help the  retail  sector.

Generally  speaking,  those  who are  interested  to  upgrade

themselves  or  introduce modern methods of  management,  eg,

franchising,  inventory control, will  get  ready  assistance

from  PSB.   The problem with many of our retailers  is  that

their  children  are  not interested  to  join  the  parents'

businesses.   The  proprietors and proprietresses  themselves

are  not able to keep up with the new technology and so  they

languish  in prolonged decline.  These are difficult problems

for  us.  There is really an over-supply of retail shop space

in  our HDB estates, and we must find a way to make it easier

for  them to exit their businesses.  In this regard,  MTI  is

working with MND to see how we can facilitate exit.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

whether  MTI and MND could also work together to allow  those

retailers who are facing difficulties in their original trade

to  vary their businesses so that they can take on what  they

regard  as being more lucrative trades while they are holding

the lease to such HDB retail properties?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, over the

years,  we  have liberalised these regulations and  we  shall

continue  to  do  so.   We  should not introduce  unnecessary

rigidity to industry restructuring.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he would

consider  setting  up  a committee with representatives  from

retailers  in  HDB estates to look into their  difficulty  so

that his Ministry can render them more effective assistance?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a

comprehensive outreach programme right now through PSB  which

works closely with various retail associations and the Retail

Promotion  Centre.  So it is not as if there  is  a  lack  of

communication.  There is a lot of communication.  The problem

is  the  inability  of  some of our  retailers  to  make  the

necessary  adjustment.   As I said  earlier,  those  who  are

prepared  to make the adjustment will be able to tap  upon  a

wide range of programmes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> I am in support

of  what  Prof.  Chin said just now.  I would  like  to  know

whether  HDB would allow shop tenants to change their  trades

or  bring in new partners without having to increase the shop

rentals to the market level.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

mentioned  earlier that where we can liberalise to allow  for

greater flexibility in the trades which retail shops want  to

go  into, we should.  Where rentals are subsidised, then  the

problem  arises when you, in fact, transfer all  or  part  of

your  lease  to somebody else, whether you will  still  enjoy

those  subsidies or you will be brought up to  market,  is  a

question  for HDB and MND to answer.  Mr Tay could pose  this

question  to the Minister for National Development.   He  has

just indicated to me that he is very happy to answer it.

<div align="center"><b>SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Impact of economic recovery)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) why

is  it  that  a  large  number of  businesses  and  employees

especially those in the small and medium enterprises  do  not

feel the impact of last year's economic recovery despite  the

robust GDP growth; and (b) is this situation likely to worsen

in view of the likely slowdown in the US economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Question No. 15,

Sir.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the overall

economy  grew by a strong 10.1% in 2000.  All sectors enjoyed

robust   growth  except  construction,  which  continued   to

contract.   However, the performance was highly mixed  within

each  sector, with some segments doing very well  and  others

not as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, although the manufacturing sector expanded

by 15% in the first 11 months last year overall, this was due

largely  to the 27% growth in the electronics industry.   The

food  and  beverage,  wood and paper products,  construction-related   materials,  basic  metals,  petroleum  and   marine

industries grew by less than 4%.  These industries  accounted

for about one-fifth of manufacturing firms and jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the retail sector, although overall retail

sales grew by a strong 25% (in volume terms) in the first  10

months of last year, much of the growth came from the sale of

motor  vehicles, telecommunications equipment and  computers.

Supermarkets,  provision  and sundry  shops,  and  watch  and

jewellery retailers experienced poorer business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the growth was uneven, those in the slow-growing

segments  did not feel the effect of the recovery.   Many  of

them  are  SMEs.  In fact, many of them asked me,  where  was

this  10.1%  growth which was put out.  The  reason  is  that

growth  has been uneven and depending on where you  are,  you

may, in fact, feel it even more strongly or less strongly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the slowdown of the US economy, this would

moderate our GDP growth.  Most analysts currently expect  the

US  to  grow by 2.5-3% this year, down from about 5%  in  the

year  2000.   MTI projects that Singapore's GDP  growth  will

slow  down accordingly to 5-7% this year.  But if there is  a

crash landing in the US, then the forecast will change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most businesses will be affected by the slower economic

growth,  but SMEs should be more vulnerable.  SMEs will  have

to find ways to improve productivity, develop better products

and explore new markets - not just SMEs, but all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>

companies.   And the Government has many programmes  to  help

SMEs to do so.

<div align="center"><b>POWER SUPPLY LTD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Revamp of billing system)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether Singapore Power Ltd (SP) (i) has  completed

its  revamp of its billing system and how many percent of its

customers are now being billed correctly on time; (ii) is  in

compliance  with  the service standards  established  by  the

Public  Utilities Board with regard to billing  customers  on

time;  and  (iii)  has  an assistance scheme  to  help  those

customers  who  do  not have the means to pay  the  lump  sum

payment  as  a  result  of  SP's failure  to  bill  over  the

preceding months.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Power Supply

Ltd  had  implemented  a new Customer  Management  System  to

replace   its  old  billing  system.   However,  during   the

transition period in June last year, Power Supply encountered

data migration problems, which affected the system operation.

This resulted in a delay in the generation of utilities bills

as  well  as inaccuracies in billing amounts.  As at December

last  year, Power Supply had not completed the revamp of  its

computerised billing system.  They tried to make improvements

and  the improvements by the system implementor created  even

more  bugs.  So they had brought in a team from the  original

software  supplier which is SAP of Germany, a very  reputable

firm,  and  they  are  working hard to resolve  the  problem.

Today, 88% of customers are receiving their monthly bills  on

time.   But this is obviously far from being good enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power Supply is required under the Electricity Supply

Code  to bill its customers promptly every month.  Since July

last  year, PUB had been receiving complaints from  customers

about  the  delay in billing.  PUB took this  up  with  Power

Supply immediately and directed them to take swift action  to

correct its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>

billing  system.  For breaching the Electricity Supply  Code,

PUB  had  imposed a total fine of $150,000 on Power Supply  - comprising $100,000 in October for the delay in billing and a

further  $50,000  in  December for  failure  to  resolve  its

billing  problems.  This is to send a strong signal to  Power

Supply  that  we take the matter very seriously  although  it

provides no comfort to customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lessen the impact on customers, Power Supply has

arranged to space out bills sent to customers by at least  18

days.   The  payment schedule for these bills  was  similarly

extended.  Customers would not be required to pay a lump  sum

for  the  delayed bills, if they do not wish to do so.   They

can  pay  by  instalments.  Power Supply has also  given  the

assurance that utilities supply will not be disconnected  due

to unpaid bills during this period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power Supply has indicated that they have overcome the

teething problems of their new billing system and more  bills

are   now   being   dispatched.   They   expect   significant

improvements  by  March  this year and  the  billing  process

should  be normalised by the middle of this year.  So  it  is

taking a very long time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to ask the

Minister  whether  he considers the penalty  imposed  so  far

deterrent  enough  to  Power Supply.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the

amount  seems  to  be  rather  small  in  comparison  to  the

operation  of  Power Supply, being a billion dollar  company.

Secondly,  how do we prevent Power Supply, being a  monopoly,

to pass on the penalty to the consumers anyway?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I suppose PUB

could have increased the fine on Power Supply, but that would

not have resolved the problem.  Power Supply had inherited  a

mainframe  computer and, to prepare for a liberalised  energy

market,  they  had embarked on a programme to install  a  new

billing system.  So they got SAP from Germany to provide  the

software  and  a  system  implementor  from  New  Zealand  to

operationalise  it.   The system was tested  last  year.   It

worked during the test.  They encountered

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>

enormous  problems when the system was implemented, tried  to

fix  the  problems, new bugs appeared.  So  one  thing  after

another.  The system implementor is no longer working on  the

problem  because  they do not seem to  be  making  very  much

headway.  We have gone back to the original software supplier

and  we hope in the coming months, the problem can be solved.

It  is very unfortunate and, being a regulated monopoly,  PUB

and  MTI  must  take overall responsibility for the  problems

that have been caused to consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the future? Once the retail market is opened

up,  then  billing  becomes competitive.  And  in  fact,  the

company  doing  the  billing may  not  be  the  one  actually

supplying the electricity.  So a market will develop  and  we

hope that the market will regulate the quality of service.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like to ask the Minister whether Power Supply  would

consider stating explicitly in its bill, perhaps in red, that

the  customer  may be able to pay in instalments,  if  he  so

wishes.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will put

this to PUB.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I would like to ask the Minister how

do we restore confidence of the consumers on the billing sent

out  by  Power  Supply because there are  reported  incidents

where those bills were outrageously way off the mark and  yet

they  were sent out.  Also, are there customers who,  because

of  such mistakes, felt that they should terminate their GIRO

transactions with Power Supply?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with

Dr  Wang  that the problems in the billing have  damaged  the

reputation  of  Power  Supply and public  confidence  in  the

entire  billing system.  So the only way for us to go forward

is  to freely admit our mistakes, be very transparent in what

we  have  done, what we hope to do and to restore  confidence

bit  by  bit,  layer by layer.  It will be painstaking  work.

Power  Supply  must  work with MPs and community  leaders  to

explain the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>

situation fully to members of the public.  It will take time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Has Power Supply

taken  steps  to refund the consumers whom they have  wrongly

billed?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, of

course, and as quickly as possible.

<div align="center"><b>LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Communications

and  Information Technology (a) how many times  has  the  LRT

system broken down since its operations in November 1999; (b)

has  the  Ministry  identified and adequately  addressed  the

system failure that led to the human error causing the  train

collision  in November 2000; (c) why were the trains  allowed

to operate notwithstanding the fact that "missing trains" had

been detected a number of times; and (d) what were the safety

tests  conducted on the LRT system under Singapore's climatic

conditions prior to its operations.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Bukit  Panjang LRT commenced operations on 6th  November

1999.   Since  the start of operations, there  have  been  42

cases  of  disruptions,  where each  disruption  exceeded  20

minutes.  32 of them occurred during the first six months  of

operation when the system was `bedding-in'. It is normal  for

minor operational problems to occur in the initial months  of

operation  of  a complicated system like the  BP  LRT.   Even

though  key members of the operational personnel had  brought

along  with  them significant experience in the  MRT  system,

they   still   had  to  gain  experience  in  operating   and

maintaining the LRT system.  I am glad to inform Members that

after  the  initial  period  of bedding-in  the  system,  the

availability of the LRT has improved steadily to its  current

commendable level.  The LRT system now has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>

an  availability of above 99.5%.  This translates to a  total

delay  of  only  6 minutes in a 20-hour daily  service.   The

delay  is not just by one car, we are talking about the delay

accumulated  over all the cars in the 20-hour daily  service.

This  availability compares favourably, if  not  better  than

other similar systems around the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the LRT vehicle collision that occurred on

19th November, a Committee of Investigation was appointed  by

the   Land  Transport  Authority  (LTA)  to  investigate  the

collision.   The  Committee completed its investigation  last

month.  It found that the incident was caused entirely  by  a

procedural error by the train controller.  The Committee also

found  that  the train safety system had worked as  designed.

Therefore,  there was no system failure.  Arising  from  this

incident,  LTA has directed the operator, SLRT  Pte  Ltd,  to

retrain  all  its  staff to enhance their  knowledge  of  the

system  and  procedures, and to do so on a continuing  basis.

LTA  reports  that  the  company has  already  put  in  place

measures  to tighten its operating and safety procedures,  as

well  as  to raise training standards for its railway  staff.

LTA  will  also  work  with the operator to  implement  other

measures  to  further  strengthen  the  LRT  operations   and

procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Dr Teo's third question, I would like to

reiterate that there was no failure or problem on the part of

the  system  hardware or software.  The system  responded  as

designed.  When the system did not detect the particular  LRT

train,  it  placed  an electronic shield in  the  last  known

position  of  the  vehicle.  This is  to  prevent  any  other

vehicle  from  coming  into  the shielded  area  and,  hence,

prevent  a collision.  The train controller had not  followed

proper   procedures   when  he  reset  the   system   without

establishing the position of the lost train.  The incident on

19th  November 2000 was the first time that a loss  of  train

detection  occurred.   If  the  correct  procedure  had  been

followed,  the  automatic  train protection  feature  in  the

system  would  have functioned as designed,  and  the  trains

would not have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>

collided.   This  fundamental and key safety feature  of  the

system has been designed to very high standards, and has been

checked and verified as working properly at all times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to safety tests on the system, extensive

tests  on  all  parts  of the LRT system  were  conducted  in

simulated  local  environment  conditions  prior  to   system

operation.  Verification tests to ensure that the system  met

safety   criteria  were  conducted  on  such  items  as   the

signalling system, the vehicle detection system, the  vehicle

and the wayside automatic train protection system.  The tests

undertaken showed that all safety requirements identified  by

the  hazard  analyses were met in the Singapore  environment.

The  tests  and  the  results  were  reviewed  and  confirmed

acceptable  by  an  independent  third  party  System  Safety

Certification Consultant.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> May I ask the Minister of State is it

safe  to  run  the trains when the system detects  a  missing

train  and  what  other measures have the Ministry  taken  to

ensure that the LRT system is safe, besides the manual safety

check system as proposed by SLRT recently?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, if a train is found

missing, the system will not allow the train to operate until

the  operator  resets the system.  So the  correct  procedure

therefore  is for the operator to find out where the  missing

train  is, make sure that the missing train is accounted  for

or  taken  out  of  the system before he resets  the  system.

Because  the interlocking feature and the safety  feature  of

the  system  are  such  that there will  be  automatic  train

protection and detection, prevention of collision, the  right

sequencing,  and  so  on,  if  the  system  is  operated,  as

designed, there will not be any chances of collision.  But in

this case, the operator overrode and reset the system without

accounting  for  the missing train.  That  is  why  when  the

system  did not detect any missing train after the reset,  it

would  not take the missing train into consideration.   Hence

the accident.  So this is to answer the Member's question  on

safety.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else did LTA ask the operator to do? LTA has,

besides asking them to conduct refresher training and enhance

training  standards, also asked SLRT to review its management

structure  to  strengthen the team in  the  area  of  railway

operation  and  signalling.  What we found out  is  that  the

personnel  in the SLRT, prior to the collision,  were  mainly

maintenance  people  from MRT.  So  we  are  asking  them  to

strengthen  the operation aspect of the management structure.

Also,  we  have  asked  SLRT  to review  all  its  procedures

requiring  human  intervention to deal with  safety  critical

functions  and  ensure  that these are clearly  stated,  that

there is no ambiguity, so that procedures can be followed  to

the letter, so to speak.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I would like to find out from the

Minister of State how he could convince the commuter that the

system  is  safe  if the train is physically there  and  yet,

through  a  manual  reset,  the train  would  disappear  into

virtual  space.  How could anyone say that such a  system  is

certified safe?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the procedure, as I have

said,  is  that before they reset, they will have  to  ensure

that  the  train  is accounted for.  In this case,  for  some

reason, the controller had forgotten to follow the procedure,

and  an  error  occurred.  It is not a software  or  hardware

system problem.  It is a human intervention problem.  This is

the first part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part is how do we ensure that human

intervention does not result in error.  Therefore,  the  SLRT

has recommended that we have a check-and-balance system.  How

do  we  have  a  check-and-balance system?  We will  have  to

ensure that before the controller can press the reset button,

he  must check with the shift manager.  This is one step.  So

if both agree that they reset, then they will reset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we are even thinking of asking the SLRT that

perhaps  they should have two buttons, just like your two-key

system.  So these are things that we can do, and will do,  in

order to make sure that, procedurally, there will be no  room

for error.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, is it normal for the system to

detect  missing trains and, if the system can detect  missing

trains,  under  what kind of circumstances  will  the  system

prompt that there are missing trains in the SLRT system?   So

it  must  be  the software, or there must be some reason  for

some system failure somewhere, that is why the system detects

missing  trains  and that is why you need to do  this  manual

reset.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, trains are detected by

sensors  and these sensors are under the car and attached  to

the  track.  It could be due to contact problem or  it  could

also  be  due to foreign objects or dirt that comes into  the

contact.  So it happened that the sensor failed although,  in

this  case, there is redundancy in the sense that  there  are

two  contacts.  But it is unlike MRT.  For the MRT, they have

a  long  train  and  the train has a long continuous  contact

whereas,  here, it is a single car.  So it is possible  that,

under exceptional conditions, it loses contact.  And when  it

loses contact, the system is unable to detect it 100%.   When

this  happens, there must be a procedure to rectify it.  This

procedure has been put in place, but, unfortunately, in  this

incident, the operator had not followed the procedure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we cannot have an automated system without the train

detection  system.  A train detection system  means  that  we

must  have  sensors, and sensors can fail and that  is  where

human intervention comes in.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> May I ask the Minister of

State why the system does not have a safety feature that will

not  allow it to be reset until all the trains in the  system

are  accounted  for?   That  will prevent  human  error  from

resetting it.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> If you want to start the train

operation  afresh,  you  will  have  to  reset  the   system,

otherwise the system will just freeze because there  will  be

no power to all the trains when the computer system detects a

fault  and  the  trains will just freeze.  So,  in  order  to

restart  the system, you will have to reset it.   And  before

you reset, you must ensure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>

that  everything  is  accounted for.   That  is  the  way  an

automated train system is run.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, the Minister of State has given a very

interesting viewpoint on this missing train.  I was trying to

find  out  whether  he has a system to deal  with  a  missing

operator,  because  human  errors  accounted  for  all  these

problems.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I do not think we have a

problem of a missing operator.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We will take one last question from Dr Tan

Boon Wan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  of  State  said that there is no  hardware  and  no

software  problem.   Evidently, the train has  gone  missing.

And,  if  it was not for a hardware or software problem,  how

could the train have gone missing?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, we cannot have a system

where the components never fail.  There is no hardware in the

world  where its components never fail.  When we  talk  about

system  failure, both hardware and software, we  are  talking

about the system not functioning, as designed, as a result of

any  component  or  software  failure.   The  LRT  system  is

functioning  as designed.  The system recognises  that  there

will  be  occasions for component failure and so  on  and  so

forth, and the system takes care of that.  So, in this  case,

there is no problem in the system hardware and software.  The

problem lies in the human intervention part, where it is  not

strictly followed.

<div align="center"><b>3G TELECOMMUNICATION LICENCES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Information Technology if the  Government

will  consider  the  award  of 3G telecommunication  licences

based on "beauty contest" instead of auction.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, the Government has

carefully  considered  the  pros  and  cons  of  the  auction

approach  vis-a-vis  a beauty contest for  the  award  of  3G

licences.   Our conclusion was that the award of 3G  licences

through  an  auction  is  the most objective,  efficient  and

transparent   means  of  allocating  the   limited   spectrum

available.   An  auction will allocate the  spectrum  to  the

operators who value it most, and this in turn would spur them

to use this limited resource as efficiently as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While several countries have chosen a beauty contest for

selecting  3G  operators, our assessment  is  that  making  a

judgement amongst bidders for emerging technologies  such  as

3G  is  entirely  subjective.  As it is still uncertain  what

would be the key 3G services, it would be very difficult  for

the  regulator  to define the service and technical  criteria

for evaluating proposals in a beauty contest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the formulation of our 3G licensing framework, IDA

has considered industry feedback and studied the 3G licensing

approach  taken by other countries, from both the  operators'

and   regulators'  perspectives.   Operators  will  naturally

prefer  a beauty contest mechanism with minimal fees  because

obtaining   the  spectrum  cheaply  will  mean  an  immediate

windfall  profit  for them.  However, the  Government  has  a

responsibility to obtain fair value for a scarce resource.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's main objective is to ensure a

transparent and fair allocation mechanism, and not simply  to

generate  revenue.  Notwithstanding the large sums that  have

been  collected  in  some earlier European  3G  auctions,  we

expect  that  the participating telecom companies  will  have

learnt  from  the earlier 3G auctions, and bid rationally  in

our auction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, firstly, in that

case,  will  the Minister not impose a reserve price  on  the

licences in the case of auction?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as he has mentioned, since the first auction

in Europe, the world of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>

3G  has  changed  significantly and now there  is  a  general

rethink among telcos whether they should proceed on 3G if  it

is too expensive.  That being the case, would this retard the

development  of  3G in Singapore?  Will the  auction  process

still  proceed  if there are fewer interested licensees  than

the number of licences available?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, would this development fund for the

development of wireless systems still proceed if  the  monies

collected from the 3G licences are not enough to support  the

fund?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Mr Chng has asked whether we

would  set a reserve price.  Sir, indeed we have set  reserve

prices.   The reserve price per licence has been set at  $150

million per licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Chng asked whether the experience elsewhere

has  retarded  the  development of 3G, and  whether  it  will

retard the development of 3G in Singapore.  Sir, despite  the

high prices paid elsewhere, we believe that 3G is going to go

on  and  that those telcos which have bidded in the  European

countries will be proceeding to roll out the system and  they

are  now  currently sourcing for funds to proceed with  that.

In  terms  of the development of 3G in Singapore, we  believe

that  what has happened elsewhere should not have any  impact

in Singapore, because we are also going to be proceeding with

the  roll-out of 3G and, in fact, we will be putting in place

programmes  to  help  the development of 3G  applications  in

Singapore through the "Wired for Wireless Programme".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng also asked whether we would proceed with the

auction  if  there are fewer bidders than licences available.

Sir,  we  are going to be offering four licences for  auction

and,  if  there  are less than four bidders, we  would  still

proceed  to issue the licences to the interested parties  and

award the remaining licence or licences later when the demand

is there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, whether the "Wired for Wireless Programme"

will  continue  if  the response for the auction  is  not  as

originally expected, Sir, the "Wired for Wireless

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>

Programme" will continue.  The amount of money available  for

this programme will of course depend on how much we manage to

raise in the auction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Two questions, Mr Speaker, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Chng. Dr Toh has the floor.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. The

Government  has  decided to do an auction programme  but  the

auction  has been postponed.  Does this postponement  of  the

auction,  plus  the  tentative  nature  now  of  the  auction

guidelines,  indicate that the IDA and the Government  itself

are not sure that the auction is the best way to go forward?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, does the postponement not create some kind of

market uncertainty and cause the market to lose confidence in

the ability of the Government to project the future?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in answer to Dr Toh's first

question whether the postponement indicates that IDA  is  not

sure and that this indicates a tentative nature, Sir, let  me

explain   first  why  IDA  has  had  to  delay  the  auction.

Following the announcement of the 3G licences last year,  IDA

sent a team of officials to interested parties in Europe, USA

and  Asia.   Arising from this trip, the team  was  asked  by

several  interested telcos, firstly, that they would like  to

know a little bit more about the auction rules and, secondly,

they  would  want to have the opportunity to comment  on  the

auction  rules before they are firmed up.  As a  result,  the

release  of  the auction rules, which has been scheduled  for

the  middle  of  January, has been delayed.  Instead  of  the

firmed-up  auction rules, it will now be auction rules  meant

for consultation with the interested parties.  We expect that

the  interested  telcos would take some  time  to  study  the

auction  rules before they give us their comments.  And  once

we receive their comments, IDA would also need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>

some  time  to study them before deciding whether or  not  to

amend the auction rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, IDA has factored in a 2-month period for this

additional process which was originally not expected.   As  a

result,  instead  of going for the auction in  February,  IDA

expects to go for the auction in April.  So the delay is  not

because of the tentative nature of the process but because we

have had requests from interested companies to be involved in

the consultation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Prof. Toh has asked whether this would not

create  uncertainty.   Sir, IDA is in close  touch  with  the

telcos that have expressed interest and, therefore, there  is

no  uncertainty at all, because they are fully aware  of  the

time  line and they are fully aware why the schedule has been

changed from February to April.

<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.04 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitutional Amendment Bill before the House

contains  three amendments. The first pertains to the  tenure

of  members  of  the  Council of Presidential  Advisers,  the

second to the protection of net investment income earned from

the  past  reserves of the Government, and the third  to  the

tenure of the Auditor-General.

<br><br><i>Tenure of Members of the Council of Presidential Advisers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn first to the amendment

pertaining  to  the  tenure  of members  of  the  Council  of

Presidential Advisers or CPA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Article 37B(3), members of the CPA are currently

appointed for a fixed term of 6 years and are eligible for re-appointments on a 6-year term.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for appointing CPA members to specified,

fixed  terms is to give them standing on their own once  they

are  appointed.  They  are expected to  exercise  independent

judgment  on  issues, rather than reflect the  views  of  the

person  who advised the President to appoint them, be it  the

President  himself, the Prime Minister, the Chairman  of  the

PSC, or the Chief Justice. Hence, they have tenure in office,

and cannot be removed at will by their nominators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, however, has pointed out that 6 years for

each  term is a long time, especially if the CPA members  are

already  in their 70s.  Health considerations may not  permit

them  to  commit  to  serving  the  full  6-year  appointment

although   they   may  still  be  able   to   make   valuable

contributions  for  a shorter term.  The President  suggested

that the Government consider whether re-appointments could be

for terms less than 6 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has considered the President's

suggestion.  Article 37(B) of the Constitution will therefore

be  amended to provide for the appointment of a member of the

CPA for a tenure of 6 years on his first appointment, and re-appointment for further terms of 4 years each.

<br><br><i>Net Investment Income</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn now to the amendment pertaining

to  the  protection of net investment income (or NII)  earned

from past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my Statement to the House on 17th August 1999, I

said  that  the Government needed time to study how  best  to

protect  NII  and  this could lead to  an  amendment  of  the

Constitution. The amendment before the House now is a  result

of the study.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into the amendment proper, let me quickly re-cap what is NII and what is its current Constitutional

position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NII is defined as the interest and dividend income

earned from investing the Government's reserves, net of  debt

servicing and expenses on investment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>

It  does not include any capital gains or losses arising from

the disposal of investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Constitution, "reserves which were not

accumulated  by  the Government during its  current  term  of

office" are protected and subjected to the President's second

key.  On  the other hand, NII, whether derived from  past  or

current  reserves, is accumulated during the current term  of

office of the Government and is thus not protected under  the

present Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although NII is thus clearly "current money" under the

Constitution,  the Government has carefully  studied  whether

part of NII ought to be locked up, especially the NII that is

derived  from past reserves. This is a complex  issue  as  we

need to project the state of the economy and the Government's

budget  position  over the long term,  and  strike  a  proper

balance  between restraining a profligate government  on  the

one  hand,  and  allowing  a  responsible  government  enough

flexibility to operate on the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future cannot be predicted with certainty. However,

we  do  know  that an ageing population will  impose  greater

demands  on  health and social expenditures, and  reduce  the

proportion  of  Singaporeans in full  employment  and  paying

taxes.  At  the same time, globalisation will  make  it  more

important for us to attract and retain talent, businesses and

investments. This calls for competitive tax rates,  and  will

put  pressure on Government revenues. It is therefore  likely

that  over  time,  expenditures will grow more  rapidly  than

revenues.  In  the long term, we may therefore need  to  draw

upon  part  of  NII  to supplement tax revenue,  although  we

cannot know for sure how much of NII we will need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be argued that so long as the Government's

budget position is healthy and in surplus, all NII should  be

protected,  since a responsible government could always  seek

the President's concurrence to draw on past reserves when the

need arises. However, we have to bear in mind that such draws

may be needed on a regular basis in future if all NII is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>

protected.   To seek the President's approval  on  a  regular

basis  will  undermine the foundation  in  the  "second  key"

system  as draws on past reserves should be called upon  only

in exceptional circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we should not provide for too much

flexibility.  Our  current budgetary  discipline  of  keeping

Government  small  and focused on basic  public  services  is

sound  and  should be continued. We cannot afford to  emulate

resource  rich  countries  in  which  government's  share  of

expenditures  has  risen  as  high  as  40%  of   GDP.   Such

expenditures  are  unsustainable in the long  term  and  will

ultimately strangle the growth of the private sector and  the

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided to protect, on an

annual  basis, at least 50% of the NII earned from  the  past

reserves  of  the  Government. NII earned  from  the  current

reserves will continue to accrue to the current reserves,  in

line with the principle that the government of the day should

benefit from its work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of NII will apply only to the NII earned

from Government's own reserves. It will not apply to the  NII

earned  by  statutory boards and Government-linked  companies

contained in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution. Just  as

normal   commercial  companies  have  full  access   to   the

investment earnings from all its accumulated funds, statutory

boards  and Government-linked companies should also be  given

access  to  their  NII  as part and parcel  of  their  normal

income. Locking up their NII will take away their flexibility

and   responsiveness   in  making  business   and   operating

decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to effect the protection of NII I have

just described is set out in clause 3 of the Bill before  the

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 142 of the Constitution will be amended to

provide  for  not less than 50% of the NII earned  from  past

reserves  in  a financial year to be added to, and  protected

as, past reserves.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact amount, which cannot be less than 50%, will be

specified  in  a  certificate that the Minister  for  Finance

shall  present  to  the  President after  the  close  of  the

financial year. The protection will take effect from the date

of  the  certificate and will be final. If a future  Minister

for  Finance refuses to issue such a certificate for whatever

reason,  50%  of  the  NII  earned from  past  reserves  will

nevertheless  be  protected  when  the  Government  Financial

Statements are presented to the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also puts into the Constitution a new

definition of NII. The definition will be expanded  to  cover

more  than  what is currently defined as NII  in  the  Budget

Book. NII will now include interest earned from developmental

loans  given  by Government, mainly to statutory boards.  The

interest  on these loans was previously treated as  Operating

Revenue,  because developmental loans were not classified  as

investments under the Financial Procedure Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we will be protecting at least 50% of NII,

excluding interest earned from developmental loans  from  NII

would  leave  a  potential loophole.  Such interest  earnings

will therefore be included in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the amendment concerns the protection of past

reserves,  albeit to tighten the protection,  Government  has

briefed   the  President  and  the  Council  of  Presidential

Advisers, who agree with the amendment.

<br><br><i>Tenure of the Auditor-General</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the third amendment. This

pertains to the tenure of the Auditor-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Article 148F of the Constitution provides for

the  Auditor-General to hold office until he attains the  age

of  60  years,  regardless of when he was appointed.   Before

reaching  the  retirement age, he can only  be  removed  from

office  by  the  President if he is found  to  be  unable  to

discharge  the functions of his office whether for  infirmity

of body or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>

mind,  or for misbehaviour.  His remuneration and other terms

of  service  are  also protected under the Constitution.   In

addition, he is not eligible for any other appointment  as  a

public officer after stepping down as Auditor-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying rationale of these provisions is to

safeguard the powers and independence of the Auditor-General,

so  that  he  can  carry out his duties  firmly  and  fairly,

without fear or favour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Constitutional provisions have worked so far. But

moving  forward in an environment of rapid change, they  need

to  be  fine-tuned. Appointment till retirement  age  creates

rigidity in the talent management process.  It does not allow

for  systematic renewal and rejuvenation of the office, which

is   always  desirable,  regardless  of  the  abilities   and

performance of the incumbent.  This is particularly so as  we

want  to appoint able officers to the post of Auditor-General

at  a  younger  age,  to inject new, fresh  perspectives  and

update  the office, rather than appoint individuals  who  are

approaching retirement age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee had informed the House of the

need  to  have  a healthy turnover of people  in  the  public

service,   especially  those  holding  top   Public   Service

Leadership  jobs.  The public service needs  to  develop  and

stretch  our  younger officers, giving them larger  and  more

challenging  responsibilities earlier.  Conversely,  it  also

means  that not all officers who assume leadership  positions

early  can  stay  in  those positions  till  retirement  age.

Systematic  but  judicious renewal is also desirable,  as  it

will  prevent the organisation from becoming too  settled  in

its ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Secretaries and other officers holding Public

Service Leadership jobs are now appointed on fixed terms. The

same  should apply to the office of the Auditor-General.   We

need  to  find and appoint good individuals to  the  post  of

Auditor-General  and  ensure that  the  office  is  regularly

rejuvenated.   "Permanency" of office and prolonged  exposure

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>

repetitive  audit  cycles could also lull an  incumbent  into

complacency.   In  the private sector, it is considered  good

practice  to regularly rotate auditing partners, if  not  the

auditing  firms,  about  once every  five  years.   The  same

principle should apply in the audit of the Government and the

public service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 148F of the Constitution will therefore be

amended to provide for the appointment of the Auditor-General

for  a  fixed term of six years, with the possibility of  re-appointments  for  further terms of six  years  each.   As  a

corollary  to appointing the Auditor-General on  fixed  terms

which   may  end  before  he  reaches  retirement  age,   the

prohibition  of  a  person who has held  the  office  of  the

Auditor-General  from taking up any other appointments  as  a

public  officer after leaving office will be removed.   There

is no reason why we should prevent a good individual from re-joining the public service after he has finished his term  as

Auditor-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a fixed six-year term appointment, subject to

renewal,  should  not  adversely  affect  the  organisational

independence  of  the  Auditor-General.  The  Auditor-General

remains    organisationally   immune   from   any   Executive

interference  and influence in his job.  Firstly,  he  enjoys

security  of  tenure during his fixed term,  unlike  ordinary

public  officers  who  hold office at  the  pleasure  of  the

Executive. The Auditor-General can only be removed on grounds

of  misbehaviour or inability to discharge his functions,  as

determined by a high-level tribunal, and even then only  with

the concurrence of the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, once appointed, the Auditor-General's

pensionable   remuneration  and  other  terms   of   service,

including  his pensionable status, cannot be altered  to  his

disadvantage while he remains in office.  This protection  in

the Constitution remains unchanged; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Auditor-General continues to report

directly to the President and Parliament under the Audit Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed

amendments  to  the  Constitution have two  components.   The

first  is  the  change to the tenure of the  members  of  the

Council  of  Presidential Advisers and  the  Auditor-General.

The second is the new treatment proposed by the Government of

the net investment income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the first issue on the change of

tenure  of  Presidential Advisers, I would like to  voice  my

support   that  it  is  appropriate  that  members   of   the

Presidential  Council be appointed, firstly,  on  a  six-year

term  and thereafter to be re-appointed for further terms  of

four years each.  I agree with the shorter term of four years

each  for  re-appointments.  This will enable the suitability

of  these  Advisers to be reviewed over a shorter period  for

future  renewals, after the first initial appointment of  six

years.  In fact, if we add the first six years to the further

re-appointment  term  of four years, a  re-appointed  Adviser

would  have served for 10 years, and further renewal  should,

of  course, be reviewed and for a shorter period.  Therefore,

I support this proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second point about the re-appointment of the

Auditor-General, the proposal is to first appoint him on a 6-year  contract basis, and thereafter for renewal  of  another

six  years.   This is quite fair as well.  But I  do  have  a

small  concern  about the proposal to remove the  requirement

that after his retirement in future, the Auditor-General  can

now  find other jobs, which, in some cases, may be deemed  to

be  not  so  suitable for him, since he has already  held  an

esteemed  post of Auditor-General.  This point may lower  the

high office of the Auditor-General, because he is supposed to

hold  a  very  independent  view of  Government's  accounting

policies.   I  would prefer that this office be preserved  at

the highest level.  Therefore, if it can be advised that even

after his retirement, the Auditor-General should only take up

jobs  that would seem to pose no conflict of interest to  his

earlier  job.  Therefore, on this basis, I also  support  the

proposal  to  have contract appointment on a  6-year  renewal

basis for the Auditor-General.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the more important amendment is the second

component  with  regard to the Government's proposal  on  the

treatment  of the net investment income (NII).  One principle

that can be adopted is the treatment of the NII from a purely

accounting   approach.    Under  this  approach,   interests,

dividends and other investment incomes earned from  the  past

capital  or  equity  of a company (ie, in  the  case  of  the

Government's  account  and this will  be  the  reserves)  are

treated  as  current  account items, which  means  that  such

incomes including interests earned from past capital will  be

treated  as  items  in the Working Capital,  Cash  Flows  and

Profit & Loss accounts of a company, and in this case of  the

Government's accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the same principle, a company that has borrowings

from  loans that were taken in the previous years,  then  the

interest  payable in the current year is also  treated  as  a

current account item, and netted off the yearly income.  Sir,

if this accounting principle were to be applied to the use of

NII  for Government accounts, then it is clear that NII which

includes  the  interest from Government  reserves  should  be

added  in  total to the current year's income, and  therefore

100%  of the NII can be used by the new Government.  On  this

basis,  if  the  past  Government has  no  reserves  and  has

incurred debts for which interests are payable, then for  the

new  Government, it could be faced with a negative or deficit

income situation.  The new Government would therefore have to

bear  100% of this debt interest and fund the entire interest

payable  out of the present Government's current  account  of

the  year.  On this purely accounting treatment basis, it can

therefore be argued that 100% of the NII can be used  by  the

present  Government.  However, we cannot  conclude  that  the

correct  treatment of the NII from past reserves to be  based

purely on accounting principles.  From the political point of

view,  it can also be argued that the entire NII earned  from

past  reserves  is  income derived from the  effort  of  past

Governments  and  therefore  any  incomes  earned  from  past

reserves should form part of the past reserves.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>

A  new  Government which did not accumulate the past reserves

should therefore have no access to this NII.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking from these two points of views, I would agree

that  the  proposal by the Government to impose a minimum  of

50% to be put into the past reserves and the remaining 50% to

be  decided  by  the present Government is a  very  fair  and

reasonable  proposal.  It strikes a fine balance between  NII

earned  from  old reserves of which 50% can be  retained  and

allow the remaining 50% to be used by the new Government.  In

some  way, this helps to mitigate any undesirable effect that

if  there is a profligate new Government that takes over  and

recklessly spends money derived from the NII, they  can  only

do  so  with 50% of the net income of the NII.  At  the  same

time,  by  having  this rule of 50%,  it  will  allow  a  new

Government  to have some facility to use 50% of  the  NII  to

help  stimulate the economy during a recession  or  spend  on

some  meaningful Government projects which are beneficial  to

the people.  Therefore, I support this amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to use some examples to elaborate on this

position.  I think the NII issue starts when a new Government

is formed after a general election.  In the first year of the

new Government, in case this Government inherited an economic

situation  that is in a recession, therefore to have  50%  of

the  NII  accessible  by this new Government  is  beneficial,

because the money can be used to stimulate the economy or, as

I  said,  to spend on good projects.  However, if the problem

is  that when the new Government is formed, it is elected  on

the  basis  that it promised to give a lot of give-aways  and

freebees out to the people.  Therefore, it can easily use the

NII  to make a lot of unnecessary and reckless spending,  and

this  can  have  a great detrimental and ill  effect  on  the

economy.   So  this proposal of 50% in a way will  cap  their

ability  to spend recklessly.  However, in the second,  third

and fourth year onwards, the Government can still draw on the

50% of the NII.  In this case, it might also be able to spend

the money recklessly.  In this sense, the 50% limit on NII is

quite generous for new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>

Governments that are not responsible.  On this basis, I think

the  idea  of the second key to be exercised by the President

will be able to have some effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving on to a secondary point which I wish to

raise, is on the certification of the exact amount of the NII

for   the  financial  year  to  be  deemed  as  part  of  the

Government's  past reserves.  The amendment, as  proposed  in

Article 142(3), states that the certification by the Minister

for  Finance "shall be final and conclusive evidence  of  the

amount."  I wish to point out that the amendment is not clear

as to the process on how the Minister will define and certify

the  final  amount.   And  if  there  are  discrepancies   or

disagreement  on  the  methodology of the  computations,  how

would the differences be resolved?  Since it has already been

proposed  that  the certificate issued by  the  Minister  for

Finance shall be final and conclusive evidence of the amount,

I  would  like to suggest that in the Government's procedures

to  be  laid  down  on  the process  on  the  issue  of  this

certificate,  the  Minister for Finance will  allow  for  the

Auditor-General, who is an independent party, to  verify  the

financial  statements before the Minister  signs  and  issues

this statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude by expressing my

support  for  this Constitution of the Republic of  Singapore

(Amendment)  Bill  and  to  urge Members  of  this  House  to

recognise that the proposed treatment of the NII is fair  and

reasonable, and therefore support it as well.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the proposed amendments, specifically, the

amendment  of  Article 142 which represents  another  prudent

attempt  at protecting past reserves.  However, I would  like

to  seek  the  clarification of the Minister on  two  issues.

Firstly, the role of the government of the day vis-a-vis  the

ownership of these past reserves and, secondly, the basis for

determining  the allocation of net investment income  between

current and past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to elaborate. Firstly, the role of government.

Sir,  I note that hitherto, the common thread running through

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>

treatment of reserves and related income has been the concept

of  protection or preservation or safeguarding as opposed  to

growth or expansion.  In this context, what comes to mind  is

the  endowment fund model, ie, the government of the day will

ensure  the  smooth  running of the country  with  investment

income  earned  on  past  reserves  at  its  disposal.    The

principal  is  protected  and  that  is  possibly  the   only

constraint.  Hence, the government of the day is  not  really

an  agent  but  a steward and a protector.   An  agent  in  a

typical  agent/principal relationship  would  earn  fees  and

perhaps even share in the profits, but this lack of ownership

would  be  inconsistent  with what an elected  government  is

supposed  to do.  A good government will and can in fact  add

budget  surpluses to past reserves and rightly stake a  claim

to  ownership of part of these reserves.  In many  countries,

as far as I understand, there are no such constraints at all,

let  alone self imposed constraints.  Therefore, the proposed

designation of at least 50% of net investment income to  past

reserves  may  unwittingly  give rise  to  questions  on  the

relationship between the government of the day and the owners

of   the  past  reserves  or,  essentially,  the  people   of

Singapore.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten the House on

how Singaporeans should view this relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, accretion of at least 50% of net investment

income to past reserves.  The Minister has explained in  some

detail  the basis for determining the at-least-50% allocation

rule.   Although  this is derived from an  estimate  of  what

future  budget challenges of an aging population  could  look

like, the application of numerous assumptions would mean that

there  could be an inherently huge variation to this  figure.

With  each  passing year or at least decade, presumably,  the

range  of  estimates could be narrowed.  How does one  ensure

that  future governments would not be tempted to modify  this

to  their  advantage?  Conversely, if the present  Government

were  to prudently specify an amount much higher than 50%  to

past reserves, future governments

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>

may find it a tall order to maintain the same even though the

minimum is 50%.  Ultimately, would we face an allegation that

the basis is simply arbitrary?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, allow me to round up with comments on

other  possible risks and implications.  As we have observed,

a  whole  spectrum of financial markets and instruments  have

sprung  up  over the last few years.  This is  especially  so

with  hybrid products where the accounting or tax  treatments

can  only evolve as quickly as these products appear.  It  is

therefore likely that relevant parts of the Articles  of  the

Constitution  may have to be amended often enough  to  ensure

that  no loopholes are created by the innovative use  of  new

financial products.  At some point, the certification of what

might be considered net investment income may be unwieldy, if

not  difficult.   It  is  perhaps  worthwhile  over  time  to

consider  alternative definitions which would meet  the  same

objective of preservation of reserves.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Constitutional

Amendment  has  the effect of focusing our mind  on  the  net

investment income (or NII), a topic which ordinarily does not

attract  too much debate in this House.  In fact,  today,  it

also  does  not  attract too much debate in the  House.   The

Minister has already given the technical definition of NII in

his  speech  when moving the motion.  Mrs Lim has also  asked

about  the  role  of the Government in respect  of  our  past

reserves  and the NII.  At this point, Sir, I would  like  to

share with the House what is a layman's definition of NII.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the layman, NII is the investment income of our

country's  past  budget surpluses.  It  is  equivalent  to  a

retiree receiving an endowment from the cash dividends  of  a

principal  sum managed by an investment bank.  Only  in  this

case, the Government is the custodian of these past surpluses

which  we  all  know have been locked away and could  not  be

touched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mrs Lim also questioned, who contributed to these

past surpluses?  They are accumulated from past budget

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>

surpluses  and sales of Government assets, such as  land  and

buildings.  In one way or another, these reserves are derived

from the sweat and labour of generations of working people in

Singapore.   Of  course,  we  have  a  clean  and   efficient

Government which manages the reserves very well, allowing  it

to grow and to be preserved over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, when we look at the Annual Budget

Statement, one would notice that the NII is below the  budget

line.   In other words, the budget is presented in terms  of,

first, revenue, followed by expenditure, then followed  by  a

statement  saying what is the surplus or deficit  of  revenue

over  expenditure, then a statement giving  us  the  NII.   I

would  like to surmise that this presentation, Sir,  is  more

than  cosmetic.  It reflects our Government's  philosophy  of

managing  our  budget.  NII is not used, it  is  hardly  ever

used,   unless  expenditure  exceeds  revenue,  which  rarely

happens  in  Singapore.  Therefore, this way of  presentation

has   the  effect  of  enforcing  a  discipline  within   the

Government to strike for a balanced budget or a surplus where

possible.   The rationale of many of our policies is  derived

from  this  principle.   In  other words,  the  Minister  for

Finance  will always try to push for a balanced budget  or  a

surplus budget, where possible, before tapping on the NII.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I chaired a Feedback Unit Dialogue

session  on major concerns of Singaporeans on the evening  of

4th  January  this year.  This is the second of a  series  of

sessions  to  be  organised by the Feedback  Unit.   For  the

session I chaired, the subject matter was the concerns of the

senior   citizens  in  Singapore.   50-odd  of  these  senior

citizens  participated in the session. Their  major  concerns

are rising cost of living and medical cost, with medical cost

being the principal area of concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentiment of the senior citizens on health care is

that  the Government could have done more for them.   Medical

costs  are  escalating and senior citizens are burdened  with

the  brunt  of it.  Several expressed the opinion  that  this

Government does not look after the senior

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>

citizens  well because they are no longer productive  members

of the community.  Others say that this Government only cares

about  "profit".  Nonetheless, the general consensus is  that

senior  citizens  have been paying taxes  all  their  working

lives  and contributing to building today's Singapore.   Yet,

when they are retired and when their need for medical care is

the greatest, the Government is miserly in dishing out social

services  and  health  care.   The  participants  called  for

greater  and more generous support by the Government.   After

all,  to most Singaporeans, the Government is considered rich

and  could  afford it.  At the Feedback Session,  the  senior

citizens  spoke  with passion and strong  emotion.   Clearly,

these issues are very close to their hearts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One participant, Dr Jazmyn Chelliah, pointed out that

one  of  the key reasons why the senior citizens are  unhappy

about  health  care  is  that the Government  expenditure  on

health  care is low, at around 1% of our GDP.  At this level,

it   is  comparable  to  the  level  expended  by  low-income

countries  and  is  not  commensurate  with  the  ranking  of

Singapore.  In other words, if we use our per capita  income,

that  ranking would put us among the top 10 countries in  the

world.   But when it comes to public health care expenditure,

we  are  being  grouped  together  with  one  of  the  poorer

countries.   She  went  on to point out that  the  percentage

spent on health care in the US is about 12%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I listened to these sentiments, arguments in support

of   Government  policies  popped  into  my  head.    It   is

inevitable, being a PAP member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the statement that senior citizens had contributed

taxes  all  their  lives,  and  therefore  should  have  some

benefits  in their old age, my response would have been  that

the  Government  budget is cash based.   Most  of  the  taxes

collected  in the current year would have already been  spent

in  the  year  collected.  So the taxpayers in the  past  had

already benefited from the Government's various programmes in

the  year they paid their taxes.  So paying taxes is not like

putting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>

savings away for old age.  Senior citizens could not look  at

the  past  reserves as their collective savings and  as  such

could  be  tapped to fund social services for them when  they

are  old.  In any event, this is already a moot point because

past reserves have already been locked up by Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the statement that Government is rich and could

afford  it,  my  answer  would be  to  highlight  that  again

Government budget is based on annual revenue from  taxes  and

expenditure.   In  order  to pay for more  benefits  for  the

elders,  we  must raise taxes on the working adults,  thereby

increasing  their  burden.  As the ratio  of  working  adults

versus  retirees  deteriorates over time,  the  burden  would

naturally increase.  Now the ratio is roughly 10  to  1.   In

the future, say, year 2030, the ratio would have been 4 to 1.

Adding more benefits would accelerate this and that would  be

unfair to the working adults.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by themselves, Sir, these arguments are logical and

rational.   For a country with a balanced budget  or  even  a

deficit budget, it is true that to provide more for the  aged

means  higher taxes for the working adults.  After  a  while,

the  tax  burden would be sky high as we could see  in  those

Nordic  countries.  Yet, when I started thinking  about  this

Constitutional Amendment Bill, it strikes me that perhaps  if

you look at the NII and the size of the NII, maybe the senior

citizens' grouses are not entirely without basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has disclosed that in our last budget

statement, NII is 3.5% of our GDP.  To do a comparison to get

a better feel of the magnitude of this number, let us look at

the  Defence budget which is pegged at 5% of GDP.   In  other

words,  while  NII could not pay for everything MINDEF  would

need,  it  does  pay for about 70%.  On the other  hand,  the

Ministry  of  Education's budget, the second largest  in  our

annual Government expenditure, stands at 3.7% of GDP.   Thus,

NII alone could have paid for our total annual

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>

expenditure  on  education, paying  everything  for  schools,

universities,  polytechnics, ITEs, teachers,  lecturers,  the

whole works.  Sir, we are indeed talking about serious money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think one could not deny entirely

that  our  reserves  have been built up over  the  past  from

contributions of our citizens in one way or another.  And  in

my  mind,  I suggest that we could group these reserves  into

three  buckets, according to the persons who have contributed

as  follows:  the first bucket contributed by working  adults

(who are working adults today); the second bucket contributed

by  retirees during their working life, and the third  bucket

contributed  by  those - pardon my pun - who had  kicked  the

bucket.   So from each bucket, you look at, flows  an  annual

NII.   We  do  not  need  to argue what percentage  of  these

reserves are in each bucket.  Maybe the Minister for  Finance

could  work  it out.  But I think of the money in the  bucket

that was contributed by retirees, the percentage is not zero.

I  do not know the number, but definitely it is not zero.  We

could argue that we should not touch the NII flowing from the

first bucket, the bucket of the working adults.  That belongs

to  the working adults, for their future use.  We could argue

that  we  should  not touch the NII flowing  from  the  third

bucket   as  these  should  be  considered  our  inheritance,

heirloom for our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is it beyond the realm of reasonableness if we use

the  investment income derived from the "retirees" bucket  to

defray the medical cost of the senior citizens who are living

today, in particular those in the lower income group?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, Sir, if we do a mental exercise and say we

earmark and use the NII from the second bucket to fund social

programmes   and  health  care  programmes  for  the   senior

citizens,  I  would find it difficult to hew to the  argument

that  to  provide  more for the old means  higher  taxes  and

heavier burden for the young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the Government is

leaving no more than 50%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>

of the NII as revenue in the Government budget, in case it is

needed  in  the future.  Part of it would be used  to  defray

more extensive social programmes as our society ages.  In  my

mind,  there  is  much scope for better  and  more  extensive

medical services, in particular for senior citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us revisit the health statistics mentioned by Dr

Chelliah.  I asked the Librarian to do a search which yielded

the   following  data  taken  there  from  World  Development

Indicators  2000 [World Bank March 2000].   In  the  case  of

Singapore,  the public expenditure on health  care  from  the

latest  figures  available was 1.1% of GDP  and  the  private

expenditure was 2%, giving a total expenditure of 3.2%.  This

puts us in the same bracket as those lower-income countries I

have  mentioned, whose numbers were 1.2% and 2% respectively.

On the other hand, the middle income countries spent 3.1% and

2.6%  respectively. The high-income countries  incurred  6.2%

and 3.7% respectively.  In the case of USA, it spent 6.5% and

7.5%,  giving a total of 13.9% of GDP.  Dr Chelliah  was  not

entirely  right but I think she has a point.  We as a  people

spent  one-third  of  the amount spent by  the  middle-income

countries  and  one-sixth of the amount spent  by  the  high-income countries when it comes to public health care.   While

I am not advocating matching these percentages blindly, point

by  point, I think we could have done more in this particular

area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that the social costs

incurred  by  the Government will increase over time  as  our

population  ages  even  at  the current  level  of  services,

thereby bringing us closer, as far as the percentage  of  GDP

is  concerned,  to  the  norm  of more  developed  countries.

However,  I think we could re-examine the basis of Government

policies  and perhaps, conceptually, tap part of the  NII  to

better look after our senior citizens.  If we earmark the use

of  NII  for  this  purpose,  we  could  rationalise  greater

expenditure without having to wait for the budget to go  into

deficit  before tapping the NII.  I would say that we  should

support our senior citizens better in their old age.  After

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>

all,  they  are  the people who have laid the  foundation  of

everything we have today in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am uncomfortable

with  the  amendment  to change the term  of  office  of  the

Auditor-General.  Neither am I convinced by the Minister  for

Finance's rationale on the need to make the change.  I wonder

what has prompted the Government to change the term of office

of  the  Auditor-General.  Is the Government saying that  the

office of the Auditor-General is facing a great problem?   Or

is  it  that there is no public officer who wishes to be  the

next Auditor-General because of the current term of office?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the office of Auditor-General is an important

instrument  in  our  system of Government  to  check  on  the

Government accounts.  I have been reading the reports of  the

Auditor-General  quite  regularly  and  I  am  convinced  and

satisfied   that   the  office  of  the  Auditor-General   is

independent and impartial.  The tenure of the current Auditor-General  is for life.  I believe that life tenure of such  an

important  position  will allow the person  to  exercise  his

power   without  fear  or  favour.   Whereas  a  fixed   term

appointment, as is proposed now before the House, may  affect

the  person's  independent judgement as  the  person  who  is

appointed as Auditor-General may have to consider whether  he

will  be reappointed again after his term of six years  ends.

Sir,  I  believe  the change in the tenure  of  the  Auditor-General to a fixed term would affect or even undermine public

confidence in the office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not support the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although the main

topic  today  is  on  the NII, Dr Wang has raised  healthcare

issues.   I will be very happy to respond to it in full  when

we  debate this during the Budget session.  But I would  like

to  make  some points since it is fresh and current.   First,

total  healthcare expenditure.  I think Dr Wang, in the  end,

did clarify that the number he used for many of the developed

countries of 6% to 7% of GDP

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>

on total healthcare expenditure and for the US, 12% to 14% of

GDP,  should be compared like with like to Singapore's  case,

which  is  3.2%  of  GDP,  and not  1%.   1%  represents  the

Government's component.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that healthcare should not be

measured  by the inputs.  It does not really matter what  you

put  in.   The more important parameter should be the outcome

of  what  you get for the money that you spend.  Although  we

only  spent  3.2%  of our GDP on healthcare,  the  healthcare

standard  in  Singapore is rated as good, if not better  than

many of the developed countries.  And this is done not by us,

but  by  the World Bank.  The World Bank recently ranked  the

healthcare systems around the world and it will not  surprise

you  to  know that Singapore is ranked sixth, even though  we

have  only  spent  3%  of our GDP on  healthcare.   The  USA,

despite  spending  12%  to 14% of GDP on  healthcare,  ranked

quite far down, beyond 20.  In the US, there are more than 45

million  people who are insured.  So even though  they  spent

12% to 14% of GDP on healthcare, not everybody has access  to

the same healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, I have given the assurance many times that

if  any  MP comes across any low income Singaporean, who  has

difficulty  paying  his bill, he can  write  to  the  medical

social  worker  in  the hospital, and  99%  of  all  Medifund

applications are approved.  For the 1% which is not approved,

please feel free to write to Mr Chan Soo Sen, or myself,  and

we  will  look into the case.  So healthcare in Singapore  is

accessible  to  everybody in Singapore,  and  it  is  of  the

highest standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the particular comment about healthcare for the

elderly,  despite his analogy of the three buckets,  we  have

indeed  set  aside part of our old reserves in  the  form  of

Medifund  for  helping low income people  to  pay  for  their

healthcare  fees.   And the main users of  Medifund  are,  in

fact,  the  elderly.   We  have set  aside  $700  million  in

Medifund and the interest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>

from  Medifund, which is equivalent to your NII, is  used  to

fund  Medifund applications, and 99% of the applications  are

approved.  Last year, we set up the Eldercare Fund  which  is

specifically targeted at the elderly, ie, those who  have  to

go  to nursing homes.  Part of the past reserves would be put

into the Eldercare Fund which would look after the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole thrust of our healthcare system is largely

aimed at the elderly because the younger population does  not

have   healthcare  problems.   The  bulk  of  the  healthcare

problems  arise in the last five or ten years of  your  life.

And in the last few years, we have put in the whole framework

to  look after the healthcare of our elderly.  We started off

with the community health screening.  We subsidise it heavily

and  we  encourage  every elderly person  to  go  for  health

screening.   If  the  elderly are so  concerned  about  their

healthcare, I would urge them to go for healthcare screening.

Instead,  today, only 20% of those we have invited turned  up

for  the health screening.  Indeed, if they are so concerned,

the  first  step  that  they should take,  to  be  personally

responsible for their health, is to turn up for their  health

screening.  Second, we have put in place the whole package to

help  them manage their health condition.  If they go to  the

polyclinics, they are subsidised 75% of the cost.  They  only

pay  25%  of  the bill.  This shows the very  high  level  of

support that the Government has put in place.   We even allow

them  to  go  to  the  private sector GP,  to  make  it  more

convenient  for them, and they still enjoy the same  subsidy.

And  every year the Government has a budget surplus,  MPs  in

this  House, including the Ministry of Health, will urge  the

Ministry of Finance to put in something for the elderly.   As

we  all  know,  every  time there is a  budget  surplus,  the

Minister  for Finance will always put aside some  top-ups  in

the  Medisave  for  the elderly.  This has happened  on  four

occasions.   And each time, we spent between $50 million  and

$250 million topping up the Medisave for the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last National Day Rally, the Prime Minister put

in place a scheme to pay the premiums for the elderly if they

have not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>

been  covered under MediShield.  All they have to  do  is  to

send  a  piece of paper saying, "I want to qualify for  these

two years' premiums."  And only 65% made the application, ie,

only  65%  bothered to return the piece of paper  to  qualify

them for the two years' premiums, despite all our efforts  to

encourage  them and their children to send in  the  piece  of

paper.   So  I must say that we have put in place  an  entire

framework  to look after the elderly.  I would like  to  urge

all elderly Singaporeans not just to be concerned about their

health but to take the first few steps to actually look after

their health.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  had  anticipated  in the 1980s that inevitably,  sometime,

somewhere,  somebody  is  going to come  up  with  compelling

reason why we should use up our reserves.  Singapore is  very

rich  - I would not deny that.  Who made us rich?  The people

of  Singapore.   Who  led  the  people  of  Singapore?   This

government.   Who  will  lead it  to  perdition?   Those  who

abandon  the principles that made Singapore.  You can  always

present a sentimental approach to hard cases which will touch

everybody's heartstrings, and then they will lose their sense

of  objectivity.   Some  child  came  from  Nepal  with  some

disease,  and they raised half a million dollars  because  of

the  sympathy generated by the publicity.  I do not deny that

we  should  have sympathy and that we should demonstrate  our

compassion.   But  when we are talking about  the  future  of

Singapore and the future of the children and grandchildren of

these old people, let us pause and think.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One position I have continued to hold, although I am not

the  Prime  Minister, is that of Chairman of  the  Government

Investment Corporation.  The Prime Minister asked me to carry

on  because  he had enough to concentrate on.  Yes,  we  have

over  US$100 billion invested all over the world.  The market

knows that, and the market considers it carefully before they

attack  the Singapore dollar.  We can be brought down to  our

knees  if  they feel that you are unable to defend it.   Hong

Kong was in peril in 1998 when they aggressively attacked the

stock market, they had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>

to prevent themselves from being brought down.  They attacked

the  dollar and forced interest rates up.  When the  interest

rate  goes  up,  the stock market goes down.  They  sold  the

stock market short, and eventually they bring Hong Kong down.

So the government bought aggressively to push the stock index

up.   They taught the speculators a lesson.  That was a  high

risk  exercise  and they are still holding large  amounts  of

shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did they not do that in Singapore? Because relative

to  our  different position they know we have quite a lot  of

ammunition.  And this guarantees that nobody's CPF will  ever

be brought low by depreciation of our currency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Prime Minister decided to move this

Constitutional Amendment.  We have spent a long time  arguing

it  in the 1980s; finally passed it after 1990, that we would

not touch the reserves.  And here comes an experienced PAP MP

who  says, "Let us have three buckets."  I will tell you what

will happen.  We will all kick the bucket!  Yes, to make  the

argument  attractive  he said it is 1%  for  health,  5%  for

defence.   Defence  just evaporates our  resources.   Health,

look  at  the  poor  old  people.  I  am  one  of  them.   My

colleagues are among them and the frequency with which I meet

them  in the hospital, because orthopaedic problems and X-ray

screening increase with age.  It is inevitable.  But argue it

within  the context of the present Budget.  I would  like  to

hear  the Member argue why we should not spend 5% on  defence

and  take away, say, 1 1/2% from defence to spend it  on  the

old.   If he can make that argument, that we should cut  down

on defence from 5% to 3 1/2%, and, with that extra 1 1/2%, as

in  the case of Florida between President-elect George W Bush

and  Vice-President  Al Gore, we can  argue  about  the  most

expensive drugs for the old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we get older, it gets more and more expensive. For

cars,  I  am told, with the COE, there is an optimum point  - probably  about  four  or five years - at  which  you  decide

whether  you sell the car while you can still get good  value

and change to a new car, or you carry on to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>

the end, till 10 years, and write it off.  Well, I decided to

use  my  car  and write it off.  But can we write  off  human

beings?   We cannot.  So, there comes a time when  the  bills

become  phenomenal.  That is the problem that  all  developed

countries  are facing.  If we were not developed, if  we  did

not  have  this health service, we would not be  facing  this

problem.  The longevity, their lifespan, would be around  65,

or,  as  in  India, around 50.  There is no old age  problem.

But we have a geriatric problem, and gerontology is going  to

be, increasingly, a large part of our medical practice.  With

cars,  you can say, right, we will change the engine,  change

the  axle, so we will just keep the chassis.  Then  you  have

dents, wrinkles, crumples, but a new engine.  Can you do that

with a human being?  With each stage, it becomes prohibitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have put NII out of reach, out of bounds. The PAP

may  lose.  Somebody may win the elections, some party  which

says, "Unlock it".  Well, they will have to win two-thirds to

change the Constitution or they will be in conflict with  the

President.   I do not say it is foolproof.  My old colleagues

told  me  I  was  trying the impossible  in  locking  up  the

reserves.  So when an old experienced Member like Dr Wang Kai

Yuen,  says this, I am reminded of their advice to me.  Maybe

it  is impossible, but I hope, because I have this chance  to

tell you why I think what I think and what made me think this

way to you MPs, it would not happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives us enormous confidence. It gives us that

flexibility to manage our economic affairs in a way we  could

not  do  if we did not have these reserves.  Do you  want  to

raid  it?   I  can find even more compelling and more  heart-rending  reasons why we should spend it.  But I suggest,  no.

At  the end of the day, whom do we owe our deepest obligation

to as a government?  To the future.  Not just to the present;

certainly not to the past.  If you want to talk about  merits

and what people deserve, then with every certificate or medal

that  we  give, we ought to give a huge sum either in annuity

or in a capital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>

grant.  That is what the British used to do.  When Nelson won

at  the  Battle of Trafalgar, he was made a Lord and a  large

piece of land was bequeathed on him.  So you can go down  the

list  of  British history.  That is one reason why they  have

all  this trouble in Ireland.  Every time the British  won  a

battle,  they  distributed large chunks of land  in  Ireland,

which  was  their  colony, to the generals who  fought  these

battles   because,  without  those  generals  winning   those

battles, there would be no empire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the way they did it. But do not mortgage the

future.  If you do, your children and your grandchildren will

pay for it.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking

after  the Senior Minister is an anti-climax, but  I  do  not

rise to be anti anything.  I wish to support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the debate on the NII, I believe that,

actually,  it comes down to a question of balance.   And  the

balance is, on the one hand, you have this argument that  the

NII  comes  from reserves that had been accumulated  by  past

governments  and the income from these past reserves  should,

therefore,  be  locked up accordingly.  On  the  other  hand,

there  can  well be an argument that the NII that  comes  out

from  past  reserves  is  actually  managed  by  the  current

Government.   How  much  we  get out,  as  income  from  past

reserves,  is as much a question of the skill of the  current

Government  as it is of the current Government earning  money

all  by  itself  from new budget surpluses and  so  on.   The

Senior  Minister has said that he is the Chairman of the  GIC

and,  certainly, a lot of our NII would have  come  from  the

skills that he has exercised in the management of the GIC and

the NII.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore say that, actually, the current

Government has every right to spend every single cent of  the

NII.   But  it  has exercised restraint.  And it  is  a  very

commendable  self-restraint that, in this  case,  instead  of

spending all of the NII, it is saying that up to 50% would be

locked up.  I therefore support this amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has also raised another issue, which,

I believe, again boils

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>

down  to  balance.  On the one hand, you have  this  argument

that  a person who is appointed until he retires has security

of  tenure  and,  therefore, he will not be looking  for  re-appointment and doing things to get his re-appointment.    On

the  other hand, I think the real question is how do we  make

this  Auditor-General independent and, if he is  independent,

he  would  not  be  looking  to  the  clock  or  to  the  new

appointment he is hoping to get.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our system now, the elected President is a person

directly elected by the electorate and, therefore, if he does

not  act  in the interests of the Singapore nation, he  would

not  be  elected.  And under this system, the Auditor-General

reports to the elected President, who is also independent  of

the parties in Parliament.  I believe this is good enough  as

a  check-and-balance,  and I believe too  that  the  Auditor-General,  in  reporting  to  Parliament,  which  is  a  House

composed of ruling and opposition parties, would want to  act

independently  and,  in  fact, would  want  to  preserve  his

professional reputation as a neutral, dependable and credible

Auditor-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess, in this case, the balance could well go either

way, but perhaps six years may indeed be a little short.  The

term of a Parliament is five years and the term of an Elected

President  is  six years.  It could possibly be  argued  that

perhaps six years may be too short, perhaps it should  be  10

years,  which is two terms of Parliament, or 15 years,  which

is three terms of Parliament.  Fifteen years is also arguable

because  if  an Auditor-General comes into his  position,  he

would  have had several years of experience and he  would  be

round about 45 to 50 years.  And add another 15 years to  his

term, he retires at a good old age anyway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ultimately, Mr Speaker, Sir, it comes down to

balance, and it is a judgement call.  Six years, 10 years, 15

years, I believe the Government has made a judgement call and

we  can wait for our time to make the judgement whether  this

is a correct number or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank  the  Members  who have supported  the  Amendment  Bill

although  some  have  expressed  reservations  on  particular

issues which I will touch on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee generally supports the amendment to

the  Constitution, for which I thank him.   However,  he  has

raised  the  point  that,  in  the  proposed  amendment,  the

Minister for Finance has the final say on the amount  of  NII

that  the  Government would lock up and, if in the event  the

President does not agree with this, there might be  an  issue

of  conflict.   I  believe that this is  unlikely  to  happen

because  the  President has full access to  the  Government's

accounts  and  these  accounts are audited  by  the  Auditor-General.   And  if  he  does  not agree  to  the  statements,

including  the NII projections, he can raise any issues  with

the  Government  at any time.  In any case, our  proposal  is

that  we will agree with the President which items should  be

included as NII and incorporate these into the principles for

the  protection of reserves.  So, on balance, it is  unlikely

that disputes would arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has raised several points, first of

which is what is the role of Government and the public in the

protection   of  reserves.   I  think  the  relationship   is

straightforward.  Past reserves belong to the people, and the

Government  is  merely  a  guardian  and  steward  of   these

reserves.   A  good steward, in his role, is to  protect  the

reserves  and  ensure  that they are available  for  spending

should  the  occasion  arise.  The reserves  should  also  be

efficiently managed so that the capital sum grows over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has also asked whether the figure of 50% to be

protected  was arrived at arbitrarily, because  she  believes

that  it is difficult to make accurate projections of revenue

and expenditure over the long term.  And, if there should  be

inaccuracies to these estimates, the figure of 50%  may  need

to  be  amended over time, which would not be very desirable.

I agree with her that the figure of 50% should not be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>

changed  too  frequently  as each  change  would  require  an

amendment   to   the   Constitution,   which   is   obviously

undesirable.   The figure of 50% was therefore  chosen  after

very  careful  consideration  of the  Government's  long-term

revenue and expenditure estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, on the revenue side, long-term

forecasts  of  operating revenue have been  fairly  reliable.

This  is  because we have a high degree of tax compliance  in

Singapore.  Also, the Government's revenue income growth  had

shown  consistent  and strong correlation  with  GDP  growth.

This means that if the Singapore economy continues to grow at

around 4% to 5% over the longer term, we can be certain  that

fairly  reliable estimates of operating revenue growth  would

be possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure side, long-term estimates of

expenditure,  especially  development  expenditures  and,  in

particular,  increases in health costs, are also  subject  to

uncertainty.    However,  the  balance  of   other   spending

requirements of Government is much more predictable  as  they

are largely under Government control.  On balance, therefore,

we believe that the longer-term forecasts of operating budget

balances should be fairly reliable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, reasonable forecasts of future NII flows are

also  fairly  reliable based on GIC's experience in  managing

past  reserves in the last 20 years.  Overall, therefore,  it

is concluded that no more than 50% of NII should be needed to

supplement  operating revenues in order to  finance  forecast

expenditures through the year 2010.  In fact, if  GDP  growth

rates  should exceed forecasts, and prudent control continues

to  be  exercised over expenditures, 50% of NII may  even  be

sufficient  to ensure balanced budgets through  most  of  the

second  decade of this century.  The need for making frequent

changes to the 50% figure is therefore unlikely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim is also concerned that future governments may,

through the use of sophisticated financial instruments,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>

manipulate the Government's accounts to maximise NII flows so

that  they would have a larger access to it.  This is  indeed

possible,  but the only way in which a profligate  government

can  increase  access  to NII is to  try  to  manipulate  the

investments  so  that you get a larger flow of  interest  and

dividend income.  If they try to do this, it will show up  in

the  accounts available to the President and his  Council  of

Presidential Advisers.  Any large scale manipulation  of  our

reserves to focus on buying huge amounts of, say, junk  bonds

with  high interest rates will become very obvious.  And when

this  comes  to  the  attention  of  the  President  and  his

advisers,  the  President  has  an  obligation  to  call  the

Government  to account for these changes and  if  he  is  not

satisfied  with  the answer, he can take the  matter  to  the

public  and to Parliament.  I think it is unlikely  that  any

significant  manipulation can be achieved without  attracting

the President's attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen has made some strong pleas for

increased social and health spending for older citizens.  The

Minister for Health has addressed part of his concerns but  I

would like to just point out that the use of macro statistics

on health expenditure is very dangerous because it depends on

what  you mean by "expenditure".  I would rather, in  looking

at  what  we  spend and what other countries spend,  look  at

other   types   of  statistics,  such  as  life   expectancy,

percentage  of  life  births,  and  other  quality  of   life

standards which we have achieved relative to other countries.

That  is  probably a better measure of how well the money  we

have  spent  on  health has achieved and, in  most  of  these

measures, I think we stand out quite well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although what we spend looks small relative

to  what  other  countries spend, what we do spend  is  spent

wisely  and efficiently.  There is no doubt that spending  on

health  and  social  costs  will  increase  rapidly  as   our

population  ages.  In fact, it is precisely for  this  reason

that the Constitution is being amended to allow access to 50%

of   NII   in   order  to  meet  increased  future   spending

requirements, primarily on health care.  The Minister for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>

Health  has  also  said that we have made  a  start  in  this

direction  as the Government has created several  buckets  of

funds, ie, Medifund and the Eldercare Endowment Fund in which

monies are placed in anticipation of future requirements  for

the  elderly.   In the case of the Eldercare Endowment  Fund,

the  targeted  amount is $2.5 billion, of which $400  million

has  already  been placed.  We will continue to add  to  this

Endowment  Fund  in  future from budget  surpluses  and  also

through  the NII component.  I think this covers largely  the

issues which have been raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to the point raised by Mr Low Thia

Khiang  on the term of the Auditor-General.  He says that  he

does not support the amendment because he believes that it is

necessary  for  the  Auditor-General to  be  appointed  until

retirement as this gives him independence. This is  a  matter

of  judgement.  We believe that 6 years plus 6  years  should

provide  him with sufficient independence and it  is  not  an

uncommon practice for other large countries to also limit the

terms  of the Auditor-General.  For example, Australia has  a

10-year  non-renewable term; Canada also has a  10-year  non-renewable  term.  Japan has a 7-year term.  New Zealand  also

has  a  non-renewable 7-year term.  In the case of the United

States  of  America, it is a 15-year non-renewable  term.  So

there is a wide range of options open and it depends on  your

judgment  on the quality of the people you appoint, and  also

what   is  the  objective  of  appointing  people  to   these

positions,  whether you want them to stay  effectively  until

retirement,  which  means you have to avoid  appointing  good

people   to  these  positions  early  which  is,   I   think,

undesirable. As I have explained in my speech, the reasons we

have  chosen to make these amendments are quite clear  and  I

believe they are sound and correct.

<div align="center"><b>LIFELONG LEARNING ENDOWMENT FUND BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br><i>Objective</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to establish a Lifelong Learning

Endowment  Fund.  This fund was first announced by the  Prime

Minister  in  August 2000 in his National Day  Rally  speech.

The  Prime Minister said that the Fund would be launched with

an initial sum of $500 million from Government's surplus.  It

will  be  built  up  over  the years  from  future  budgetary

surpluses to a target size of $5 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund will be used to

promote and support lifelong learning in Singapore.  It  will

finance  efforts  to  encourage  Singaporeans  to  engage  in

lifelong  learning, and provide assistance and  opportunities

for  them to do so.  This will help Singaporeans to meet  the

needs  of a knowledge-based economy and cope with the  threat

of  structural  unemployment.  In particular, the  Fund  will

help  to  enhance the employability of those  who  are  lower

skilled or those who come from the lower income group.

<br><br><i>The Imperative of Lifelong Learning</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the importance of lifelong learning cannot be over-emphasised. Increasingly,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>

knowledge   and  skills  are  becoming  the  key  competitive

advantage  for  individual  workers,  companies  and   entire

nations.   Today,  a CD-ROM costs less than  fifty  cents  to

produce.   But when that same CD-ROM is loaded with  exciting

computer  game  or some very efficient office  software,  the

same  article can now be sold for $50 to more than $100.   It

is  the software knowledge and skills which created the value

added.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the rapid pace of technological advancement also

means  that the shelf life of knowledge and skills is getting

shorter.  We need life-long learning to remain up-to-date and

in possession of skills which can drive the economy forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another example, Sir. The neighbourhood

or  backyard mechanics that we used to go to in the past  are

facing  a  lot of competition and a dwindling customer  base.

Why?   Because  the  new generation cars come  with  computer

engine   management  system  and  many  other   sophisticated

devices.   The old mechanics do not know how to service  such

hi-tech  gadgets in the cars.  And car-owners prefer to  send

their  expensive cars to the agents for maintenance  and  for

servicing, because the agents have trained mechanics who  can

deal with these sophisticated systems.  The mechanics of  old

who  cannot  or do not want to upgrade their skill  may  well

have  to  look for an alternative vocation. To put it simply,

lifelong learning is no longer an option.  It is a necessity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, skills upgrading has a long history in Singapore.

It  is not a recent discovery or something that we just  come

upon overnight.  In fact, since 1979, the Government had been

providing  incentives for worker training through the  Skills

Development Fund. National training initiatives, such as BEST

and  WISE,  were  also introduced to help the lower  educated

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, EDB and the NTUC introduced the Skills

Redevelopment Programme (SRP).  This programme was expanded

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>

in 1998 into a full-scale nation-wide programme to help older

and   lower  educated  workers  facing  retrenchment  in  the

aftermath  of the Asian economic crisis.  In July last  year,

we  revised the Skills Development Levy to provide more funds

for  skills  upgrading.   We also launched the  $200  million

Manpower  Development  Assistance  Scheme,  as  part  of  our

Manpower 21 action plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our job is far from over. Lifelong learning is not

a  one-time  effort,  but,  as the name  itself  suggests,  a

continual  effort.   Today, we are taking  another  important

step  towards  helping  Singaporeans to  embark  on  lifelong

learning.

<br><br><i>Establishment of the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the establishment of a Lifelong Learning Endowment

Fund will provide a secure and continuing stream of income to

support our lifelong learning efforts in the years ahead.  It

is  a  testimony to the Government's commitment to continuous

upgrading and re-skilling of workers.  By setting aside  part

of our budgetary surpluses to build up this Lifelong Learning

Endowment  Fund,  we are, in fact, investing  the  fruits  of

economic growth in the development of our people.  This  will

help to sustain our competitiveness and ensure prosperity  in

the  future.  The Lifelong Learning Fund will ensure not only

the  continuity of existing manpower development  programmes,

such  as the Skills Redevelopment Programme, but also  create

opportunities for new programmes to help our workers  acquire

the skills and capabilities for the knowledge economy.

<br><br><i>Size of the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund will be started with an initial contribution of

$500  million.   Based on the prevailing CPF Special  Account

interest rate of 4%, the initial capital sum will earn  about

$20  million  a year to support lifelong learning activities.

When the Fund reaches the target size of $5

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>

billion,  we  should have about  $200 million  each  year  to

support lifelong learning activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will study the needs of employers and

workers and develop programmes which can be supported by  the

Lifelong  Learning Fund.  More schemes will be  added  as  we

build   up  the  capital  sum.   My  Ministry  also  welcomes

innovative  ideas and proposals from community  organisations

which want to play a role.

<br><br><i>LLF Programmes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, my Ministry and the Infocomm Development

Authority have been working with organisations, such  as  the

National Library Board, People's Association, National Trades

Union Congress, the Singapore National Employers' Federation,

and  also  the  self-help groups, to develop  a  National  IT

Literacy Programme.  This programme aims to help Singaporeans

acquire  basic IT and Internet skills.  It will minimise  the

dangers   of   a   widening  digital  divide   disadvantaging

Singaporeans who lack such skills.  A pilot project  will  be

launched   before  April  this  year.   About   5,000   adult

Singaporeans  from various organisations, including  selected

companies, the People's Association and the various self-help

groups,  are expected to participate in this pilot programme.

The  experience of the pilot project will enable us to refine

the programme for wider application later this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, aside from IT, the Lifelong Learning Fund will

progressively cover other employability skills and widen  the

supply of training opportunities.  Today, we already have  an

excellent  network of community facilities spread  throughout

Singapore.   This includes community clubs, self-help  groups

and  many  voluntary organisations.  We will work with  these

community   organisations   to   bring   lifelong    learning

opportunities   closer   to  the  heartlanders.    For   many

Singaporeans,  the convenience and proximity  to  home  could

make  a  big  difference in getting them to take up  lifelong

learning.  Such community-based

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>

learning and skills upgrading is an area which we will  study

closely.

<br><br><i>Provisions in the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now address the key provisions

of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 anticipates the setting out of the operational

date of the Bill.  The Minister for Manpower will appoint the

date at which the Act will come into operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 provide for the establishment of the

Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund with capital money provided

by  Parliament.   The  capital money can  only  be  used  for

investments  authorised  under the  Financial  Procedure  Act

(Cap. 109).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 sets out the purposes for which the income of

the  Endowment  Fund  may  be expended.   These  include  the

promotion,  establishment  of  facilities  and  provision  of

financial  assistance  for the acquisition,  development  and

upgrading of skills to enhance employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 establishes an Advisory Council to advise the

Minister  for Manpower on the application of the income  from

the Endowment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 allows expenses incurred in connection with the

operation  and  administration of the Endowment  Fund  to  be

defrayed out of the income of the Endowment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, clause 17 empowers the Minister to make

regulations  for  the  purposes  of  the  Bill.   These   may

prescribe the procedures for payments from the fund, criteria

for  approval of applications for the fund and the  procedure

of the Advisory Council.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as Singapore transits into the New

Economy, lifelong learning will be a key competitive strategy

for  our success and prosperity.  We must nurture the  spirit

of  lifelong  learning  to equip Singaporeans  with  relevant

skills and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>

knowledge.    The   establishment  of  a  Lifelong   Learning

Endowment Fund is an important part of this effort.  It  will

provide  concrete support to foster a new spirit of  learning

among  our people.  It will enable us to embark on a learning

revolution  to  make Singapore a Learning Nation  capable  of

tapping   every   opportunity  in  the  New  Economy.    More

importantly, it will enable all segments of our population to

be  engaged in lifelong learning and bring about more  active

participation in the economy by Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for lifelong learning cannot be emphasised

enough  in Singapore which depends to such an extent  on  its

skilled,  educated workforce.  The setting up of an endowment

fund  to actively encourage Singaporeans to pursue the skills

needed  in  an  economy  where technology  is  still  rapidly

evolving  will  only  underscore the  importance  we  see  of

directing  Singaporeans  towards  a  philosophy  of  lifelong

learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan to set up an endowment fund is a bold move that

will  help  a  large  number of older Singapore  workers  who

missed  the opportunity for higher education in their younger

days  and who are now saddled with low skills.  The Fund will

give  them better hope in taking up skills courses  that  can

help enhance their employability.  Following the announcement

of  the  plan  to  set up the fund by the Prime  Minister  in

August last year, our workers and union leaders await eagerly

for  the  details.   I  am sure today's announcement  by  the

Minister  for Manpower will be welcome not only by  our  low-skilled  workers but Singapore workers in general,  including

the better educated, as well as the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund can fill a gap in

existing  assistance  programmes  like  the  SRP,  the   NTUC

Education and Training Fund and other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>

programmes  supported  by the Skills Development  Fund.   The

conditions   governing  the  SRP  and  SDF  limit  subsidised

training to particular groups of employees.  In contrast, the

Lifelong Endowment Fund does not set any limits on the target

groups.   It  should, therefore, work alongside schemes  like

SRP,  NETF and SDF, rather than duplicating the areas already

covered  by  these programmes.  While the Fund  should  widen

further  the  training  opportunities for  older  workers  at

company  and industry levels, it can also be even widened  to

assist  training of better-skilled workers.  I would like  to

urge that the Fund be made available for workers who want  to

take  up  courses  not covered by the SRP by subsidising  the

course  fees as well as to encourage companies to send  their

workers for skills upgrading through absentee-payroll scheme,

like  the  SRP.   As  we have seen in the past  three  years,

including  during the recession years, even  skilled  workers

and   professionals  were  retrenched  as   their   companies

reorganised  and  restructured.   In  the  New  Economy,  all

workers,  irrespective  of  their  skills  levels,  are   not

protected  against skills obsolescence, unless  they  upgrade

and re-tool themselves.  In this case, the flexibility of the

endowment  fund must be stressed.  But having  said  that,  I

must  emphasise the priority that we must give  through  this

new  Fund  in  assisting  the more  vulnerable  lower-skilled

workers to learn relevant skills to remain employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Bill, an advisory council will be set

up  to  advise  the  Minister on the tasks to  be  undertaken

through  the  application of the Lifelong Learning  Endowment

Fund.  It is important that this advisory council be made  up

of  people who can best determine the array of skills courses

which workers should have access to under the Endowment Fund.

Representatives  from  the  labour  movement   and   employer

organisations should be included in the advisory council.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the endowment fund also provide for

"the  promotion of the acquisition, development or  upgrading

of  such  skills  and expertise".  The inclusion  of  such  a

clause  in the Bill will help to ensure that the Fund can  be

used  to  provide  incentives to companies  that  promise  to

employ retrenched workers, particularly those above 40  years

old,  who take up full-time SRP or SRP-like courses.  Sir,  I

raise  this suggestion because some older retrenched  workers

face  difficulties in getting jobs suitable  with  the  newly

acquired  skills  after they have completed  their  full-time

courses.   The  number of such workers is now small,  but  it

could  be  more  in  future as even older  workers  would  be

retrenched and they would need the support of their employers

to  gain better jobs after they have completed their courses.

It should provide the incentives to companies that offer jobs

to  such  retrenched  workers on  the  condition  that  these

workers  complete their courses.  Based on NTUC's  experience

working  with  retrenched workers during  the  recession  and

working with self-help groups to help these workers under the

SRP  Facilitators  Programme, I  find  that  many  retrenched

workers  are  motivated to upgrade their skills.   We  should

take  one more step in helping them, by giving incentives  to

companies to hire them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also includes possible funding for

research  and development of "learning methods and technology

to  enhance the acquisition, development or upgrading of such

skills  and expertise".  This provision will make it possible

to  fund  the development of better designed modular courses;

courses  that  will  make teaching simple and  learning  fun;

those  that would not make the workers feel fearful of  being

shown up as unintelligent in the classroom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Prime Minister and the Manpower

Minister have mentioned the IT Literacy Programme as  one  of

those  that  would take advantage of the new Endowment  Fund.

Other  than our unions and employer organisations, we  should

indeed  make  the Fund accessible to grassroots organisations

like the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>

Citizens'  Consultative Committee, Community  Clubs  and  the

Community Development Councils to provide IT courses  at  the

local community level.  But I should caution against wasteful

duplication  of  having  too many  IT  centres  in  the  same

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me just conclude by stating that the

setting up of this Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund is a step

in  the  right  direction in helping our workers  imbibe  the

culture  of  continuous learning.  This  is  a  bold  way  to

support   our  people  against  the  pitfalls  of  structural

unemployment already experienced by many developed countries.

This is a positive way to help our workers and our economy to

be  even more competitive.  We are fully aware that if we are

not  competitive, we will not be able to generate enough jobs

for  our people.  We will have unemployment.  Even if we  are

competitive  as  an  economy, but if many  of  our  unskilled

workers  become  unemployable as  we  move  deeper  into  the

Knowledge-Based  Economy,  we  will  face  the  problems   of

structural  unemployment due to the mismatch  of  skills  and

jobs.  So this new Fund, as provided in the Bill for which it

is debated today in our first sitting in this new millennium,

is  a  very important vehicle which will lead Singapore  well

into the 21st century.  It could help our workers to level up

in  terms  of income so that they can continue to enjoy  high

quality  of  life  and  thus  maintain  social  cohesion   in

Singapore in years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the European

Commission made a report in November last year that within 10

years,  80% of the technology in use today will be  outdated.

This means that if nothing is done, only 20% of the workforce

will have the skills and knowledge to keep a job.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.22 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not train and upgrade workers, 80% of the

present workforce will not have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>

the skills and knowledge to master new technology.  This will

affect  our ability to maintain full employment and meet  our

social   objectives.   There  could  be  massive   structural

unemployment accompanied by major social problems.  I am sure

none of us want to see that happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill because it will contribute to

enhancing  the employability of workers, and I fully  support

full employment to be part of the economic and social agenda.

Economic  growth must also meet social objectives.  The  best

social  safety  net any worker can expect is a  decent  good-paying job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is crafted in general terms and does not have

details on how it works.  As the Minister has explained, most

of the details will be in the form of regulations.  So I will

just  speak  in general terms and hope that the Minister  and

the advisory council that will be formed will take up some of

the comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, training and learning is a shared responsibility.

The   Government,  the  employer,  the  community   and   the

individual  all  have a part to play.  The  establishment  of

this Endowment Fund should not result in the reduction of the

shared  responsibility.   The aim of  lifelong  learning  and

training  should be to contribute to the continued well-being

of  everyone in our society.  We should see lifelong learning

as  a  continuous  process that takes place throughout  one's

working  life.   We  should  also have  to  learn  from  real

experiences  at  work and life.  It is beyond the  occasional

but useful spurt of training in classrooms or elsewhere.   In

that  light,  I support the fund being used in  research  and

development  of  learning methods and in  the  technology  of

delivery mechanisms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best approach to ensure that future demands for

skills are met is for employers to invest in training as part

of  workplace  learning.  I hope this  Bill  will  not  shift

responsibility  for  training  totally  to  workers   because

workers  will have access to this Fund.  Employers will  have

to continue to invest in education, training

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>

and  development of their employees.  This Fund should be  an

additional  support  for  workers complementing  the  various

existing  Government  and employers' schemes  in  place  now.

These schemes include the Skills Redevelopment Programme, the

Skills  Development Fund, etc.  The objects and  applications

of income of the Fund in clause 5 is crafted in language that

is  so  broad that I think we need some reassurance  on  this

point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the individual, lifelong learning will need an

element of self-direction and self-management.  People of all

ages  and  all  backgrounds  will have  to  embrace  lifelong

learning,  otherwise  we  will all lose  life  skills.   Some

workers will need more support to successfully achieve  this.

The 2000 Population Census shows that older and less educated

workers  have greater risks of facing unemployment.   I  will

add that the physically disabled also need special attention.

These  people  need training most, but they  also  have  many

impediments to take up training.  The lower income group find

it  difficult  to  find time to go for training.   They  earn

little.   Their  incomes are now dropping  due  to  new  work

organisation  of outsourcing and contracting.  Older  workers

who  are facing job insecurity will need to continue to  work

as  they  live  longer.  These groups will  have  to  embrace

lifelong  learning and I ask that special extra attention  be

paid to these groups of people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a little concerned about clause 4(5) of this

Bill.   The clause says that any diminution in the  value  of

the  capital money has to be made good from the income of the

Fund.   This  could  happen  if there  are  wrong  investment

decisions  made or there is a general economic downturn.   If

there  is  a wrong investment, I do not think workers  should

suffer.   In  an  economic  downturn  particularly,  in  fact

workers  would  need  more  help and  they  would  need  more

training.   From  this Fund itself, in an economic  downturn,

the  returns will be less.  With this reduced income,  trying

to make good the capital means that workers will be affected,

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>

workers  will  suffer.  I hope that the  desire  to  maintain

capital  money  will  not  be  at  the  expense  of  workers.

Therefore  extra  money will be found  when  it  is  actually

needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I ask the Government to give money from the

Fund  to  individuals as in CPF, for use of training  in  new

areas  not  provided by the employers and which  may  not  be

directly  related  to their present job or funded  elsewhere.

This  idea is not new.  It was raised by many Members in this

House  and  by my colleagues in the unions.  It is  to  start

what  you  call a skills-save account similar to the Medisave

account  in  CPF.   This is basically for  workers  to  learn

continuously and to live more fulfilling lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the

Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Minister of State without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State without Portfolio (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the outset, may I say that I completely

support  what  the  Minister has said in his  Second  Reading

speech  and  I  am also in complete agreement  with  what  my

colleagues, Mr Hawazi and Mr Thomas, have said before me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most countries, subsidised education is given to the

young only.  Once the young people leave school, they are  on

their  own.  As adults, they have to find their own resources

to  extend their learning.  Our system was also like this  in

the  past.  But as the Minister reminded us, we have  changed

the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first change came with the Skills Development Fund

which   was  set  up  in  1979.   Then  came  various   other

programmes,  the latest of which are the Skills Redevelopment

Programme  and the NTUC Education and Training  Fund.   These

programmes  work on the premise that learning does  not  stop

after  one  leaves school.  Learning is necessary  throughout

one's lifetime, and should be encouraged and subsidised, just

as  we  encourage and subsidise our children to go to school.

It is a very fundamental

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>

change in the way we should think about education, and it  is

a very profound change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund Bill confirms that

our  Government will make lifelong learning a lasting reality

for  our  workers.  Our union leaders and members are excited

about  the possibilities it offers.  They have waited eagerly

for  the Fund to be implemented since it was announced by the

Prime  Minister last year.  The Fund will help workers  learn

new  skills  to stay employable as the industries restructure

and  business models change.  With a possible slowdown in our

economy  while the US economy takes a downturn,  it  is  even

more  urgent  for our workers to get help to  train  and  re-train.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers know, as the Minister pointed out, that

lifelong  learning  is not an option but  a  necessity.   Our

workers  know that there are many opportunities for  them  to

upgrade.   They know that training is important and that  the

courses  are  heavily subsidised.  Many of  the  courses  are

modular,  so  the  workers can break  up  the  training  into

different parts to suit their schedules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC Education and Training Fund was set up with an

initial  sum  of  $20  million.   It  has  received  so  many

applications from union members for training grants  that  we

have to increase it now to $40 million.  This shows that many

workers  are keen to retrain and are actually doing something

about it for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we also hear that older workers are reluctant

to  go  for  training.  Is that so?  In my  discussions  with

union leaders and members, I see that there is indeed such  a

reluctance.   The  workers  agree  that  the  subsidies   are

generous, but they think the barrier to entry is still  high.

I  think  there are three basic reasons for this.  First,  is

the   loss  of  income.   Companies,  though  supportive   of

training, will not send many workers for the longer  courses.

If the workers want to take up longer courses, they will have

to  take  no pay leave, or even resign from their jobs.   The

older workers have heavier family

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>

commitments.  Many will feel the strain if they have to  lose

their income for even just a few weeks.  Of course, there are

classes  conducted at night or on weekends.  But some workers

do  not  want  to  attend them because  they  will  lose  the

opportunity to do overtime work to supplement their incomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, these are the workers who will benefit most from

the  training.   What the older workers  need  are  not  just

subsidised  courses,  but  also  some  help  to  cover  their

household expenses while they attend the courses.  Looking at

the  Bill,  Sir, I am not sure whether the Lifelong  Learning

Endowment  Fund  can be used to help the workers  cover  some

part  of  their loss of income when they attend  courses.   I

would therefore like to ask the Minister whether the Fund can

be  used  in  this way, and if not, whether there  are  other

means to help workers overcome this difficulty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason for their reluctance is their fear of

the  courses  themselves.  They are afraid that  they  cannot

absorb  the  lessons quickly enough, that they will  be  left

behind by their younger course mates, and that they will hold

back  the classes because they are too slow.  These are  real

fears.  Young people learn faster than older people, and they

learn in a different way.  Those of us who have children will

have  had enough humbling experiences learning with  them  to

know what I am talking about.  If we put 50 year olds side by

side with 16 year olds in the polytechnic or ITE, we are  not

going  to get the same result from the two groups within  the

same  timeframe.  If we teach 50 year olds using a curriculum

designed for 16 year olds, we will only discourage the  older

workers from joining the courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need is a better understanding of the

methodology to teach older adults.  We then need to structure

the  courses meant for them accordingly.  Here, the  Bill  is

very  clear.  Clause 5(2)(b) allows the Fund to  be  used  to

support  the  research or development in or of  the  learning

methods and technology to enhance the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>

acquisition, development or upgrading of skills and expertise

to enhance employability.  In other words, how to teach older

workers more effectively.  Or more importantly, how to design

training so that the older workers will feel comfortable  and

will enjoy the training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of older workers, I urge the Minister to give

top priority to using the Fund for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason for reluctance to go for training and

work  in  a  new  area  is the fear of  being  penalised  for

mistakes made while the worker is new to the new job.   Older

workers who are in a job for a long time gain experience  and

knowledge.  They become experts in their fields.  Their peers

and subordinates look up to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they retrain and enter a new area, they start from

square  one  like  everyone else, including those  junior  to

them.  They lose status and influence, which they may not  be

able  to  regain.   If  they  make  mistakes,  they  may   be

penalised.   Worse  still,  if  they  cannot  cope  with  the

retraining or the new job, they may become unwanted.  So some

workers  would rather stay in the old job until  it  is  made

redundant,  and then move on to another company  and  do  the

same  job  all over again because they are good at that  job.

They  are afraid that their attempt to try something new  may

backfire  on them.  But the fact is if they refuse  to  learn

new skills, their industry may simply disappear and they will

be left far behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem the Fund alone cannot solve. But

there  is  a solution.  The employers must do their  part  to

make  the  training and transition easier  for  the  workers.

Allow  me  to  tell  you how one factory helped  a  group  of

workers  change from using a manual process to a computerised

one.   It  is  a real story and it happened in  Wing  Tai,  a

garment  factory.  In the factory, a group of ladies manually

laid out paper patterns on the cloth and cut out the required

shapes.   They  had  to squeeze the patterns  as  closely  as

possible  to  minimise wasting of cloth and  had  to  cut  as

quickly as possible to keep

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>

the  sewing  line going.  They were very good in  their  jobs

because they were very experienced at it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, no human being can beat a computerised

machine  when it comes to squeezing patterns closely together

and cutting quickly.  So the company decided to automate, and

asked  the ladies to train to operate this new machine.   The

ladies tendered their resignation.  They would rather  go  to

another  factory  to lay out the patterns  manually  than  to

learn  how  to operate the new machine.  They were afraid  of

failure.  It was not worth their while to try.  But the  boss

was  creative.   He  told the ladies:   "Well,  you  wish  to

resign?   OK.  From now on, consider that you have  resigned,

consider that you are no more with my company.  You are  free

to  go."  Then he told them, "Now that you have resigned, you

have to look for a new job.  But since you have time, why not

try  out  this  machine anyway?  Every day you  turn  up  for

training, I will pay you.  Anytime you want to give up,  just

take  your  pay and walk out.  You can do that, because  from

now  on you are not my staff.  I cannot punish you.  I cannot

do  anything to you."  The ladies stayed on to learn  on  the

new  machine.  After a few days, they decided not  to  resign

anymore.  And in fact, they became very skilled with the  new

machine, and became far more productive than before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of the story is: Workers fear change. They

fear  being  penalised.  They fear the loss  of  self-esteem.

Employers can and must help the workers remove this fear.  My

message  to  employers  is:  Please do  not  just  blame  the

workers  for not trying.  Please make it easier for  them  to

try.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a Part 2 to this Wing Tai story. Not long

after  the  company has automated their cloth  cutting,  they

found  that  the costs were still too high in Singapore.   So

they  closed  down the production line and shifted  it  to  a

lower  cost  country nearby.  And the ladies had to  be  laid

off.   Before  we  think that all the training  on  them  was

wasted, actually there is a happy ending to this story.   The

three of them got together and started

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>

their  own company to do garment alterations.  They  put  all

their  previous training, knowledge and experience into  very

good  use.   And they are no longer workers; they are  bosses

and  owners of their own company.  And the Wing Tai boss told

me that these ladies are doing quite good business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the next moral of the story is this: Even with

retraining,  the  industries  continue  to  restructure   and

industries   can  disappear.   Our  workers  must  constantly

retrain,  be  prepared  to adapt and make  full  use  of  the

learning opportunities to improve their own prospects in  the

changing circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many older workers have low educational

qualification.  Because they have lower education, they  have

lower income.  Because they have lower income, they are  less

able  to  afford a loss of income when they go for  training.

Because  they  cannot attend the training, they  remain  less

qualified.  This is the "circle of disadvantage".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund is a bold and

concrete  measure that can break the circle of  disadvantage.

Let  us lower the barrier of entry for training.  Let us find

better methods to make training effective and enjoyable.  Let

us  help  them  overcome their fears.  Let our older  workers

gain  new  knowledge and skills that will bring  them  higher

incomes.   And  with  higher incomes,  they  will  have  more

savings,  then  they can take on courses of longer  duration.

And  then  they will acquire better knowledge, and they  will

learn  more complex skills and take on yet higher level jobs.

This is the "circle of opportunity".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us use the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to break

the  "circle  of disadvantage", and turn it into  a  lifelong

"circle of opportunity" for all our workers in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, we all know that with money, time and  energy,

many things can be done. But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>

many  people often feel that they have not enough  time,  not

enough money, and not enough energy, and so they could not do

anything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the dialogue sessions with our workers, I observe

that  many  young workers are not willing to go for  training

because  they claim that they do not have enough time.   They

want  to  spend their time working overtime in order to  earn

more  money.  In the meantime, the middle-aged workers  would

say  that they have family commitments, and not enough money.

As  for  the older workers, they have time and money, but  no

energy  to  go for training.  On the other hand, the  workers

who  are undergoing training have money, time, and energy  to

undergo all the training that they want.  So the crux of  the

matter  is the workers must understand that whether they  are

old,  middle-aged or young, they do have the time, money  and

energy to undergo some training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund is the

manifestation  of  the  Government's  re-affirmation  of  the

spirit  of lifelong learning.  Whether you are old, young  or

middle-aged,  you can always find time, money and  energy  to

undergo some form of training.  As a matter of fact, lifelong

learning  is not a new expression that emerges with  the  New

Economy.  When we are young, we must learn.  We must keep  on

learning  for  so long as we are alive. For my generation  of

Chinese-educated  Singaporeans,  we  learnt  in  school   the

Chinese  phonetic symbols, English, computers,  Hanyu  Pinyin

and  the  Internet.  So if we do not carry  on  learning  and

making ourselves relevant to the times, we will be the losers

for the rest of our lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, successful businessmen all know that the

marketplace is like a battlefield.  They learn and adapt  the

various  strategies from Sun Tze.  So they all learn and  win

all  life long.  We must inject this spirit into the  concept

of lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good that we have this Bill before us. I support

this Bill.  But there are two points I wish to raise with the

Minister for his clarification.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in this Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, the

stress is on enhanced employability.  That is the emphasis  - enhanced  employability.  So the emphasis is on skills.   But

there  is no mention of the word "knowledge" in the Bill.   I

feel  that  lifelong learning should not be confined  to  the

skills  level.   It should also be extended to the  knowledge

level  so  that  when  we encourage Singaporeans  to  go  for

lifelong  learning,  aside from skills enhancement,  we  also

encourage  them to enhance their knowledge.  To acquire  more

knowledge, we must teach people not only how to do a job  but

how to be a man.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, older people have this worry

that  after  Singapore becomes  globalised, they  would  lose

their jobs, as there may not be jobs for them to do.  So this

Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund Bill is a shot in  the  arm

for  them  so that they will be able to learn more skills  to

make it easier for them to secure jobs. It is very painful to

have  the  skills  without a job.  So I  feel  that  when  we

subsidise these older people for training, we have to be more

liberal with their choice of training programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the language of instruction, it should not

be confined to English only.  The Ministry of Manpower should

also have a package so that these older people would be given

some kind of special treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must teach every Singaporean not only how to do a job

but  also  how to be a man.  It has been observed that  while

most of our young people can do their job very well there are

many  who  do  not  know how to conduct themselves  properly.

They are very strong in their jobs but when they are facing a

crisis and handling human relations, marriage and parenthood,

they  are  not  so strong.  We must have some programmes  for

social  and personal cultivation to teach them how  to  be  a

man.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that there is no specific

explanation on the cost of setting up the infrastructure.  We

know that we are aiming at all Singaporeans, including people

living in HDB estates.  So the best

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>

places would be the CCCs, the CCs and the RCs.  In order  for

these  CCs  and  RCs  to  be  able to  make  available  their

facilities,  they will have to find money.  If they  have  to

raise funds for such facilities, then it would slow down  the

process.   For  example, if a community centre  or  community

club wants to start computer classes, they will have to raise

funds  of  $10,000,  $100,000  or  whatever.   To  cater  for

National Education, all the basic infrastructure costs should

be subsidised.  I also suggest that in assessing applications

for  subsidies, they should also allow the residents to enjoy

the  benefits under the Skills Development Fund.  We all know

of  the song "We must slog in order to win", but I think when

you  slog you may not necessarily win.  So in order  to  win,

they must have new skills and new knowledge.  They must learn

new  skills  and new knowledge so that they will be  able  to

win.  So we must learn in order to win.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, in principle, I support the

Bill, but I have many concerns in regard to the provisions in

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3(2), it is noted that "The Minister shall

be  responsible for the administration of the Endowment  Fund

and  that  the Fund shall be regarded as a Government  Fund".

One  would  think  that since the Fund shall comprise  mainly

taxpayers'  money  and  public  donations,  there  should  be

complete  accountability and transparency in respect  of  the

administration of the Fund.  This can be achieved only if the

administration  of  the  Fund  can  be  carried  out  by   an

independent  body.  As the Bill now stands, all payments  out

of  the Fund is dependent only on the decision of one  man  - the  Minister - who is a PAP member.  I think that this  kind

of administration of the Fund is not satisfactory.  I propose

that  it  be  administered by an independent body,  which,  I

suggest,  can comprise respectable and well-known  people  in

our community without any political affiliations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of this independent body shall be to disburse

the income of the Fund

based entirely on merit and not on any political preferences.

Unfortunately, I note that there is nowhere in the Bill  that

says that the income of the Endowment Fund shall be paid  out

based entirely on the merits of the applicants.  As the  Bill

now stands, what is there to stop the income of the Fund from

being  distributed  to  only  people  who  support  the  PAP?

Supporters of the opposition, I think, shall have no ghost of

a chance to enjoy any of the benefits of the Endowment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of the Community Improvement Projects

Committee  (CIPC)  funds readily comes to  mind.   Taxpayers'

money  that is controlled by the CIPC has, in the main,  only

been  disbursed to PAP-controlled constituencies.   The  Town

Council at Potong Pasir, which is opposition-controlled,  has

not  been given one cent of the CIPC funds, although  it  has

requested for it many times.  Similarly, my fear is that  the

Endowment  Fund, which is a public fund, without  independent

control, shall be made use of mainly for the benefit  of  the

PAP rather than for the general good of the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5(1) states the objects for which the income of

the  Endowment Fund shall be used.  They are to benefit  only

"persons".  I wonder why the word "persons" is used  and  not

"workers".  This gives the impression that the Endowment Fund

does  not  want to benefit the workers but rather is confined

to  certain  hand-picked persons only.   The  word  "workers"

should be substituted for the word "persons".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 concerns the Advisory Council. I notice that

very  little  is  said of the Advisory Council.   Nothing  is

mentioned  of  its number or composition.  I hope,  like  the

CIPC, the Advisory Council is not going to be packed with PAP

MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill talks about the capital money of

the  Endowment Fund but there is no mention of a fixed amount

that  is to be placed as capital in the Endowment Fund.   Can

the Minister please give an indication as to the amount to be

allocated as capital for this Endowment Fund?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first I would

like  to thank Mr Hawazi and the other hon. Members who spoke

in  support  of the Bill, including, I notice, Mr  Chiam  See

Tong,  who  expressed  his in-principle support  although  he

raised several questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to thank the Members for making various

suggestions, particularly about the type of training  or  the

nature  of  training and the way to deliver training  to  the

older  workers.  These are suggestions and issues which  will

certainly  be  taken  into consideration  when  the  Advisory

Council is convened to study various proposals for the use of

the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will respond to the various comments as they were

made.   First, Mr Hawazi suggested that the Lifelong Learning

Endowment   Fund  should  work  together  with   the   Skills

Redevelopment Programme (SRP) and the Skills Development Fund

(SDF),  and  not  to  compete  with  them  but,  rather,   to

complement  what is already being done through  the  SRP  and

SDF.   I  agree  with him.  That is in fact the intention  of

setting  up  a Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund:  to  provide

more  resources which could be used to complement the  budget

allocations  for programmes such as the Skills  Redevelopment

Programme,  and  also to provide additional support  for  the

Skills  Development  Fund in providing  training  and  skills

upgrading opportunities for workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also suggested that the Lifelong Learning

Endowment  Fund should provide support for CCCs or  community

clubs  and maybe even Community Development Council-initiated

programmes for skills upgrading.  I agree with him.  This  is

one  of the things that we will be looking into, how to  work

with  community organisations that want to play a very active

role  in  offering  skills  upgrading  opportunities  to  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, a project that I mentioned in my Second Reading

speech  -  the National IT Literacy Programme - is  something

that  was  conceived  along this line where  the  Government,

through the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, would work

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>

together  with community groups to offer basic IT skills  and

Internet skills training to people who lack such skills.   So

we  are  in fact going to work closely with various community

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that Mr Hawazi emphasised that the priority for

the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund should still remain with

the  lower-skilled  because this is the group  that  is  most

vulnerable,  although he also mentioned that  we  should  not

overlook the needs of the better-skilled, who will also  face

the danger of retrenchments in an economic downturn.  I agree

with  him.   We  will continue to focus our efforts  and  our

resources  on the lower-educated, lower-skilled Singaporeans,

particularly the older workers.  For this group,  we  already

have  a  very wide range of training courses available  under

different   programmes,  such  as  the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme, the National Skills Recognition System,  Strategic

Manpower Conversion Programme, etc.  For instance, under  the

SRP,  we have more than 20 industry sectors covered where  we

are  actually offering training for workers in these sectors.

These include electronics, hotel, marine, telecommunications,

taxi, healthcare, insurance, cleaning and even childcare.  We

will  continue  to  expand the list so  that  more  and  more

industry sectors are covered and the needs of workers in each

of these sectors will be catered to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked that employers should be encouraged to put

workers  who  are at risk of being retrenched  or  have  been

retrenched  on  to programmes such as the  SRP  and  for  the

Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to support these workers and

their  employers.  This is, in fact, one of the ways in which

we  are  encouraging employers to take advantage or  to  make

full use of the SRP in helping workers who are vulnerable  to

retrenchment.  We persuade employers, who are in the  process

of  having  to  downsize,  to send  their  workers  for  such

training  long  before they actually have to  be  retrenched,

which means that they will be given an opportunity to acquire

a new skill or to upgrade

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>

their old skills so that it is easier for them, when it comes

to  the  actual day of retrenchment, to go out there to  look

for  a  new  job.   The encouragement that  we  give  to  the

employers  is  a very substantial cash subsidy, the  absentee

payroll,  while their workers are sent away for training  and

we  also  bear  up  to  almost all  of  the  training  costs,

depending on the age of the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for workers who are better educated, such as

polytechnic  and  university  graduates,  they  have  already

enjoyed  a  headstart in the skills race,   compared  to  the

older   lower  educated  workers.  They  have  also  received

substantial Government subsidy in their higher education,  so

they  should  therefore take a higher  responsibility  and  a

higher  proportion of the cost of upgrading their skills.  Of

course,  in  this context, many employers are also continuing

to  provide their better educated workers with employer-based

upgrading  and  training.  We have  also  raised  the  skills

development levy ceiling from $1,000 to $1,500 in  July  last

year and we will continue to gradually adjust this ceiling up

to  $2,000.  By raising the skills development levy  ceiling,

we  are,  in  fact, enabling the Skills Development  Fund  to

collect  more  money which can then be used to  provide  more

training opportunities.  As the ceiling has been raised  from

$1,000  to  $1,500, and progressively to $2,000, we  will  be

able  to extend more training support and assistance to  even

polytechnic  graduates who are presently  not  fully  covered

under  the  skills development levy. So there  will  be  more

opportunities made available for this group of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a principle, Government's support for the higher

educated group would have to be focused on specific areas  of

critical  industry and skills requirement, rather  than  just

broad-based  support, such as fee subsidy  or  allowance  for

them  to  sign up for all kinds of postgraduate  courses.  We

have  to be very selective because these are people who  have

already benefited from a high level of Government subsidy  in

their tertiary education and for an additional upgrading to a

higher degree, we have to be very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>

selective.   Only  when we are sure that  this  will  make  a

significant  difference to our economic competitiveness  will

we be able to provide some form of support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing is that we are currently working

towards   increasing  the  capacity  or   opportunities   for

continuing education and training for the diploma and  degree

holders.   But  it  would have to be in  very  selective  and

economically  critical disciplines and courses which  can  be

made  available at our universities and polytechnics and also

the  ITE.  If you have read today's newspapers, there is also

a  possibility of having a fourth university.  If that  comes

about,  it would make it even easier for polytechnic  diploma

holders  who  want  to upgrade themselves.   They  will  have

access  to  a fourth university, which will offer  affordable

courses  for them to upgrade.  They do not have to either  go

overseas to upgrade or try to find one of the limited  places

in  NUS or NTU.  Let me assure him that we will also consider

how  we  can extend the assistance to the better educated  in

this  process of lifelong learning.  But at the  end  of  the

day,  we  must  have  our priority, and as  the  hon.  Member

himself  stated,  the  priority  should  be  with  the  lower

educated  and the less skilled workers because they  are  the

most vulnerable group now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas has expressed concern whether, with the

establishment of a Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, it would

shift the responsibility of skills upgrading and training  to

the  workers  and relieve the employers of their  traditional

responsibility of training their workers.  Let me assure  him

that  this  should not be the case.  I agree  that  employer-based  training is, in fact, the most important and effective

form  of  skills upgrading because training provided  by  the

employers will definitely be relevant to their jobs  and  the

skills  much  needed in the marketplace. We will continue  to

emphasise  the importance of employer-based training  in  the

programmes which we will develop and evolve for the  Lifelong

Learning  Endowment Fund.  I would like to  assure  the  hon.

Member  that it is not our intention to undermine this  nexus

between employers and employees in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>

terms of training and skills upgrading, but our intention  is

to  supplement and strengthen this relationship so that  more

and more employers will be willing to go out of their way, if

necessary, to provide training and skills upgrading to  their

employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing so, the programmes that we will craft for the

Lifelong  Learning  Endowment Fund will, as  I  mentioned  in

response  to  Mr  Hawazi,  complement  the  existing   Skills

Development  Fund  programme  and  the  Manpower  Development

Assistance  Scheme,  and because of the additional  resources

that  are  now  available, we will open up more opportunities

for  the workers.  In the future, when the budget allocations

for  the  Skills  Redevelopment Programme  and  the  Manpower

Development Assistance Scheme run down, we can then  use  the

Lifelong  Learning  Endowment  Fund's  stream  of  income  to

continue  to sustain this programme so that lifelong  efforts

will continue unabated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also raised a specific point concerning clause

4(5)  where  it  states that if there is a reduction  in  the

capital  sum  in the Fund, then before we spend  any  of  the

future  income, we should make good this loss.  He also  said

that  if we do so, we should not do it at the expense of  the

workers,  because  of  two possible scenarios  -  a  loss  in

capital  sum can happen in case of a bad investment  decision

or  in  a  general economic downturn.  I agree with him  that

yes,  this is a possibility.  We cannot dismiss it.  At  some

point  in  the future, from time to time, the Endowment  Fund

might actually suffer a capital loss. Should we make good the

capital  loss  before we start to spend the  future  revenues

that  come  later on?  I think the spirit of this  clause  is

that  we  should  make this effort before we start  to  spend

future revenues.  Let me explain why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not make up for the losses in the capital sum,

over several cycles of losses over a period of time, we could

seriously  diminish the amount of capital sum  available  and

future incomes would also diminish.  Although we understand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>

why in a downturn workers need more training and therefore we

should  actually spend more money and not spend less,  if  we

were  to  do  it,  we  will, in effect, be  depriving  future

workers  of  opportunities for training.  In any  event,  the

workers  are going to suffer.  Once you have a diminution  in

the  capital sum and you do not make up for it, the  question

is:  should  the  current group of workers suffer  or  future

workers  suffer?  Our view is that we should try as  fast  as

possible  to  make up for the losses in capital and  then  we

resume funding programmes so that future workers do not  have

to  suffer  the  losses.  I think this is a  wiser  and  more

prudent approach over the long-term because the intention  of

setting up an Endowment Fund is to make sure that there is  a

continuing stream of income, which hopefully, over the years,

will  grow  and we can continue to support lifelong  learning

activities.    If  you allow the funds to  run  down  by  not

making  up  for any capital losses, you are diminishing  this

return  and, in the long run, that would not be good for  the

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned about a skills-save account and

whether  we  could consider this under the Lifelong  Learning

Endowment  Fund.  Let me point out that, as I have  indicated

in  my  Second Reading speech, the estimated income from  the

Lifelong  Learning  Endowment Fund in the initial  years  may

only  be  $20 million to start with, and even if we  reach  a

target  of  $5  billion,  we only  have  $200  million.   The

Lifelong  Learning  Endowment Fund is perhaps  not  the  best

means to go about setting up the individual learning accounts

for  the workers because if we were to distribute this amount

of  money  to all the workers, we will probably end  up  with

each one getting less than $200 a year which will not make an

impact.   And by distributing this resource, we  may  not  be

able to focus on much needed programmes to upgrade the skills

of  workers  who are most vulnerable to retrenchment.  So  we

should  actually  harness this resource to  selectively  help

workers who are in greater risks.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Matthias Yao has given us a graphic account of how

workers  see lifelong learning and the kind of problems  that

they  face.   He mentioned three points, the first  point  is

that there is an obstacle confronting workers who want to  go

for  skills  upgrading. There is this concern about  loss  of

income.    Many  of  our  skills  upgrading  programmes   are

developed  with this concern in mind.  If you take  the  SRP,

for  instance, we provide up to 85% absentee payroll  subsidy

and  up  to 100% course fee subsidy, depending on the age  of

the  workers. For older workers, we contribute more. This  is

to  help  employers to put their workers up for this kind  of

programmes and not having to bear all the costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that if a worker is unemployed, then of

course  it  is  even more difficult for him to  go  for  such

skills  upgrading because he had already lost his job and  he

has  no income. It is precisely because of this concern  that

we  have set up programmes with self-help groups like  SINDA,

MENDAKI  and  CDAC  to  identify these  self-help  groups  as

surrogate   employers.   We  have   also   identified   other

organisations or associations as SRP facilitators. These  are

people  who  can help the unemployed by sponsoring  them  for

training  under  the SRP and we will then provide  them  with

both the course fee subsidy and the training allowances.  For

instance, up to now, about 7,000 low-income workers who  have

lost  their jobs, particularly during the downturn  of  1998,

had  managed  to  acquire better skills, qualifications,  and

also  had  their  skills upgraded under the SRP  through  the

surrogate  employers scheme.  Under that scheme, we  actually

provide  them with training, subsidise their course  fee  and

also a training allowance up to a maximum of about $500. With

that training allowance, we could help to defray some of  the

expenditure that the unemployed worker would need  to  incur.

We  cannot  provide huge allowances which would  make  it  so

attractive just to become a trainee, but we can help  workers

who  are out of job with some out-of-pocket expenses, so that

during that period they would not be in too great a financial

distress.  But it still depends on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>

the worker making the effort to come forward, sign up for the

programme  and  to diligently attend the training  course  to

qualify for his higher skill qualification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Matthias Yao also talked about the special needs for

the  training of adults.  This is, in fact, one of the  areas

that the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund will be looking at.

We  understand  that training adults is quite different  from

training the school-going cohort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we started the Bukit Merah Skill Development

Centre,  we  were quite conscious of this.  And  one  of  the

things  was that if you look at the training manuals used  by

the  Bukit Merah Skill Development Centre, all the prints are

extra large, much bigger than you would find in any textbook.

The  reason  is simple, because older workers have difficulty

reading  fine  print.  So we had to have special  instruction

manuals  printed with huge print to make it easier for  older

workers  to read.  We are, in fact, quite conscious of  this.

With  the  establishment of the Lifelong  Learning  Endowment

Fund, we now have resources to even better study the training

methods that will be most suitable for older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third point is that many workers, especially the

older  workers,  fear  making mistakes  during  the  training

courses.   I think it is human nature to fear mistakes.   But

if  we  do  not make the effort to learn, then we will  never

make  any  progress.  And in the course of  trying  to  learn

something  new, from time to time, we are bound to make  some

mistakes.    My   response  would  be  that  employers   must

understand this human nature, and in the way that they manage

their  older  workers  and  in  the  way  they  motivate  and

encourage  their older workers to go for training, they  must

always  be  patient;  they  must always  be  sympathetic  and

understanding, especially when an older worker, in the course

of  training,  were  to make mistakes.  In  fact,  he  learns

through making mistakes.  Because he has made the mistake, he

learns  not to do it again, and he will learn how to  improve

his  performance  at  work.   So  employers  should  be  more

sympathetic  and  understand that  older  workers  have  this

special

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>

need  to  upgrade.   And  in the training  course,  they  may

occasionally make some mistakes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong asked whether the Lifelong Learning

Endowment  Fund would also support knowledge acquisition.   I

made it quite clear in my Second Reading speech that what  we

are  looking for is both knowledge and skills.  The word  may

not have appeared in the text, but I have made it quite clear

that  the  spirit is to help Singaporeans to embark  on  this

lifelong  journey  to  acquire higher  knowledge  and  better

skills,  so  that  we  can  be  more  competitive  and   more

proficient in the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to social and personal needs, I think this

is  a  separate area, whether young Singaporeans grow up into

balanced,  mature  adults and know all their responsibilities

and  obligations  as an adult.  This is a  separate  area  of

education.   This is something that they would have  received

good  preparation during their schooling years.  And, in some

cases,  through  some other kind of social interaction,  they

should acquire such skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund's focus must be on

employability.   We must focus on skills and  knowledge  that

are  relevant  to  the needs of the labour  market.   As  the

economy  transits  into a knowledge-based  economy,  we  must

increasingly focus on the skills and knowledge that can  help

a  worker  hold and do a productive job in such  an  economy.

And I think that should remain our focus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong also asked how the Fund would

cooperate with grassroots organisations such as the CCs,  RCs

and community clubs which want to set up training facilities.

This  is  an  area which we should leave it to  the  advisory

council  to  consider when they deliberate on  the  programme

that  should  be  supported.  There will  certainly  be  some

support,  because  we understand that if you,  for  instance,

want  to  introduce training under the national  IT  literacy

programme,  you,  in fact, have to invest  in  computers  and

softwares.   You have to set up some small computer  training

facilities.  You may need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>

two  or  three dozen computers.  And who is going to  finance

this?   We  will  look into how, under the Lifelong  Learning

Endowment  Fund,  we can jointly support such  projects.   We

could work with the community organisations to establish such

training  centres.  But, of course, somebody  else  mentioned

that  we should avoid duplication.  We should make sure  that

resources are not just wastefully duplicated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I just want to add one point, as I forgot to

respond  to  Mr  Hawazi  about  the  advisory  council.   Our

intention  is  to make the advisory council an  all-embracing

council in terms of composition.  We will bring in the  trade

union  representatives.  We will have  employers  represented

there.  We will also have community organisations represented

there.   We will have industry groups represented there  and,

of course, also Government agencies that are participating in

skills  upgrading  and also steering the  economy.   So,  the

advisory council will represent a very wide cross-section  of

interests and concerns in the labour market and the  type  of

skills that are required by the labour market.  In this  way,

we  can have good feedback, good effective evaluation of  the

programmes  that  should  be  supported  under  the  Lifelong

Learning Endowment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to add another point at this juncture. We

also   welcome  proposals  and  initiatives  from   community

organisations that want to come forward to join  us  in  this

effort  to  reach  out to Singaporeans  in  helping  them  to

upgrade themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that leaves only Mr Chiam who queried why is it

that  only the Minister is responsible for the administration

of  the Fund and not some independent organisation.  This  is

an  Endowment  Fund set up by the Government specifically  to

provide  resources  for  training and  skills  upgrading  for

Singaporeans.   The Ministry of Manpower is  responsible  for

manpower  development.   That is why  the  responsibility  is

placed with the Ministry of Manpower and the Minister is made

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>

responsible for the administration of the Fund.  It does  not

mean  that the Minister himself is going to individually sign

every  cheque or approve every single payment.  The  Minister

will have, of course, under the normal operation, to delegate

the  duties that will set up the administration framework  to

monitor the returns and disbursements of all the money  under

the  Fund.   I  think  this is no different  from  the  other

endowment funds, whether it is Edusave or MediFund, or as  Mr

Lim  Hng  Kiang  mentioned earlier, the  Eldercare  Endowment

Fund.  This is a fairly standard provision.  So I do not  see

why  he  should object to it.  This is actually  Government's

budget surplus.  So the Government has to be responsible  for

it, as a trustee for the members of the public, the people of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants an independent body to administer and disburse

the  Fund.  Why is that necessary?  The Fund, of course, will

be  audited  and  proper  accounts  will  be  provided.   The

Ministry of Finance will be the first to want to know if,  in

fact,  the  Fund  has  not  been properly  administered,  and

somebody  will  be held responsible.  In this case,  if  that

happens, the Minister for Manpower will be held responsible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He expressed his concern that the Fund should only

support activities on merit, because he talked about the Fund

disbursing  payments  to individuals  or  persons.   He  even

objected  to  the word "person".  A person can be  a  worker.

What do you call somebody who is unemployed?  Is he a worker?

How  about  a  housewife  who  wants  to  go  back  into  the

workforce?  Do you call her a worker too?  Sir, I think he is

becoming  too narrow if he says that we should only  use  the

word "worker" and not "person".  The word "person" is a wider

term.  From my perspective, it appropriately covers everybody

who  needs  training  in order to help  him  to  enhance  his

employability.  I am looking at housewives, for instance, who

have  left the job market for 10 years and now want to return

to  work,  but  they need some training and new skills  which

they did not have.  So should we include or exclude them?  By

his definition, if we were to say that the Lifelong Learning

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>

Endowment  Fund has got to be focused on workers,  then  this

group  will not be eligible.  Is that good?  I do  not  think

so.  I think we should extend support to women who want to re-enter  the workforce.  So the choice of the word by the legal

draftsman is quite appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained the advisory council. We

intend to bring in people from the different sectors, so that

we  get  a  very  good and comprehensive feedback,  and  also

objective  evaluation.   The funds are  mostly  going  to  be

disbursed by way of support for specific programmes.  Let  me

assure  all  Members that good ideas will not be  overlooked.

If  Members have any specific ideas about how they and  their

community organisations can play a part in promoting lifelong

learning  and  provide  their constituents  with  more  skill

upgrading opportunities, please put your ideas to us  and  we

will  have  them examined by the Lifelong Learning  Endowment

Fund  advisory council.   And if the idea is sound,  we  will

definitely help you to put these ideas to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think Mr Chiam missed my Second Reading speech,

because he asked about the amount of the capital money.   The

Bill  does  not say anything about the actual  sum,  but  the

Prime  Minister, in his National Day Rally speech last  year,

said   that  the  Fund  will  be  started  with  an   initial

contribution  of  $500 million from the Government,  and  the

objective  is to build it up over the years - of course,  the

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil

List and Pension Act (Chapter 44), resolves that the Schedule

to that Act be varied by deleting the figure "$1,757,700", in

the second column and substituting the figure "$2,232,000".

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that an additional provision of $474,300

be  supported  for the Privy Purse under Class I expenditure.

This  represents  27% over the Privy Purse's budgeted  FY2000

provision of $1,757,700.  The additional provision is to meet

the  increase  in  expenditure due to  the  salary  revisions

announced  in the financial year 2000.  As such,  the  FY2000

revised estimate for the Privy Purse is $2,232,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary to vary the Privy Purse amount

in  the  Schedule  to  the Civil List  and  the  Pension  Act

(Chapter 44), as indicated in the Motion before the House.

<div align="center"><b>BROADBAND USAGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and  Information  Technology  how   Singapore

compares  with  Hong Kong and South Korea  on  the  level  of

broadband  usage and what is his Ministry's plan  to  promote

widespread usage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of broadband users in Singapore has reached

268,000 by the end of Year 2000, an increase of 150% over

1999.  Today, Singapore's broadband user penetration of 6.6%

is comparable to both Hong Kong's and South Korea's. As an

example, South Korea's user penetration is 6.4%.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to promote and facilitate the growth of

broadband applications and services, both wired and wireless,

in  the coming years. To this end, we are putting in place  a

comprehensive,     diverse    and     pervasive     broadband

infrastructure.  One key measure was the  mandating  of  open

access in our ADSL network. This allows more than one service

provider  to use the same copper infrastructure. Open  access

has  attracted  new  broadband ADSL  service  providers  like

StarHub and Pacific Internet to offer broadband services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further open up new channels for broadband access, we

will  be  issuing  Fixed Wireless Broadband and  3G  wireless

licences in 2001. It will give Singaporeans better quality of

services  and  more  competitive prices in  their  choice  of

broadband access.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to providing comprehensive broadband

infrastructure, we also intend to tackle the demand  side  of

broadband   usage.  The  availability  of  more  and   richer

broadband  content will also stimulate demand growth.  It  is

therefore  encouraging that the number of  broadband  content

providers  has increased to about 300, from 200 in  1999.  To

further  stimulate  growth  of  the  broadband  sector,   IDA

recently  announced a $150 million package to  stimulate  the

demand  for  and  supply  of  Internet  Broadband  Multimedia

content  and  services. IDA will continue in its  efforts  to

develop  our  local  players and work  with  foreign  content

providers  to provide useful and media-rich content  to  meet

the  growing  demand for broadband content here in  Singapore

and the region.

<div align="center"><b>AMBULANCE ACCIDENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

(a)  how many ambulances were involved in accidents over  the

last  3  years; (b) what were the causes of these  accidents;

(c)  of  these, how many persons were injured or killed;  and

(d)  what  measures  can be taken to improve  the  safety  of

passengers in ambulances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) of the Singapore

Civil   Defence  Force  (SCDF)  responded  to  about  190,000

ambulance  calls over the past 3 years.  During this  period,

SCDF  ambulances were involved in 11 road traffic  accidents.

This works out to about 0.58 accidents per 10,000 calls.  All

the accidents were investigated by the Traffic Police (TP).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police is currently investigating the cause

of  the latest accident between an ambulance and an SBS  bus.

The  causes  of the remaining 10 accidents, 5 of  which  were

attributable   to  the  ambulance  driver,  were   overtaking

dangerously,  failing to give way or keep a  proper  lookout,

changing  lanes without due consideration to road  conditions

or traffic, and tail-gating.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than 2 deaths arising from the latest incident,

which TP is still investigating, there were no deaths in  the

remaining  10  accidents. In these 10 accidents,  17  persons

suffered minor injuries, 8 of whom were SCDF personnel and  9

were  civilians,  and  3  persons,  all  of  whom  were  SCDF

personnel, suffered major injuries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that measures are in place to

ensure  the  safety  of persons conveyed and  ambulance  crew

alike.  Indeed, their safety is paramount.  Ambulance drivers

are  required  to  adhere  to all  traffic  rules,  including

observing speed limits, while responding to calls.  Even when

conveying  persons  in  urgent need of  treatment,  ambulance

drivers  are required to ensure that all other vehicles  have

stopped and given way, and it is safe if they have to beat  a

red  light.  Warning lights and sirens must also be  switched

on to alert other road users to give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All patients are securely strapped to a stretcher, which

in  turn is held in place by a locking mechanism bolted  onto

the  floor of the ambulance. Only 1 accompanying relative  of

the  patient  is allowed in the ambulance and he  or  she  is

required to use the seat belt in the ambulance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ambulance drivers have to attend an Emergency

Vehicle and Defensive Driving Course, where they learn how to

handle the vehicles under adverse road conditions.  They  are

also  taught the safety aspects of high speed driving,  which

they  have  to  master  before  they  are  allowed  to  drive

ambulances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCDF ambulances meet all the safety regulations

stipulated  by  the  Land  Transport  Authority  (LTA).    In

addition,  they  also  conform to  the  International  Safety

Standards  adopted  by leading overseas ambulance  operators.

These  standards  require,  amongst  other  things,  a   body

structure of the ambulance that can resist sudden impact, and

features to safely secure medical and other equipment  within

the  ambulance cabin, in case of a collision.  SCDF  Standing

Operating Procedures require ambulance drivers to check daily

that  the  ambulances assigned to them are  in  good  working

condition.

<div align="center"><b>HUMAN SMUGGLING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs  what  is  the number of  cases  involving  the

smuggling  of  persons into Singapore and what  actions  have

been  taken  at  the entry points to counter the  problem  of

human smuggling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More cases involving the smuggling of illegal immigrants*

were detected last year compared to 1999.

<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>



*   Traffickers attempted to smuggle illegal immigrants  into

Singapore  by land via concealing them in car boots,  tankers

or  in  special  compartments of travel coaches  and  factory

buses (bus kilang) as well as by sea via speedboats.

<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the land checkpoints, 40 traffickers were arrested

last year, as compared to 27 traffickers arrested in 1999, an

increase  of 48%.  However, the number of illegal  immigrants

detected  being  smuggled  into Singapore  through  the  land

checkpoints decreased from 197 in 1999 to 81 in 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no traffickers arrested at our ferry

terminals.   Out  at sea, 16 Tekongs or boat  operators  were

arrested.  This was a 100% increase over 1999, where  8  boat

operators  were  arrested.  The number of illegal  immigrants

caught  being  smuggled into Singapore by sea increased  from

153 in 1999 to 200 in 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team has adopted, and will continue to adopt

stringent checks at our air, land and sea border entry points

to detect the smuggling of illegal immigrants into Singapore.

Specifically, the following actions have been  taken  at  the

entry points to counter the problem of human smuggling:





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i More Intensive Checks

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expanded facilities at the new Woodlands Checkpoint

have  enabled  immigration officers to conduct more  thorough

checks  on  persons and vehicles to deter illegal  entry  and

departure  through  the land checkpoints,  without  adversely

affecting traffic flow.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii Enhanced Intelligence Capability



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensified Police and SIR intelligence gathering has

resulted  in  the  higher  number of arrests  of  traffickers

operating across the land checkpoints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii Sea and Coastal Enforcement



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Coast Guard (PCG) has stepped up both sea and

shore  patrols to detect smugglers who attempt to smuggle  in

illegal  immigrants by sea.  PCG has acquired new  high-speed

patrol boats with better manoeuvrability and fitted with  the

latest surveillance and digital communications equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv Technology



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will employ new technology to detect such attempts at

smuggling illegal immigrants.  Specifically, SIR is acquiring

mobile x-ray machines to detect illegal immigrants hiding  in

vehicles.   PCG  has already deployed state-of-the-art  radar

surveillance  systems and electro-optic cameras at  strategic

locations to detect illegal landings at night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v Deterrent Messages



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to rigorous enforcement, we have also

constantly  sent  out  deterrent  messages  through  targeted

public education.  For example, SIR distributes pamphlets  in

4   languages   to   foreigners  coming  through   our   land

checkpoints.   These pamphlets highlight the stiff  penalties

for trafficking illegal immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team's multi-pronged approach and coordinated

enforcement  action  has yielded good  results  so  far.   My

Ministry  will  continue  to take concerted  action  to  stop

immigration offenders and traffickers.  If necessary, we will

review  the  penalties for traffickers.  With the support  of

the  community, we will keep the immigration offender problem

under control.

<div align="center"><b>HARBOURING OF ILLEGAL WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for

Home Affairs how many persons suspected of harbouring illegal

workers  have been (i) arrested and charged; (ii)  prosecuted

or   are   awaiting  prosecution;  and  (iii)  acquitted   or

convicted, since the recent campaign to warn flat  owners  of

the  need to check on the credentials of foreign persons  who

approach them for accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the increased publicity in April/May last year to

advise  homeowners on the need to check the status  of  their

tenants,  there was an increase in the number of persons  who

were arrested for harbouring immigration offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period January to March 2000, on average, about

41 persons per month were arrested for harbouring immigration

offenders.    From  April  to  December  2000,  this   number

increased to about 52 (about 27% increase).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly average number of immigration offenders

arrested  increased  from about 1210 to 1430,  for  the  same

corresponding periods (about 18% increase).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the enhanced publicity, coupled with increased

enforcement  efforts by Police and SIR, the increase  in  the

numbers  of immigration offenders and harbourers arrested  is

not surprising.  Notably, the public has also contributed  to

the   enforcement  efforts.   More  have  come  forward  with

information   relating  to  suspected  cases  of   harbouring

immigration offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorities have been meticulous in examining the

circumstances  and  facts  of each case  before  deciding  to

charge the harbourer or employer in court.  Last year,  about

42%  of  those arrested for harbouring immigration  offenders

were  not charged in court.  For those who were charged, more

than 80% of them were convicted.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC SECTOR DOCTORS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health (a) how

many  public sector doctors have been allowed to practise  in

the  private sector;  (b) what will be the number of  doctors

allowed to practise in the private sector each year;  and (c)

how  does  his  Ministry ensure that the care  of  subsidized

patients will not be compromised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, our current health care system maintains a

clear  demarcation between public and private sector  medical

practices.  There is scope for greater public-private  sector

collaboration  to  improve the quality and  accessibility  of

care for both subsidised and private patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has given public sector hospitals the

flexibility to allow their doctors to practise in the private

sector  for  part of their time. This is aimed  at  retaining

doctors  who would otherwise opt to leave completely for  the

private sector. They will then continue to contribute to  the

care   of   subsidised  patients  as  well  as  to  teaching.

Subsidised  patients  benefit from  the  retention  of  their

skills and expertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public sector hospitals already have a Visiting

Consultants Scheme where private sector specialists appointed

as  visiting  consultants can see patients in  public  sector

hospitals. There is scope for the public sector hospitals  to

interest  more  private sector doctors to take  up  part-time

work  in  the  public sector.  These doctors could  be  given

remuneration  and terms tailored to the amount  of  time  and

effort they commit to patient care, teaching and research  in

the  public  sector hospitals.  In this way,  we  can  foster

greater  public-private sector collaboration in administering

patient care and this will benefit Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has left it to the two clusters to decide

whether  they wish to implement the private practice  scheme,

and they are considering it. If implemented, they can set the

terms  to best suit their requirements, including the  number

of  doctors  to be allowed on the scheme. They will  have  to

assure my Ministry that the needs of subsidised patients  are

met.  My  Ministry will be monitoring them in  various  ways,

including time set aside by these doctors for subsidised care

and  teaching, clinical performance measures and non-clinical

indicators  such  as waiting times to ensure  that  care  for

subsidised patients is not compromised.

<br><br><i>Resignations</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resignation rate of Chinese Language teachers ranged

to  the overall resignation rate of between 2% and 3% in  the

<br><br><i>Retirements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please refer to Table 2. Annual retirement figures for

Chinese  Language teachers ranged from 158 to  235  over  the

last  5  years.   In the first 10 months of  this  year,  163

Chinese  teachers retired.  Due to the age profile of Chinese

Language  teachers  in  primary schools,  the  percentage  of

retirement among Chinese Language teachers in primary schools

is  higher  than the corresponding percentage  for  secondary

schools and Junior Colleges/Centralised Institutes.



<br><br><i>Foreign Recruitment</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please refer to Table 3. We are tapping on overseas

<div align="center"><b>"CASH-BACK" SYSTEM</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  he  is  prepared to allow a  "cash-back"  system  to

operate  in  Singapore whereby customers in supermarkets  can

withdraw  cash from the check-out counters, as like  that  in

the UK.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash withdrawals at point of sale, or "cash-back"

schemes,  are  readily  available in supermarkets  and  other

retail  stores  in  the  UK,  US  and  Australia.  These  are

commercial   arrangements  between   banks   and   retailers.

Retailers who receive large amounts of cash benefit, as "cash-back"  allows  them  to  reduce their cash  handling.   Banks

benefit  as this means fewer cash withdrawal transactions  at

ATMs,  a service which is costly to provide.  Consumers  will

also  gain from the convenience and choice of accessing cash-withdrawal  services at these new cash-points, especially  in

locations further away from any bank branches or ATMs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has decided that it has no regulatory objections to

"cash-back"  schemes.  Banks  and  retailers  are   free   to

implement  "cash-back" schemes using their  Electronic  Funds

Transfer at Point of Sales (EFTPOS) and Cash-card systems. It

is  up  to  the banks and retailers to institute  operational

procedures,   security   measures,   and   appropriate   cash

withdrawal limits.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that retailers like NTUC Fairprice, petrol

stations and convenience stores will take this opportunity to

provide  better  service to their customers,  and  make  cash

withdrawal  facilities more widely available.  This  will  be

especially helpful to lower-income Singaporeans whose monthly

salaries  are  credited to their bank accounts by  employers,

and  whose  main need is to make regular cash withdrawals  in

small amounts for their daily expenses.

<div align="center"><b>BUDGET DEFICIT FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2001</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance if

his Ministry can provide for a budget deficit for FY 2001  in

order   to   stimulate  domestic  demand,  given   the   many

indications  of  a slowdown in the US economy  and  political

uncertainty  in  the region which will adversely  affect  the

Singapore economy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy is expected to grow at 5 to 7% in 2001, well

below  the  exceptional growth rate of 10.1%  in  2000.  This

forecast takes into account a slowdown in the US economy  and

continued uncertainties in the region. Adequate funds  should

therefore be available to finance all desirable expenditures,

and a sharing of some budget surpluses may even be possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if a hard landing of the US economy triggers

off   a   worldwide  recession  affecting  the  region,   the

Government has ample resources to support any downturn in our

economy, as we did in the 1997/1998 recession.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE'S ECONOMIC TRENDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry,  with reference to the recent US Embassy report  on

Singapore's  economic  trends  and  outlook  for  the   third

quarter,  (a) how does Singapore compare with other countries

in  the  area  of  new company formation; (b)  what  are  the

indicators  to  assess  whether  our  progress  to  become  a

knowledge-based  economy is on track;  and  (c)  whether  the

measures  which the Government has adopted so far to  promote

risk-taking  ventures are effective in achieving the  desired

outcomes.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of new companies formed has been rising since

the  Asian  crisis.  2,800 new companies were formed  in  the

third  quarter  last year compared with 1,600  in  the  third

quarter of 1998.  New companies formed in 1999 accounted  for

7%  of  the  total  number of companies in  Singapore.   This

compares well with the 7% in Hong Kong, and 5% in both Taiwan

and  Malaysia.   (There are no data on new company  formation

available for other countries like the US and Japan).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many indicators to track our progress towards

becoming  a  knowledge-based  economy  (KBE).  These  include

quality of our work-force, expenditure on R&D, foreign direct

investment  inflows, number of patents, and  usage  of  info-communications and technology (ICT) like internet and  mobile

phone  penetration.  While we have improved in many of  these

indicators,  the  transformation to  a  KBE  is  a  long-term

process that requires sustained effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote risk-taking ventures, the Government launched

several  initiatives  to create a more conducive  environment

for  technopreneurship development since 1999.  These include

new  incentives  to  encourage venture investments,  employee

stock  options  for technology start-ups, relaxation  of  our

bankruptcy regime, attraction of foreign talents, and the US$

1 billion Technopreneurship Investment Fund.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These initiatives have borne initial fruits. A NSTB

survey   showed  that  the  number  of  new  technopreneurial

companies formed has increased significantly, from under  100

companies  in 1996 to more than 500 in 1999.  There  are  now

more  venture  capitalists (VC) and VC  money  in  Singapore.

Some 26 top-performing VC firms have set up in Singapore.   A

total of $1.4 billion was raised by VCs in Singapore in 1999,

a 16% increase from 1998.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too early to gauge how well we have progressed.

Many  high-tech startups have been affected by the plunge  in

tech stock prices.  This should not set us back as those with

strong technology and sound business models will continue  to

thrive.  They will become an important part of our economy in

the future.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR INDONESIA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. <b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs  (a)  whether the Singapore  Government  has

received  new  requests  for financial  assistance  from  the

Indonesian   Government;  and  (b)  whether  Singapore   will

consider providing other financial assistance because of  the

increasingly  difficult political and economic  situation  in

Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first part of the question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will recall that we offered Indonesia a S$1.2

billion  economic  assistance package  during  PM's  trip  to

Jakarta in January 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, given the low take-up rate of the package, the

Indonesians have expressed an interest to explore other means

of  implementing the package, in particular the S$400 million

Loan Financing Scheme*.



<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>

*  The  economic  package  comprised  a  S$400  million  Loan

Financing  Scheme for Singapore investments in  Indonesia;  a

US$500 million Singapore Co-Investment Fund for Indonesia;  a

S$2  million  Tourism  Cooperation Package;  and  cooperation

projects in the Riaus.

<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, Singapore reiterated that the objective of

the Loan Financing Scheme is to encourage Singapore companies

to  look  for commercially viable opportunities in Indonesia.

Loans  are  provided  to  Singapore companies  interested  to

invest   in   Indonesia  through  Singapore-based   financial

institutions.  That said, we are prepared to  work  with  the

relevant agencies in Indonesia to "match make" Indonesian and

Singapore  investors and SMEs. The idea is for the Indonesian

Government  to  inform  us  of the sectors  where  there  are

possible  investment  opportunities and  forward  a  list  of

potential   Indonesian  partners.  We  can  then   facilitate

matching  these Indonesian companies and interested Singapore

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part of the question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S$1.2 billion economic assistance package will

continue  to be made available to Indonesia. The  package  is

intrinsically  sound,  and there  have  been  some  cases  of

success.   In   March  2000,  the  Government  of   Singapore

Investment   Corporation  participated  in  an  international

consortium,  led  by  Cycle  and  Carriage  (Singapore),   by

investing US$76 million in Astra.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All foreign investors, however, make decisions based on

commercial considerations. Feedback from Singapore  companies

and  financial institutions indicate that the general take-up

rate  of the package is unlikely to improve until and  unless

the  domestic  political and economic situation in  Indonesia

stabilises  and investor confidence returns.  Moreover,  with

countries  in Northeast Asia adopting aggressive policies  to

attract  investments, investors will naturally  gravitate  to

them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the economic package, we will continue to

build  on our economic cooperation with Indonesia for  mutual

benefit.  In January 1999, the West Natuna Gas Agreement  was

concluded  between  Singapore's Sembawang  Gas  Pte  Ltd  and

Indonesia's  state-oil  company,  Pertamina.  This  deal   is

expected  to generate earnings of US$8 billion over 22  years

and create employment for many Indonesians.

<div align="center"><b>CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY MANPOWER</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Manpower (a)

what  is  the manpower projection (by professions and trades)

for the construction industry over the next 5 years; (b) what

are  the  plans or measures taken to upgrade the construction

workforce  in  Singapore;  and (c)  can  construction  skills

training courses be conducted in all ITE institutions instead

of  in  only  one training centre, the Construction  Industry

Training Institute (CITI), presently.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br><i>Manpower Projection of the Construction Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry has shown signs of improvement

since the economic crisis.  The third quarter Economic Survey

of 2000 indicated that the sector has contracted by only 1.3%

as  compared  to a decline of 14.2% in the third  quarter  of

1999.   Despite the improved performance of the  construction

industry  over the recent quarters, the construction industry

is  still  sluggish. As a result, the employment in the  near

future  is unlikely to grow.  In fact, overall employment  is

projected  to  decline in absolute numbers over  the  next  5

years.  This is partly due to efforts to reduce the number of

foreign  workers  in  the  construction  industry.   The  C21

blueprint had recommended reduction of the man-year

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>

entitlement (MYE) to 70% of the level in 1999 by 2005 and  to

50%  in  2010, or earlier if practicable.  Based  on  a  more

cautious  economic outlook for the sector, and  the  move  to

reduce  MYE to raise productivity, the overall employment  in

the construction sector is likely to continue to decline over

the  next  5  years.  The decline in overall employment  will

mainly  affect the low skilled workers (eg general  workers),

most of whom are foreign workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the decline in overall employment for the

construction sector, some jobs will still be in demand in the

construction industry.  Manpower demand is projected to  grow

for   those   with   degree,   diploma   and   post-secondary

qualifications.  In terms of manpower demand by  occupations,

professionals, associated professionals and skilled craftsmen

will  emerge  as  the  fastest  growing  occupations  in  the

construction  industry.  Specifically,  at  the  professional

level,  the  jobs  in  demand include  project  managers  and

engineers;  for  the associate professionals,  these  include

foremen,  site supervisors and project coordinators;  as  for

the  skilled craftsmen, these include bricklayers, plasterers

and carpenters.



<br><br><i>Efforts to Upgrade the Construction Workforce</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Construction 21 Blueprint also recognises the need

to  upgrade the skills level of the construction workforce in

Singapore.  It has recommended a number of measures to  raise

the  professionalism in the industry and upgrade  the  skills

level of construction workforce.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to raising professionalism, institutions of

higher learning will be introducing new modules and enhancing

the  tertiary curriculum for construction-related  fields  to

develop  multi-disciplinary skills and strengthen cooperation

between    professionals.    Professional    bodies,    trade

associations and the Construction Industry Training Institute

(CITI) have continuing professional and technical development

programmes  including harnessing Information Technology;  the

design-and-build concepts; and buildable designs.   C21  also

recommended   making   Continuing  Professional   Development

Programmes  mandatory  for the renewal  of  professional  and

trade  membership.  The  Board  of  Architects,  Professional

Engineers Board and the Construction Industry Joint Committee

(CIJC) are taking steps to implement continuing education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To upgrade the skills of construction workers, BCA works

closely  with the industry to train construction workers  and

reviews  training curriculum regularly to respond to industry

needs.  Since  1999,  BCA has also progressively  raised  the

skill requirements for foreign construction workers who  come

to work in Singapore.  Early last year, it included the trade-related  knowledge requirement for skilled  workers.  Arising

from  these measures, the new construction workers that  come

to  Singapore  to  work are generally of  higher  skills  and

better  educated. There is also a proposal for multi-skilling

requirements  for  the construction workers.   MOM  has  also

introduced   the   100%   Basic  Skills   Certificate   (BSC)

requirement  for  construction workers  from  non-traditional

sources.   As  a  result of such efforts, the  proportion  of

foreign construction workers certified at SEC level is 65% as

at November 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also put in place incentives to

upgrade the skills of local workers. Local workers pay  lower

test fees at CITI for most of the main trades.  Employers can

also  enjoy  subsidies from the Skills  Development  Fund  of

between 50% and 80% on the fees of many courses in CITI, such

as  courses in "Safety Construction Supervision" and  "Mobile

Crane Operations".



<br><br><i>Conduct of Construction Skills Training Courses</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, construction-related training was carried

out  by  the former VITB, which has been transformed  to  the

present ITE. In 1984, it was decided that a separate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>

construction training institution be set up under the  former

CIDB  so that a wide range of training and testing programmes

can  be  provided  to  meet  the needs  of  the  construction

industry at one single location.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Agency responsible for the construction industry,

BCA  has the primary responsibility of training and upgrading

the  skills  of  construction  workforce  in  Singapore.  The

Construction Industry Training Institute (CITI), the training

arm  of BCA, has been responding to the training needs of the

construction industry.  However, BCA recognises that it alone

could  not provide all the training needs of the construction

industry. Hence, training is also carried out by the industry

through  the Testing Centres in Singapore authorised  by  BCA

and   other  training  institutions.  The  polytechnics  also

provide  training for the construction supervisors  and  sub-professionals. For foreign workers, most of them are  trained

at  the  source  countries before  they  are  tested  at  the

Overseas Testing Centres. Although construction training  and

skills  upgrading  is a primary responsibility  of  BCA,  BCA

supports ITE conducting construction skills training  courses

if ITE should decide to resume this activity again.

<div align="center"><b>NEW/RESALE FLATS SOLD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (a) how many new flats (breakdown by  flat  type)

were  sold  over  the  last  3 years;  (b)  how  many  resale

transactions (breakdown by flat type) were processed over the

3 years; and (c) what are the pro-family policies or measures

taken by the Ministry to encourage Singaporeans to stay  near

their relatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The number of new flats sold in the last 3

years  in FY97, FY98 and FY99 were 33,300, 34,700 and  28,700

respectively. The breakdown by flat type is as follows:

<pre>

  Year     2-Room   3-Room   4-Room   5-Room   Exec/MG   Total



 FY 1997    200     1,500    14,500   12,900    4,200    33,300

 FY 1998    200     1,500    15,200   14,400    3,400    34,700

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The number of resale transactions processed and

completed  in  FY97,  FY98 and FY99 were 37,300,  60,500  and

57,700 respectively.  The main reason for the surge in resale

transactions completed in FY98 and FY99 was due to the  lower

resale  prices which had fallen as a result of  the  economic

downturn.  The breakdown by flat type is as follows:

<pre>

  Year     1&2-Room  3-Room  4-Room  5-Room  Exec/MG   Total



 FY 1997        600   13,100  14,400   6,400   2,800  37,300

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Besides providing affordable homes for

Singaporeans,  HDB's  public housing programme  supports  the

Government's   social  policy  to  encourage  extended-family

households to live together or close to each other for mutual

care  and  support.  This is achieved through  the  following

housing policies/schemes :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) Flexibility on Income Ceiling Assessment

Policy, which facilitates a married child and his parents  to

live  together  in one HDB flat by setting a  higher  monthly

income ceiling at $12,000 for the extended family as compared

to $8,000 for a nuclear family;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) Multi-Tier Family Housing Scheme, which

accords  priority allocation to a multi-generation  household

to buy an HDB flat;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) Joint Selection Scheme, which gives the

families  the option to select flats on priority so that  the

married child and his parents can stay in separate flats  but

near  to each other, either within the same housing block  or

estate;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv) CPF Housing Grant Scheme, which provides a

higher family grant of $40,000 for eligible applicants buying

a  resale flat near their parents, as compared to the $30,000

grant for other families;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v) Conversion Scheme, which allows the lessee of an

existing  3-room or smaller flat to buy over another  similar

adjoining flat from the neighbouring lessee for conversion to

a  bigger  unit  so that more space is made available  for  a

growing or an extended family;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi) Mutual Exchange of Flat Scheme, which enables

the  parents or a married child currently living in different

estates to live near to each other in the same estate through

mutual exchange of flats with the other lessees; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vii) Studio Apartments for the Elderly Scheme,

which accords priority allocation to eligible elderly lessees

of  HDB flats to buy a custom-built studio apartment, if they

have  children living in the same electoral division or Group

Representation Constituency.

to  locate  petrol  kiosks near residential  flats;  and  (d)

whether his Ministry will consider co-locating petrol  kiosks

along expressways.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What  are  the considerations for allocating  land  for petrol stations?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planning of the required number and siting of petrol

stations  is  carried out at the local area  level  when  the

Development  Guide  Plan  (DGP) for  each  Planning  Area  is

prepared.  The planning considerations include ensuring  that

there  are sufficient petrol station sites to meet the demand

from motorists within that Planning Area. The actual location

of  each  new petrol station site has to be studied carefully

with  the  relevant agencies like FSB and LTA.  For instance,

sites  chosen for such use should not cause traffic  problems

in  the  area  and  hence, it should not be  sited  at  major

traffic junctions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, petrol station sites are confined mainly to

areas  which are zoned Transport Facility in the Master Plan.

MND/URA will be working with MTI to study the feasibility  of

allowing more petrol pump facilities on suitable sites  which

meet fire safety and environmental requirements.

<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What  are  the tender prices for land of petrol  kiosks from 1991 to 2000?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has released for sale 19 land parcels for petrol

kiosks  development since 1991. The successful tender  prices

were  between  $6,524 psm and $19,045 psm, depending  on  the

year  of  sale, the location, size and configuration  of  the

site  [see Appendix A (Cols 1401-1404)].  In 1999, two  sites

were  offered  for  sale but the response was  poor  and  the

tender prices were well below the market value as assessed by

the Chief Valuer.  Hence no award was made.

<br><br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Whether  it  is  safe to co-locate petrol  kiosks  near residential flats?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petrol stations are allowed to be developed near

residential   flats  provided  they  satisfy  the   necessary

technical and safety requirements of the Fire Safety Bureau.



<br><br>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Whether  MND  will consider co-locating  petrol  kiosks along expressways?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any co-location of petrol kiosks along expressways has

to  be  done in consultation with LTA. Petrol kiosks  can  be

located  along expressways if the siting does not  compromise

the efficient operation of the expressways and the safety  of

the  public.   Hence,  they are commonly  found  along  rural

expressways in other countries. The expressways in  Singapore

are  actually  urban  expressways  with  close  intervals  of

traffic  interchanges, and they carry a very high  volume  of

fast moving traffic.  The siting of a petrol kiosk along  our

expressways is likely to create traffic weaving problems  and

hence,  compromise the safe and efficient  operation  of  our

expressway   system.   Therefore,  this  is  not  encouraged.

Moreover,  there  is already sufficient provision  of  kiosks

along major arterial roads to meet the need of our motorists.

<div align="center"><b>LOCAL FIRMS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a) what are the key initiatives implemented  to

nurture local firms in the construction industry to be world-class  companies; (b) what are the benchmarks to monitor  the

progress  of  these firms; and (c) whether there are  further

plans  to strengthen the capabilities of local firms  in  the

construction industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an open economy where both local and

foreign  contractors  compete for our construction  projects.

This is also in accordance with our WTO obligations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of large foreign firms has provided the

competitive pressure for local firms to upgrade and level  up

over  the years. Many of the firms which were once family-run

are  now  managed by professionally trained personnel.   Many

are also listed on the stock exchange.  In terms of the types

of  work,  our local firms are gaining expertise  which  were

previously  the  domain of the foreign  contractors.  Several

local  firms  can  now build with precast components  and  be

competitive   and  innovative  in  winning   projects   using

buildable design and method of construction. The local  civil

engineering  contractors are also winning contracts  for  the

construction of vehicular fly-overs and bridges. In the  area

of  exports,  Singapore construction firms secured  over  S$1

billion  worth  of contracts each year in the region,  except

during the years of the Asian economic crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Singapore's small size of the construction

industry,  we  have  to  be realistic about  nurturing  local

construction firms to be world-class companies.   While  most

would  probably not be able to achieve world class  standard,

they  can still attain high standards of project delivery and

able to compete for projects in the region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) had

implemented  several initiatives to upgrade the  construction

industry.  Generally, our local firms had responded  well  to

the initiatives. These include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Raising the work quality of the industry through

the  Construction  Quality Assessment  Scheme  (CONQUAS)  and

incentives such as the Bonus Scheme for Construction Quality.

All  BCA registered G6 to G8 contractors must also attain ISO

9000 certification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Raising the productivity levels of the industry

through  implementing buildable designs and promoting Design-and-Build arrangements for greater efficiency and integration

of the designer and builder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Upgrading technology and Research and Development.

A  $10  million  fund  managed by BCA has  been  obtained  to

finance   R&D   of  innovative  construction   products   and

processes.  A $10 million Industry Productivity fund has also

been  made  available  to  raise the general  capability  and

productivity  of  the construction industry. Other  incentive

schemes  to  help firms in capability building and technology

upgrading include the Investment Allowance Scheme, Innovation

Development Scheme and Local Enterprise Technical  Assistance

Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Giving recognition to firms which had demonstrated

leadership, innovation and sustained efforts in adopting best

practices  through  the BCA Construction  Excellence  Awards,

Best Buildable Design Awards and the new Construction 21 Best

Practice  Awards.   This has provided  a  channel  for  local

construction professionals and firms to showcase  their  work

and benchmark themselves against foreign contractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BCA is currently working very closely with all players

in  the industry to implement the various recommendations  of

the  Construction 21 study to propel and upgrade the industry

to  one that is professional, progressive and productive.  In

addition,  as  size and financial strength are  necessary  to

enable  construction firms to take on large projects, BCA  is

looking  into the following areas which can help local  firms

to build size:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Revamping the BCA Registry of Contractors by

raising   the  registration  criteria  for  the  contractors.

Contractors  will  have  to  meet  more  stringent  turnover,

financial  strength, track records and professional  manpower

requirement   criteria  to  be  registered  at  the   various

financial grades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Encouraging local large firms to merge or to

acquire  to grow even larger.  A joint study by BCA and  SCAL

is being planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Facilitating those local contractors who are ready

to venture abroad to develop their second wing.
