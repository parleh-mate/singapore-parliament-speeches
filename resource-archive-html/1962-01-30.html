<div align="center"><b>FEDERATION OF MALAYSIA</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question, as amended,

was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, in pursuance of the national objective of a

united Malayan nation, enlarged and strengthened  by

the   addition  of  our  brothers  in   the   Borneo

territories,  this  House declares  its  support  in

principle  for  the  plan  proposed  by  the   Prime

Minister  of  the Federation of Malaya, Tunku  Abdul

Rahman  Putra Al-Haj, and agreed to in principle  in

the Federation Parliament on 18th October, 1961, for

the  establishment  of the Federation  of  Malaysia,

comprising   the  eleven  States  of   the   present

Federation, the States of Singapore and Brunei,  and

the territories of Sarawak and North Borneo.".



<br><br>Since which amendments have been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 4, to leave out "plan" and insert

"motion";



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 6, to leave out "in principle".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the word `plan' proposed to

be  left  out, be left out." The debate will proceed

on  both  amendments and the original  Question,  as

amended.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at

the  moment of interruption yesterday, I was tracing

the  political background that led to the  split  in

the  P.A.P. and  subsequently  to  the  concept  of

Malaysia in Singapore. I was interrupted when I  was

saying  that  Malaysia is now peddled about  by  the

P.A.P. as  a  panacea to cure all the ills  of  the

people. We saw the Prime Minister running from Kuala

Lumpur  to  Sarawak selling the idea to the  people,

including  Bangkok, Saigon and other various  places - [Interruption]. I beg your pardon, Bangkok.  I  was

interrupted  by  the  Prime  Minister   who   sought

information as to whether I was suggesting  that  he

was  selling  the idea in Bangkok, and my  reply  to

him,   Sir,  I  thought,  was  not  caught  by   the

microphone. So I might repeat it. I told him  if  he

felt  the cap fitted, he could put it on. I have  no

objections.  But, Sir, when it came to a  conference

of  genuine  socialists in Kua1a Lumpur,  the  Prime

Minister never showed up -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Genuine Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> We have all seen how

disgracefully  the P.A.P. conducted itself  and  how

subsequently it was expelled.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Yes. Barisan manners.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The P.A.P. had great hopes in

Malaysia, for not only would it be expected to  help

the  P.A.P. to cure all its political ills, but also

if  and  when it should come to fruition, the P.A.P.

cou1d hope to drop its political socialist mask once

and for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the third phase of my argument, I

find that there is very little left for me to say -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Thank goodness!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - except to remark that my

colleagues have almost fully covered the ground. The

P.A.P.'s line is that the Communists reject Malaysia

and   therefore   all   who  reject   Malaysia   are

Communists -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Suffice it for me to mention,

Sir,  that  the connivance of the Straits  Times  in

playing  up  the P.K.I. resolution on the  day  this

motion  was  moved  in  this  House  was  sufficient

evidence  of  a reactionary ganging-up and  for  the

purposes of smearing the Barisan Sosialis -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> You mean the

P.K.I. ganging up with the reactionary forces?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The Straits Times and the

reactionary  forces have been ganging  up  with  the P.A.P. -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Are

you suggesting Alex Josey?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> You live with him any way.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have heard of P. A.P. traps

and  so  on  and so forth. It seems to me  that  the

P.A.P. are setting a trap into which the Member  for

Nee   Soon  is  falling.  He  should  ignore   these

pleasantries - I  suppose they are still  pleasantries

up to this stage - and address the Chair if he can.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, with great respect, I

think those who set traps might very well themselves

fall  into  counter-traps. That is why I thought  if

anybody  tried  to trap me, I might  have  a  go  at

trying to trap them. To say that people who live  in

the  same house do not gang up is a little bit  far-fetched.  Anyway, I have personally known  both  Mr

Alex  Josey and the Minister for Culture quite well.

I   understand  how  they  feel  about  each  other,

particularly when Mr Alex Josey is here today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of information -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated that

any  Member  speaking from the Floor of  this  House

must not make any direct reference to any person  in

the  Strangers' Gallery. The Member for Nee Soon has

been  guilty  of  ignoring that direction  from  the

Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> My apologies, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Do I understand the Member

therefore  to condemn Mr Josey, Mr Rajaratnam  and

Comrade  Aidit for being in a conspiracy to  do  the

Barisan Sosialis harm?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is so far-fetched a possibility that I will not waste the time

of  this  House arguing about it. But if  the  Prime

Minister  would  like to hear  more  of  it,  he  is

invited  to  attend our mass rally  tonight  and  we

shall let him hear more about it. In the meantime, I

do  not  think  it is fair to burden you  with  this

political battle between us and the P.A.P. The right

place would be at a mass rally where the people  who

are  to  judge us would be listening to us directly,

and  we extend a very heartfelt and warm welcome  to

the  Prime Minister to attend, if for any reason  at

all to get back his anti-colonial fervour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malayan Socialist Conference has ended

during  the  weekend. We have seen  how  the  P.A.P.

behaved  to  fellow  socialists in  Malaya  and  the

Borneo  territories. I need only read the resolution

passed  unanimously to show that they  are  no  more

socialists,  as  the Member for Cairnhill  has  just

murmured. The resolution unanimously passed  by  the

conference  reads as follows. Sir, I am reading  the

Straits Times of Monday, 29th January, 1962 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Colonial paper.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Quite so, quite so!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Then why do you read from it?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... "This conference regards that the P.A.P. had

staged  a  walk-out and issued slanderous statements

about the conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are convinced that they (the P.A.P. delegates)

have  come here to dominate the conference,  failing

which  they  tried  to wreck it. They  are  no  more

Socialists [today] and are hereby expelled."' -



<br><br>[Laughter]  it  is  not very  funny.  If  the  Prime

Minister  thinks it is very funny, perhaps he  might

like to ask the people who will ultimately judge him

to see whether it is so funny. When the Deputy Prime

Minister had the Floor yesterday, he was kind enough

to  read  out  one  of  the resolutions  passed  and

neglected all the rest. For purposes of the  record,

Sir -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Read the whole of it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - it is my privilege here to

read  only the resolutions mentioned in the  Straits

Times,  and  I shall not bother with the  background

that led to the P.A.P.'s expulsion -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the extracts are to

illustrate what the hon. Member is saying,  then  it

is  all  right. But if it is just for  the  sake  of

reading  extracts,  I think the easiest  way  is  to

table  that paper and Members will be able  to  read

the extracts.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, because

there   is   a   direct  relationship  between   the

resolutions and the motion that is before the  House

today,  I  think it is very relevant that  I  should

read it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member does not know Standing

Order 48 (d). It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`During a sitting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Members shall not read newspapers, hooks,

letters  or  other  documents  except  such  matters

therein  as  may  be  directly  connected  with  the

business under debate.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 44 permits the reading of extracts

in  support of a Member's argument, that is to  say,

the arguments as put forward by the Member speaking;

otherwise we will have the position where  a  Member

can just get up and read a newspaper and say that is

his speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With great respect, Sir, I

think  that position can never obtain in this  House

in  so  far  as  you, Sir, who are  so  vigilant  in parliamentary matters, are in the Chair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now read only the relevant parts which are

related  to  this motion. Amongst other things,  the

conference also passed resolutions which:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`CONDEMNED the three previous Consultative

Solidarity  Committee  meetings  on  the   Malaysian

proposals on the ground that the delegates to  these

meetings   in   Sahah,  Sarawak  and  Kuala   Lumpur

"represented  their  own  selves  and  the   British

interests;"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEMANDED that the Federation, Singapore and the

British Governments stop these consultative meetings

on Malaysia;'.



<br><br>The third one was read by the Deputy Prime Minister.

I do not intend to repeat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`CALLED for a closer association of the Malaysian

peoples  based on recognition of the right of  self-determination of the peoples of Malaysia;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUPPORTED the principles of the Afro-Asian

conference, especially against colonialism  and  for

world peace and disarmament;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONDEMNED any move to force through the Malaysian

plan  without  first obtaining the  consent  of  the

Borneo peoples, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRITICISED the British Government, saying that it

had no right to negotiate on Malaysia in the name of

the Borneo territories.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's paper, Sir, we have read a joint

communique  signed  by  all  the  socialist  Parties

issued at the end of the meeting. It reads, Sir,  in

page 24 of the Straits Times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Seven socialist Parties said in a joint communique

today that constitutional changes should not be made

without the express consent of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communique also said that there was an intense

propaganda campaign to rush through a constitutional

arrangement  for Malaysia that was  not  in  harmony

with  the sentiments and aspirations of the  people,

who  had  been given little opportunity to genuinely

express their views. Instead, there appeared to be  a

deliberate attempt to by-pass the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Federation/Singapore merger, it said:

"Considering  the present state of political  growth

in  the Federation, the Conference realises that the

conditions  are  not  favourable  for  a  full   and

complete merger and, therefore, supports the  desire

of    the    people   of   Singapore    for    self-determination."'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the socialists in the Malaysian territories

have    gathered   and   they   have   made    their

pronouncements  on  Malaysia.  We  in  the   Barisan

Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



are  one  hundred per cent behind the pronouncements

made  by  the  Socialist  Conference.  We  therefore

reject the motion.



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche M. Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche M. Ismail Rahim (Geylang East)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, for several days we  have  heard

Members  of this Assembly speaking on this  Malaysia

motion. The Members of the Barisan Sosialis spoke of

theories  which they gathered from the textbooks  of

Lenin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the Members of the Barisan

Sosialis deserted the P.A.P. when their position  in

the  P.A.P. became untenable, in the hope  that  the

P.A.P. would  be  paralysed,  because  the  Barisan

Sosialis  prefer to indulge in violent  politics.  I

ask   them  whether  this  is  in  accordance   with

democratic  practice.  The answer  is  `No'.  It  is

clearly a Communist tactic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me speak on simple political

matters so that the Barisan Sosialis and the  people

may  easily  understand the difference  between  the

political stand of the P.A.P., which is for  a  non-Communist, democratic and socialist Malaya, and that

of  the Barisan Sosialis. They indulge in deceit and

falsehoods.  Their  intention  is  to  hoodwink  the

people. I say to them that they should not have  any

false  pride. The people cannot be fooled any  more.

Now  it  is  even clearer that the Barisan  Sosialis

have  exposed  their true colours when they  expound

theories from the textbooks by Lenin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Barisan Sosialis will

not continue to fool the people. The people are keen

on a unification of the five territories. There is a

proverb which says that united we stand, divided  we

fall.  The Malaysia proposals reflect the desire  of

the people in Malaysia who wish to be united.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion has the support of all the political

Parties,  except of course the Barisan Sosialis  who

are  adopting  a  pig-headed attitude  - quoting  the

words  of  the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Prime

Minister.  They still persist with their mischievous

tactics of opposing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



the  Malaysia proposals. In short, they are  against

Malaysia because they have evil intentions.  In  the

political  struggle that has been going on  in  this

Chamber,  I  have  heard a lot  about  nationalists,

colonialists, Communists, and so on Everybody  knows

the  stand  of the Barisan Sosialis. The Members  of

this  Assembly are clear in their minds  as  to  the

intentions  of  the  Barisan Sosialis.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  want  to  fool  and  hoodwink  the  people - particularly   the   people   of   Singapore,   the

Federation of Malaya, Brunei and Borneo.  They  have

gone astray. The territories comprising Malaysia are

watching  with  great interest the  attempt  of  the

Barisan Sosialis to mislead the people. I urge  upon

them  not to adopt an attitude of false pride.  They

seem  to oppose everything. They are against  merger

and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of the various

territories  in this region give their  wholehearted

support  to  this  motion  which  will  bring  about

independence.  It is the duty of every  citizen  and

every political leader who owes an undivided loyalty

to  the country to give his wholehearted support  to

this motion. The Barisan Sosialis are being used  as

stooges by the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion represents the

wishes  and desires of all the political Parties  in

the territories concerned. The slogans "Let Malaysia

Live"  and  "Merdeka Malaysia" cannot be applied  to

the  Barisan  Sosialis. We should be proud  of  this

Malaysia  concept and every citizen should  take  an

active  part  in  its realisation.  Of  course,  the

Barisan  Sosialis  are  trying  in  every   way   to

frustrate its realisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis is just

like  a  frog under a coconut shell. The frog thinks

that  the  coconut shell is the world.  The  Barisan

Sosialis   are  strongly  opposed  to  the  Malaysia

proposals.  Perhaps  they  would  prefer  the  words

"Chinesia"  or  "Communisia".  They  should  clearly

state their ideological stand in this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu said

that we still see British soldiers in Singapore  and

independent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



Malaya  today.  He alleged that the P.A.P. are  the

adopted sons of the British. It is up to the Barisan

to  state  their  stand. We in the  P.A.P. strongly

support this Malaysia motion because we want to  see

the  realisation of merger and Malaysia. This is the

desire and wish of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind the Member of

the  Barisan  Sosialis that everyone of  them  is  a

traitor to the PAP. They cannot put their own  house

in  order and yet they want to try to put the houses

of other people in order. The Members of the Barisan

Sosialis comprise traitors of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the object of this motion can

only  be  realised by people who are loyal  to  this

country and are prepared to fight for it. Once again

we  urge the Malays in particular and the people  of

other  races to beware of the Communist elements  in

the  Barisan  Sosialis  who oppose  the  merger  and

Malaysia motions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I say that the Barisan Sosialis

which  opposes  this  Malaysia  motion  is  a  Party

comprising  people  who  are  treacherous  to   this

country.



<br><br>2.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this Malaysia problem is

not only being discussed in this Assembly but it was

also  discussed in the Federation of Malaya and also

at  the  Malaysia Solidarity Consultative  Committee

meetings  held  in  Jesselton,  Kuching  and   Kuala

Lumpur,   and  it  will  be  further  discussed   in

Singapore from the 1st to the 3rd of next month.  In

one  of  these discussions, the Member  for  Thomson

represented  the Barisan Sosialis.  If  the  Barisan

Sosialis oppose this Malaysia Plan, why is  it  that

they  requested  to be  represented at  the  Malaysia

Solidarity Consultative Committee?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution adopted at the Malaysian Socialist

Conference   held  recently  in  Kuala  Lumpur,   as

reported  in  the  Berita  Harian  of  Monday,  29th

January, condemned the three previous Consultative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



Solidarity  Committee  meetings  on  the   Malaysian

proposals on the ground that the delegates to  those

meetings   in  Sabah,  Sarawak,  and  Kuala   Lumpur

represented   their  own  selves  and  the   British

interests. This, Mr Speaker, means, in effect, that

the  Barisan Sosialis were interested in their party

interests   only.   The   Barisan   Sosialis    were

represented  at the Malaysian Socialist  Conference,

and  therefore  they were trying to  defend  British

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Utusan Melayu of Monday, 25th December reported a speech of the President of Party Rakyat of Malaya made at a Party conference. It said that the Malaysian concept initiated by Tunku Abdul Rahman was accepted in principle by Party Rakyat. It was not a new idea, as it had been thought of by former political leaders like Ibrahim Haji Yacob.

Therefore, the Barisan Sosialis do not really oppose

the  concept of Malaysia, hut what they  oppose  are

the fighters who initiated this Malaysian concept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the arguments are clear. As I said earlier, Party Rakyat accepted in principle this proposal as initiated by Tunku Abdul Rahman. Tunku Abdul Rahman has merely resuscitated this Malaysia concept which was mooted by Ibrahim Haji Yacob. If this Malaysia concept which we are debating today were initiated by Chin Peng, I am quite sure the

Barisan Sosialis would give 100 per cent support. So

the  problem is not the concept of Malaysia but  the

people who mooted this concept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis say that the original aim of Malaysia is to attain the independence of Malaya, including the Malay Archipelago. With the establishment of Malaysia, Brunei will then be independent; so will Sarawak and North Borneo. They will be free from colonial

clutches.  Is this not one of the efforts to  attain

independence? If the Barisan Sosialis consider  that

this  is  not the way to get independence  from  the

British,  are they suggesting that Brunei,  Sarawak,

and Sabah should get independence by violent means?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Malaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee discussed the question of Malaysia in Jesselton, Kuching, and Kuala Lumpur, and unanimously agreed that with the establishment of Malaysia, Brunei will be free from colonialism, and so will North Borneo. The statement goes on to say that, secondly, to unite all those independent

countries into one single unit called Malaysia,  the

question  of  achieving independence  has  not  been

finalised yet. So the second question of integration

of   all  the  independent  countries  to  form  one

Malaysia  is:  when will these three territories  be

free from British colonialism? For then only can  we

unite  these three territories. Mr Speaker, at  the

moment,  these territories are still under  colonial

rule,  and independence is being achieved  for  them

through  Malaysia.  Only when  they  are  free  from

British colonialism can we discuss the necessity, or

otherwise the merits and demerits, of uniting  these

three  territories and whether to include  Indonesia

or  the Philippines. That is a subsequent matter.  I

hope  this integration will not be with the Republic

of China or the U.S.S.R.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the object of the Barisan Sosialis is to unite the Malaysian countries with Indonesia. I think the Barisan Sosialis are dreaming. As stated yesterday by the Minister for Health, the Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis issued a statement in Bintang Timur saying that one of the objects of forming Malaysia is to let it come under the

influence   of   Indonesia.   But   the   Indonesian

Government itself has already made it clear that  it

has  no territorial claims on other countries except

to liberate West Irian. So it is clear, Mr Speaker,

that  if  the  Barisan Sosialis  want  Singapore  or

Malaysia  to merge with Indonesia, I am  quite  sure

the Indonesian Government will not accept it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, all the efforts of the Barisan Sosialis reflect nothing but a Communist attitude

designed  to  bring disaster to the  people  of  the

territories comprising Malaysia. Mr Speaker, in the

Utusan  Melayu of 25th December, the leaders of the

Malayan socialists say:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are not alone in our struggle to see the end of

the stationing of foreign troops in Our country.'.



<br><br>This,  Mr  Speaker, says the leader  of  the  Party

Rakyat  means that it is not alone in its  struggle.

It  means  that  there  are other  important  people

behind it. I believe Mr Speaker knows who are those

people  behind  Party Rakyat. They are  the  Barisan

Sosialis, which is the front line of the M.C.P. and

the  P.K.I.  This is obvious, Mr Speaker, when  they

say  that  they  are  not alone  in  this  struggle.

Therefore, all their efforts to oppose Malaysia  are

the result of leaders who claim to be socialists and

who  have  contacted leaders of the P.K.I. recently.

Then  they  came  out  with the decision  to  oppose

Malaysia  in  a  meeting of the Malaysian  Socialist

Conference in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, Mr Speaker, the leaders accepted the

Malaysia  Plan in principle. What they opposed  were

the people who initiated the Malaysia concept. As  I

said earlier, if the Malaysia that we are discussing

today were initiated by Chin Peng or D. N. Aidit,  I

am quite sure the Barisan Sosialis would give it 100

per  cent  support.  So. Mr Speaker,  this  clearly

shows  that  the Barisan Sosialis is the channel  or

the  vehicle  and  the  stooge  of  the  P.K.I. of

Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. I wish to inform this House that this Malaysia Plan is not a question of leaders of political Parties, but is a plan which will bring in its wake prosperity to the entire people of Malaysia. This is even more clear, Mr Speaker, when we see that the Barisan Sosialis is trying to wreck and to frustrate the prosperity of the people of

Malaysia.



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat (Siglap)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker.  I  fully support the Malaysia Plan.  I  am

surprised  at the attitude taken by Members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis. They said that if they could  not

have  their own way in the merger of Singapore  with

the  Federation,  they  would  like  to  get  it  by

themselves.  Are  they thinking only  of  their  own

interests or are they thinking of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



the interests of the 1½ million people in Singapore?

If  we get our independence, what will happen to the

welfare  of the people in this island, when at  this

time  we  are dependent on the Federation Government

for  our  trade?  Do  they ever  think,  if  we  get

independence,  what  the  fate  of  the  people   of

Singapore would be? We would be eating ourselves, or

should  we  eat sand? Do we not think that  that  is

very dangerous? They always double talk. I am fed up

with  their talk. They do not seem to think  of  the

interests  of  the  people of Singapore.  They  only

think  of their own selfish interests. This  is  how

they get Communist support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am surprised at their attitude in fully

supporting the Indonesian demand for West Irian - that

that  area be returned to Indonesia. Irian Barat  is

not  independent,  but  when  we  have  a  plan  for

Malaysia,  they oppose it and demand that  Singapore

should  first of all get self-government,  and  then

only  will  there be Malaysia. The  people  in  this

island  cannot understand the tactics of the Barisan

Sosialis,   especially  the  way   they   go   about

bamboozling the people. We understand the Indonesian

demand   for  West  Irian.  They  have  opposed   us

regarding  Malaysia. They do not want  us  to  bring

about a union between Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei and the

Federation  of  Malaya. Let us  consider  how  their

minds work. On the one hand, they oppose unification

and, on the other hand, they support it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have always said they are

genuine  socialists. But if they are really  genuine

socialists,  Mr  Speaker, they will  not  have  any

discrimination between the different races. Whenever

they move a motion, for instance, on education, they

always  talk  about the Chinese and  not  about  the

other  races.  Do they call this the thinking  of  a

genuine  socialist? But if they are  really  genuine

socialists,   they   will   not   have   any    such

discrimination.  What we are  fighting  for  is  the

welfare  of  the people of Singapore  and  of  other

areas which will be united with us in the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Mr Speaker, the Members of the

Barisan Sosialis have criticised Tunku Abdul Rahman.

They say he is a stooge of the British. Such remarks

cannot be accepted because we know fully what  Tunku

Abdul  Rahman has done. He has done many things  for

the welfare of the people of the Federation. Now  he

is  working hard to improve our country and the area

around  us.  The  Barisan Sosialis  have  made  such

assumptions.  They should swallow these  accusations

and  not say this about the Tunku. Furthermore,  Mr

Speaker, they do not seem to remember that not  many

months  ago  they  praised him. But  now  they  have

reversed  their  stand and are criticising  him.  Do

they not think that this is a wicked act  - an act  to

split up the committees?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Members of the Barisan Sosialis have said that Malaysia is sponsored by the P.A.P. I am surprised at this suggestion. Have we so much influence that we can ask the Governments of Brunei, Sabah and the Federation to follow our guidance? Are we not co-operating among ourselves to create Malaysia? But, Mr Speaker, we are not surprised

because  it  is  natural for them to  have  such  an

attitude because they want to play politics. They do

not realise that if they play the wrong politics, it

will  burn them up. They say that the P.A.P. is  not

democratic  and does not give freedom or liberty  to

the   people.  I  think  the  people  of   Singapore

understand  us. We can see for ourselves  that  even

now  no other Party has followed the example of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  in putting  up  posters  at  bus-stands.  This  is not election time. Has  any  other

Party done that? If we were not democratic, we would

have  arrested those who put up posters at the  bus-stands,  because this is against the law. They  knew

that  this was wrong. Yet they deliberately did  it.

So,  Mr Speaker, we can see how they go about their

work. They say we do not give them freedom of speech

just  because we do not give them this  freedom.  We

have  allowed  them to hold rallies  many  times  at

several  places in Singapore. Do they say that  this

is  undemocratic on our part? We give this  back  to

them. If they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



were  to  be  in  power, they  would  not  have  any

sympathy  for the people of Singapore.  If  we  have

Malaysia  and are united, it would not be  difficult

for  us  to  oppose Communism. As the  Malay  saying

goes:  the  coconut fronds can either be used  as  a

stick for making satay or we can tie them up into  a

bundle  and make them into a broom. It is the  same,

if  we  stand alone, we are not strong.  But  if  we

unite  together, we will be quite strong and we  can

oppose  Communism. I say that I do not allow  myself

to  be  influenced. I am willing to die in order  to

follow the right path. I do not like my country -  the

place of my birth - to fall to the Communists. We must

remember that this country is the possession of  the

people  of  this place. They should  not  bring  any

"ism"  which is not agreeable to the people of  this

place.  They  should  not be proud  and  should  not

condemn the Government. They do not know what  they

are talking about. They talk what they like. That is

all, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I had better put the record straight.

The hon. Member has spoken to the main motion. As  I

have  indicated  right  at  the  beginning  of  this

debate, if he wishes to speak, he can only speak  on

the amendment and nothing further.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand that, Sir. I just

want  to clarify the situation. I will not take very

long.  There has been a lot of misunderstanding  and

confusion  regarding the amendment  put  in  by  the

Member  for Anson. There has been great play on  the

words  "plan"  and  "motion". It is  argued  by  the

Member for Anson that so far as he knows there is no

Malaysia  Plan.  Though  he  does  not  support  the

present  Malaysia Plan sponsored by the British  and

the  P.A.P., nevertheless, he would like to  support

the  motion  moved by the Tunku and debated  in  the

Federal  Parliament on the 18th October,  1961.  His

reason is that though he does not support the  plan,

he supports the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



concept  of  Malaysia. I do not think I have  to  go

over  the  old  grounds, Sir. All our speakers  have

repeatedly  stressed that we support the concept  of

Malaysia. But we do not support the present Malaysia

Plan of the British and the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Of the Tunku.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This has recently again been

stressed by us at the Socialist Conference at  Kuala

Lumpur.  I am sure the Member for Anson, if he  were

here,  would understand and appreciate what  he  has

done.  But we feel that in moving the amendment,  he

has  failed to take note of one thing. That is, what

took place in the Federal Parliament when the motion

was  debated there on 18th October, 1961. The Member

for Anson thought that the motion had nothing to  do

with  what  took place in the Federal Parliament  in

the  debate that ensued. He thought that the  motion

had  nothing to do with the Malaysia Plan.  We  feel

that here is where the Member for Anson has made  an

error,  because  in  moving the  motion,  the  Tunku

clearly  indicated  the line and  the  plan  he  was

pursuing and -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With the support of the

Socialist Front.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - hoping to adopt. He wanted a

Malaysia with the Borneo territories - Sabah,  Brunei,

and Sarawak - coming in as States and Singapore coming

in   as   a   partner  with  no  automatic   Federal

citizenship and no proportional representation. Sir,

these Malaysia proposals or the Malaysia plan itself

of  the  Tunku, as debated in the Federal Parliament

on  the date the motion was introduced, that is,  on

the  18th  of October, 1961, cannot be divorced  and

separated  from  the  motion  itself.  It   is   not

realistic,  Sir.  The amendment of  the  Member  for

Anson  amounts  to  changing the soup  but  not  the

medicine,  as  the  Chinese saying  goes.  In  other

words,  the Member for Anson is saying that he  does

not want to take the mutton, to use another analogy,

but he is willing to take the mutton soup. So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



we  see,  Sir,  that the plan cannot be  dissociated

from the motion itself. Similarly, the motion cannot

be  dissociated from the plan. They are one and  the

same  thing in the context of what took place in  he

Federal Parliament on 18th October, 1961. Therefore,

as  far  as we are concerned, the amendment  to  the

original  motion  of  the Prime  Minister  makes  no

difference to the original motion itself.  It  would

be  wrong  indeed,  Sir, to fall into  the  trap  of

supporting the plan when the intention, in fact,  is

not to support the Malaysia Plan. The Workers' Party

has joined all the social Parties in the Federation,

in Brunei, in Sarawak and in Singapore in condemning

the present Malaysia Plan. But the Member for Anson,

in  moving  the amendment, has given the  impression

that in supporting the Malaysia concept of the Tunku

he  is  also supporting the Malaysia Plan.  That  is

what,  in  fact, the amendment has done. Sir,  as  I

have  said a little while hack, the Member for Anson

has  joined  with  other socialist  Parties  in  the

Borneo  territories, Federation  and  Singapore,  in

condemning the plan. There -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He feels less windy, is it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - a lot of confusion has been

created  by this amendment of the Member for  Anson.

The  people find it a little difficult to follow his

logic and utterances on the subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> He has scooted!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In short, Sir, he has

unknowingly fallen into the P.A.P. trap and has thus

become the unwitting supporter of the Malaysia  Plan

of which the P.A.P. and the British are co-sponsors.

That is why the P.A.P. is secretly very happy at the

amendment of the Member for Anson.



<br><br>3.31 pm.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, this getting together in the form

of Malaysia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



has  been  debated in this House for  several  days.

Originally, I did not wish to give my views  because

almost  all the Members had expressed similar views.

But in view of the fact that almost every Member  of

the Opposition has stood up to talk at length and if

they  are not replied to by the Government, then  it

will be discourteous on our part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the concept of Greater

Malaysia,  I  will  say  that politically  the  five

territories in this area should get together. It  is

an  inevitable historical process. The reunification

of the peoples in the five territories, as far as we

are   concerned,  is  something  which   we   should

celebrate  and rejoice at. The question  of  whether

this super merger will bring about prosperity to the

people in the five territories has become the  focal

point,  As  to the form of merger and what  it  will

bring  to  the people, we will say that as  long  as

this  plan  will bring well-being and prosperity  to

the people, we will support it; and the broad masses

of  the people will also support it. So we say  that

the whole question of super merger lies in the hands

of  the poor people who were exploited for years. We

hope  that by realising the concept of Malaysia  - and

the  sooner the better  - it will bring prosperity and

improve the livelihood of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a long-term objective of the P.A.P., we work

for  the  interests of the people. A  common  social

system   exists  among  the  peoples  in  the   five

territories.  So this concept of a super  merger  is

very important as it will bring prosperity and well-being to the peoples of these five territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk of the views of the people,

especially the Chinese, outside the House  in  order

that  Members  of  this House can  understand  their

views. During the last few months when the debate on

merger  and Malaysia took place, the people  outside

have  been  very  enthusiastic  about  whether  they

should have a merger or not. Some of the Chinese are

very  frightened.  They  are afraid  whether,  after

merger, the Malays



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



would suppress the Chinese and that, as in the  case

of  the  Federation, priority would be given to  the

Malays   whenever  they  apply  for  jobs   in   the

Government service. Now, if that situation  were  to

arise, then the Chinese in Singapore are afraid that

they would suffer. But let me say that this fear  is

not  illegitimate.  We know for  a  fact  that  some

Malays  in  the Federation of Malaya are  privileged

and  have enjoyed certain priority over the Chinese.

That  is  the  cause  for worry of  the  Chinese  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope this merget and super

merger will bring equality to all races in Singapore

and  in all the other territories so that there will

be  no priority of one race over the other. If there

is  priority  of the Chinese over the  other  races,

then   our  Malay  brothers  will  be  discriminated

against;  I  oppose such a plan.  As  far  as  I  am

concerned,  I  say  common equality  and  prosperity

should  be shared by all the races. If there  should

be   any  difficulties  and  responsibilities,  they

should likewise be shared by all the races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last few days of

debate  on  this  motion, we  saw  how  the  Barisan

Sosialis  Members  attacked us in  this  respect.  I

would  like to tell them that we must not look  only

at  one  side of the story. For example,  the  front

part  of the Chair in which you are sitting is  red,

but  it does not mean that the rear of your seat  is

also  red.  So  if you listen to a story,  you  must

listen  to  the other part as well. We  just  cannot

concentrate  on one side. We must look  at  all  its

aspects in order to ascertain whether it is good  or

bad.  We must realise that nothing in this world  is

perfect.  It  is all the better for  us  if  we  can

achieve  perfection. But it is impossible to achieve

perfection, and so we must weigh the advantages  and

disadvantages,  and take those with more  advantages

over the disadvantages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must weigh the pros and cons. So on the

question of Malaysia and merger, we think we  should

support  the  concept of Malaysia. For example,  Mr

Sun  Yat-sen, a political leader in China,  had  the

concept  of having a common world, which means  that

all the peoples



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



in the world would be under one roof. So the concept

of Malaysia, as far as we can see, is similar to the

concept of a common world, because it reunifies  the

peoples in the five territories. So I can say  quite

safely  that there is no doubt whatsoever about  the

advantages of the Malaysia concept because  this  is

only to the good of the people. If there is anything

sinister about this concept, then we will oppose  it

as long as this comes from the British colonialists.

So  I hope that all the Members in this House should

be  careful  if there is any sinister motive  behind

the  concept. But we must not do something good just

because we fear the colonialist motives. As long  as

the leaders who are pushing through this concept are

vigilant and they know that they will not fall  into

the  trap  of the colonialists, then we should  give

them  support.  If  the British colonialists  should

think  that  they  can make use of  our  leaders  to

perpetuate  their  colonialist  rule,  then  I  will

advise them that all the people in Singapore and all

the  people in the world will condemn them for  such

an act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you have pointed out, you say

that we should concentrate on the amendment, and  so

I  would  like to cut short my speech. But  I  would

like,  however,  to  clarify  certain  points   that

appeared in the newspapers -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the Lady has not

misunderstood me. My remark about the amendment  was

directed  to  the  Member for Queenstown.  The  hon.

Member  can  speak  on the motion  as  well  as  the

amendment now.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you for

your guidance. I apologise for the misunderstanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to clarify certain

points. First, there is one point raised by Mr  Tan

Lark Sye as reported in the Sin Chew Jit Poh on  the

27th  of this month. In his speech, he touched  upon

the  question  of merger between Singapore  and  the

Federation. He said if there is a merger, then  half

of  the  population  in Singapore  will  lose  their

citizenship  rights. Then what kind of a  merger  is

it? We have many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



Chinese here, but there is no representation in  the

talks on merger. This has been said by Mr Tan  Lark

Sye.  I  would like to point out that I do not  know

what  he  means as to what kind of Chinese  have  no

representation  in  the  talks  on  merger.  If,  by

Chinese,  he  refers  to  the  absence  of   Chinese

representation,  then  it is incorrect  because  the

merger  talks  between Singapore and the  Federation

were carried Out between our Prime Minister and  the

Prime  Minister  of the Federation  of  Malaya.  Our

Prime Minister here is a Chinese. As to Mr Tan Lark

Sye's worry about half of the Chinese population  or

other races losing their citizenship rights, I  will

say that at a certain dinner we had occasion to meet

Mr Tan Lark Sye. When he expressed his concern over

the  citizenship  question, we  told  him  that  the

peoples of Singapore will not lose their citizenship

rights, except that they will elect among themselves

representatives who will be sent from  Singapore  to

the  Federal Government. We also pointed out to  him

that  the people in the Federation cannot come  here

to stand for election.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is now going

back  on the merger proposals. We have finished with

that. She might touch on that in passing. But if she

goes  into  details, it is completely irrelevant  to

the motion, which is dealing with Malaysia. She must

not  debate  on  the  merger proposals  now  between

Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  because merger is quite related to Malaysia  I

am  mentioning  this  in order  to  clarify  certain

points.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for

the  last  two weeks we have been debating two  very

important motions, namely, the motion pertaining  to

Irian Barat and the other on Malaysia. In the debate

on Irian Barat, the Barisan Sosialis were vociferous

in their anti-colonial stand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



They  even stated that Irian Barat should  be  freed

from   Dutch  colonialism  by, force.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  never  at any time said that  the  Papuans

should have self-determination first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the same anti-colonialists in the

Barisan  Sosialis, when it comes to taking  a  stand

against  British colonialism, are offering the  same

proposals  for Malaysia as the Dutch are making  for

Irian  Barat. Since the famous Eden Hall tea  party,

the  Barisan  Sosialis revolutionaries  have  become

great  advocates  of  internal  self-government  for

Singapore  and  the  Borneo  territories  but  still

retaining the British as their overlords.  In  order

to   understand   the  Barisan  Sosialis   political

somersault, we must realise that the Communists  and

pro-Communists  are  dedicated  primarily   to   the

strategic   and  political  needs  of  international

Communism. It is significant that the opposition  to

Malaysia  has  been  voiced most  violently  by  the

P.K.I.,  or  the  Partai  Kommunis  Indonesia.   The

Indonesian  Communists have condemned  the  Malaysia

concept  because they see in Malaysia a  counter  to

their long-term plans to make Malaysia a part of the

Communist  Indonesian empire. They, the  Communists,

see  Malaysia as something which stands as a barrier

to  the  expansion of Communist influence in  South-East  Asia.  The P.K.I., whose sphere  of  influence

includes South-East Asia, condemns Malaysia, and the

local  underlings  like  the Barisan  Sosialis  have

started implementing the P.K.I.'s policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our feeling that the attitude of the

Barisan  Sosialis towards Malaysia  merely  reflects

the  strategic  needs  and interests  of  Indonesian

Communists  and  not  those of the  people  of  this

region.  It is ironical that just as in its  heyday,

Western  imperialism deliberately fostered a  policy

of  divide and rule in South-East Asia so that small

and  feeble States could be manipulated by  colonial

powers;  so  today we see Communists  following  the

same  policy  of preventing the establishment  of  a

strong   united  States  of  Malaysia.  The  Barisan

Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



have now become servile stooges of the P.K.I. in its

plans   to   keep   Malaysia   weak,   divided   and

impoverised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P.'s approach to the problem of Malaysia

is  based  on  the  fact that  the  over-riding  and

primary  objective should be the completion  of  the

national  struggle of the people of  Malaysia.  This

approach   implies  not  only  the  elimination   of

colonialism, which is after all a negative  approach

to  the  problem  of anti-colonialism,  but  in  the

context of Malaysian community, it also implies  the

consolidation   of  a  Malaysian   community   whose

loyalties transcend racial, religious, communal  and

other parochial considerations and affiliations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, in the context of the Malaysian

situation,  socialists must lay  the  foundation  of

national  consciousness before they can utilise  and

mobilise class solidarity which is so essential  for

the ultimate establishment of socialism in Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member for Toa

Payoh  read out extracts from the resolutions passed

at  the Malaysian Socialist Conference held in Kuala

Lumpur.  One  resolution as reported in the  Straits

Times  of  29th  January, 1962, page 18,  column  2,

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`CONDEMNED the three previous Consultative

Solidarity  Committee  Meetings  on  the   Malaysian

proposals on the ground that the delegates to  these

meetings   in   Sabah,  Sarawak  and  Kuala   Lumpur

represented   their  own  selves  and  the   British

interests.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this resolution, supported by the Barisan

Sosialis  at  the  Kuala Lumpur Malaysian  Socialist

Conference, is correct, then the Member for Thomson,

according to his own colleagues, represented himself

as  well as British interests. Since the expenses of

the  Singapore  delegates were met by the  Singapore

Government,  it appears that the Member for  Thomson

has  travelled  under false pretences  in  order  to

represent British interests. What is the reason  for

this? Has the Member for Thomson stepped out of  the

party  line? Is this a public rebuke of  the  Member

for Thomson at the behest of the P.K.I.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



that  he  had said and done the wrong things?  Would

he, like Molotov, be sent to Outer Mongolia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person who attended the Consultative

Solidarity Committee was the Chairman of the Sarawak

United  People's Party. The Secretary of that Party,

supporting  the resolution passed at  the  Malaysian

Socialist Conference, has condemned his own Chairman

as having represented British interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the average person, all these political

somersaults  will  be  confusing  and  difficult  to

follow.  The  truth  of  the  matter  is  that   the

Socialist   Front  of  the  Federation   of   Malaya

supported Malaysia before the P.K.I. resolution. The

Socialist Front leaders voted for the Malaysia  Plan

in the Federal Parliament. Once the orders came from

the  Indonesian Communists to oppose  Malaysia,  all

the  so-called Socialist Parties were forced to  eat

their  own words. Now that the Communist masters  of

the  Barisan Sosialis in Jakarta have given the  new

line, the Barisan Sosialis do not hesitate to make a

scapegoat of the Member for Thomson by implying that

he was at Kuching to promote British interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is so amazing about all this is that the

Member  for  Thomson  and  his  Barisan  colleagues,

though  proclaiming themselves Malayan  nationalists

and socialists, are knowingly allowing themselves to

become  traitorous dupes of the Indonesian Communist

Party.  They  know  full well that  they  have  been

instructed  by  the  P.K.I. to  go  back  on  their

original stand on Malaysia. They know that they  are

now  engaged on a deliberate sabotage of merger  and

Malaysia  to  further not the ends of Singapore  and

Malaysia  but  to help the Indonesian Communists  to

one day subvert and conquer the 10 million people of

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step, the Barisan Sosialis Members are

being  forced by their Communist overlords to engage

in  political  duplicity  and  in  the  sell-out  of

Malaysia to foreign Communists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Barisan Sosialis deny that they are

a  branch  of  the  P.K.I., but  they  respond  like

trained  poodles  to  the  orders  of  their  P.K.I.

masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we in this Assembly know that the denials of

the Barisan Sosialis mean nothing, because political

duplicity  is  an essential part of their  political

strategy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that once they dismissed

as  a  fairy tale our allegation that they had  paid

secret visits to Eden Hall in order to sell out  the

independence of Singapore to the British, in  return

for the abolition of the Internal Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once the evidence was produced, they had to

admit   that  they  had  been  engaged  in  such   a

disgraceful and humiliating plot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now denying that their opposition to

Malaysia is a conscious effort to promote the  cause

of  Indonesian Communism. They say, "The  P.A.P. is

branding all who oppose Malaysia as Communists."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know that this is not true. The P.A.P. has

never   said  that  all  who  oppose  Malaysia   are

Communists. We recognise the fact that there are non-Communists  who  oppose Malaysia  for  non-Communist

reasons. We do not brand them as Communists,  though

we think they are wrong in fearing Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are saying is that there are proved

Communists who are opposing Malaysia for the sake of

ensuring   that   Malaysia  comes  under   Communist

control.  The Barisan Sosialis in opposing  Malaysia

are  working to promote the cause of Communism. They

are  exploiting non-Communist anti-Malaysia elements

to further the ends of the P.K.I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, that the Barisan Sosialis

Members react to our allegation of Communist control

by  saying that the whole thing is a smear, but they

never deny our specific charges. Mr Lim Ching Siong

his  not  denied the authenticity of  the  documents

published in the book "The Battle for Merger".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



Yet these documents clearly prove that Mr Lim Ching

Siong is a fervent disciple of Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They denied too the report about Mr Lim Ching

Siong wanting Singapore to merge with Indonesia  was

true.  Yet  the  recent somersault  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  on  the question of Malaysia  makes  clear

that  that is what they really want. The Member  for

Thomson  made this cleat when he talked of Indonesia

being the heartland of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called Malaysian Socialist Conference is

further  proof  that  the local  Communists  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis  and  front organisations  in  the

Federation are now the messenger boys of the P.K.I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Socialist Conference was originally

intended  to  be  a  conference  of  socialists   to

discuss,   among  other  things,  the   concept   of

Malaysia, which  the  Barisan  Sosialis   and   the

socialists in the Federation said was a good thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the conference was postponed. No reason was

given  for  this  postponement. Yet  it  was  common

knowledge   that   the   success   of   the   merger

negotiations    and    the    Malaysia    Solidarity

Consultative  Committee meetings were  worrying  the

Communists.  Not long after the Kuching  meeting  of

the  Committee,  a  number  of  so-called  socialist

leaders  from  Singapore,  the  Federation  and  the

Borneo  territories went to Indonesia.  Towards  the

end  of  last  month, the P.K.I. came out  with  its

blast against Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the so-called socialists changed their

line  on  Malaysia. The conference of socialists  at

Kuala  Lumpur  was  not to be  one  to  discuss  the

socialist way of realising Malaysia but a conference

to  break up Malaysia. Since the P.A.P. was  one  of

the  Parties  which  did not take  orders  from  the

Indonesian  Communists, efforts  were  made  at  the

conference  to see that the P.A.P. was  gagged.  Its

working paper was rejected. Its delegates were booed

when  they revealed that some of the delegates  were

Communists and P.K.I. stooges. It was clear that the

conference



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



had  been  so  rigged that the P.A.P. would  not  be

given  a chance to state its case for Malaysia.  The

Communists had their "boo boys" ready to shout  down

any  unpleasant  truths  which  would  have  exposed

Communist machinations. May I state here, Sir,  that

after  all  the  efforts, the  so-called  socialists

could  not  summon much of a crowd at the  Chin  Woo

Stadium. There were no more than 200 people present,

and  of that a few were curious observers; many were

schoolboys and schoolgirls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysia Socialist Conference was a flop, and

the  Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis knows

this. This, in spite of the deception played on  the

people  of Kuala Lumpur. Posters were pasted in  the

Chinatown  in  Kuala  Lumpur, Petaling  Street,  and

other  areas,  which indicated that  Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong,  Mr  Devan  Nair,  Mr  Woodhull,  would  be

addressing   the  rally.  The  organisers   of   the

Conference knew that Mr Lim Ching Siong  would  not

be  addressing  the  rally. Indeed  the  Member  for

Queenstown, the leader of the Barisan Sosialis,  who

was  present  at the Conference, knew that  Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong would not be addressing the rally.  Yet

in  order  to  dupe the people of Kuala  Lumpur,  in

their  posters  they mentioned that  Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong  would  be addressing them. And  in  order  to

bring  others who might be opposed to Mr Lim  Ching

Siong but wanted to know what it was all about, they

mentioned  Mr Devan Nair, Mr Marshall and  others.

This is their practice to attract a crowd. But after

all their machinations and all their dupes, all they

could get were about 2,000 people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis know that in fighting

Malaysia,  they  are fighting a losing  battle.  The

fact that they have now to become openly stooges  of

the  P.K.I. shows clearly that the Barisan  Sosialis

is  neither  a  socialist Party  nor  a  nationalist

Party.  It  is  a Party dedicated now  to  the  most

shameful of all political acts - the betrayal  of  the

country and the people of Singapore and Malaysia  to

their Indonesian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



Communist masters. Betrayals are not a new thing  to

the Barisan Sosialis. They have betrayed their Party

and  their colleagues at the Anson by-election.  Now

they embark on the betrayal of 10 million people  of

Malaysia.



<br><br>4.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we should all

be  grateful that this time we have been spared  the

ordeal  of  further 7½ hour-speeches on this  motion

seeking  the  support of the House for  Malaysia  in

principle.  Obviously  the  Barisan  Sosialis   have

learnt  that their tiresome performance in  the  two

weeks  of repetitious speeches during the debate  on

merger had not won for them either praise or support

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all their arguments in this debate, one thing

is  clear, viz., they have learnt that to  say  that

they  support  merger in principle and then  quarrel

with   merger  in  practice  has  put  them  in   an

embarrassing  position and has  confused  their  own

supporters.  So this time, on Malaysia, this  debate

has  been cut short because they are going  back  to

the   more  simple  and  straightforward  propaganda

line - of  being  against  the  proposal,  oppose   in

principle and in practice. What, is curious is  that

this  switch  of  line  coincides  with  the  policy

statement   of   the  Indonesian   Communist   Party

attacking Malaysia as being anti-Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From June to December last year, the time of the

Kuching Conference, the line of the Barisan Sosialis

as  the  open front Communist political organisation

was  that  n  principle,  they  supported  Malaysia.

Indeed   the   Secretary-General  of   the   Barisan

Sosialis,  Mr Lim Ching Siong, said in  writing  to

the  newspapers  in  June last year  that  he  would

support  a confederation of all the five territories

provided  internal  security was  left  outside  the

hands  of  the  Central Government. In  Kuching,  as

recently  as the 17th and 18th December  the  Member

for  Thomson, as the representative of  the  Barisan

Sosialis   from  this  Assembly  to   the   Malaysia

Consultative Solidarity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



Committee  Conference,  said  categorically  in  the

Conference  that he supported Malaysia in principle.

However,  on the 30th and 31st December, the  P.K.I.

held  a  conference and denounced Malaysia as  anti-Indonesia.  And on 7th January in Kuala  Lumpur,  at

the  resumption  of  the adjourned  meeting  of  the

Solidarity Committee, after this policy statement of

the  Indonesian Communists, the Member  for  Thomson

was  the  only delegate to the Solidarity  Committee

meeting  who refused to stand up and raise his  hand

to say, "Hidup Malaysia", when everybody else did so

at  the  call  of  Dato Mustapha, the  North  Borneo

delegate.  And  so at the so-called Socialist  Front

Conference in Kuala Lumpur, which even the blind now

know  to  be  nothing more than  a  Communist  front

conference, the line was anti-Malaysia and, instead,

self-determination for Singapore and Sarawak by1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Havelock has alleged that I

have  disclosed at a Party meeting in June 1960 that

Malaysia  was  a British plot. The Barisan  Sosialis

and  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong must have  been  in  full

knowledge  of all the information in the  possession

of the Member for Havelock. When one year later, Mr

Lim  Ching  Siong  in June/July 1961  in  a  written

policy  statement  disclosed  that  he  supported  a

confederation  of  the  five  territories   provided

security was left outside the Central Government, he

must  have  known this-that Malaysia was a  `British

plot!  Because by then the Member for  Havelock  had

already  turned turtle on us and gone  back  to  his

former  supporters and friends and superiors of  the A.B.L.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how is it that in June last year, knowing

full  well that it was a British plot, Mr Lim Ching

Siong  still  advocated  a confederation - of  course,

always  provided  that internal  security  was  left

outside the hands of the Central Government? For the

purposes  of  the record, may I put the  Member  for

Havelock's recollection right on what was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



said?  I  never said that Lord Selkirk showed  me  a

telegram  which he sent to the Colonial  Office.  No

U.K.  Commissioner does that and certainly not  Lord

Selkirk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I recall referring to the Russian loan of over a

thousand million rubles for the purchase of arms  by

Indonesia  and  saying that the  British  understand

that general tension in the whole area must mount as

a  consequence; that one day in the near future West

Irian  will  be settled either by force  or  by  the

imminent  use  of  force.  They  must  therefore  be

conscious of the fact that once West Irian has  been

removed  as  a  colonial irritant on the  Indonesian

Republic,  the Borneo territories of Kalimantan  are

bound  to loom large [I think it is more correct  to

say  the British Borneo territories than Kalimantan]

in  the  forefront of the South-East Asian  horizon,

and being practical people the British know it is to

their advantage to move one step ahead of history.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not as the Member for Thomson and the Member

for  Havelock have suggested - fear of the rising tide

of  anti-colonialism in the Borneo  territories - that

bothers the British. These are fanciful thoughts  in

the   context  of  the  realities  of   the   Borneo

situation.  Sir, the Member for Havelock  has  never

been to Borneo. The Member for Thomson was there for

the  first  time last December, for  three  days  in

Kuching,  and two or three days in Brunei town.  And

he has not the slightest idea of the real position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me table a few salient facts. Sarawak has

three-quarters of a million people,  of  whom  about

half  are  Dyaks,  one-quarter  Malays,  one-quarter

Chinese. The Dyaks were once part of the kingdom  of

the  Sultan of Brunei. Later they were ruled by  the

white  Rajahs  who  gave special privileges  to  the

Malays  over  the Dyaks. With the advent  of  direct

British  rule in 1946, the special position  of  the

Malays under the Rajahs was wiped out and there  was

complete equality between the Malays and the  Dyaks.

And  the  Dyaks, far from being anti-British because

the   British  Colonial  Government  improved  their

position  after the Second World War, are  extremely

happy  with  the  present position  of  equality  as

against the previous position of inequality.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only so-called anti-colonial elements in

Sarawak are found in the towns of Kuching and  Sibu.

Pro-Communist  elements, who have in  the  last  few

years undergone training from elements in Singapore,

are  operating amongst a section of the  Chinese  in

the  towns of Sibu and Kuching - the size of Muar  and

Kluang respectively of some 10 or 15 years ago. Sir,

it  would  be  15 to 20 years before the nationalist

movement  of the Dyaks, the Dusuns, the Muruts,  the

Malays and the Chinese can reach the point where the

British position would be at all threatened. And  it

is not internal pressure which is making the British

withdraw gracefully before the time is up. I suggest

it is the relentless logic of external pressures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Barisan Sosialis talk of the

S.U.P.P. and the Party Rakyat of Brunei, I  do  hope

they  would put things in perspective. The influence

of  the S.U.P.P. is only in one section of the total

Chinese population in Kuching and Sibu, the two main

towns  of  Sarawak, and not by all  means  the  only

towns   of  Sarawak.  And  not  the  whole   Chinese

population live in Kuching and Sibu. Sir,  in  North

Borneo  there  is no Socialist Party but  there  are

about 12 nationalist Parties now, and more are being

registered.  Of  a  population  of  430,000,  three-quarters  are  Dusuns, Muruts, and other  indigenous

people,  and  one-quarter  Chinese.  In  Brunei  the

population is 20,000. Of these, 20,000 are  Chinese,

and  of  the  20,000 only 3,000 have any citizenship

rights  as subjects of the Sultan. 60,000 are Malays

and  the indigenous people; 25,000 are adults.  Even

assuming that every adult supports the Party  Rakyat

of  Brunei, all it means is that a constituency, the

size  or about Geylang Serai, supports Party Rakyat.

When  the  Barisan  in Singapore and  the  Socialist

Front  in the Federation, which unfortunately  today

is  openly  and  heavily  Communist  penetrated  and

dominated,  though  not to the same  extent  as  the

Barisan  in  Singapore, talk about the anti-colonial

freedom  movements of Borneo, the British  officials

there  must be laughing their sides out. If it  were

internal pressure of the Borneo territories that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



British colonialism has to contend with, then I  say

they  can safely remain there for another 15  to  20

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a nationalist and a socialist Party, our

decisions  are based not on what the colonial  power

does  or does riot do, but on what is or is  not  in

the  interest of our people. The argument  has  been

advanced  by the Barisan Sosialis, in particular  by

the  Member  for  Thomson, that if any  proposal  is

supported by the British colonialists, then it  must

be   pro-colonial   and  must  be  opposed   because

obviously  the  proposal is in the interest  of  the

colonialists;   otherwise  they   would   not   have

supported   it.   Therefore,   since   the   British

colonialists  have  welcomed Malaysia,  it  must  be

opposed by anti-colonialists. Sir, this may be anti-colonialist, Communist tactics and policy.  But  any

nationalist  Party that works on such  a  fallacious

principle and commits fatal blunders in the  process

will  wind  up in the gutter. The British  obviously

know  that  they must withdraw from the position  of

sovereignty in Singapore and the Borneo territories.

I  am  not  quite  sure they are  very  happy  about

withdrawing from the position of sovereignty in  the

Borneo  territories too quickly. That was the reason

why I asked the Member for Thomson whether, in fact,

should  be  found  the British were recalcitrant  to

leave, would he then support the liberation movement

analogous to West Irian? But, of course, he said  he

was  going  to  give me an answer on  this  Malaysia

debate.  But he has not done so. Sir, does  it  mean

that  it  is against the interest of the  people  of

Singapore, Malaya and the Borneo territories if  the

British  say  it  is  in their  interest  to  leave?

According to the Member for Thomson then,  it  is  a

colonial  plot,  and therefore, we must  oppose  it.

What  is  this?  Is  their  leaving  and  giving  us

sovereignty  against  our  interest?  Must  we,   to

satisfy  and make the Communists happy, insist  upon

the  British remaining and prevent their withdrawal,

all in order that the anti-colonial struggle can  go

on  and  on  to its protracted and final  conclusion

which  they  hope  will be to  the  benefit  of  the

Communists? Sir, since the objectives of nationalism



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



are  different from the objectives of Communism,  so

the  yardstick of what is good and what  is  bad  is

also  different. The fact that the Malaysia Plan  is

considered by the Indonesian Communist Party  to  be

anti-Indonesia does not mean, first, that it  is  in

fact  anti-Indonesia. It probably means that  it  is

against  the  interest  of the Indonesian  Communist

Party, and, to that extent, as was stated by Mr Lim

Ching Siong, on behalf of the Communists, it is part

of  the  cold war strategy to prevent the Communists

from  expanding their `influence'. That is what  the

Secretary-General    of   the    Barisan    Sosialis

said - involving  Malaya,  Singapore  and  the  Borneo

territories in the cold war. How? By preventing  the

Communists  in  Indonesia from expanding.  Secondly,

Sir,  even assuming, for the sake of argument,  that

Malaysia  is  anti-Indonesia - in other words,  it  is

anti  a  Communist Indonesia, not  favourable  to  a

Communist   Indonesia,  because  the   non-Communist

Indonesians are quite happy with Malaysia - why should

the plan be  bad for the people of Malaysia? The fact

that it is bad for a Communist Indonesia because  it

prevents  easier  expansion of its  influence  over,

first,  the  Borneo territories and later  Singapore

and the Federation of Malaya may very well be a very

good  thing for the people of Malaysia. The  trouble

with  the Barisan Sosialis and their Communist  open

front  back-seat drivers is that they have  not  sat

down  to  calculate the consequences  of  their  own

policy  statements. In June/July last year, Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong said that he was in favour of  Malaysia

provided  internal security was outside the  Central

Government. But on the 18th and 19th December,  with

the  assistance of the Member for Thomson,  all  the

Sarawak,  Borneo and Brunei delegates were convinced

that  the  best thing was to have external  affairs,

defence  and internal security in the hands  of  the

Central Government, and an announcement was made  to

that  effect at the end of our deliberations.  After

that  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong lost  interest  in  the

confederation because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



three  Borneo territories have agreed, their leaders

have expressed the view that they should go into the

Central  Government.  Now first,  because  any  such

scheme  to keep internal security outside the  hands

of  the Central Government will obviously fail, and,

secondly,  because the P.K.I. has come  out  against

Malaysia  as  anti-Indonesia, the  Barisan  Sosialis

openly  oppose  Malaysia both in  principle  and  in

practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, meanwhile Inche Syed Zahari, a former editor

of  Utusan  Melayu, who was barred in the Federation

of  Malaya for a diversity of reasons - which  at  one

time  I  had  hoped  to  be of  some  assistance  in

resolving - and  who  is  now the  prospective  editor

behind  the  scenes  of  the Malay  edition  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis, stated that the Tunku's  Malaysia

Plan  is  a fraud because Melayu Raya, the  original

term  for Malaysia, meant the incorporation  of  the

Borneo territories. Singapore, and the Federation of

Malaya into the heartland of Indonesia Sir, the pro-Communist  faction  of  the Socialist  Club  in  the

University  of Malaya published with approval  Inche

Syed  Zahari's article taking this line in the Fajar

of  December  1950. And then we all  heard,  to  our

consternation  last  week on  the  motion  for  West

Irian,  the  Member for Thomson repeating  the  same

line  that  a real Malaysia means Indonesia  as  the

heartland  and  that Malaysia without  Indonesia  is

anti-Indonesia.  Sir, obviously  the  Barisan  fully

supports  the  proposal that real Malaysia  must  be

Malaya,  Singapore,  the Borneo  territories  coming

into  the  heartland of Indonesia, and  because  our

Malaysia does not mean that our five territories are

put  into  the heartland of Indonesia, it  is  anti-Indonesia,  because, and I suggest the P.K.I. knows

that, it will make it more difficult for the P.K.I.,

if it were to gain control of Indonesia one of these

days,  to  absorb the Borneo territories,  Singapore

and  later  even  the Federation of Malaya.  So  the

Barisan Sosialis have turned and twisted their  line

until   even  their  own  followers  are   confused.

Originally   they  wanted  to  oppose  merger,   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, for the simple reasons that  internal

security



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



would be in the hands of the Central Government  and

Communist activities would be conscribed. Instead of

sincerely  admitting this and fighting  it  on  this

ground,  which  they fear nobody will support,  they

have  looked for all kinds of other reasons.  First,

they  want  to stop merger, with a lot of  malicious

nonsense about citizenship and second-class citizen;

the worthlessness of labour and education being left

in  the  State  of  Singapore. Then  they  want  the

reverse  of  that, saying, "Anyway,  look  at  that.

Although it is valuable, it will be revoked  by  the

Federation Government." As each one of those lies is

debunked,  they are then pushed into more  and  more

extreme positions. Now since the Tunku says if there

is  no Malaysia then there shall be no merger,  they

say. "Well, then that is the best thing. Let us have

no  Malaysia." But they were quite happy to  have  a

Malaysia   with   security   outside   the   Central

Government.  But  now that the P.K.I. has  declared

Malaysia to be anti-Indonesia, then all they have to

do  is to echo it and follow that line. That settles

it.  They  alleged,  first, that Malaysia  is  anti-Indonesia:  secondly, it is part of a  British  plot

and   conspiracy:   third,   there   is   no   self-determination in the Borneo territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask them what are their long-term

objectives  and  where  does  this  policy  of  just

blocking the other guy going to lead them? What  are

they in favour of? They do not want merger unless it

is  on  terms  which  will allow the  Communists  in

Singapore  to capture the Federation.  They  do  not

want Malaysia since they have reserved that for  the

Indonesian Communist Party. What they want, so  they

have said, is an internally self-governing Singapore

with  defence, foreign affairs and sovereignty  left

in  British  hands,  but with the Internal  Security

Council  abolished in order that the Communists  can

run  amok  and expand their influence. But what  are

their  long-term aims and where do those  lead  them

to?  What are their long-term objectives? Surely  it

cannot  be to create an independent Communist  State

of Singapore, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



that  would  be  both  economically  and  militarily

impossible.   The  declared  aim  of   the   Malayan

Communist  Party  is  to set up a  Communist  Soviet

Republic  of Malaya and Singapore. Yet they  do  not

want  merger,  although for all  these  years  since

1945,  they have condemned the separation  of  these

two  territories as being the responsibility of  the

wickedness of the British colonialists and later  of

the Federation reactionary feudalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Wartawan, a little journal of some non-Communist and Communist journalists in Singapore,

ran  a series called "Quo Vadis". For those who have

not  seen the film, all it means is, "Where are  you

going?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Brother.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> "Brother". "Where are you

going, Barisan brother?" That is the question  which

every  Communist  and  fellow-traveller  should  ask

himself.  As far as we are concerned  - the socialists

and    the    nationalists - it   is   quite   simple:

independence, stability, peace and prosperity  in  a

democratic  non-Communist  socialist  Malaysia.   We

tabled   this  as  a  resolution  in  the  so-called

socialist  conference  in  Kuala  Lumpur,  and  this

Communist  front  conference  using  the  banner  of

socialism,   was   afraid  even  to   discuss   this

resolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Plagiarising!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, the Barisan Sosialis

plagiarising from the P.A.P. saying that  they  want

an independent, democratic, non-Communist, socialist

Malaya.  They wrote it down solemnly hoping  thereby

everybody will forget that they are Communists. When

we  tabled that and said, "Let us discuss this  non-Communist   socialist  Malaysia,"  our   paper   was

rejected   and  our  resolution  was  scrubbed.   No

discussion  was  allowed from men  who  day  by  day

abused  the  liberties of the democratic system  for

tirades and untruths in the name of human rights, of

liberty of speech, liberty of association. Sir,  the

tragedy  of  the  M.C.P. is that,  contrary  to  the

Marxist/Leninist  doctrine, it is  trying  to  bring

about a Communist revolution working through not the

indigenous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



races - the Malays, Dyaks, Dusuns and the Muruts - but

through the active immigrant section, the Chinese. I

am  not  here  pronouncing judgement on  the  M.C.P.

because  I  was  never a member. I just  watched  at

close quarters. I am quoting now Mr Fong Swee Suan,

Mr  Sandra  Woodhull, Vice-Chairman of the  Barisan

Sosialis,  Mr  James Puthucheary,  adviser  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis - I do not want to quote ad nauseam.

I  know  it is always unpleasant to have irrefutable

proof  of  evidence of their own handwriting,  their

own  statement, solemnly made on the  day  of  their

release  from  prison, of their own  volition  after

they were released. They said the Communist movement

in Malaya had failed because it has not been able to

get  Malay  support. I am quoting them  when  I  say

this.   `The  inspiration,  the  impetus   and   the

organisational  technicalities  are  those  of   the

Chinese Communist revolution. That is what Mr James

Puthucheary told me; that is what Mr Woodhull  told

me;  and that is what Mr Fong Swee Suan told me.  I

spent  hours  analysing and reanalysing the  follies

and  the blunders of the M.C.P. and I profited  from

these very objective and agonizing reappraisals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communist revolution in China is one of

the  greatest revolutions that had ever taken  place

in  the history of China. It has given coherence,  a

disciplined   sense  of  purpose  to   replace   the

warlordship and the corruption that reduced China to

anarchy  for  so  long. But even  according  to  the

Marxist/Leninist  doctrine,  for  a  revolution   to

succeed it must be locally based and the M.C.P. will

not   be   locally  based  for  as  long  as   those

inspirations cannot pull at the heartstrings of  the

indigenous people of Malaya and Malaysia. If one day

Communism were ever to hope to make a really massive

appeal,  then it must be home-based and it  must  be

able  to draw the Malays, the Dyaks, the Dusuns  and

the Muruts together with the Chinese and the Indians

into  its whirlpool. That day can only come  if  the

leadership  of the Communist Party passes  into  the

hands of local Malays,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



Dyaks,  Dusuns  and Muruts, and the  inspiration  of

revolution   comes  from  a  close  neighbour   like

Indonesia  with  a  people and a country  more  like

Malaysia. Hence I say the significance of the P.K.I.

statement that Malaysia without Indonesia  is  anti-Indonesia.  It  is  easier to make  Malaysia  accept

Communism  from Indonesia through the Dyaks,  Dusuns

and   Muruts  on  the  Indonesian  side  of  Borneo,

appealing to kinsfolk on the Malaysian side  through

Malays  from  Minangkabau and Sumatra, appealing  to

their  kinsmen  in Malaya, than to get  Malaysia  go

Communist  from appeals of' thousands of miles  away

from China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown said that the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in Cairo has condemned

Malaysia as a British plot in the cold war.  Sir,  I

do  not  know how many Communists there are in  that

Solidarity Committee, but I know that India  is  one

of  the strong supporters and a great leader of  the

Afro-Asian  neutralist bloc. On  the  9th  December,

when the Yang di-Pertuan Agong arrived in New Delhi,

the Vice-President of India, Dr Radha Krishnan,  at

a State banquet on behalf of the President of India,

who  was  then indisposed, stated that India  hailed

and  welcome the plan to include Singapore,  Borneo,

Sarawak,  Brunei and the Federation in Malaysia.  He

expressed   the  hope  that  such  a   State   would

contribute  to the peace and prosperity of  Malaysia

and  wished Malaya success in the execution  of  its

plan.  Sir, this comes from the head of the  largest

non-Communist neutral nation. What I want to ask the

Member  for Queenstown is: is he suggesting that  he

and  his  fellow travellers in the Barisan  Sosialis

are  more  anti-colonial than Mr Nehru,  Dr  Radha

Krishnan,  or President Prasad? Or is he  suggesting

that  the  Indian Government is less  well  informed

than the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in Cairo?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been accused in the course of the

debate  on the merger proposals of having  sold  out

Singapore.  Therefore, it was my great  pleasure  to

watch the Member for Thomson  - who obviously gets  no

pleasure in hearing things like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



this  recounted to him - both at Kuching and at  Kuala

Lumpur recently, for there he found the North Borneo

and Sarawak delegates pressing for the same kind  of

concessions   and  safeguards  that  the   Singapore

Government  has  obtained  from  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  They wanted autonomy in a number of spheres

also. They did not want to go in as a complete State

like  one  of  the  eleven  States  in  the  present

Federation because they had certain local  interests

to  protect.  They wanted to prevent free  migration

into    their   territories.   They   pressed    for

Borneonisation, not Malayanisation, of  their  civil

service. They made mention of a separate citizenship

in  order that people from the Federation of  Malaya

and  Singapore cannot go to North Borneo and Sarawak

freely and outvote the people there. And yet we were

here  falsely and maliciously accused of having sold

out   Singapore    - we  who  have  obtained   special

nationality  rights, automatic  conversion  for  all

Singapore  citizens into Federation  nationals  with

equal rights as Federation citizens even though they

could  not  qualify  under  the  present  Federation

citizenship laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing, may I just say that a Press report

referred  to  by the Member for Bras Basah  about  a

member of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr Tan Lark Sye,

saying  half  of  the people would be  disfranchised

after merger, must be false and untrue, because  Mr

Tan  Lark Sye on the 27th of November last year, had

dinner  with us and expressed great satisfaction  at

the  arrangements whereby nobody in  Singapore  lost

citizenship  and at the fact that it  is  absolutely

fair  that if Singapore citizens cannot vote in  the

Federation, neither can Federation citizens vote  in

Singapore.  But  from  time to  time  we  get  these

deliberate,  malicious  either  misunderstanding  or

misreporting.  So the battle will go  on  until  the

last of every malicious lie has been nailed down  to

the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson was present in Kuala

Lumpur  when  the citizenship rules for  the  Borneo

territories were discussed; citizenship rules



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



to decide who will be the citizens of Malaysia. Only

British  subjects  in Sarawak and North  Borneo  and

subjects  of  the  Sultan  of  Brunei  will   become

Federation citizens. Those not permanently  resident

there  must  have  both - they  themselves  and  their

parents,  their  fathers,  must  be  born   in   the

territories  before they can qualify for citizenship

of  the Federation. Sir, under these conditions,  90

per cent of Singapore citizens who were not born  in

Singapore  will be disqualified. In other words,  90

per   cent  of  340,000  citizens  by  registration,

because   they   were  not  born   here,   will   be

disqualified.  So we have reached special  agreement

with  the Federation to allow all Singapore citizens

to    keep    their   Singapore   citizenship    and

automatically   have   equal  rights   by   becoming

Federation  nationals. Sir, the  Borneo  territories

could agree to these conditions because 95 per  cent

of  their  population  were  born  and  bred  there,

including  the  Chinese in Borneo.  The  immigration

laws  of  Borneo have been so strict since  the  war

that  only  5 per cent are new immigrants  who  have

just come from outside, namely, Indonesia and China;

from China via Hongkong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the curious thing the Member for Thomson had

to  explain  away was -  and I asked him this  at  the

Malaysia     Solidarity    Consultative    Committee

meeting - if the agreement between Singapore  and  the

Federation  of Malaya was a sell-out,  why  did  the

Borneo  territories  want the same  concessions  and

safeguards   which  the  Singapore  Government   had

obtained?  I  asked the Member for Thomson  in  open

session  whether, by virtue of the  remakes  he  was

making  about the people of Borneo the necessity  to

protect them and so on, he doubted the competence or

the  standing of the delegates from Borneo,  Sarawak

and  Brunei. He stood up - and it is on the record  of

the  Kuching conference - and admitted that they  were

fully competent and fully qualified to represent the

people  of  Sarawak and North Borneo. He knows  that

the representatives of the people of Sarawak are men

who have been elected in local government elections.

Mind you, I do not know if the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



Member for Thomson understood the importance of when

in  Rome, as the saying goes, not acting contrary to

what  the  Roman's do. He turned up at Kuching  with

great  revolutionary  force, verve  and  fervour  to

unfurl  the banner of revolution, took off  his  tie

and   his  coat.  I  understand  some  very  elderly

gentlemen  there, who represent thousands of  people

up  the Baran River and the Rejang River, turned  up

to  do  honour  to  the occasion. They  brought  out

family heirlooms and beads and necklaces round their

necks  and all the other tokens of respect  for  the

occasion.  I  am  sorry to say that the  Member  for

Thomson, much to his disappointment, discovered that

he  was  cutting no ice with men who talked politely

but whose word carried the authority of the whole of

the  inhabitants  up  the  various  rivers  and  the

tributaries  of  those rivers. One chief  turned  up

with  bear's teeth attached to his ears to do honour

to  the occasion. This great revolutionary from  the

Barisan will be  able to confirm this. I am told that

these  bear's  teeth signify courage,  tenacity  and

decisiveness, because once the teeth sink in, it  is

the end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amongst the other happy events in the

Solidarity Consultative Committee meeting  were  the

tremendous  cheers  from all sectors  of  the  crowd

present. One of the Dyak chieftains said that in the

neighbourhood  where he came from, if the  Communist

gave  trouble - I  did not understand him  altogether,

Sir,  because  I  am  not well versed  in  the  Dyak

language hut I understood a few words here and there

by  his  gesticulations -  he  left  me  in  no  doubt

whatever  of  the traditional method  of  the  Dyaks

dealing   with  troublesome  people.  And  tumultous

applause  from  the Chairman of the  S.U.P.P.  As  I

turned  round to my colleague, Inche Ahmad,  lo  and

behold,  to  his  right, there was  the  Member  for

Thomson sitting rather morose and forlorn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> I thought he clapped his hands.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He did not. He was the one

gentleman - just  like  the  one  gentleman  in  Kuala

Lumpur - who  was  reluctant to stand  up,  raise  his

right  hand, and say, "Hidup Malaysia!" He  was  the

one  gentleman  who came with revolutionary  fervour

without a tie when other people brought out all  the

family heirlooms. He found more and more that he was

very  far from unfurling the flag of revolution.  In

fact,  it  was  the great catalystic effect  of  his

timely interruptions, always dissociating himself on

behalf  of his people from everything that was  said

by  any other member of the delegation, which  I  am

sure  convinced  everybody else of  the  first  cold

draught  of the things to come. They decided without

further  ado  that  external  affairs,  defence  and

security go to the Central Government  - thanks to the

Member  for  Thomson. And so through all the  twists

and  turns the Communist open front Barisan Sosialis

have now at last successfully isolated themselves as

the only Party now here which is anti-Malaysia both

in principle and in practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like their Vice-Chairman, Mr Sandra

Woodhull,  and their adviser, Mr J. J. Puthucheary,

to  ask  themselves, how is it that they could  have

approved  in  writing - one of the useful  habits  one

acquires as a lawyer is always to have a document in

writing; it helps to establish what was intended  to

be  said  accurately and I have their  agreement  in

writing - the   policy  statement   of   the   Central

Executive Committee even before it was published  in

the  6th Anniversary Souvenir number on 1st January,

1961 - just a year ago  - defining the P.A.P. stand  on

merger  and  supporting  the  first  proposals   Oil

Malaysia.  And, of course, they have gone  back  and

melted   away   under   Communist   pressure.    But

fortunately letters and documents do not  melt  away

under any form of pressure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unlike the Communists, our decisions are

based  on  our  own appraisal, and our policies  are

designed to achieve our own political objectives. We

cannot  and do not switch lines in midstream at  the

behest of an outside authority.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has

explained  how  the Indian Communists first  opposed

the  last  war as an imperialist war and joined  the

Congress Party leaders in going to prison for nonco-operation with the British. But when Russia  entered

the  war,  then  it became an anti-Fascist  people's

war. People's war - they always talk about the people.

Unfortunately, it was contrary to the sentiments and

the  national  feelings of the whole Indian  people,

and  the Indian Communists organised strike-breaking

to  help the British war effort. As a result of such

anti-national  policies, the Indian Communist  Party

today  continues to be isolated from the broad  mass

of the Indians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the High Priest in Moscow says or

probably  the local Cardinal in Indonesia  says,  so

the  person  in  the  Barisan Sosialis  repeats  and

parrots  the  sermon. One day, Stalin  was  a  great

creative  Marxist-Leninist. And even Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong - the    Secretary-General   of   the    Barisan

Sosialis - held a meeting in memoriam to  grieve  over

their departed leader. The next day he was condemned

as  a  murderer  with  a personality  cult.  Cities,

roads,  squares, factories and villages named  after

him have been given new names so that his memory can

he erased from the mind of Russia. And even his body

lying  in  in state in the mausoleum was pulled  out

and  reburied to be properly forgotten. This is  the

way  you switch lines. "I am in favour of Malaysia,"

the  Member for Thomson said so in Kuching. I  asked

him  pointblank.  He  stood  up  and  in  clear  and

categorical  terms  asserted  his  support  and  the

support of the Barisan Sosialis -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> The concept of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - for Malaysia in principle.

Now  principle or no principle, they are against it.

The  P.K.I. says, "Anti-Indonesia", and the  Member

for  Thomson  says,  "Yes, anti-Indonesia."  Let  us

assume that it is anti-Indonesia. So what? Is it pro

the people of Malaysia? That is the yardstick.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Anti the people of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You never said that. That is

the  tragedy of the Member for Thomson and his  ilk.

They never say the right things because they do  not

think these things. It is not whether it is good  or

bad  for  the  people  that  they  are  supposed  to

represent, or their interest and welfare  that  they

are  supposed to advance. They just parrot  whatever

is pumped in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He will be demoted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, as I have said, when the

history of this epoch comes to be rewritten in 20 or

30  years' time by a Communist government  in  exile

somewhere, several chaps will be pulled out of their

graves,   put  up  against  the  wall,  shot   again

metaphorically and reburied. [Laughter]. It is not a

laughing  matter. If they are unfortunate enough  to

be  alive, then it will be worse for them. Once upon

a  time  Molotov, Kaganovitch, Malenkov,  Voroshilov

were all great men - Marxist-Leninists. The day before

yesterday  I read that a special law was  passed  to

scrub  out  the  names  of  these  men  from  towns,

villages,  factories,  schools,  universities,  army

units   and  other  items.  Sir,  84  decrees   were

introduced - 84   special  honourable  mentions,   New

Year's  Honours, Stalin's Birthday Honours,  Lenin's

Heroes' Day and Red Square Day over 30 years  giving

recognition to these men for their work on behalf of

Joe  Stalin and the Russian Communist Party. Marshal

Voroshilov, President of the Soviet Union,  referred

to  20  times  in  several army units  and  military

academies  named after him. Kaganovitch,  27  times;

his name given to several stretches of railway lines

and  underground stations. Now they are going to  be

wiped out for a ghastly mistake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I say history will record that this folly of

fighting merger and Malaysia is one ghastly  mistake

in which all those who participated in either making

the  decision or executing the orders of  those  who

erroneously and criminally made this decision -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You were left alone to yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - I say to them that when

history  comes to be rewritten, I hope there  is  an

honest  non-Communist socialist Professor of History

in  the  University of Singapore who will ensure  at

least  that  we  are given a decent footnote.  These

were  misguided but fortunately ineffective  men  so

that their crime is mitigated by the ineffectiveness

of  the evil intentions they were unable to execute.

From   being  pro-Malaysia  in  principle   provided

internal  security - always provided - is  not  in  the

hands  of  the  Central Government or provided  they

capture  the Central Government, they have done  one

complete  right about turn and their  new  line  is,

"Malaysia is anti-Indonesia and is to be opposed  in

principle."  The  Member for  Thomson  was  the  man

entrusted  with the most important policy statement.

He  was  the man sent, since only one man  could  be

sent to Kuching.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Failure of a mission!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Failure of a mission. Well,

bad  luck.  And it was an impossible task.  Even  if

they  had  sent a Kaganovitch or a Khrushchev,  they

would  still have failed. These were men with  stout

hearts. I was told that people who wear bear's teeth

in  their  ears  and have beads round  their  necks,

descended from hundreds of years of family tradition

and  history, are not rattled by fierce  words  from

Singapore. And they demonstrated in a very effective

way  and left us all in no doubt as to exactly  what

was  intended. What could the Member for Thomson do?

But he nevertheless - I give him credit - was chosen  as

the  only  man who could go to Kuching. If you  will

remember, they wanted to send two - perhaps you do not

remember.  But  I was told that they made  enquiries

from  the Minister for Culture whether he could have

a   travelling  companion  because  he  gets  lonely

travelling to faraway places. Since only one man was

allowed, the Chairman of the Barisan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



obviously  thought  it rather risky  sending  a  new

recruit  like that all by himself and a second-class

scout  was sent - not the tenderfoot - in search of  his

first-class badge provided he made good there. I am

sorry  to say the Barisan Sosialis Plan - defence  and

external  affairs  go  to the  centre  and  internal

security  remains  outside; two days  of  dissenting

with  everybody and keeping on. Here he was.  I  had

literally  to apologise on behalf of my colleagues - I

think the Member for Geylang Serai apologised on his

own  behalf - as we had by our democratic manners  and

democratic  habits  allowed  the  impression  to  go

abroad  that  we  were  all a  lot  of  uncouth  and

unmannerly  people  who went to foreign  places  and

kept  on talking in a way which left nobody  in  any

doubt  that  the local people are not  fit  to  look

after  themselves:  that the Barisan  Sosialis  have

come to look after their interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> To be liberated by the Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To be liberated by the Barisan

Sosialis. And then I stood up publicly to apologise.

I  am  glad  to  say that at least  the  Member  for

Thomson had the decency to stand up and affirm  that

he  had  not the slightest doubt that the  delegates

from Sarawak and North Borneo were fit and competent

to  look after the interests of their own people. It

is  all  recorded  in  Radio Sarawak.  There  is  no

document  in  writing, but I am told  that  this  is

almost  as good. You can hear the voice. I  am  glad

that  the  Member for Thomson said that, because  he

was  a  better  judge  than the gentlemen  in  Kuala

Lumpur  who  never went there. They  never  saw  the

chaps who turned up there with beads. [Interruption]

They said that this represented British interest.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

will realise that he is going back on his speech.  I

understand why he is doing it because the Member for

Thomson   is   here.  He  is  hoping  to   have   an

interjection. Let us get on with the speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you know, it is all right

being fair and democratic. I would not like it  ever

to  be  said by the Member for Thomson outside  this

Chamber, "If I were there I would have denounced the

Prime  Minister as a so-and-so." Well, he  is  here,

Sir,It is all recorded on tape by Radio Sarawak. He

was  there.  There were three witnesses - the  Member

for  Geylang Serai, who was no accomplice  of  mine,

the  Minister  for  Culture  and  the  Minister  for

Labour.  Sir,  I  am quite sure Radio  Sarawak  will

oblige, if Members of the House feel interested, and

arrange  for  the tape to be heard  in  the  Library

during   the   next   Session  of   the   Solidarity

Consultative   Committee.  He   admitted   that   he

represented  them. And a bunch of  people  who  knew

nothing about it - I do not want to be discourteous to

people who - I think they really are more to be pitied

than   hated - had  the  temerity  to  say  that  this

Conference  represented British  interests  and  the

people  themselves. What is the Member  for  Thomson

doing  there?  Let me remind him: at  least  in  our

Malaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee there  is

freedom  of speech. The Member for Thomson stood  up

when  he was not expected to stand up at the opening

ceremonial session. He stood up, dissociated himself

from  everybody else. He was allowed to  speak.  The

Chairman  did  not  stop  him.  I  was  told  by  my

colleague,  the  Minister  for  Culture,  that   the

Chairman at the Kuala Lumpur Conference - men who  are

always  shouting in defence of human  rights - took  a

big  ruler  and was getting more and more  agitated,

banging  the table and threatening the Minister  and

the   Parliamentary  Secretary.  Here  we  were   in

Kuching, civilized gentlemen. No, Sir, I will not be

very long. I think I might as well complete this.  I

want  this on the record, Sir; so many other  things

and they are very useful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly knew that good manners pay, because the

next  day when he turned up for the party, he turned

up properly dressed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> With a tie.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With a tie, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And a coat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And a coat. A well-mannered

gentleman. But I am sorry to say it was not such  an

important  formal occasion and so I  think  all  the

family  heirlooms  were not  on  display.  What  has

happened between July last year and now to have made

the Communists and the Barisan Sosialis take a right-about  turn?  That  is  the  question  we  must  ask

ourselves.  What  new in-formation,  what  startling

fresh analysis, has been discovered which they could

not  have  discovered six months ago? Or they  could

not  have discovered one month ago in Kuching,  when

the  Member  for  Thomson went there  and  supported

Malaysia in principle?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Concept of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Concept of Malaysia. Now they

do  not  even support the concept of Malaysia.  They

say the concept of Malaysia is anti-Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> No, we said we support the concept.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Now they support the concept

of Malaysia. They say it is anti-Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The trouble is that you do not want to

listen to our speeches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the tragedy, Sir. We

listen  so  attentively that we are  bewildered  and

confused.  In  dealing with such  gentlemen,  it  is

always safer to have things down in writing.  All  I

can  say is that that is their tragedy. The line has

been  set for them by the P.K.I. from Jakarta.  Mind

you,  Sir,  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Ban-san

Sosialis  is  a more important open front  Communist

leader.   And   he   is  not  a  man   reputed   for

understatements. He has categorically asserted  that

it  is  the  P.K.I. that is following his line;  the

P.K.I. taking the line from the Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Following from your line.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what he said. In other

words,  the most important Communist Party in South-East



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



Asia and the third most important Communist Party in

the  world outside the Communist countries takes its

line  from  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  And the Secretary-General of the  Barisan

Sosialis  says, "No. I am not a Communist."  Are  we

seriously asked to believe, Sir, that the third most

important  Communist Party in the world  in  a  non-Communist country would take a line from a  man  who

is  not  a Communist? That the Cardinal, instead  of

listening  to the Pope, listens to the local  parson

from Singapore, and takes the sermon -the Sermon  on

the  Mount  is  preached  by  the  local  parson  in

Singapore. And the parson says, "But, no, I am not a

member  of  the whole organisation.  I  am  just  an

outsider. A good, non-Communist Socialist."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by keeping in line with the decisions of

communist Parties outside Malaysia, they are  slowly

becoming  isolated in Malaysia. Just as  the  Indian

Communist  Party, by toeing the Moscow line,  became

anti-nationalist;  so  they, by  toeing  the  P.K.I.

line, will become anti-nationalist in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment moved by the Member for Anson

and  supported  by the Member for  Hong  Lim  is  an

amendment  in form. The substance remains that  they

support  the principle of Malaysia. And we agree  to

the  amendment. It also quite clearly  isolates  the

Barisan  Sosialis as the only Party in this  Chamber

that is against Malaysian solidarity and against the

Malaysian nation. Sir, it is a bad start for them to

be against a nation even before it is founded. After

its inauguration, I think those who were against the

nation   even  before  it  was  founded  have   only

themselves to blame if they find that the nation  is

not particularly well disposed towards them after it

has been inaugurated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here as a Government prepared to do all

that  is  necessary in the interests of the  people,

regardless  of  the personal abuse and  smears  that

have been showered on my colleagues, on myself,  the

P.A.P. and the Government. We are what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



we   are,  and  always  have  been.  Fortunately  my

colleagues and I, Sir, are not desperate men because

we  have no reason to be desperate. I would like  to

assure  my  enemies that desperation is  an  ailment

that  will  fix only those who are on the  verge  of

dire  disaster. And we have no dire disaster  gaping

in  front  of  us,  Sir. We are going  through  with

merger  and  Malaysia. It is our responsibility  and

duty  to  the people to see that their security  and

their prosperity are ensured. Nothing will deter  us

from  this task. If it was power we wanted, we would

not  have contemplated resigning after Hong Lim; nor

would  we  have  chosen the more  difficult  way  of

taking  a  nationalist stand and defending  it  from

attack  by the Communists and their supporters.  Why

should we have taken a more difficult road if it was

personal interests that moulded us? And we did  take

the more difficult road by setting out to explain to

the  people of Singapore why they must be part of  a

larger  entity  for their own survival,  instead  of

taking   the  easy  and  cheaper  slogan  of  "anti-colonialism", "full internal self-Government without

the Internal Security Council". In a write-up in May

in  Hong  Lim,  and  in  June  before  Anson,  the

Communist front organisations in the unions and  the

most important Communist front leader, Mr Lim Ching

Siong,  were  inviting us, the P.A.P., to  take  the

lead  in the anti-colonial struggle. This is all  in

writing,  Sir;  statements  issued  to  the   Press,

documents in writing. We were asked to lead the anti-colonial struggle but in their direction - to  press

for  the  abolition of the Internal Security Council

at  the next constitutional talks. All we need  have

done  in  Anson,  if  it  was  power  that  we  were

interested  in  for our ownselves, was  to  pay  lip

service  to  anti-colonialism  as  defined  by   the

Communists  and promise to ask for the abolition  of

the I.S.C. in 1963. And when 1963 comes and there is

no  abolition  of the I.S.C., then  lead  a  massive

agitation  for its abolition, to greater heights  of

mass  popularity, all in the Communist anti-colonial

movement. That was the easy way and would have  kept

us our safe majority this time;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



and  perhaps  with  a  bit of skilful  trimming  and

cutting,  bring us in again the next  time.  But  it

would  have brought ruin and perdition to the people

of Singapore, the people of Malaya and the people of

Malaysia; for if Singapore goes, so will Malaya  and

the whole of the Borneo territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communists have made grave

miscalculations as to our firmness of intention  and

tenacity of purpose. They may do well before they go

on with their anti-merger and anti-Malaysia campaign

to  ask, where will all this lead them to? On issues

of  life  and  death, such as merger  and  Malaysia,

considerations  of  personal fate  and  fortunes  of

Assemblymen and Ministers are utterly and completely

irrelevant. Let the Barisan Sosialis remember  this.

Let the Communist front leaders take this into their

calculations before they mount their final assault.
