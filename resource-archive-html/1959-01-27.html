<div align="center"><b>ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question-[26th

January, 1959]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read the Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

continuing  my speech made yesterday, I wish  to  give

the first reason why I advocate compulsory voting.  It

is  because  I  believe that compulsory  voting  would

rectify   the  not  fully  representative  nature   of

Government, which arises from optional voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an ironical example, there is the so-called

popularly elected City Council in Singapore. Here is a

news  cutting from the Sunday Times of 22nd  December,

1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The People's Action Party have 13 seats; the Liberal

Socialist   Party   have  seven  seats;   the   Labour

Front - four seats; Workers' Party - four seats;  UMNO - two

seats; and Independents - two seats."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg your pardon for having to bring out the names

of the particular wards from which the candidates were

returned.  But it will show and prove  to  the  House

what  type  of  City Council we have  today.  Does  it

really  fully represent the wishes of the  people?  Do

the Councillors really gain popular support?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People these days are very busy and they tend to

forget  the past quickly. Therefore, it would be  nice

if I were to bring back their memories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Swee Hong (Liberal Socialist Party) was returned in the Aljunied Ward with a percentage of

27.3  per  cent  of the total votes polled;  Mr  John

Mammen  (P.A.P.). (Member for Anson), 33.3  per  cent;

Mr  Sze Lih Hwa (P.A.P.). Member for Bras Basah, 32.3

per cent; Mr G. Govindasamy (Independent), Member for

Bukit Merah, 21.1 per cent; Mr O. S. Rengasamy

(Workers' Party), Member for Cairnhill, 29.4 per cent;

Inche Baharudin Bin

Mohamed Ariff (P.A.P.), Member for Crawford, 42.11 per

cent;  Mr  J. C. Corera (Workers' Party), Member  for

Member for Farrer Park, 33 per cent; Mr Kum Teng Hock

(P.A.P.), Member for Geylang East, 33.2 per cent;  Mr

Low  Por Tuck (P.A.P.), Member for Geylang West,  41.5

Besar,  34.9  per cent; Mr Chang Yuen Tong  (Workers'

Party),  Member for Kallang, 46.3 per cent; Madam  Hoe

Puay Choo (P.A.P.), Member for Kampong Glam, 38.3  per

(Liberal  Socialist Party), Member for Moulmein,  28.1

per cent; Our heroine of the City Council, Mrs Felice

Leon-Soh (Liberal Socialist Party), Member for  Mountbatten,  24.6 per cent.

Now she is leading the  Katong Council or something like that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Say Yeo (Liberal Socialist Party). Member for Pasir Panjang, 39.7

per cent;  Mr  Tang  Peng  Yeu (Labour Front), Member for Queenstown, 33.2

per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, is the Member allowed to read

out the results of the last election? He is taking  up

the time of the hon. Members in this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know what the point of order

is.  But I think the hon. Member is perfectly in order

if he wishes to inform the hon. Members of the results

of the City Council election.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, it is quite a lengthy result.

We  all know the results of the last election. He need

not waste our time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. Mr Lim Cher

Kheng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Well, well, that is the type of

Assemblymen we have -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> All right, Sir, I beg your

pardon. Now, I come back to the results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ho Kok Hoe (Labour Front), Member for River Valley, 28.18 per cent; Mr Lin You Eng (P.A.P.),

Member  for Rochore, 41.1 per cent; Mr S. M.  Vasagar

(Liberal-Socialist  Party), Member  for  Sepoy  Lines,

35.9  per  cent;  Mr G. B. Armstrong (Labour  Front),

Member  for  Stamford, 15.78 per cent; Inche  Mohamed

Shariff  bin Dollah (UMNO), Member for Tanglin,  25.1

per  cent;  Mr  Ong  Pang Boon (P.A.P.),  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar,  32.2  per cent;  Mr  Wang  Tsun  Hao

(Workers'  Party),  Member for Telok  Ayer,  47.9  per

cent; Inche Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff (UMNO), Member  for

Telok  Blangah,  37.2  per  cent;  Mr  Lee  Bah  Chee

(Liberal-Socialist Party), Member for Tiong Bahru, who

is  the friend of our hon. Member for Tiong Bahru, was

returned with the marvellous result of 32.4 per  cent;

Mr  Wong  Soon Fong (P.A.P.), Member for  Toa  Payoh,

42.1  per  cent;  Mr  Chua Kim Kee (Liberal-Socialist

Party), Member for Ulu Pandan, 33.2 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry to have taken up so much valuable

time  of  the Assembly, especially of the  Member  for

Tiong  Bahru. But the point I would like to  emphasise

is  that these election results give an ironical proof

that  we  have to rectify the not fully representative

nature  of a Government or any authority which  arises

from optional voting. We are going to get this kind of

result if we say to the people, "You can go or you can

stay at home."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one sad thing in the Singapore City Council

affairs.  The  debate that is going  on  in  the  City

Council,  whether  it is on a big  thing  or  a  small

matter, is so well-known that it may be known all over

the world by now. Regarding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>



the decisions made by the City Council, are they fully

and popularly supported by the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These City Councillors were returned on a small

margin  of  votes polled, some as low as 15 per  cent.

Where  were those 85 per cent voters? Where was  their



voice?  What  was their stand? Do they  approve  every

action  taken  and  every issue  raised  in  the  City

Council?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, any decision or legislation passed will

not  represent the wishes of the people  as  a  whole,

unless  all the eligible voters take part in it.  Then

will the democratic process be secured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why I support compulsory voting is

that I believe it would bring to the polls many voters

who  are in favour of a stable form of government. The

right of suffrage and democracy can be preserved  only

through the exercise of that right. Are the people  of

Singapore fully aware of our political aspirations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time I have been confronted by foreign

visitors  and  they seem to think that  our  political

status is rather peculiar. They say that we are not  a

Colony  because we are going to have a Head  of  State

(maybe we will have to address him as His Majesty  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara), and yet we  are  under  the

control  of the Colonial Office in London. Therefore,

we  are neither a Colony nor an independent state. Why

has   Singapore  been  thrown  into  such  a  peculiar

situation? I wonder how many people know this exactly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time I have not only advocated a merger,

which  is  popularly supported by our Chief  Minister,

Tun Lim Yew Hock, or even our most respected-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member should

stop at "Chief Minister", and not give him a name.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Even if these two nationalist

leaders, our Chief Minister and the Prime Minister  of

the Federation of Malaya, decide on a merger, I do not

think  Whitehall  or even the White House  will  allow

Singapore and Malaya to merge so easily. It is because

Singapore has been outlined as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>



most  important  strategic port by the  Western  bloc.

They  just  do  not  trust the people  of  Malaya  and

Singapore. In this respect, I would like to recall the

remarks  I made in this House about two years ago.  We

must think this: without Gen. Tojo in Japan and Hitler

in  Germany, I do not think we will ever have this so-called   constitutional  advancement   or   a   Rendel

Constitution even. In other words, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering how Gen. Tojo has anything

to do with compulsory voting in Singapore. Perhaps the

hon.  Member  would  like  to  relate  Gen.  Tojo   to

compulsory voting?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, we cannot afford to have any

radical change. If there is any radical change we must

wait  for the whole of Asia or the whole world to have

a  change.  Therefore, we need a moderate  and  stable

Government. We do not want any pink party (not red but

pink).  They try to mislead the masses. They  want  to

have  land  reforms;  they  want  to  "down  with  the

capitalists!";  and they want us to be  ruled  by  the

workers  and farmers in this country. Therefore,  Sir,

it is only by compulsory voting that we can settle it.

We need a moderate and stable Government. We are going

to  force  the middle-aged people and the middle-class

to  exercise  their right. The right of  suffrage  and

democracy  can be preserved only through the  exercise

of  that right. It is no use of their crying, "We want

to  be  citizens of Singapore," and when it  comes  to

voting  they  remain  at  home.  Therefore,  the   new

citizens  and  new  voters  of  today  are  of   vital

importance  and I shall term it a potential  force  to

this country. It is only through these middle-aged and

middle-class people that Singapore is as prosperous as

it  is  today.  Yet their wishes and their  views  are

never  represented in the Legislative Assembly or  the

City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, nobody dares to disregard or ignore the danger

which  lies ahead of us, of the great tendency of  the

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore who either suffer from political  apathy

or   fall   into  the  hands  of  what  we  call   the

unscrupulous politicians who lure either with power or

through the mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a newspaper cutting which shows why we need a

moderate  and stable government. Here is a picture  in

the  Straits  Times of 23rd December,  1958,  the  day

after the mayoral election result was announced.  Sir,

I show the picture here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captions read: "P.A.P. Cheers", "Clenched fists",

"Victory proves people back us - Mayor," "Ong re-elected

Mayor  for new term." Sir, what I would like  to  show

you  are these two pictures, one showing the newly re-elected Mayor being chaired by P.A.P. supporters  with

clenched  fists, and another one showing T. T.  Rajah,

with  a clenched fist. I invite every hon. Member here

to have a close look and study these pictures. Why are

these  faces  so  youthful? In some  instances,  their

mouths are opened as if they were shouting during some

big  festival. Why cannot we get more varieties of age

groups?   See  this  picture - where  are  the  parents,

teachers and employers? Why cannot Mayor Ong Eng  Guan

be  supported by all races, all classes  and  all  age

groups?  They  are  not  in this  group  here  in  the

picture.  A moderate estimate shows that the  majority

of  them  are below 25. A closer look may reveal  that

they  are even below 20. Is this country going  to  be

influenced  by this crowd who turned up  at  the  City

Council Mayoral election? I am sure that every genuine

nationalist leader here, including our People's Action

Party  leader,  will not be satisfied if  their  Party

were  to  be supported by youngsters only.  They  only

belong  to a certain group-workers, students, farmers.

They are only the Chinese-speaking group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this picture, the question is posed. Where

was  the middle-aged group who was interested  in  the

City Council elections?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason why I am in favour of compulsory

voting is that I believe compulsory voting would  tend

to  produce a better type of candidates for  election.

It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>



is  only  by compulsory voting that you can  produce  a

more suitable type of candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a queer belief among our people in

these  last few years that you must vote for the Party.

Do  not  care about the candidates. Even how  unpopular

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar is, never mind about him.

The  People's Action Party is the best. Do not care for

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar. He is nothing.  But  the

Party is important. There is no more individuality, but

collective  regimental  organisation.  That   is   the

picture we are going to see. Tom and Harry can  be  put

up as candidates for the election as long as they stand

for  a particular party. They do not care what kind  of

personality or ability they have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that by compulsory voting, the middle-aged group and the middle class people, who are mature

and experienced, will be able to give a better lead. If

we  can  force those people to go to the  polls,  they

will be able to influence others around them to go too.

I  give a particular example. If I go to the polls,  my

wife  will naturally follow me. But if I do not go,  my

wife will not be bothered to go. She will say: "Even my

husband does not care about voting, so why should I  go

to  the  polls?"  So if I am the one who  goes  to  the

polls,  I can at least bring one voter more. No  matter

whether or not it is decisive, we can at least cast our

vote with conscience and knowledge. We will be able  to

know how to choose the suitable candidate that is going

to  represent the best interests of the people of  that

particular division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my belief that only by compulsory voting can we

encourage  persons of good character and  ability,  who

are   not   interested  in  getting   any   Ministerial

appointment  or  have  any axe  to  grind,  to  reflect

genuine public opinion by fearlessly speaking out their

minds.  This will tend to force any political Party  to

pick its candidates most carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth reason why I am in favour of compulsory

voting  is  that  it  tends to  reduce  corruption  and

malpractices. I believe that compulsory voting  can  at

least   eradicate   part   of   the   corruption    and

malpractices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us refer for a moment to the famous Elias

Commission  Report. Although this Report  was  bitterly

criticized by the People's Action Party, it has  opened

the  eyes of the people of Singapore and made known  to

them  how  the elections are actually run, who controls

them and who influences them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to relate a personal story which I experienced

on  my  way home from abroad in a liner just  two  days

before  the Kallang by-election to the City Council.  A

stranger  knowing that I was from Singapore, asked  me,

"Is it true that Singapore politics are in the hands of

students  and  gangsters and the fight in Singapore  is

caused by the students and gangsters?" Sir, is it not a

shame  for  an  elected representative of Singapore  to

hear such stories? The stranger did not know who I was.

He  only  knew that I was a Singaporean. Sir, it  is  a

well-known fact that in past elections - this is actually

referred to in the Elias Commission Report - undemocratic

and  unscrupulous  elements had  infiltrated  into  our

ranks.  What are we then going to do about  the  coming

elections?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition of "corruption" in the public

mind  is  still not very clear. The act of  giving  two

bottles  of  brandy  or an ang pow of  $100  is  called

corruption.  Sir,  that, in  fact,  is  not  true.  In

politics, the definition of "corruption' should include

power corruption and moral corruption, besides material

corruption. Let our people understand clearly in  their

minds  that  there are politicians without  any  morals

thirsting for power. They are as equally corrupt as the

gangsters in the streets. The gangsters intimidate  the

innocent  public  by  the  use  of  force.  There   are

unscrupulous  and  selfish  politicians  who  influence

ignorant  youngsters, workers and  farmers  with  their

irresponsible  promises.  Sir,  these  politicians  are

equally  guilty of corruption. Sir, to those  extremist

politicians  who  know  too well  that  Singapore  will

remain a Colony for some time and also that Singapore's

livelihood is dependent, not only politically but  also

economically, on Her Majesty's pleasure, I  would  like

to ask the Member for Sembawang who is not here, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>



should the Naval Base authorities decide to close down

the  Naval Base in Singapore, how he would be able  to

look  after  the welfare of the tens of  thousands  of

workers who are employed in the Naval Base. Sir, I  am

the  Member  for  Changi  and  I  know  how  much  the

livelihood of the people of Changi is dependent on the

Changi    Airport.   If   because   of   international

repercussions  or Commonwealth implications  Singapore

cannot  get its freedom, how can we promise our people

unrealistic,  impractical and even impossible  changes

to  this  country? Sir, I pray to God  that  Singapore

will never have a Government with such an outlook.  If

I  have  a  durian, you might say, it is shit "because

Mr  Lim Cher Kheng's durian must be shit". But if  it

was  the durian of, say, the Member for Tanjong Pagar,

then  it  would be a durian. Sir, the public may  have

come  to  believe  that  the  Preservation  of  Public

Security   Ordinance  passed  by  the   Labour   Front

Coalition  Government  is undemocratic,  but  had  the

Ordinance  been  passed by the P.A.P.  Government,  it

would have been made to appear that it would serve  to

bring  Singapore  nearer to the Federation.  Sir,  all

these irresponsible, unrealistic and selfish political

promises  can  be countered only by compulsory  voting

which  will  open  the  eyes  of  the  people  to  the

existence  of these morally corrupt politicians.  They

are equally as bad as corrupt gangsters.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is addressing the

Chair and the Chair is, I think, today being very much

intimidated. I would ask the hon. Member  to  modulate

his  voice  and perhaps be a little calmer  about  the

whole matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir, I cannot

help it because I am so sorry at the thought that  the

people of Singapore only understand the definition  of

corruption  as  merely  the receiving  of  bottles  of

brandy and cash. They do not know that there is such a

thing as power and moral corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore strongly advocate compulsory voting

because I believe that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>



through   compulsory  voting  we  can   get   rid   of

corruption, including moral and power corruption,  and

malpractices.  In  the  past, we  have  seen  how  the

regimented  students of a Party were  ordered  to  get

ready  to  start a meeting, if Mr So and So  were  to

stand up on the stage, they clapped their hands.  Only

a  few  persons  at first would start  clapping  their

hands.  Sir, you know our masses here; if a few  start

to  clap  hands,  then  immediately  everybody  starts

clapping hands too. These students are regimented  and

well  trained. The students and the workers are  told,

"Our  Party is going to have a political meeting at  a

certain  place." A group of people will then be  given

the front seats and when the leaders have spoken there

is  loud clapping. The reporters quickly send out this

message,  "This  Party  is very  well  supported.  The

attendance is wonderful and the Party has the  genuine

support  of the people of Singapore." Sir, to me  that

is  also  a  kind of corruption - the kind of corruption

which misleads our public into believing that such and

such  a  Party  is genuinely supported and  is  beyond

corruption. This sort of a Party is corrupted and very

irresponsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last reason why I am in favour of compulsory

voting is that it would stimulate the interest of  the

people in the elections and in political issues.  Sir,

if I want my children to learn, I must compel them to

go  to  school.  They will be able to concentrate  and

learn  quickly. It is human nature that if you  compel

people  to  do anything, they will show some  concern,

but  if  you  do not compel them to do anything,  they

will  not  show  any  concern. I  will  quote  another

practical example, Sir. Today, the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar,  a  Queen's Scholar, has to learn  the  Chinese

language most diligently. Sir, why does the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar have to devote so much of his  precious

time  to  study Chinese most diligently? It is because

the circumstances compel him to do so. If he wants  to

become  a  popularly supported leader of the  Chinese-speaking  students and workers, he  must  be  able  to

speak  Mandarin, Sir. Therefore, we should induce  our

people to be more politically conscious and to be more

interested in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>



public  affairs. We must force them to understand  the

issues at stake in the next elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, those people who claim that

compulsory  voting is undemocratic,  impractical  and

useless  should  bear in mind that  unless  compulsory

voting is introduced, Singapore cannot be safe against

the  insidious  attempt  to  seize  power  by  morally

corrupted  extremists  thirsting  for  power  and   by

gangsters. It is only by compulsory voting that we can

get  rid  of  this danger. Only compulsory voting  can

ensure  for Singapore a government which is  popularly

supported by and is truly representative of all races

in  Singapore. Singapore today needs a government with

such  popular support. We should never allow Singapore

to  fall into the hands of a government which is  only

supported by a section of the people - workers, farmers

or  any  racial group. We want a government which  can

provide  for  our welfare and prosperity - a  government

which  has the confidence of the people and  which  is

popularly supported by all races in all age groups.



<br><br>10.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

must rise to congratulate the Member for Changi on his

most coherent and perhaps the best speech in the whole

of his career in this House. Sir, I do so because I am

amazed  at  the  growth of his political  maturity.  I

recall  the time when he first crossed my path  during

the  first general elections. He stood at the platform

of my opponent in Paya Lebar Airport and there he made

a speech saying, "Mr Lim Koon Teck is the Chairman of

the  Appeals Board in the Singapore Improvement  Trust

and,  as  Chairman,  he  is responsible  for  all  the

evictions."  I must say that possibly the  information

was falsely passed to him and I bear him no malice for

saying that, although at that time I had a writ  ready

to unseat him from this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those were the things which we had to face when

we  fought  the  first elections  to  the  Legislative

Assembly  under the Rendel Constitution. I  have  been

sold that political elections is a dirty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>



game  and  I found, to my cost, that nothing  is  more

dirty  than  that  in Singapore.  We  who  fought  the

elections know how much we suffered and how many  home

truths  on corruption there are in the Elias Commission

Report.  So  much so, Sir, that very many  responsible

people  refuse  to come forward as candidates  because

they are afraid to be slandered, defamed and have  all

the mud thrown at them on the election platform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of compulsion in anything, particularly in

using one's sacred right to vote, must be repugnant to

most  of us, but when we consider and reflect on  what

has  happened during the past few elections  we  have

had in Singapore, I think we must strike a balance and

say  that  under  no other system than the  compulsory

system  of voting will Singapore be able to produce  a

truly  representative government  for  the  people  of

Singapore. We have seen on election day how troops  of

boys  and young men and gangsters having all sorts  of

emblems  tied around their foreheads, on their  shirts

and  on their cars, rushing about from house to  house

telling lies sometimes to the extent that where  there

are  old people in a house, they tell them, "You  must

come and vote for us," and then, when they are in  the

car,  they are told, "Now you must vote for a  certain

Party  and  if you do not do so, we shall be  able  to

find  out  for  whom you voted, and dire  consequences

will  happen to you if you do not vote for  us."  Sir,

all these things must be stopped. We must stop the use

of  all  cars.  This costs a large sum  of  money  and

entails  an  obligation to the person  who  lends  the

candidate  his  car which sometimes gets  damaged.  We

must,  in  every respect, try to make it  possible  so

that  a candidate can contest the polls without having

to  contravene the law by spending more than  what  is

allowed   under   the   Local   Government   Elections

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us make it possible for the people of

Singapore  on  voting day to reflect  calmly,  without

being  oppressed and without being dragged into  motor

cars,  on  the  candidate whom he wants  and  whom  he

thinks  will  serve  him best.  Let  us  have  a  calm

appraisal on that day and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>



do  not  let  us  have all the hurly-burly,  rough-and-tumble activities on election day as we have had during

the previous years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these grounds, Sir, I support compulsory voting.



<br><br>10.50 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

several  hon.  Members  of this Assembly  have  already

expressed  their views on the advantages of  compulsory

voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to support it by pointing out that

it  will allow many good and honest people, who do  not

have  much money, to stand for election since there  is

no   more   need   for  canvassers  on   polling   day.

Furthermore, now that Government has granted to Chinese



citizens and others who have stayed here for more  than

eight years the right to vote, they must do so if  they

have  the  interest of the State at heart.  Previously,

parents  with  children  not  born  in  Singapore  were

considered aliens, no matter how long they resided here

and  they  had no right to vote. To get naturalisation,

they have had to spend a lot of money and they have had

to  go through a tedious procedure. Since we have given

them  the  easy method of being Singapore citizens,  we

want them to participate actively in the elections.



<br><br>10.52 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

participation  in  elections to the  Legislature  is  a

privilege of democracy. Every enlightened citizen of  a

democratic  country should know the kind of  government

he  wants. Merely going to the polling booth  does  not

solve the problem. He must also take a keen interest in

all  social and political matters. He must be  able  to

understand   the  various  policies  that   are   being

advocated  by politicians and Parties, and he  must  be

able  to  choose  the personalities  accordingly.  Just

getting  a person to the polling booth is not going  to

solve  the  problem. In fact, we will  be  deliberately

leaving the fate of the government of the country to be

decided    by   voters   who   are   indifferent    and

unenlightened.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in England - the home of parliamentary

government - the  machinery  of  elections  has  been  in

motion for the last 130 years without a break, and I am

going  to  quote  certain figures from  a  very  keenly

contested election, Sir, I am quoting from page 329  of

Whitaker's Almanack. These figures I am quoting are for

one  whole constituency. I have heard the hon. Mr  Lim

Cher Kheng quoting the figures for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must not refer to

a Member by name.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am sorry, Sir. This hon. Member was

quoting-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is the Member for Changi.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am sorry, Sir. The Member for Changi

was  quoting  the  number  of  votes  which  particular

individuals managed to get, but that is not the correct

way  of going about it. Now I stood for the Farrer Park

Division. There were five candidates in all and,  if  I

remember  correctly, I got over 3,700 votes  out  of  a

total  of over 9,000 votes. Altogether there were  over

12,000 people registered as voters for the Farrer  Park

Division, and 40 per cent of these 12,000 voters  could

never  be  found  at  all. The Members  who  stood  for

elections will agree with me that at least from  35  to

40  per  cent of the voters could never be found.  They

were  either not found at their addresses or they  were

found  at  the  wrong addresses. So it  would  be  more

correct  to  say that the number of voters was  60  per

cent of those registered. In my Ward, 70 to 75 per cent

of the total number of voters went to the polls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quoting figures of the elections in England:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rt. Hon. Macmillan - out of 47,000 voters for the

constituency, 40,000 voted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rt. Hon. Gaitskell - out of 57,000 voters, 38,000 voted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rt. Hon. Attlee - out of 42,000 voters 34,000 voted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rt. Hon. Lennox-Boyd - out of 49,000 voters, 33,000

voted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rt. Hon. Lyttleton - out of 50,000 voters, 40,000 voted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Winston Churchill - out of 72,000 voters, 62,000

voted.



<br><br>When  I  quote  "Sir Winston Churchill - out  of  72,000

voters,  62,000  voted", it does not mean  that  62,000

people  voted for Sir Winston Churchill. It means  that

62,000  people of the whole constituency went to  vote.

So  this  works out to about 60 to 70 per cent  of  the

total number of voters who went to vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all admit that the election registers of

Singapore are absolutely inaccurate. You could  put  it

at  literally  60 per cent of the voters,  if  you  are

lucky  to get them. Of this 60 per cent of the  voters,

70  to 75 per cent went to vote. So I do not understand

how  it can be said, "Ah, the people are not coming  to

vote.  Therefore, we must have an Ordinance  to  compel

the people to come and vote."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in England, as I said, the election machinery

has  been  in  motion for the last 130  years,  but  in

Singapore the elections started only from 1948. How can

it  be said, "The people of Singapore are just going to

be  indifferent. They are not enlightened. They are not

intelligent enough to take part in the elections."?  So

when you take 60 per cent of those registered as voters

to  be the accurate figure due to the fact that 40  per

cent of those registered as voters are untraceable, the

response  of  the  voters  in  Singapore  is  excellent

comparing  our election results with those  of  England

where elections have been going on without a break  for

the last 130 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government has brought up this Bill with

the  purpose  of getting indifferent and  unenlightened

people  to come to vote. My point is that there  is  no

need for us to compel such people to come and vote.  If

you  say  that there are quite a number of  indifferent

voters  in  Singapore, there are also people  in  other

countries  who are equally indifferent and who  do  not

want  to  vote  and if you are going  to  compel  these

people to vote, there must be something wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I oppose the particular clause which compels the

people to vote.

<!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock(Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In reply, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir,

for  11  years have I sat in the Legislatures  of  this

country. During the course of my career in the  service

of  the  people  of  Singapore, I have  at  times  been

discouraged and saddened but never have I felt so  sick

as  I  felt yesterday. I would have thought that as  we

are getting into an era of self-government, politicians

in  Singapore  would  be more mature,  responsible  and

fully  aware of their duty in the service of the people

of  Singapore. But it would appear, Sir, that from  the

performance of the members of the People's Action Party

in  this Chamber yesterday, and as we get more and more

towards  self-government,  as  D-day  gets  nearer  and

nearer,  then is the time to become most irresponsible,

then is the time to practise the art of distortion as -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I ask the Chief Minister to

choose   his   words   carefully,  because   the   word

"distortion"   is   obviously   unparliamentary    with

reference to a Member of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I withdraw the word "distortion",

Sir, I  will try to find a more parliamentary word - the

art  of  misleading the public through  the  propaganda

machinery  of the Party by trying to inform the  public

that  they, and they alone, are the best Party to serve

them, and that all other Parties are not there to serve

them,  are  self-seeking  and  inept,  dishonest,   and

useless.  And  any move made by any man, any  political

Party  other than the People's Action Party, is a  move

aimed  at  the welfare and interests of the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, with your permission, Sir, to quote an

illustration of this irresponsibility and of  this  art

of presenting to the public something that is not true,

something that is politically advantageous to them  and

politically  disadvantageous to their opponents.  While

we were in this House last Thursday, Sir, I received  a

telephone call



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>



from  the  Chairman  of  the  Constitution  Exposition

Committee  informing me that the Committee  felt  that

they  did  not  consider  it  advisable  to  open  the

Exposition on the 21st of this month as fixed, because

the  ground was not firm, and because of the incessant

rain,  the  ground was so muddy that  it  would  cause

great  inconvenience to the public and that  it  would

deter the public from visiting the Exposition. Would I

be  good enough to agree to a postponement? When  that

question was posed to me, Sir, in all humility I  must

say that, with my experience in the political field, I

knew that this postponement would be caught hold of by

the   People's  Action  Party  to  turn  it  to  their

political  advantage. I thought to myself  whether  it

would  be  better for me to tell them, "Go ahead  with

the  opening. I do not care about the comforts of  the

public!"  and  thereby save the  Government  from  any

odious remarks from the members of the People's Action

Party.  But,  Sir, having been in the service  of  the

people  of  Singapore, having loved them, as  I  still

love  them  and think of their welfare more  than  the

welfare  of  my Party and myself and my Government,  I

felt  that it was right and proper that if the grounds

were  not  ready for them to attend the exhibition,  I

had  no  objection.  Therefore,  the  opening  of  the

Exposition was postponed and, as expected  by  me,  it

was  twisted  and  twisted in  such  a  way  that  the

Government   pavilions  were  not  ready,   that   the

Government  machinery  is  not  good,  that  only  the

P.A.P.,  which  is now running the City  Council,  can

deliver  the goods in time, can do what they say  they

would do at a certain date. Never have I been so sick!

And  never have I felt so much compassion for the hon.

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar then. Oh! how  corrupt  can

power be!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> True!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, then there is another art of

throwing back at the Government by saying that we were

delaying the District Council elections



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>



because  of  the disaster we met at the  City  Council

elections in 1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is true, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I happened to be away at the

time,  Sir,  when there was an electoral understanding

being discussed between the People's Action Party  and

the  Labour Front. But I must admit that I  was  aware

that there had been some such discussions going on. As

a   result   of  those  discussions,  there   was   an

understanding that certain seats should  be  contested

by  the People's Action Party and certain seats should

be contested by the Labour Front, and certain seats by

the  U.M.N.O./M.C.A. Alliance. And there was a clearer

understanding  that, in order to have a  victory  over

the  Liberal-Socialists, both sides should  help  each

other,  work  for  each other, so that  there  can  be

better  things to come. We, Sir, in the Labour  Front,

kept our bargain, and -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will sit down.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I can understand how

conscience   can  prick  sometimes,   and   I   really

sympathise  with  the hon. Member  if  his  conscience

pricks him.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> He has none!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, as I said, we kept our

bargain. Therefore the P.A.P.-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What about the Labour Front?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - came into the City Council. It

was mentioned, Sir, yesterday by the hon. Mr R. C. H.

Lim that the disaster was the result of, shall we say,



a  trick that was played on the Labour Front. So  they

won, and so we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>



lost. We lost but we were not dismayed. We lost but we

became wiser. We know that in political life, one must

be  quite prepared to accept political trickery!  Sir,

the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar then says:  it  is  the

result  of  our  defeat in the City Council  elections

that  we  delayed the District Council elections.  The

hon. Member will remember that it was he who tabled  a

motion  for the appointment of a Commission, resulting

in  the appointment of the Elias Commission. That  was

in   July  1957.  The  Commission  was  appointed   in

September  1957,  I  remember,  and  the  Report   was

submitted and tabled in this House in April 1958.  The

recommendations  of that Report received  commendation

even  from the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, although

I  can  still remember he did try to move a motion  to

censure  certain parts of the Report,  and  he  failed

miserably. It was because the recommendations  of  the

Elias  Commission were felt stupid that, in  the  best

interests  of clean elections, amendments  had  to  be

made to incorporate those recommendations, so that all

future elections can have a chance of being clean.  At

that  time,  Sir, there was the All-Party Constitution

delegation  to London; again to finalise the  drafting

of  the  Orders  in Council. So it  was  felt  by  the

Government, even with the knowledge of the hon. Member

for  Tanjong Pagar, that the quickest way to set about

implementing these recommendations was to introduce an

amending   Bill  to  the  Local  Government  Elections

Ordinance,  so  that  whatever  is  decided  by   this

Legislative  Assembly could be incorporated  into  the

amending  Bill  to  amend  the  Singapore  Legislative

Assembly  Elections Ordinance. The amending  Bill  was

introduced  for  First Reading a  few  days  ago,  and

whatever is decided on this Bill decides the  fate  of

that  amending Bill. The amending Bill was  introduced

in  July last year. After its Second Reading, a Select

Committee  was appointed. All Parties were represented

in Select Committee. Deliberations had been protracted

because  there had to be discussions on various  lines

of   approach   and  the  feasibility  of  introducing

compulsory voting. The Report of the Select  Committee

was presented to this Assembly on 29th November, 1958.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to the accusation that it is the

Government who seeks to introduce compulsory voting in

order  to  try  their luck at getting  back  into  the

Government again. I would like hon. Members to refresh

their minds that when the amending Bill was introduced

in  July  1958,  there  was no  clause  on  compulsory

voting. There was none. It was not in the Bill because

I felt, as I said yesterday, that as compulsory voting

a matter of great importance to all political Parties,

it  should  be discussed in Select Committee,  and  if

accepted, it could be introduced into the Bill.  Where

then   is   the   accusation   that   the   Government

deliberately introduced compulsory voting in order  to

stage  a  comeback? Sir, I myself did not  think  that

compulsory voting would help the Government because of

the experience I have gained over the past years - this

move, as in every other move of the Government, can be

twisted about in such a way as to cause the voters  of

Singapore  simply  to  cast  their  vote  against  the

Government out of spite! It could happen that way.  In

fact, it is a great danger to the Government to accept

compulsory  voting.  It  is  not  something  that   we

introduce  in order to put us in. I am sure  the  hon.

Member  for Tanjong Pagar and his Party, while  having

dreams  of  becoming the next Government of  Singapore

and  while most of their leaders have gone  out  on  a

witch-hunt, are already saying what they will  do  and

what they will not do to those that are with them  and

to  those that are not with them. I have felt that the

burden  of  Government is indeed a heavy one.  It  has

weighed heavily upon me, but I am not doing all I  can

through  the machinery of the Government  in  any  way

whatsoever to say that I am staging a comeback through

compulsory voting, and to tell the people, "Unless you

vote for us, watch out!" We do not do that, Sir,It is

up  to the people of Singapore. The fate of Singapore

is  in their hands. If they want us to serve, we  will

gladly serve. If they do not want us to serve, we will

take  it.  But we do not go out of our way to  try  to

corrupt  the minds of the public by matters  that  are

most irresponsible, by actions that are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>



not right. If we do get into the Government, we get  in

to  serve  the  people of Singapore. But  I  feel  that

through  the  activities, the actions,  the  words  and

deeds  of a different political Party which is  seeking

power  today - they are seeking it because they  want  to

say,  "We,  the P.A.P., are the Party. We are  here  to

serve  the  P.A.P. We are not here to serve  you!"  And

once  they get in, "My God! Watch out! I'll twist  your

necks if you do not wake up!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there are suggestions, or any kind of

activities   or  any  kind  of  legislation   that   is

introduced, but not by the P.A.P., therefore  they  are

not  right.  In  this way, they say that  because  this

amendment cannot be implemented during the lifetime  of

this Assembly, therefore, it is just-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> A waste of time!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - a waste of time. Whereas the

hon.  Member  himself knows, Sir, that the  purpose  of

amending  this  Bill  first,  instead  of  awaiting  an

amendment   to   the  Singapore  Legislative   Assembly

Elections  Ordinance, is just to put it on the  Statute

Book. I am sure the hon. Member does not mean, when  he

said it was a sheer waste of time, that he would prefer

to   have   no  amendments  in  this  Local  Government

Elections  Ordinance, and that the  recommendations  of

the  Elias Commission, which he praises so much, should

not  be introduced into this Local Government Elections

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, I really am sick, and will not talk any

more  about  this. I would rather talk about  something

that  is  more healthy, something that is more  in  the

interest and the welfare of the people of Singapore  by

replying  to certain of the points made by  leaders  of

Singapore, who know how to be responsible, whose  first

aim  is  to  serve  Singapore, and  not  the  political

machine. The hon. Member for Tiong Bahru has said -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is he one of the great leaders?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you, Sir. The hon. Member

for  Tiong Bahru brought up the difficulties  which  he

himself  encountered  in  his own  Electoral  Division,

Tiong Bahru. He said that people living on one side  of

the street have now been transferred to the Division of

Delta. Sir, I would like to inform him that this is the

division of Singapore into 51 electorates, as a  result

of  the  Delimitation Committee on which all  political

Parties are represented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think I could say much more on this

than  to  repeat again that in the case  of  compulsory

voting,  if  it is introduced, it will help to  correct

the  electoral  register inaccuracies  that  have  been

pointed out by the hon. Member for Farrer Park. We will

then  have  electoral  registers which  will  correctly

reflect  the  voting strength in every constituency.  I

said  in  my opening speech that the Hon. Minister  for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing and the  Assistant

Minister  for Education have received my permission  to

state  the  stand  of  their Party  against  compulsory

voting, and they have, therefore, left this sitting  in

order not to participate in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>CONTROL OF MANUFACTURE BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Select Committee's Report)</b></div>



<br><br>11.24 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion



standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the

Control  of Manufacture Bill, as contained in Sessional

Paper  No. L.A. 2 of 1959, be adopted, subject  to  the

recommittal of the Bill in respect of Clauses 5 and  12

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Bill was considered in Select

Committee, representations were heard from the Chambers

of   Commerce,  the  Manufacturers'  Association,   and

certain  individuals  connected with  manufacturing  in

Singapore. The main



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>



objections were jointly from the Chambers of Commerce,

and  the  grounds  for  the main  opposition  were  as

follows.  First,  they objected to  the  licensing  of

manufacture   of  almost  every  type,  because   they

considered  that that was too rigorous  a  requirement

and  created  a  state of uncertainty. Secondly,  they

considered  that the 15-year life of the  licence  was

too  short  and that there was no certainty  that  the

licences  would be renewed by a different  government.

They  also  considered that the power  vested  in  the

Minister  was  too excessive, and that there  were  no

checks  on  the Minister in the form of any  machinery

for  appeals.  They  considered  that  there  was   no

safeguard for those who were in the course of  setting

up  industrial projects. And finally some of them were

opposed  to  the  granting of monopolies  to  any  one

manufacturer.  These points, Sir, were  considered  by

the Government, and amendments were moved by me in the

Select  Committee  to  remedy these  main  grounds  of

opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended Bill, Sir, meets this opposition by the

following  methods: licensing has been  abolished  and

registration has been substituted. The 15-year  period

has  now been removed so that registration is  for  an

indefinite  period. Manufacture of every type  is  now

not  required  to  be  registered;  instead  only  the

manufacture of those items specified in the  Schedules

is  required  to be registered. A Registrar  has  been

provided  for  to administer the requirements  of  the

Ordinance,  and  an  appeal to the Minister  over  the

Registrar   has  been  provided  for.  Additions   and

variations  to  the Schedules are to be  made  by  the

Minister,  but an appeal to the Assembly  is  provided

for  in  the form of a provision whereby the  Assembly

can,  by  a  motion,  overrule the Minister.  Projects

already set up and are manufacturing cannot be refused

registration. Projects in the course of being  set  up

are  safeguarded by a provision that registration  for

such  projects cannot be refused except for  those  in

the Second Schedule. The granting of monopolies by the

Registrar will still be possible, but will now have to

be gazetted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>



so  that  the public are informed and they could  make

representations  to the Minister, and  therefore  this

granting  of  monopolies is subject to appeal  to  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the salient features of the amended Bill as

it  has  emerged  from the Select  Committee.  I  have

nothing further to add, Sir, and I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> I second the motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The remarks which I passed yesterday in

regard  to item 1 on the Order Paper apply with  equal

force  to  this  item. Briefly, if honourable  Members

wish  to  discuss or vote against any specific clauses

in this Bill in Committee, this is the time to move an

amendment  to the motion providing that the  Bill  may

also  be  recommitted  in  regard  to  those  specific

clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly recommitted to a Committee of the

whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 18, line 35, to leave out "and Second

Schedules" and insert "Schedule".



<br><br>Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to bring it into

line  with the amendment of which I have given  notice

earlier  in  regard  to clause 12 and  to  remove  the

protection   to  the  Second  Schedule.   A   parallel

amendment  is to be moved to leave out the  powers  of

the Minister over the Second Schedule and to allow the

Minister to have powers over the First Schedule only.

amendment in moving the earlier amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Now, Sir. Sir, I move, "That the

<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir. The Minister for Commerce and

Industry  now holds the record of having introduced  a

Bill  which  underwent the most drastic transformation

of  any  Bill in Select Committee. You will  remember,

Sir,  when he moved the Second Reading of this  Bill,

before  it was committed to Select Committee, that  he

considered  any  move  to  send  the  Bill  to  Select

Committee as an attempt to block and stymie him. Sir,

he  might  well  be right in guessing the  motives  of

those   who  wanted  to  send  this  Bill  to   Select

Committee,  but certainly by the amendments  which  he

has  accepted  and introduced into this Bill,  he  has

confessed that, in fact, his first thoughts  were  not

his best thoughts. He prided himself for having made a

speech on one occasion when he uttered famous words to

a  famous  gathering which included the  Secretary  of

State  for the United States of America without  first

having  committed it to paper. He regaled us with  the

privilege of hearing it after it had been committed to

paper. Sir, the experience which he has undergone as a

result  of this Bill should be a constant reminder  to

him  that  bright ideas should first be put on  paper.

They  should  be  carefully  considered  not  only  by

himself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>



but  by  all  his experts, and should receive  further

consideration   after  everybody   has   given   their

contributions as to what was right and  wrong  in  the

Bill.   He   would   then  have  saved   himself   the

embarrassment of having been the Minister who put in a

Bill  which received the most number of amendments  in

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, as it is now passed, still enables him to

pursue his pet topic, because I notice that cigarettes

and matches are put in a special Second Schedule. I do

not  want, Sir, to join in this speculation as to  the

profits  which  can be milched out  of  the  cigarette

industry,  but  I  can assure the  Minister  of  this:

nobody  is  going  to  make any  commitment  involving

millions of dollars on the basis of a Government whose

term  of  office  will last for approximately  another

eight weeks.



<br><br>11.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy that

I  am an Independent Member, and I am not seeking  any

political  capital in the coming elections this  year.

Therefore,  I  have no axe to grind and  do  not  care

whether this Bill is passed too early or too late, and

whether it is practicable or impracticable. Of course,

one  point we are in common agreement with is that  we

have to remind the Minister to explain to us how he is

going to make this Bill work, as the statement he  has

just made fails again to mention the importance of Pan

Malayan  economic  development. He  has  not  told  us

whether  he has any confidence that the implementation

of  this  Bill  can  cope with the further  industrial

development in the Federation or not, and whether this

Bill  will  not  mislead the Federation industry  into

believing that we are going to challenge the  industry

which is opening up in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to touch on a point which I suggested in

the  last  Budget  debate, and that is,  we  must  get

together -  Singapore and the Federation - and  sit  down

and  try to outline a plan as to what type of industry

we are opening up and what type of goods we are going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>



to  manufacture,  both  in  Singapore  and  Malaya.  The

interests  of both territories are inter-related  and  a

loss  suffered in Singapore will also mean an equal loss

to   the   Federation.  For  example,  if  our  Minister

advocates  the  manufacture of cigarettes in  Singapore,

and,  at the same time, Malaya also decide to open up  a

tobacco  factory,  then we would have,  in  a  territory

which  is  so  small - Singapore  and  Malaya - two  tobacco

factories,  subsidized and supported by the  Government.

To  me  this  seems  a waste of our  resources  and  our

strength.  If  we  can manufacture  cigarettes  and  the

Federation can manufacture matches, then we can  achieve

wonderful  results.  Sir, this is  the  principal  point

which  I wish the Minister to clarify more fully to  the

House. Any legislation which he introduces in connection

with  the encouragement of industrial expansion must  be

on  a Pan Malayan basis, because the interests of Malaya

and   Singapore  must  always  be  taken  as  a   whole,

especially in view of our common economic interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, this Bill deserves our

congratulations because it is a good Bill.  The  timing,

however,  I regret, is rather late. But we do hope  that

the  Minister for Commerce and Industry will be returned

to  office  in the next Government, so that he  will  be

able  to  see  the implementation of this  Bill  carried

through smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will definitely encourage local

industry.  It will definitely give an assurance  to  the

local  industry that they will have a certain  security,

and  they  will feel confident that the money they  have

invested here is going to be repaid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that we have many business houses

which  are  not keen to open up factories here.  Through

this  Bill,  we are going to force, indirectly,  foreign

companies to set up factories here. Otherwise, if we  go

along,  the  business  houses, especially  the  European

business houses, thinking that we must maintain our free

port   status,   just   could  not   care   less   about

manufacturing our own goods here. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>



will  quote  an example. I strongly oppose the  monopoly

which  the Shipping Conference has in Singapore. If  you

want to export copra to Europe, the freight is lower and

the  space  can always be reserved. But if you  want  to

export coconut oil, the freight is much higher, and from

time  to time they will say that there is no more  space

available for the export of coconut oil. That shows that

the  European  business houses have a control  over  our

local trade. Through this Bill we are going to force the

European  business houses to open up  factories  and  to

manufacture goods which they are used to handling here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is this. I am sure this Bill will serve

a  good  purpose in that it can regulate our  trade  and

investment. To me, industry and trade are twins. As  you

know,  Sir,  all the big ports in the world today,  like

London,  New York and Tokyo (the three biggest ports  in

the  world  today) are also known as the big  industrial

centres  of  their  country,  especially  New  York  and

Tokyo-although  we can consider Osaka as  an  industrial

centre too. But you cannot deny that Tokyo and New  York

produce  many manufactured goods in order that they  can

export  their  manufactured  products.  Therefore,   the

entrepot position of Singapore will never be jeopardized

by the boosting of industry here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heartily support this Bill. Before I sit down, I

wonder whether the Minister can clarify an article which

appeared  in  this morning's paper about  Mr  Hosgood's

criticism of the Minister's plan to open up factories to

manufacture cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jumabhoy, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. First, the Member for

Tanjong Pagar said that I would have saved a lot of

embarrassment to myself. There is no embarrassment to

myself. I am not embarrassed in the least. Why should I

be embarrassed, Sir, when I have moved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>



these amendments myself? He says that this will create a

record  for  a Bill that has undergone the most  drastic

transformation. No thanks to the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar. Out of nine meetings of the Select Committee,  he

attended  only one meeting. The transformation that  the

Bill has undergone is entirely voluntary on my part.  It

still  fits  in  with the policy that I  laid  down  and

announced in the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will see that the power of the Minister

to  add or vary to the First Schedule remains intact. It

is   immaterial  whether  the  Bill  should  be  as   it

originally was which said that everyone has got to apply

to  the  Minister before he starts a factory; or whether

the Bill is in this form, so that the Minister can still

make  anyone,  whom  he  feels he  wants  to  get  under

control,  apply  to  him by putting  that  item  on  the

Schedule. The point is that the power of the Minister is

still there, as far as the First Schedule is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always said that so long as I am allowed to

carry   out  the  policies  that  the  Government   have

formulated,  if  more safeguards can  be  put  into  the

legislation, I am not going to stand in the way. It is a

perfectly  democratic procedure, if you do it in  Select

Committee  or  even outside the Committee when  you  get

reasonable objections. It is perfectly democratic to try

and meet those objections by changing the wording in the

law  so  long as the basic requirement of the government

being able to carry out its policy remains intact. I can

well  understand, Sir, that such a procedure  would  not

appeal  to  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar  who  is  well

versed  in a dictatorial form of administration,  as  is

now  going on in the City Council. Therefore, if he puts

up  legislation, one may well expect he will not  change

it,  even  though it could very well be changed  without

affecting the powers that the legislation should have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changi has asked me to clarify the

reply which one big cigarette organisation has given to

my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>



clarification in the Assembly on the profit factor.

I do not know, Sir, what he wants me to clarify, but -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He wants to know whether an

investment of $500 will bring in a profit of $500!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I can say that this reply in

no way says that I am wrong in my calculation of the

profit factor. The only place where it says that I am

wrong is about the cheaper brands. Sir, I have taken

that into calculation and when I said in this House last

week that I had estimated the profit factor would be

about 60 per cent based on the sale of two million

cigarettes, I was, in fact, only estimating the profit

on the medium type of cigarettes and not on the lower

type. Singapore smokes 6 million cigarettes a day, out

of which 5 million are imported. I was estimating my

profit of 60 per cent only on the sale of 2 million, not

on the sale of 6 million cigarettes. Sir, I have

therefore taken this factor into consideration when I

said I estimate the profit factor would be 60 per cent

of the capital. [Laughter.] It is no use, Sir, the

Member for Tanjong Pagar laughing it off, because these

are hard facts. These are calculated figures which the

Member for Tanjong Pagar may try to belittle, but he

cannot get over them. I only wish the people of

Singapore know of these facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, Mr Hosgood said the Minister spoke

in  terms  of  150 million cigarettes monthly,  but  the

profit  depended upon whether every smoker would  accept

the  new  brand and that no cigarettes would be smuggled

into  Singapore. Sir, I said 150 million cigarettes  was

the number imported, but my profit factor was calculated

only on 60 million cigarettes a month-two million a day.

However,  on  the  question whether  every  smoker  will

accept  the  new brand, I also indicated in  this  House

that  probably  there would be no  reason  to  have  new

brands  because  we  are negotiating with  the  existing

trade to try and bring a big firm into partnership on  a

49  :  51 per cent basis, Singapore holding the  51  per

cent. If so, then most of the popular brands could be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>



manufactured here. Therefore, there is no question of

new brands being rammed down the throats of the people.

But if we come to the stage where, because nobody will

make any commitments before the election results are

known - the Member for Tanjong Pagar is sure about this,

and I do not know why he is so sure, but it is possible

that he may have got into contact with them and offered

them "instead of Jumabhoy 49 per cent, the P.A.P. will

give you 51 per cent - and complete control, if possible."

(that is why he is so sure he can stymie the progress of these negotiations) - if it comes to that, and if we are

forced to have a factory entirely capitalised by

Singapore capital, then the factory will have to make

new brands. I can assure this House, Sir, that even if

it comes to that, we can manufacture cigarettes as good

as the imported ones. There is no question that we

cannot. Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, practically

all Asian countries are manufacturing

cigarettes - cigarettes that are considered as good as

imported cigarettes. Japan and Vietnam also manufacture

cigarettes as good as the imported ones. The only thing

is that foreign interests will make a lot of propaganda

and probably they will be assisted in this by the ex-extreme Left - at present the extreme Right - the Member

for Tanjong Pagar in order to stymie the efforts of this

Government to benefit the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is curious, Sir, how out of the ashes of the

passionate  fires of class hatred aroused  in  1955  and

1956 by members of the People's Action Party, there  now

arises an extreme Right-wing personality-the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar, who  would go to outside  interest  and

undercut what is beneficial to Singapore



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot see how this is relevant

to the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, what is relevant is that it

is  in  reply to the Member for Tanjong Pagar who states

that  nobody will make any commitments, and I am  trying

to  find the reason why the Member for Tanjong Pagar  is

so sure in making such a statement. I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>



a strong suspicion that something along the lines I have

indicated is going on behind the scenes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, Sir, I will not give way.

Anyone, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I must answer this allegation



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Anyhow, Sir, I have finished with

my  reply  to the debate, and I have nothing further  to

add,  except that I still think that this Bill  will  be

useful  to  the  present Government and  to  any  future

government. I have never drafted any legislation with  a

view   to  making  political  propaganda  at  all.   The

legislation  that has been brought in  has  always  been

objective, with a view to helping Singapore as a  whole,

whichever government is in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move the Third Reading.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps I could remind the hon. Member

for  Tanjong Pagar of the Standing Order I did read out,

that is Standing Order 30, paragraph (4) of which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Member who has spoken to a question may again be

heard to offer explanation of some material part of  his

speech  which has been misunderstood; but he  shall  not

introduce new matter."



<br><br>If   the   hon.   Member  claims  that   he   has   been

misunderstood, then he will be allowed to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I have been misunderstood by

the Hon. Minister for Commerce and Industry. In fact,  I

have  been  deliberately misconstrued. What I  said  was

that nobody would make commitments involving millions of

dollars  on  the  basis  of  promises  held  out  by   a

Government  which can only honour them for eight  weeks.

If  the Minister chooses to read into that a plot to try



and down him,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>



then  he  must  be  becoming  a  paranoic.  He  fondly

believes that people would bother to spend their  time

to negate his efforts, when he has placed himself in a

position where his protestations are worthless.
