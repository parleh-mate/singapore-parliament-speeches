after  meeting President Suharto twice in the last  two  months,

what  is  his  latest  assessment of the economic  situation  in

<div align="center"><b>(Assistance)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed</b> asked the Prime Minister how

he sees the chances of his proposal to assist Indonesia in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



alleviating the problem of bank credits taking off and how  this

proposal will complement that initiated by Malaysia for  trading

in regional currencies.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I will answer Question  Nos.

1 to 5 together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Indonesia's economic prospects remain

cloudy.  According to official Indonesian estimates, the  number

of  unemployed  may rise to more than 8 million  in  1998.   The

drastic fall in the rupiah has pushed up the prices of food  and

basic necessities, making them unaffordable to many Indonesians.

This  has  triggered riots in towns in Java and  other  islands.

Provision shops have been destroyed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian government has taken many steps to stabilise

the situation.  It committed itself in January to implementing a

comprehensive  IMF  programme.   It  has  organised   Indonesian

companies  to  discuss with lenders how to resolve  the  private

sector  debt  problems, which the companies would  otherwise  be

unable  to  repay.  Unfortunately, confidence has not  returned,

and the exchange rate has not recovered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is now considering implementing a currency board

system  in the hope that it will stabilise the rupiah.  The  IMF

and  the World Bank have advised Indonesia that it does not  yet

have the preconditions to do so.  The markets are waiting to see

what Indonesia will decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMF, the World Bank, and many countries, including the

United  States,  Japan and Australia, have been  discussing  how

they  can  help  Indonesia  along  its  difficult  path  towards

economic  recovery, and alleviate the hardship and  social  pain

the crisis is causing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will continue to help Indonesia within the limits

of  our ability.  We are working with Indonesia's friends in the

region  and  worldwide.  Our US$5 billion loan arrangement  with

Indonesia  still stands.  The loan is structured  as  a  back-up

credit, to supplement the IMF programme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also helped to work out a guarantee scheme for

Indonesian  imports.   The  currency  crisis  in  Indonesia  has

substantially increased the risks of financing Indonesian trade.

Major  foreign banks will no longer provide trade financing  for

Indonesian   firms.   It  has  become  almost   impossible   for

Indonesian firms to import essential goods, or raw materials and

components for their export industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed guarantee facility is to give confidence to

foreign  banks to accept letters of credit of Indonesian  banks.

Under the scheme, central banks from a number of countries  will

jointly counter-guarantee the guarantees made by Bank Indonesia,

which  is Indonesia's Central Bank, on letters of credit  opened

by  trade  financing  banks.  The participating  countries  will

cover only sovereign risk, and not commercial risk.  It will  be

a  scheme  to assure the foreign banks that Bank Indonesia  will

honour its own guarantees.  All corporate risks will continue to

be  the  responsibility  of the foreign banks  themselves.   The

scheme will operate for at most two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will pledge up to US$2 billion towards the guarantee

facility.  This amount will come from its existing commitment of

US$5  billion  for  the  second tier  IMF  credit  facility  for

Indonesia.   No  additional funds need  to  be  committed.   Our

exposure under the counter-guarantee will be proportional to our

contribution to the facility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still in discussions on the scheme with several

countries.   It will proceed only if enough countries  agree  to

participate,  including the major G-7 countries.   The  IMF  and

World Bank have to support the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multi-lateral trade guarantee scheme is not related to

the  Malaysian  proposal to use regional currencies  to  finance

regional  trade.  The former, the trade guarantee scheme,  is  a

short-term  measure  to  overcome the unwillingness  of  foreign

banks  to  finance  trade  with  Indonesia.   The  latter,   the

Malaysian proposal, attempts to address the longer-term issue of

limiting the exposure of trade to currency fluctuations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events in Indonesia will have a profound impact on the

entire region.  They have been extensively reported and analysed

in  the media.  Ministers have made many speeches explaining the

situation  and  its  significance for  Singapore.   Members  who

follow   the  media  reports  will  have  a  good  overview   of

developments.   When  Members  raise  specific  questions,   the

Government will provide the House with the information it has.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister, in view  of

IMF's  opposition to Indonesia's plan for a currency  board  and

threats  of  withdrawal of IMF funding should Indonesia  proceed

with the plan, would the Singapore Government similarly withdraw

or  what  would  be  its position on the US$5  billion  stand-by

credit to Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the US$5 billion

stand-by  credit is a second line credit.  As has been explained

in  this House by Dr Hu, it stands behind the IMF commitment and

is conditional on Indonesia following an IMF programme.  It will

only  be  drawn down, first, if Bank Indonesia exhausts its  own

reserves  and,  second, if Indonesia then draws  upon  the  IMF-provided  line of credit, which is about US$20 billion,  and  if

that  is  still insufficient, then we are really third in  line.

So  it  is  conditional on the IMF programme and  therefore  the

situation envisaged by the Member is unlikely to arise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

sovereign  guarantee  of Indonesian exports  is  a  last  resort

guarantee.  How is this limited only to sovereign risks?   Maybe

the Deputy Prime Minister will like to explain a little more  on

how  this is limited to sovereign risks.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The scheme is like this. If an

Indonesian  company  wants to import something,  raw  materials,

food, it goes to an Indonesian bank and gets a letter of credit.

Normally,  that would be sufficient for it to do business.   But

under  present  circumstances, many foreign banks are  uncertain

about the credit status of Indonesian banks and will not accept

this  letter  of  credit.   So they take  this  letter  to  Bank

Indonesia, the Indonesian Central Bank, and get the Central Bank

to  reconfirm it.  That means the Central Bank will  answer  for

the letter of credit.  Under normal circumstances, that would be

sufficient.  Because it is Bank Indonesia guaranteeing it and if

Bank  Indonesia says, "No.  I can't pay", then it  is  sovereign

risk if the country is in default, which is a very grave matter.

But  under  present  circumstances, even with  Bank  Indonesia's

endorsement,  foreign banks are still reluctant  to  accept  the

letter of credit and therefore the trade cannot flow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal is for this trade financing scheme to counter-guarantee the Indonesian Central Bank's guarantee so that if

the  Indonesian Central Bank is unable to cover, then only  will

it fall back on the other central banks.   In other words, it is

a  back-up  line.   But  it  has not proceeded.   As  the  Prime

Minister  has said, it is still a concept because the  countries

who  might participate are waiting to see if Indonesia  proceeds

with  the  currency  board and whether there  will  still  be  a

central bank to counter-guarantee the credits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> May I ask the Deputy

Prime Minister to confirm whether there has actually been a draw

down  as  yet on the US$5 billion.  If not, what is the schedule

that he expects it to happen?  Also, would there be pressure  on

the  Government, in case this US$5 billion is fully drawn  down,

that   they   need  to  consider  further  financing   for   the

Indonesians?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The US$5 billion has not been drawn

down  at  all.  The arrangement is that when Indonesia needs  to

call  on  the  loan, they will give us notice and draw  down  in

reasonable  tranches, but they have not yet  done  so.   So  the

second question on what happens if it runs out is hypothetical.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask  the Deputy Prime Minister to elaborate, in the light  of

the uncertainty about the economic crisis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



in  Indonesia and the uncertainty related to the mechanism  that

will  be  applied, including the question of the currency  board

and  IMF  package,  whether  there is  continuing  dialogue  and

consultation  between the Indonesian authorities  and  Singapore

and,  if not, whether there is a need for a machinery to  ensure

that  there  is  proper  understanding  between  our  offer  and

conditions.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We are in close contact with the

Indonesian  government.  He can be sure that our  Ambassador  in

Jakarta  is  a  very  busy man right now.   But  the  Indonesian

government  has many preoccupations and the trade  guarantee  is

only one of them.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the

Deputy   Prime  Minister  not  just  one  question,  but   three

questions.  First of all, I am not quite clear as to whether  he

has  stated  what is the Singapore Government's  stand  on  this

proposal  to  set up a currency board.  What is the Government's

view on it?  Does it support the proposal or does it oppose such

a set-up of a currency board?  May we know from the Deputy Prime

Minister about that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, as I have understood it, this

guarantee  is  to  be given by the central banks  of  the  other

countries.   In  Singapore, who would  that  be  in  giving  the

guarantee?   Would  public funds be tied  up  in  any  guarantee

given?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, has any decision been taken, if other countries

participate  in  this  scheme, for  Singapore  to  give  such  a

guarantee?    I  know  there  is  a  Question  on  whether   the

President's approval will be sought.  May I know whether  it  is

the  intention  to  seek the approval of Parliament  before  any

guarantee is given?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of

whether Indonesia should or should not have a currency board  is

one which is for the Indonesian government to decide.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What are the Singapore Government's views?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We do not go round telling other

people how to run their country.  We are busy enough running our

own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has stated that there are certain

preconditions which a currency board requires in order to have a

good  chance  of  success.   These have  been  reported  in  the

newspapers.   You  must have adequate reserves,  there  must  be

confidence, your interest rates should not be too high  and  you

must  have  a strong banking system.  It is the state  of  these

preconditions  which I think has caused the  IMF  to  have  some

reservations  as to whether this is the right time  to  proceed.

But finally, these are sovereign judgments which the governments

have to make, and in this case, the government of Indonesia  has

to make.  So we will have to wait and see what they decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the guarantee by the central bank, in Singapore, the

Monetary Authority of Singapore is de facto the central bank and

if  we  participate, the guarantee will be given by the Monetary

Authority of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will these be public funds? Yes, of course, the Government

has no private funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we go to the President? That is the question which we

will answer because Mr Simon Tay has asked.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is Parliament's approval I am asking.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> If the law requires us, we will come

to Parliament.  If not, we will act within our powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the decision whether Singapore will give such a

guarantee if others participate, as I have explained, this is  a

matter  which  is still a concept, because the  others  are  now

waiting  to see how the currency board issue will develop,  what

the outcome will be, and whether there will be a central bank if

a  currency board is set up which will guarantee the letters  of

credit with whom we can deal.  If not, the scheme will be unable

to  proceed.   If  the  scheme can proceed and  other  countries

agree,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



and  since  we  have  suggested it, I  think  there  is  a  good

likelihood that we will participate as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, there have been efforts by

a  private  sector led consortium to restructure debts  owed  to

Singapore  banks by Indonesian companies.  I would like  to  ask

the  Deputy  Prime Minister what is the progress and  status  of

this  and whether it is timely for the Singapore Government  and

other governments in the region to play a more facilitating role

to help solve this problem.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> A private consortium to restructure

debts is a private consortium.  So it is up to them to work  out

an  arrangement which is acceptable to both the lenders and  the

borrowers  in order to turn over the debts and share the  burden

of  any losses.  I do not know what the latest status is.  I  do

not think they have resolved the problem yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government's role in this is limited, we hope the

countries whose institutions have lent large amounts of money to

Indonesia,  like  Japan,  or  the  countries  which  have  major

influence  on  the international financial system like  America,

will  exercise  their influence over their  bankers  to  play  a

constructive  role  and to get together to solve  this  problem,

instead  of  running  for the exit all  at  the  same  time  and

therefore  all  panicking  and getting  nothing  back.   We  can

encourage them to do it, but it is for them to decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that it is not easy for a debtor/creditor forum

to  succeed in the case of Indonesia compared to Korea.  Because

in  the case of Korea, a lot of the money are debts to the banks

and  the  banks are relatively few and it is easy for the Korean

government to know who they are dealing with and which are sound

and  which  are not sound, and where they can step in  and  give

assurances.   In the case of Indonesia, a lot of the  debts  are

non-bank debts and here the range is much greater and there is a

severe  moral hazard if the Indonesian government  comes  in  to

say,  "Well,  this  is  a private company.   It  borrows  money.

Events have turned out adversely and the government will bail it

out."   The Indonesian government has said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



that it will not do this and this makes it harder, and there are

so many more parties.  So I do not foresee a quick resolution to

the problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister

says  that Singapore does not tell other governments how to  run

their  own  business.   I  hope that it  is  followed  by  other

Ministers  as well.  But leaving that aside, I do not understand

why  if  Singapore  is  going to help  Indonesia,  what  is  the

sensitivity  or  the  reluctance to state Singapore's  views  on

something  that Indonesia is planning to do?  It is not  telling

them how to run their country, but to give them our advice.  May

we know what Singapore's advice is?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Deputy Prime Minister says if it is the law,

we  will  come to Parliament.  May I ask him: what is  the  law?

Because we had an opinion from the Attorney-General when I asked

a question about the loan.  So what is the law?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if what Mr Jeyaretnam

says  is  true,  we  would not need a Foreign Ministry;  only  a

newspaper  to  publish  our views.  There  are  many  dialogues,

discussions,  consultations between us  and  other  governments,

some  are  sensitive, some are top secret, some we  can  discuss

more openly, some we publish in communiques.  Not everything  is

put  out  in  a communique and we do not express all  our  views

publicly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the law, we have verified the position and we have

the powers under the MAS Act to give the guarantee and there  is

no requirement to come to Parliament.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, without naming the

countries, maybe the Deputy Prime Minister will like to indicate

how  many  countries are likely to participate in  this  counter

guarantee scheme?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think you will need

half a dozen or a dozen in order to make it worth while.  But as

I  have  stated, none have committed because all are waiting  to

see what will happen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am sorry to have to come back to this

question  about   parliamentary  approval.   The  Deputy   Prime

Minister  now  says  that  under the  present  law,  it  is  not

necessary.   But  does  he  not think that  it  runs  completely

counter  to the opinion of the Attorney-General which  was  read

out to this House by the Minister for Law on the question of the

loan?   We were told then that it was only for a guarantee  that

approval was needed.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not a lawyer, but

Article  144  pertains  to  the  giving  of  guarantee  by   the

Government.   In this case, the guarantee will be given  by  the

Monetary Authority of Singapore and Article 144 does not  apply.

A  different  Article  applies  and  it  does  not  require  the

President's approval.

<div align="center"><b>(Approval by President)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Prime Minister, as regards

the  proposal discussed with President Suharto of Indonesia  for

guarantees   to  facilitate  Indonesian  imports,  whether   the

Government intends to seek the approval of the President of  the

Republic of Singapore for any guarantee that Singapore may give.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained just

now,  the  trade guarantee facility will proceed only if  enough

countries agree to participate.  Provided they do so,  MAS  will

pledge   US$2  billion  towards  the  Indonesian  trade  finance

guarantee facility.  The fund will come from Singapore's earlier

US$5  billion contribution towards the IMF second-line financing

package for Indonesia, which so far has not been drawn upon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantees under the proposed facility will be given by

MAS.   MAS  has  the  authority to extend such guarantees  under

section 23(1)(k) of the MAS Act.  The contingent liability posed

by  the  guarantees will not draw on the reserves that  MAS  has

accumulated  prior to the current term of office  of  Government

which began on 25th January 1997.  This is because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



MAS  has,  during the term of office of government,  accumulated

reserves  well  in excess of the US$2 billion for the  guarantee

facility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there will not be a draw on past reserves, the

Attorney-General has advised that there is no need to  seek  the

President's  approval for the guarantee facility under  Articles

22B(6) and 22B(7) of the Constitution.

<div align="center"><b>LOANS EXTENDED BY LOCAL AND FOREIGN FINANCIAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INSTITUTIONS TO REGIONAL ECONOMIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Update)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister if he

will  give  the  latest update on loans extended  by  local  and

foreign financial institutions to regional economies, especially

Indonesia where a de facto moratorium on debt payment  has  been

announced.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 31st December

1997,  the  six  local banking groups had loans and  investments

amounting to $37.2 billion, which is 16% of their total  assets,

in  Malaysia,  Indonesia, Thailand, Korea and  the  Philippines.

This is $3.8 billion or 9.2% lower than it was a month earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-thirds of this exposure was in Malaysia, where

Singapore   banks  have  long  established  operations.    Their

exposure  to  Indonesia was $5.4 billion or 2.3% of their  total

assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total classified loans of the six local banking groups

to  these five countries amounted to 5.7% which is $2 billion of

their  loans  to these countries.  This figure is  based  on  an

assessment by the banks' auditors in mid-January, taking account

of  developments  up  to  that date.   It  is  higher  than  the

preliminary  estimate  of  3.2%  which  was   $1.2  billion  for

November  1997,  which  I provided in my previous  parliamentary

answer,  and it follows the comprehensive and updated review  of

the banks' portfolios by the auditors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total classified loans for the local banks, including

both  local  and overseas loans, were 2.6% of their  total  loan

portfolios.  My previous figure was 2%.   As a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



percentage  of  their  total  global  assets,  this  was   2.3%.

Perviously,  it  was  1.7%.  These figures  remain  well  within

comfortable limits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local banks, in consultation with the MAS, have decided

to  set  aside substantial provisions to cater to the  potential

risks  arising  from  their exposure to the regional  economies.

They   have  each  made  full  specific  provisions  for   their

classified  loans,  with  the  actual  provisions  depending  on

whether  the  loans are classified as sub-standard, doubtful  or

bad.  They provide 10% for unsecured sub-standard loans, 50% for

doubtful  loans and 100% for bad loans.  In addition, the  banks

have  also  made general provisions on the performing  loans  in

their  regional portfolios, over and above their normal  general

provisions.   These  exceptional general  provisions  are  of  a

precautionary nature, and may not eventually be used.  They will

provide a buffer against a possible further deterioration in the

quality of their regional loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, the six banking groups will set aside $1.6

billion  from  their  1997 earnings in  regional,  specific  and

general provisions.  If we include provisions for regional loans

that  they  had set aside in earlier years, they will  have  set

aside $2 billion.  Most of this, which is $1.8 billion, consists

of  provisions on loans to non-bank customers in the region,  or

about  8%  of such loans.  The provisions vary from  country  to

country,  depending on the risks assessed by the banks  in  each

case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these exceptional provisions for regional

risk,  the  six  local banking groups will report  significantly

lower  earnings  in 1997 compared to 1996.  In aggregate,  their

earnings  will  decline by about 30%, although some  banks  will

decline  by  more  than  others,  depending  on  their  regional

exposure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all six banks are financially sound. They have

strong  capital positions, exceeding 12% of their  risk-weighted

assets,  higher than most banks in other countries.   They  also

sit   on  substantial  reserves.   These  comprise  the  general

provisions they have accumulated in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



previous  years  as well as substantial assets valued  at  cost,

which remain well below current market values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS is satisfied with the provisions that the local

banks  are  setting  aside in 1997 as part  of  prudent  banking

practice.   By  recognising the potential  problems  early,  the

banks   will   be  well  prepared  to  cope  with  any   further

eventualities in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked about foreign financial

institutions.  Foreign banks book their loans to the  region  in

various  branches, not only in Singapore.  Their global exposure

to  the  regional countries, as disclosed by their head offices,

is more relevant than the exposure of their Singapore operations

alone.  Some foreign banks disclose their regional exposures  in

their annual reports.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime

Minister  has  given  the assurance that  all  local  banks  are

financially sound and they have all made generous provisions for

these loans.  The figures that he has given are actually for the

six  local  banks  in  total.  I was  wondering  whether  it  is

possible  for the Deputy Prime Minister to actually reveal,  not

so  much  in terms of absolute amounts but a relative amount  by

individual  banks in order not to disclose the identity  of  the

banks,  if  that is actually a concern, in order  to  allay  any

suspicion  that these banks are indeed, in terms of their  total

exposure, financially sound.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the banks are

financially sound, from the largest to the smallest.  They  will

all  face a difficult year but none of them are in danger.   The

banks  know that I am making this statement today and that  this

information  is coming out.  And they also know that  when  they

publish  their  annual reports, they will have to  give  further

elaboration on their individual exposures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are expecting to publish their annual reports and

their annual results probably early in March.

<div align="center"><b>COMPANIES AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC TURMOIL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assistance)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister, given

the  current economic turmoil in the region, how the  Government

will help companies which are badly affected by both a reduction

in  demand  and  a  tightening of bank credit, and  whether  the

Government will work with financial institutions to assist  such

companies.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore cannot

escape   the  regional  financial  turmoil  which  affects   our

neighbours.    The  Committee  on  Singapore's  Competitiveness,

chaired  by  Mr  Lee Yock Suan, has gathered feedback  from  our

businessmen on how they have been affected.  The impact has been

mixed,  depending  on the company's customers  and  whether  its

costs  and  revenues  are  denominated in  regional  currencies,

Singapore  dollar  or  US  dollar.  Those  with  export  markets

outside the region have not been too badly affected.  But  those

who export to the region for local consumption have been hit  by

the weaker demand and the problem of debt collection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tightening of bank credit is inevitable at a time of

uncertainty.   However, the MAS' figures show that overall  bank

lending  to non-bank entities is still growing, not contracting.

Loans  to  non-bank customers continued to increase,  from  $133

billion as at June 1997 to $139 billion as at September 1997  to

$143  billion as at December 1997, although there have been some

signs  that new loans are decreasing now.  Interbank rates  have

also  been  declining in recent weeks, indicating an  easing  of

liquidity.  After hitting a high of 14% in January, the  3-month

interbank rate is now back down to 6_%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that companies are concerned not just about the

interest  rate,  but also that banks may be pulling  back  loans

altogether.    It  is  difficult  and  inappropriate   for   the

Government  to  intervene in such cases.  These  are  commercial

lending decisions, which the banks themselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



have  to  take, because the banks, and not the Government,  will

bear the consequences of the decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Yock Suan addressed this issue in his speech on

Chinese  New  Year's  Day at the Singapore  Chinese  Chamber  of

Commerce and Industry.  I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One issue which companies have highlighted to us is the

tightening  of bank credit as a result of the currency  turmoil.

There  have been some calls for the Government to help companies

tide over this credit squeeze.  We are examining how to help the

economy and companies through this difficult period.  There  are

schemes  in  place such as the Local Enterprise Finance  Scheme,

where  the  Government joins the banks to extend credit to small

and  medium  local  enterprises, and  share  the  credit  risks.

Commercial  lending decisions by banks, both local and  foreign,

must  continue  to  be based on the banks' assessment  of  their

relationship and credit risks.  Banks will naturally take a long

term view of their customer relationships.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what the Government can do is to enhance the Local

Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS).  We are studying this and  the

Minister for Trade and Industry will be explaining this later in

his  reply  to Mr Tay Beng Chuan, if we have time to  reach  the

Question today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must take the regional economic slowdown in our stride.

The   Government   will   continue   to   invest   in   economic

infrastructure  to  build  up  our capabilities  and  productive

capacity.   Companies  too should use this opportunity  to  trim

costs,  restructure and upgrade productivity, so that  when  the

region  recovers and becomes more competitive, they will not  be

left behind.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister that  in  the  event  of  a  severe

liquidity crunch for companies, especially the smaller ones  and

those which do not qualify under the various assistance schemes,

would the Government be prepared to deviate from its usual  non-interference   philosophy   and  persuade  banks   to   consider

restructuring  or rolling over some of the short  term  domestic

loans?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Firstly, on a macro point of view, the

tightness  or  the  looseness of the monetary policy  cannot  be

determined by whether or not we want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



to help particular companies.  That is an overall parameter.  If

you  loosen the monetary policy, it impacts your exchange  rate.

You  cannot say you want your exchange rate to move one way  and

your monetary policy to move the other way.  Many countries have

got  into  trouble trying to do that.  So the tightness  of  the

monetary policy depends on market conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for leaning on banks, on individual cases, even in

difficult  circumstances, I think this is not wise.   The  banks

have  to  judge the risks because they have to bear  the  risks.

They  know  the  customers, they know  the  history,  they  have

criteria which are good borrowers, which are doubtful borrowers,

which  loans are good, which loans are doubtful, which are  sub-standard, which are loss.  What does the Government know,  which

the  bank does not, for us to be able to tell the bank, "No, you

do  this."  Are we saying, "You are wrong, this is a good  loan,

make it."  Or are we saying, "You are right.  This is a doubtful

loan,  but  make it anyway."  I think both put us in difficulty.

Because  if  we say it is a good loan, you may hit,  but  if  it

turns  out not to be a good loan, MAS will be the first  one  on

their back asking them to make provisions for the bad loan.   If

we  tell them that it is not very good, you make it anyway,  the

banks  too  have bottom lines to safeguard and have shareholders

to  answer to.  And as I have explained, their profits are going

to   be   down   30%  this  year.   Banks  are  not   charitable

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local banks and foreign banks will probably take different

attitudes towards their relationships.  For some foreign  banks,

it  is  known that they come in very quickly when the market  is

up,  and there is good business to be done.  But when the market

is  down  and  conditions look grimmer, they pull back,  perhaps

because of orders from the head office.  But I do not think  all

foreign  banks  are like that.  But it has been said  that  some

are.  Assuming that it is so, everybody knows this, it is not  a

new  phenomenon,  it  has happened, we  have  been  through  the

business cycle of up and down every so many years, the last time

in  1985,  anybody, who after knowing this, goes to a bank  like

that, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



get  a  favourable rate during good times, then  when  there  is

difficulty, he comes running back to a more tolerant  lender  to

say, "No, I have just been chopped,  please help me."  These are

calculations which you have to make.  I believe that  the  banks

which  have longer term stakes in the region, both foreign banks

and  of  course the local banks, will take longer term views  of

their relationship with their borrowers.  If you cut people  off

like that, you will gain a reputation which will not help you to

get customers in the next upturn.  So they have to decide, and I

think that they will decide with a  longer term point of view in

mind,  and if with that longer term point of view, they  decide,

"No,  this is not a loan which they can make", I think  we  will

have  to  abide by their decision. We are not in a  position  to

second guess that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have told the banks this. I have told the Government

officials  and  department  this.   We  will  help  within   our

capabilities.  We have the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme.   We

are looking to see how we can perhaps adjust the terms and widen

the  eligibility conditions.  That is feasible.  But if you tell

me,  "I  am  a  very deserving case, and a very big  sob  story,

please  help", I will first ask, "I will introduce  you  to  the

bank.  Come,  let us have a heart-to-heart talk."  If  it  works

out, that is good.  If not, that is the way business is done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are operating a system of free markets. I think the

Government   has  been  accused  more  often   of   being   more

interventionist   than   it   should   be,   rather   than   not

interventionist enough.  Now we are being asked why we  are  not

intervening sooner.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> In the extreme, what the Deputy Prime

Minister has described is actually being practised by some other

countries in Asia and would he say, in cases like this, this may

lead  to  undermining of the system and loss  of  confidence  by

foreign investors if Government intervenes too  much?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Yes, if we intervene and prop up

companies  which  should  not  be propped  up,  straightaway  it

affects our reputation and our standing, and everybody will know

this  is  a  different kind of system.  It is not  just  half  a

percentage  point, plus or minus, of the GDP.   But  is  this  a

system where the rules stand and you go for the free market  and

you  take the upside, and you lump the downsides?  Or is this  a

system where you go for the markets, you take the upside and  in

a  downside you run to me and my friends get help?   That  is  a

very  important distinction and a  key reason why in this period

Singapore has not been as badly affected as the other countries.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE DOLLAR AS COMMON TRADING CURRENCY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN ASEAN COUNTRIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  (i)  it  is in the long term interest of  Singapore  to

allow the Singapore dollar to serve as a common trading currency

in  ASEAN countries; (ii) he would consult expert as well as the

Chambers  of  Commerce  before  a  decision  is  taken  by   the

Government; and (iii) the Government is still of the  view  that

the Singapore dollar should not be internationalised.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not received

any  specific proposal to use the Singapore dollar as  a  common

trading  currency among the ASEAN countries.   If  and  when  we

learn  the  details  of such a proposal, we  will  evaluate  its

benefits and costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the first question is whether the Singapore dollar

has the pre-requisites for being used in this way.  Dr Augustine

Tan  published  a  lucid article in the Straits  Times  on  12th

February  1998,  in  which  he set out  quite  clearly  what  is

required for a currency to play this role.  First, the  size  of

the  economy  matters.  Second, there has to  be  a  substantial

amount  of the currency in international circulation.   On  both

counts,  the  Singapore  dollar does not  qualify.   It  is  not

without  reason  that  the US dollar is  the  most  widely  used

currency in international trade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary reason the Singapore dollar has not become

internationalised is that there is no market demand for it.  Our

policy  against the extension of credit in Singapore dollars  to

non-residents   could   not  by  itself   have   prevented   the

internationalisation  of the Singapore dollar  in  the  face  of

market demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic rationale for not encouraging the

internationalisation of the Singapore dollar remains valid.   If

the  Singapore  dollar is widely held and used  internationally,

our  influence over the exchange rate would diminish, making the

currency  more vulnerable in a speculative attack,  even  though

our  sound fundamentals make it unlikely that such attacks  will

eventually  succeed.   As a small and open  economy,  we  cannot

afford this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, within this framework, we are reviewing some of the

specific restrictions on the use of the Singapore dollar, with a

view to making adjustments that can help to further develop  the

financial  sector, particularly in the area of capital  markets.

In each case, we need to weigh the incremental risks to monetary

and  exchange rate management against the potential benefits  of

further liberalisation.  MAS is currently studying this issue as

part  of  its  review of policies affecting the  development  of

Singapore as a financial centre.

Minister  what  is his initial assessment on the recommendations

there  are  plans  by  the Government to open  up  the  domestic

banking sector to competition as part of the overall strategy to

strengthen Singapore's financial sector.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government responded

yesterday  to  the report by the Sub-Committee  on  Finance  and

Banking.  It has accepted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



nearly  all the recommendations, except for those involving  tax

issues, which it will study further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are studying our policy towards the domestic banking

sector  as  part of our overall review of the financial  sector.

We  have not yet reached any firm conclusions.  But whatever our

policy,  the  inevitable  trend  is  towards  a  more  open  and

competitive  business  environment.  The forces  of  information

technology   and   globalisation   will   increasingly    breach

geographical  and  regulatory barriers. Worldwide,  institutions

are  merging  and  restructuring.  Traditional barriers  between

markets and products are breaking down.  Competition is intense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic banks are important contributors to the stability of

our  financial system. We want them to remain strong players  as

the  domestic  market becomes more competitive.  The  Government

will support them through this challenging transition, but it is

up  to  the  banks to upgrade themselves in order to thrive   in

this new environment.

significant impact on our cost of living.  Consumer prices  rose

by  a  modest  2.3%  in the second half of 1997.   Although  the

Singapore dollar has depreciated against the US dollar,  it  has

strengthened  against  the  regional currencies.   Overall,  the

Singapore  dollar  has remained relatively stable  on  a  trade-weighted basis.  This has kept imported inflation at bay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestically, inflationary pressures are also low as a result

of  slower economic activity and keener retail competition.  The

rate  of consumer price inflation in 1998 is expected to  remain

low.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry what is the magnitude of non-bank private sector credit

which  has been extended to countries in the region affected  by

the   financial   crisis,  namely,  Indonesia,   Malaysia,   the

Philippines and Thailand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not have such

figures as companies are not required to declare them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 60% of Singapore's exports to the region are by MNCs

exporting parts and components to meet final demand outside  the

region.   As  these  are largely intra-company  transactions  or

sales to other MNCs, they do not face problems of non-payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies that sell to the region for local

consumption  are facing some credit collection problems  due  to

the  current  liquidity shortage.  Company feedback gathered  by

TDB suggests that the companies are tackling the problem through

various means.  Some have extended the credit period.  Some were

able  to  convert  these  debts  to  equity;  while  others  are

exploring counter-trade options.  This problem does not  pose  a

significant risk to the Singapore economy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> The Minister mentioned that Singapore

companies  that trade in the region probably face problems.   Do

we  have  an  indication as to the extent of the  problems  that

these Singapore companies face?  Is it not possible to have some

statistical  magnitude of this kind of problem so that  we  know

what is the extent of the problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> To give an indication, Singapore's

exports  to  the  four  ASEAN  countries,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,

Thailand  and  the  Philippines,  last  year  amounted  to  S$69

billion.  40% of this is by locals.  That amounts to about  S$28

billion for the whole year.  So for one month it would be  about

S$2  billion.  So you can estimate.  It is hard to say how  much

of this is going to be lost.  But it is of that order of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



magnitude, in terms of credit extended.  That is why I said this

is  not a significant risk to the economy.  Another indicator is

that  Singapore loans to the four ASEAN countries (this includes

loans   by  MNCs  which  are  in  Singapore  lending  to   their

subsidiaries  in  the  four ASEAN countries)  amounted  to  $3.5

billion.  This is probably over a longer term period.   So  some

of it may be due; others may be having problems.  But we have no

figures to show.  On the whole, I think we are all right.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  how  the  Government can assist companies  which  have

invested   heavily   in   the  region   in   response   to   the

regionalisation  drive and which are now  facing  cash  flow  or

implementation  problems in their regional projects  because  of

the current financial turmoil.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some Singapore

companies  with regional investments are adversely  affected  by

the  regional  financial crisis.  The problems are difficult  to

overcome  as they are dependent on how the banking and financial

systems of the host countries are sorted out.  Nevertheless,  my

Ministry will try to assist companies, where feasible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to support eligible companies with

financing  under the Regionalisation Finance Scheme.   It  helps

local  companies by providing low cost loans for  investment  in

fixed assets, such as buildings and equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) is designed

primarily for the Singapore operations of local small and medium-sized  enterprises.  Depending on a company's regional  project,

its financing needs and associated risks, it may be feasible  to

extend  some  financial  assistance  under  LEFS.   The  lending

decisions  are  made  by  the  participating  banks   with   the

Government  sharing part of the risk.  My Ministry is  examining

the LEFS to broaden its scope.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to monitor the regional developments

closely   and  review  what  else  can  and  should   be   done.

Ultimately,  companies  have  to accept  that  there  are  risks

involved in any investment decision, whether locally or abroad.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, when the Government

encouraged companies to go regional, at that point in  time  did

it  foresee the possible problems that we face today?  Secondly,

when  these  companies were encouraged by the Government  to  go

regional, were they forewarned of the possible tighter credit in

the face of a situation like this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The answer to the first question is

obviously no.  I think nobody foresaw it, not even the big banks

which  lent so much money and are now facing problems collecting

their  loans.   As  to the second part, we have told  companies,

"Please  go  regional.  It is necessary for us to  make  use  of

resources  in the region and to tap the markets", and many  have

done  so, but they must go in with their eyes open and they have

to use their own resources.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Even if the companies went in with

their  eyes open, and the Government claims to have a helicopter

view  and  could foresee what is going to happen today  when  it

encouraged  companies  to  go regional,  I  wonder  whether  the

Government   would  provide  a  more  sympathetic  solution   to

companies  which  have  already gone  into  the  regionalisation

process.  They are caught in the currency turmoil, their  credit

is tighter, and the whole investment could just drain off.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The Government is very sympathetic to

these companies.  But when it comes to public funds, we have  to

be  very  careful.   So there is no question about  bailing  out

companies  that are not feasible.  But where it is feasible,  we

will see where we can help out.  As explained, we are looking at

the LEFS to see whether we can broaden the scheme.  For example,

if  they  have  good collateral here, maybe the  banks  will  be

willing to lend them the money with the Government sharing  part

of  the  risk,  and they themselves can then lend to  their  own

subsidiaries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance how

the  Government  will contain the size of the public  sector  to

free  resources  for  the private sector to  stimulate  economic

growth in the face of the regional financial turmoil.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government has a long  standing  policy  of

keeping  the  public  sector lean and trim.   This  is  to  free

manpower  and  financial resources for  the  private  sector  to

function as the engine of economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have contained the size of the public

sector   by  restraining  operating  expenditure  (by  operating

expenditure  I  mean  recurrent  expenditure  which  is   mostly

manpower  cost) to grow no faster than GDP growth, thus  keeping

operating expenditure constant as a share of GDP.  This has been

achieved  by  stringent  control on cost  increases,  with  some

allowance  for  heavier  workload,  new  programmes  and  better

quality of services to meet public demands and expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At around 10% of GDP, our operating expenditure is

considerably lower than that of most developed countries.   This

is  because Government expenditure is focused on providing  only

public  goods and services, such as security, basic  healthcare,

public housing, national infrastructure and education.  We  have

also  steered  clear  of  many forms of  state  welfarism,  thus

avoiding  large scale public assistance programmes  which  would

have  drained heavily on our coffers.  Instead, our approach  is

one of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



many  helping hands with co-funding from Government  and  public

donations,  and services rendered by volunteers and  members  of

<div align="center"><b>(Status of review)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Minister for Law what is the

status  of  the  review  to make en bloc  sales  for  flats  and

condominiums easier for owners.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee)</b>

<b>(for the Minister for Law):</b> Sir, the Government has completed

its   review.   As  I  indicated  in  November  last  year,  the

requirement that all the owners must agree will be removed.  The

main  features of the new scheme to facilitate en bloc sales  in

strata developments will be as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the required percentage of majority agreement will

depend  on  the  age of the development.  If the development  is

less  than  10 years old, there must be at least 90%  agreement;

for  developments 10 years old or more, there must be  at  least

80% agreement.  Both figures are based on share values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this majority consent will apply only to strata

developments  with more than 10 strata units.  For  developments

with  10  or  fewer units, there will be no change and  all  the

owners must agree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, certain checks and safeguards will be introduced.

For  example,  the majority owners must advertise in  the  local

press  their intention to sell.  The notice to be served on  all

the  owners  must  enclose  a copy  of  the  sale  and  purchase

agreement  and  the  buyer's statutory declaration  stating  his

relationship, if any, to any of the owners in that development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Strata Titles Board will be given the role of

hearing appeals from minority owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main task of the Strata Titles Board will be to satisfy

itself  that  the  proposed en bloc sale is a  bona  fide  `arms

length'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



transaction,  to  ascertain,  for  example,  that  there  is  no

coercion  of the owners or collusion between buyer and  majority

owners.  In this regard, the Board can take into account factors

such  as the sale price, relationship between buyer and majority

owners,  and  distribution of the sale proceeds.  If  necessary,

the  Board  can  call for an independent valuation  report.   If

there  are  non-price issues, the Board will help to  have  them

resolved through mediation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the broad outline of the new scheme. The

details,  including the procedures to be followed, will  be  set

out  in  the amendments to the legislation which are  now  being

prepared.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask the Minister, in view of the interest shown by the public

in  the  press, whether he would consider sending  the  proposed

Bill to a Select Committee when the time arises.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Let us see how the Bill shapes

up  first.   We are working on the details.  We will  take  into

consideration the suggestion by the Member at the time when  the

Bill  is finalised by the Government.  We will then look at  the

magnitude of the Bill and decide whether or not to send it to  a

Select Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta-Ayer Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I

remember, the objective of this exercise is to prevent very  old

developments from degenerating into slums.  So if  you  put  the

age  as  10 years, does he not think that it is a bit too early?

Because many of the developments below 10 years old are still in

very  good  condition.  Does he not think that maybe  20  to  30

years  would  be a much better age, before they are  subject  to

this law?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, essentially, the decision

now  is  left  to the owners.  Of course, partly it  is  in  the

national  interest, if older developments are  rejuvenated,  and

enhanced plot ratios are realised.  But if the owners decide  in

a development that is less than 10 years old, they must get 90%.

If they decide to come together for community living, and after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



all,   strata   title  living  is  community  living,   and   if

circumstances change, and a significant majority, 90% agree that

they  should  all sell to a developer who will then develop  the

property, then I think we should make it possible for them to do

so.  So we have taken age as this criterion: below 10 years,  10

years and above, because we feel that, as rightly pointed out by

Mr  Lew, for older developments you may have more owners who are

interested in selling.  If we peg the percentage for these older

developments too high and if it is not attained, then  a  larger

group of owners' interest will be thwarted.  That is why we have

decided  that age will be the criterion and 10 years will  be  a

reasonable time-frame for this distinction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the

Minister  of State how many sales have been aborted  because  of

such  a  small minority?  In other words, how many  sales  would

otherwise have gone through if the new law was already in place?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> We really cannot say. We do not

have  a  fix on that.  But certainly we can look at the  reports

that come from the ground, in the press, and I think many of our

Members  here would also have contacts with people who have  had

sales  which  have been thwarted because one or two owners  have

refused to go along, and this can be big developments.   So  the

current law really is a situation where there is tyranny of  the

minority and for whatever reason, if one or two owners hold out,

then  the  rest of the owners' wishes to redevelop the  property

cannot be realised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Minister of State, of these so-called instances which people have heard of, what are the

reasons  which  the  property owners,  minority  interest,  have

refused to sell for commercial reasons?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think the reasons for

holding out are very variable.  Some could be because of  price,

some could be because they have recently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



renovated their flats, and therefore they feel they should get a

higher  price.   Some might have bought the flat more  recently,

compared to the others who bought a long time ago, and therefore

feel  that,  based on the formula of distributing the  proceeds,

they ought to get a higher price.  Some may just want to live in

that  area for a longer time.  Some who are retirees may be very

used to living in the area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach is that we want to provide a mechanism so that

these concerns can be addressed.  But the way to address it,  at

least  the  best way that we feel we should take as an approach,

is that the Strata Titles Board will look at objective criteria.

Basically it will look at factors such as the sale price and the

relationship of the parties.  I think that is important  because

we  want  to prevent collusion and therefore ganging up  by  the

majority  on  the  minority  who may  be  in  cahoots  with  the

developer,  and also this question of distribution of  proceeds.

These  factors  will be taken into consideration by  the  Strata

Titles  Board in deciding whether or not to intervene.   But  if

there  should  be non-price factors, other points  that  I  have

mentioned -

<div align="center"><b>HOLIDAYS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact the Holidays

Act   (Chapter  126)  to,  firstly,  make  clear  that  official

executive and judicial acts done and contracts entered  into  on

Sundays  or  public  holidays, are not  invalid;  and  secondly,

validate  all  such past acts or contracts done on  Sundays  and

public holidays.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Dies Non</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present Holidays Act poses some ambiguity in

connection with the doing of official acts on Sundays and public

holidays.  Section 3 of the present Act declares all Sundays and

public holidays as dies non, an old Latin expression meaning non-days  in law.  The present Act is substantially the same as  the

Holidays  Ordinance  1876.   The  modern  application  of   this

antiquated concept is unclear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legal effect of the present Act should be put

beyond  doubt.  The Government must be able to function  at  all

times.   Hence,  official acts done even on a Sunday  or  public

holiday  ought to be valid.  Our civil service is  committed  to

greater responsiveness to the needs of the public.  This will be

frustrated if, in law, no official acts can be validly done on a

Sunday  or  public  holiday,  even  if  public  departments  are

prepared to open on these days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is constitutionally a secular state. To most

Singaporeans  today,  Sundays and public holidays  are  days  in

which they can rest and relax without being compelled to work if

they  do  not want to.  They should not be days in which  people

are  prevented by law from working or from entering into legally

binding  transactions if they want to.  Many  local  businesses,

especially   those  in  the  tourist  and  food   and   beverage

industries,  require  their offices and  shops  to  be  open  on

Sundays and public holidays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill therefore repeals the Holidays Act and re-enacts the law governing public holidays but without declaring

Sundays  and  public holidays as dies non.  The new law  instead

makes  clear  that  nothing done on a Sunday or  public  holiday

shall be invalid by reason only that it is done on such a day.



<br><br><i>Previous official acts and contracts</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid any doubts and provide certainty, a validating

provision makes clear that past official acts and contracts done

on a Sunday or public holiday are not invalid.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Employer-employee arrangements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new law will not affect the provisions of the

Employment Act relating to shift work and rest days of  workers.

Employers and employees will still be free to agree to  holidays

in  substitution of any public holiday declared  under  the  new

law.



<br><br><i>Consequential amendments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also makes consequential amendments to a few

other  written  laws  (namely, the Bills of  Exchange  Act,  the

Criminal  Procedure Code, the Parliamentary Elections  Act,  the

Presidential Elections Act, the Subordinate Courts Act  and  the

Supreme Court of Judicature Act) to bring the provisions in line

with  the  new law and remove provisions made redundant  by  the

change.  In particular, amendments to the Subordinate Courts Act

and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act will establish a uniform

legislative  scheme allowing the conduct of court  and  Registry

business on Sundays and public holidays when urgent matters have

to  be  dealt with or the Chief Justice or Senior District Judge

so directs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that this Bill will remove

an anachronism in our law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have only got a question

now  for  the  Minister  of State.  He says  there  will  be  an

amendment  to  the  Supreme  Court of  Judicature  Act  and  the

Subordinate Courts Act to permit the courts, I take it that they

will be open, to transact any business.  But what I wish to know

from the Minister of State is: will this Bill affect the present

provisions as to the filing of documents in court and  the  time

prescribed  under  these rules?  As the Minister  of  State  may

probably  be  aware that, under the rules, where the  number  of

days  is below a certain number, then the dies non do not count.

May I know whether it is intended to do away with all that now?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I have a question

first.  It would appear that with this Bill, Sunday is no longer

a  sacred  day, ie, just like any other day.  What about  people

who  continue  their  building  construction  on  Sundays  in  a

residential neighbourhood?  This can be very disturbing  to  the

people  around there.  Is there any provision to prevent  people

from   continuing  in  the  construction  of  their  houses   in

residential areas on Sundays?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my party recently suggested that an additional day be

observed as a public holiday to remind Singaporeans that we  are

a  multi-cultural society.  A multi-cultural society means  that

we   are   a  multi-racial,  multi-lingual  and  multi-religious

society.  Racial harmony is important in Singapore.  Yet, we  do

not  have  a  public  holiday  to remind  Singaporeans  of  this

important  aspect  in our way of life.  We should  have  such  a

public  holiday.  This new public holiday could be called Multi-racial  Day  or Multi-cultural Day.  I think Multi-cultural  Day

would be a suitable name.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can afford to have an additional day for a public

holiday.   At the moment, we have 11 days set aside as statutory

public  holidays.  Should we have one more, the number of public

holidays would be 12 a year.  This is not too many when compared

to the public holidays of other countries.  I have looked up the

number  of public holidays of 18 countries.  Australia  has  the

lowest  number  of public holidays, at eight days  a  year,  and

South  Korea  has the highest, at 20 days a year.   The  average

number of public holidays per year of those 18 countries  is  13

days.  Should we increase the number of public holidays to 12  a

year, we would still have less number of public holidays a  year

than  the  average  number  of  public  holidays  in  those   18

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this suggestion is taken up, the additional public

holiday  should be fixed in a month in the latter  half  of  the

year, because almost all our present public holidays are bunched

up  in the first half of the year.  There are no public holidays

in  the months of July, September, or November.  We could fix  a

new public holiday in one of those months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister would give this proposal his

serious  consideration and amend the Bill to  include  a  Multi-cultural Day as a public holiday.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me reply to Mr

Jeyaretnam.   I have checked this matter with the  courts.   The

Bill  will not change the current practice of the courts,  which

will remain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the suggestion by Mr Chiam to have

another  holiday  in Singapore.  I think all  of  us  want  more

holidays.   But  the  point is whether we  ought  to  have  more

holidays.  The specific suggestion he gives is to have a  Multi-cultural  or Multi-racial Day.  But really the point  is  multi-culturalism and racialism as concepts should be practised  every

day  of the year by all Singaporeans, and not to have a day when

we  say,  "Let  us  be reminded that we should  practise  racial

tolerance or appreciation of each other's culture."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of course is, in Singapore, over time, even

for  different festivals, whether it is Lunar New Year  or  Hari

Raya or even Deepavali, Singaporeans of all races now visit  one

another,  greet  one another and, in that sense,  reinforce  the

concepts  that  Mr  Chiam,  and I think  rightly  so,  says  are

important.   And indeed, if you want to look at  one  day  which

would draw all Singaporeans together, that must be National  Day

which reminds us that we are one people, one nation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have looked through all the

holidays  and  you  will notice that most of  the  holidays  are

religious-biased, or in terms of National Day, it  is  specially

set aside for patriotism, especially for the country.  We do not

have  any  one  day  which is for the people  themselves  to  be

reminded that we are multi-cultural.  I think this is important.

In  Japan, they have got its Cultural Day.  The reason why  they

want  to  have  a Cultural Day is to emphasise that  culture  is

important in the country.  I think the Minister, instead of just

brushing it off, should give his serious consideration.  I  hope

he will say that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Anyway, Sir, this is not under

the  Ministry of Law.  The number of public holidays is actually

determined by the Ministry of Labour.  But in any case, I  think

the last time this matter was brought up, Members also suggested

other holidays, such as a Women's Day.  So where do you draw the

line?   If  you  want non-religious festivals also  to  be  made

public holidays, of course besides National Day which is now the

one  event that straddles all religions and festivities, I think

we  should  be  careful.  We can practise it.  I think  that  is

important.  But to have a public holiday to remind us  about  so

many  things in Singapore, such as a Save Water Day, I think  we

should be careful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].

read a Third time and passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>COPYRIGHT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going into the provisions which are fairly

complicated and technical in some respects, let me state at  the

outset  that  the  protection  and enforcement  of  intellectual

property  rights, including copyright, will become  increasingly

important  as the Singapore economy matures.  With  advances  in

information  technology, the global economy  is  rapidly  moving

from   an   industrial-based   to  a  knowledge-based   society.

Intellectual  capital, not merely physical assets  or  financial

capital, will be the key factor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore responds to this, developing a strong and

effective  system  for protecting intellectual  property  rights

becomes  more important.  Where a company's value is based  less

on  its  factories, plant and equipment but more  on  ideas  and

technical innovations,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



effective  protection of its intellectual property  will  become

increasingly central to its strategic plans and operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that Singapore stays ahead of the competition for

high-value,  knowledge-intensive industries, a  good  system  of

protection  for  intellectual  property  rights  is   not   only

desirable  but  in  fact necessary.  Knowledge-based  industries

will  be  attracted to invest in Singapore if they are confident

that  their  intellectual  property  will  be  given  sufficient

protection here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good IPR infrastructure is also important to the success

of  our  own home-grown knowledge-based industries.  We have  to

bear in mind that increasingly it will be our inventors who will

want  patent protection and our artists, writers, etc, who  will

want copyright protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to an independent survey by PERC (Political &

Economic  Risk Consultancy) in October last year, Singapore  has

the  best intellectual property rights protection in Asia.   The

Government, however, recognises that technological advances  and

changing  circumstances continually challenge us  to  strengthen

and improve our IPR regime, and we are committed to doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will amend the Copyright Act to improve the

level  of protection for copyright in Singapore and to implement

Singapore's  obligations  under the World  Trade  Organisation's

Agreement  on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property  or

what is known as the TRIPS Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under TRIPS, all WTO members, except the least developed

countries,  shall  establish  common  standards  of  protection,

remedies  and enforcement for all areas of intellectual property

rights  by  the  end  of  next year.   Singapore  has,  however,

committed   itself  in  APEC  to  bring  the  time   frame   for

implementation forward to the end of this year, one  year  ahead

of schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Government inter-Ministry committee has been reviewing

our  legislation on intellectual property rights to give  effect

to our obligations under TRIPS.  Work on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



patents  was completed first and a new Patents Act has  been  in

effect since the beginning of 1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amending Bill and the related Medicines (Amendment)

Bill  are  the  result  of  the  review  of  copyright  and  the

protection of test data which was completed at the end  of  last

year  and  also reflect the desire to further enhance  copyright

protection.    Work  on  other  legislation  in   trade   marks,

industrial designs and integrated circuits is also under way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this Bill, we have also taken the opportunity to

make  changes, firstly, to enable us to accede to the 1971 Berne

Convention  for  the Protection of Literary and Artistic  Works;

and,  secondly, to enhance the enforcement mechanism  under  the

Act.



<br><br><i>TRIPS Agreement Amendments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first deal with the provisions relating to the

TRIPS  Agreement.   These can be broadly classified  as  changes

which relate to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) rental rights;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) ephemeral copies of recordings and works;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) performers' rights

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) remedies; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) border enforcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take up rental rights, the TRIPS Agreement requires that

in  the  case  of  computer programmes and sound  recordings,  a

copyright  owner's rights shall include the right  to  rent  the

programmes and recordings.  This is reflected in clauses 3 and 4

of  the Bill which introduce a new section 25A and amend section

26  of the existing Act, as well as clause 17 which repeals  and

re-enacts section 82.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as for ephemeral copies of recordings and works, the

defences  of reproducing literary, dramatic, musical or artistic

works  or sound recording for the purposes of broadcasting  have

been  narrowed  by the introduction of restrictions  so  that  a

broadcasting organisation may only keep copies made for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



purpose  of  its  broadcast, in general, for  a  period  of  six

months.   This is achieved by clauses 7, 15 and 19  which  amend

sections 43, 68 and 107 of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for performers' rights, clause 35 of the Bill inserts a

new  Part XII of the Act which confers upon performers  of  life

performances of drama, musical and literary works, dances,  etc,

new  rights  in  relation  to these  live  performances.   These

include   the   right  to  prevent  unauthorised  direct   sound

recordings, the reproduction of such recordings, live broadcasts

and communication to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remedies for infringement of copyright set out in the

existing   Act   are   generally   comprehensive.     But    the

implementation of TRIPS has required us to expand  them  in  one

area.  Under clause 22, new sections 120 and 120A are introduced

pursuant to which the Court may order, upon an application by  a

copyright  owner,  that infringing copies of works  and  devices

used to make infringing copies be delivered up and destroyed  or

forfeited to the owner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant amendment relates to border enforcement

measures  to prevent infringing intellectual property  materials

from entering Singapore.  Clause 25 of the Bill gives effect  to

our  obligation to put in place a border enforcement  system  by

introducing new sections 140A through 140R on border enforcement

measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 140B(1) enables a copyright owner who suspects that

any  shipment of pirated goods is coming to Singapore to  notify

the  Director-General  of  the Customs  and  Excise  Department.

Subject  to  certain safeguards, the Department  may  seize  the

goods when they enter Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of provisions relating to the protection of

test data under the TRIPS  Agreement will also entail amendments

to  two other Acts, namely, the Medicines Act, which I will take

later,  and the Control of Plants Act, the amendments  to  which

will be tabled in this House shortly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>The Berne Convention Amendments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the amendments which are related to the

Berne Convention.  This Convention predates the TRIPS Agreement.

Many  of  its  provisions  in fact  are  covered  by  the  TRIPS

Agreement, and  Singapore is not presently a party to the  Berne

Convention but we intend to accede to it once this amending Bill

has come into force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceding to that Convention will require us to permit

libraries  to  allow  the  copying of works  only  if  they  are

satisfied  that  these  works  cannot  be  obtained   within   a

reasonable time at ordinary commercial prices.  This is provided

for  in  clause  9  of  the Bill which repeals  and  substitutes

section 45(5) of the Act.



<br><br><i>Other Amendments to the Scope of Copyright and Defences</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may quickly touch on other amendments on the scope of

the copyright as well as defences, first, the deletion by clause

5  of  section 35(5) of the Act will bring us in line  with  the

United   States,  the  United  Kingdom,  other  European   Union

countries, Hong Kong and Australia, which do not bar the use  of

copyright materials for commercial research.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, various new defences are to be introduced where

the copying of copyright materials is:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to assist the intellectually handicapped;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for examination purposes;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) carried out by educational institutions by non-reprographic materials; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) for a course of instruction in the making of films and

soundtracks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes are effected by clauses 10 to 13, 20 and

21  which  insert new sections 50A, 52A, 54A, 115A and 115B  and

also amend section 116.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 6 introduces various amendments to section

39 which lift the restriction on the making of back-up copies of

a  computer programme.  This change brings us in line  with  the

position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



in  the  United  Kingdom and reflects in fact  current  industry

practice, which is not to impose such a prohibition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, section 74 of the Act, which deals with the

overlap in protection under industrial design and copyright laws

is  amended  by  clause 16.  The relevant period  of  protection

stated in that section is increased from the present 15 years to

25 years, which is in line with the increase in the maximum term

of  protection  for a registered design under the UK  Registered

Designs Act to 25 years.



<br><br><i>Changes to the Enforcement Provisions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may touch on the provisions relating to enforcement,

the main amendments are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Clause 23 which repeals and substitutes section 134 so

that  in  the  case  of  proceedings  for  the  enforcement   of

copyright,  there is now a rebuttable presumption that  what  is

stated  on the label of a sound recording is sufficient evidence

of  the facts stated regarding ownership of the copyright in the

recording.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clause 24(e) amends section 136(4) to widen the

offence  of  possession  of  equipment  to  make  pirated  sound

recordings or audio-visual productions to include the possession

of equipment designed to make pirated copies of all works; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Clause 24(g) deletes and substitutes section 136(9)

and  introduces new sub-paragraphs (10) to (12) to regulate  the

seizure  of articles and documents pursuant to a search warrant.

In  the  existing  Act, the execution of  a  search  warrant  is

limited  to only the pirated items themselves and the implements

used  for piracy.  The new section 136(9) will extend the  scope

of  search  warrants issued under the Act to cover all  articles

and  documents  which are evidence of copyright offences.   This

will  enable  a more effective investigation and prosecution  of

copyright offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out that some of these changes are the result

of  feedback  received from various intellectual property bodies

representing copyright owners.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes, of course, are not the last word on

copyright  amendments or copyright enforcement.  The  Government

remains  committed to considering and exploring further  avenues

to  deal  effectively with copyright piracy in cooperation  with

copyright owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also say that the honourable Chief Justice in his

judgment  in the Summit case made various observations,  amongst

other  things, on the possible need for safeguards where  search

warrants are obtained at the initiative of copyright owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His observations are currently being studied. They have an

impact,  not  just  on  the Copyright Act  but   also  on  other

legislation and therefore any necessary amendments will be taken

up  subsequently  in  the  context of a  broader  review,  among

others, of legislation like the Criminal Procedure Code.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

intellectual   property  rights  now  play  a  major   role   in

international  trade.   Copyright is an important  component  of

many  of the world's major industries: publishing, music, films,

databases, broadcasting, telecommunications, computers  and  the

media.   Singapore  must  be  seen  to  have  "state-of-the-art"

copyright laws, to help encourage such industries to invest,  or

continue to invest, in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Copyright Act 1988 modernised Singapore's copyright

law to deal, amongst other matters, with the evils of piracy and

counterfeiting: of records, films, books and music.  Rights were

strengthened and methods of enforcement were improved.  The 1988

Act  was  widely admired and held up as an example of  what  new

copyright laws should contain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, much has happened. The economic importance of

copyright  has  become even more pronounced; in  spite  of  some

effective  action  being taken to deal  with  piracy,  it  still

remains a problem; technological developments which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



transforming  our way of life - the global information  society,

Internet,  multimedia,  are  throwing  further  strains  on  the

copyright system, and the problems which they give rise to  have

to be addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start with TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual

Property).   It  is  stated that one  of  the  reasons  for  the

introduction of this Bill is the need to comply with  the  TRIPS

Agreement.    Singapore,  as  a  member  of  the   World   Trade

Organisation  (WTO)  with the status of an "advanced  developing

country",  has to comply with the TRIPS Agreement  by  the  year

2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIPS, of course, deals with all areas of intellectual

property.    There  is  a  need  to  amend  or   introduce   new

intellectual  property  legislation in other  areas,  eg,  trade

marks,  industrial designs, integrated circuits,  disclosure  of

confidential  information, and so on.  Can  any  information  be

provided by the Minister as to when all these other measures are

going to be introduced and whether they will be enacted in time?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of performers has traditionally been weak.

Their   rights  have  often  been  severely  limited  as   other

rightholders   have  tended  to  oppose  the  strengthening   of

performers' rights, both because they reduce their own share  of

royalties  and also because of the practical difficulties  which

could  arise  if  so  many people involved in  productions  have

rights  to  them.  Successful performers with strong  bargaining

power   can   sometimes  satisfactorily  safeguard   their   own

interests, at least, by contract.  Lesser performers have little

negotiating strength.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIPS actually does not confer strong rights on performers.

Neither  does  Singapore in the current Bill.  But  it  must  be

noted  that  today  the  situation is  changing.   Both  from  a

cultural and an economic point of view, recognition of rights of

performers is developing, eg. the European Directive  on  Rental

and  Related  Rights confers much stronger rights on performers,

seeking to equate them with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



owners   of  authors'  works;  and  the  WIPO  Performance   and

Phonograms  Treaty of 1996 also provides internationally  strong

rights for performers (certainly for phonograms, but not yet for

audio-visual works).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be argued that Singapore should go beyond that,

and to show its concern for the encouragement of culture and the

arts, it should provide similar stronger rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Singapore Bill does not address some of the

practical issues arising from the conferment of such rights. For

example, the relationship between performers, producers of films

and  broadcasters.  Should there, for example,  be  presumptions

for  the  purpose of easier use and exploitation of works,  that

such  rights are transferred in the absence of agreement to  the

contrary;  in which event, should performers be guaranteed  some

form  of  reasonable remuneration?  These matters have all  been

addressed  in  Europe.  I hope that they  can  be  addressed  in

Singapore as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's information society, the compilation of data and

material,  especially  for use in computers  and  networks,  has

taken  on exponential proportions.  Arguably, the protection  of

compilations under Singapore copyright law (as was the  case  in

the  UK  until  the  implementation  of  the  European  Database

Directive)  does protect data and material itself.   It  is  not

clear  whether this present state of the law is consistent  with

TRIPS.   It seems that there is a case for incorporating Article

10.2 into Singapore's legislation so that a Singapore court  can

ensure in an appropriate case that more general TRIPS' principle

prevails.  The Article states, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine

readable  or  other form, which by reason of  the  selection  or

arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual  creations

shall  be  protected as such.  Such protection, which shall  not

extend to the data or material itself shall be without prejudice

to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Producers of databases are particularly interested in this

area, and there have been many developments in recent times



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



to  try  to  produce laws which give appropriate  protection  to

databases.   For example, a new European Database Directive  has

recently been implemented throughout Europe, whereby in addition

to the fairly limited copyright protection for some databases, a

new  sui  generis  right has been created.  A  proposal  for  an

international Database Treaty was made in 1996, and  the  matter

is   still  under  discussion  although  it  is  proving   quite

controversial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to ask the Minister to consider what is

Singapore's approach to such databases and whether it  would  be

appropriate to introduce a new sui generis right similar to  the

European model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to the remedies and enforcement. One of the most

important  features of TRIPS is the detailed code  dealing  with

the enforcement of intellectual property rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although at one time, Singapore's enforcement laws were

thought  to be strong, and Singapore has taken action to  create

additional  enforcement  machinery,  rightholders'  associations

(eg, the software manufacturers) still maintain that more should

be  done  by  the  Government and its agencies  to  ensure  that

enforcement receives a higher profile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overseas, there is also a similar perception that more

needs  to  be  done in Singapore to show that the Government  is

applying  time  and resources to these matters.  Steps  must  be

taken  to  ensure that, with appropriate safeguards,  civil  and

criminal  raids to obtain evidence are available to  assist  the

legal process.  Without questioning the merits of the case,  the

Summit  decision  may  have given the  wrong  signals  to  those

engaged in piracy and counterfeiting, and it is to be hoped that

the  measures  in  the Bill will be sufficient to  correct  that

perception.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to ensure that there is a fair balance

in any Copyright Bill between the interests of holders of rights

in  "cutting edge" software and the interests of competitors who

want  to  design and market non-infringing competing  programmes

which interface or are inter-operable with the basic programmes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal's decision in Creative Technology v.

Aztech established that currently Singapore's copyright law does

not  permit most kinds of reverse engineering.  Companies cannot

decompile programmes to establish how they were put together and

armed   with   that  knowledge  to  develop  new  inter-operable

programmes.   Whether  competitors should  be  able  to  reverse

engineer and, if so, to what extent, is a very difficult  matter

to resolve.  It seems clear, however, that most countries in the

world  are  trying  to draw a line between those  two  differing

computer industry groups so that those who own the copyright  in

the  leading  programmes  can maintain  their  strong  copyright

protection   over   their  software,   but   that   in   certain

circumstances  others may decompile because there  is  a  public

interest in doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, use is made of the "fair use"

defence,  whereby courts are required to weigh up, on the  facts

of  every  case,  whether  the defendants  could  justify  their

activities.  In Singapore, with the current amendment to section

35(5),  I  am pleased to see that the Copyright Bill brings  the

law  of Singapore very close to that of the United States.  This

is  especially welcome and should receive warm support from  the

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just say that the TRIPS Agreement was

drafted  in  the early 1990s, the full impact of the information

superhighways  was  not  yet  fully  appreciated.   Accordingly,

little was done in TRIPS to ensure that the copyright law  deals

with many of the new problems to which they give rise to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the WIPO Copyright Treaty of December 1996

seeks  to  do.   It is a Treaty which sets out  new  rights  for

authors and others to ensure that they can control the copyright

interests of works winging their way around the world in digital

form one way or the other.  There are also measures designed  to

protect  those  who  are seeking to use technological  means  to

dabble with anti-copying devices.  For example, selling unlawful

decoders,  or interfering with copyright management information.

These are matters of the utmost importance.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



European  Union  has already introduced proposals  to  implement

this  particular  Treaty.  I hope that the Minister  will  study

such measures and to introduce them in due course in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank Assoc.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung for his useful observations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take up some of the points that he

mentioned.  He has asked about the time-table for TRIPS.  I have

pointed  out that the work on implementing legislation in  other

areas,  such  as  trade  marks, industrial  designs,  integrated

circuits,  etc.  is  actually in progress.   We  have  committed

ourselves to bring our legislation in conformity with  TRIPS  by

the  end  of  this  year,  which is actually  a  year  ahead  of

schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for performers' protection, the stronger regime for

performers  which he has in mind is actually pursuant  to  other

treaties,  such  as  the  1996 WIPO Performance  and  Phonograms

Treaty  which came into effect after TRIPS.  Let me  assure  him

that  the  need to extend these additional rights will  also  be

reviewed and, if necessary, changes will be made to the  Act  at

the appropriate time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted what he said about databases and compilations

and  the  need  to comply with Article 10.2 of  TRIPS.   But  my

understanding  is  that  databases and compilations  as  of  now

already enjoy protection under the existing Act.  I would  refer

him  to  the  definition  of "literary  work"  in  the  existing

legislation  of  the  Copyright  Act.   I  believe  our  Act  is

therefore  in  compliance with Article  10.2  of  TRIPS.   After

TRIPS,  he  is right that there were proposals made  by  certain

member states of the World Intellectual Property Organisation to

extend protection for databases and compilations under a special

regime  or what he referred to as sui generis regime.  That  was

because  of  rapid developments in information technology.   The

proposals  for  that, I believe, were tabled in  the  1996  WIPO

Diplomatic  Conference.  But these proposals are still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



under  discussion  and therefore the relevant Government  bodies

will  monitor the developments and decide how we should  act  on

these trends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted what he said about remedies and enforcement

and  especially his concern that the Summit case may have  given

the wrong signals to those engaged in piracy and counterfeiting.

Let  me  therefore take this opportunity to reiterate  that  the

Government's  policy  is not to condone commission  of  criminal

offences.    Because  tackling  copyright  piracy   requires   a

comprehensive  approach which involves  the  enactment  of  good

laws,   which  we  are  attempting  to  do  in  this   exercise,

enforcement  of stiff penalties and cooperation of the  industry

as  well  as  constant review of the entire gamut  of  laws  and

enforcement.   In  the  case  of enforcement,  the  Intellectual

Property  Rights Warrant Unit set up under the CID in  1995,  in

fact,  conducted  over 500 IPR raids in 1997  and  on  copyright

alone, there was an increase of 104% of raids compared to  1996.

In  terms  of the number of fiats issued authorising prosecution

by  copyright  owners, this went up from 64 in 1996  to  218  in

1997, more than 240% increase.  Only last month, a 5�-hour  raid

on five retail outlets in Sim Lim Square was conducted.  Several

suspects  were arrested with more than 3,700 CD-ROMs  containing

pirated  business  and games software and  270  VCDs  containing

pirated films were seized.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our courts also have consistently meted out fairly stiff

and  long  term imprisonment for intellectual property offences.

I  think  he would have read this morning, for example,  that  a

proprietor  of  a  shop at Sim Lim Square was sentenced  to  two

years'  imprisonment after being caught repeatedly  for  selling

pirated CD-ROMs.  I hope the message will be loud and clear that

we  are  not soft on copyright piracy.  We are, however, mindful

of  the  need  to  respond effectively to  continually  changing

circumstances, and we will do so.  Of course, the public have to

play  their  part also.  Because the supplier of  pirated  goods

exists  only  because there is a demand for the  pirated  goods.

The public must therefore respect the rights of those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



who have put in efforts in creating computer software, artistic,

musical,  literary or other copyright works and  refuse  to  buy

pirated items.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he asked me about further amendments to copyright

laws,  and  he is right.  As I said in my speech, the amendments

today will not necessarily be the last word on the subject.   We

have to evolve our copyright legislation as we take into account

information  changes.   As for the 1996  WIPO  treaty,  it  does

introduce various new rights relating to advances in information

technology,  especially for activities in  cyberspace  which  he

referred  to.  Let me assure him that the Government is  looking

into these trends at the moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Medicines Act to enable

Singapore to comply with our obligations under Article 39 of the

WTO  Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property

or  the  TRIPS Agreement which I have set out in greater  detail

earlier.  Article 39 requires, among other things, countries  to

protect  the  test  data  of  a pharmaceutical  product  against

disclosure and unfair commercial use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already set out the background concerning the

implementation  of the TRIPS Agreement and its significance  for

Singapore  in the debate on the earlier Bill.  I therefore  will

confine myself to the changes to be made in this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill introduces new sections 19A and 19B which

place  upon  the licensing authority for medicinal products,  in

our case either the Director of Medical Services or the Director

of   Primary   Production,  a  duty  to   protect   confidential

information received in relation to an application for a product

licence for a medicinal product which utilises a new ingredient.

This  confidential  information  can  be  in  relation  to   the

medicinal product itself or its applications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty to protect the confidential information is for a

period  of  five years from the date of receipt by the licensing

authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some circumstances in which disclosure of the

information   is  permitted  which  include  disclosure   to   a

Government department or statutory body for the purposes of that

department   or  body  and  disclosure  to  the   World   Health

Organisation,  the  Food and Agriculture  Organisation  and  any

regulatory agency of a WTO member state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, as I said, is to implement a specific

obligation under the TRIPS Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><h4>FROM INCOME TAX) (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend the Economic Expansion Incentives

(Relief  from  Income Tax) Act, which I will  refer  to  as  the

Incentives Act in short.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Bill extends the Investment Allowance

incentive to approved space satellite projects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it enhances the Overseas Enterprise Incentive by

allowing  the  flow-through  of  tax-exempt  dividends  to   the

ultimate shareholders of an overseas enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes were announced in the 1997 Budget Statement

and shall take retrospective effect from 11th July 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now describe the proposed amendments in turn.

<br><br><i>Extension of Investment Allowance Incentive to space satellite projects</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satellites play an increasingly important role in today's

telecommunications  and broadcast industries.   There  exists  a

huge  market for wireless transmission of voice, video and other

multimedia  content that satellite operators  in  Singapore  can

exploit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill extends investment allowance to cover

space  satellite  projects.   This will encourage  companies  to

launch  satellites,  and  operate them  out  of  Singapore.   To

qualify  for  the  incentive,  companies  will  be  required  to

undertake  high  value-added  services  in  Singapore,  such  as

setting  up a Tracking & Telemetry Control Centre or  a  Network

Operations Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will make two consequential amendments to the

Investment Allowance incentive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the definition of "fixed capital expenditure" will

be   amended  to  include  productive  equipment  used   outside

Singapore as opposed to only in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, fixed capital expenditure will be deemed incurred

so long as the productive equipment is delivered to the company.

<br><br><i>Enhancement to Overseas Enterprise Incentive</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Overseas Enterprise Incentive was introduced in 1993 as

part of the Government's efforts to encourage the development of

an external economy.  Income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



derived  from approved overseas projects is exempt from tax  for

up  to  10  years.  Tax-exempt dividends can be paid up  to  two

tiers   of   shareholders,  subject  to  a   100%   shareholding

requirement at the first tier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, changes were made to the Income Tax Act to allow

the flow-through of tax exempt dividends to more than two levels

of shareholders, provided that a 50% shareholding requirement is

met  at  each  level paying the dividends.  The 50% shareholding

requirement may be waived with Ministerial approval on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill makes similar amendments to the

Incentives Act relating to the Overseas Enterprise Incentive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>UNDESIRABLE PUBLICATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undesirable Publications Act, or UPA, was enacted more

than  three  decades  ago,  in 1967, to  provide  for  penalties

against objectionable publications brought into the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, publications were printed words and pictures

compiled  as  books or simple reproductions like an audio  tape.

In recent times, technology has brought into the marketplace new

media  forms,  with multi-media capabilities.  The compact  disc

can  contain  text, sound and video.  It may also have  multiple

applications.  For example, if you play an enhanced CD on a  hi-fi set, it functions as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



an  audio CD.  If played on the computer, it is a CD-ROM, and if

played  in  a  multimedia computer, it can show video  clips  as

well.

<br><br><i>New definition of "publication"</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of such technological advances, the traditional

definition  of  publication  can  no  longer  be  "all  written,

pictorial  or printed matter." There is a need to re-define  the

term  "publication".  In this Bill, "publication" has  been  re-defined  to  include  CD-ROMS, sound recordings,  pictures,  and

drawings generated by computer graphics.

<br><br><i>Censorship by differentiation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our censorship policy is based on the principle of

differentiation.  Different media have different impact and  the

extent  of  censorship varies accordingly.  In  general,  moving

images have a greater impact than static images, which in  turn,

have  a  greater impact than words.  We are most stringent  with

the  visual  media which reach the living rooms.  Thus,  we  are

strictest with free-to-air TV channels, but we allow more leeway

for  subscription  services such as cable TV.   With  films,  we

differentiate between G, PG, NC-16 and R(A).  For films shown to

members of film societies, we are more relaxed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the print medium, we make a distinction between

pictorials  and the written word.  We are stricter with  graphic

publications  meant for children such as comics  depicting  sex.

We  are  least  concerned with the printed text because  reading

them  requires  a certain level of education and  concentration.

Some  books  meant  for adults are required  to  be  wrapped  in

plastic or cellophane in the book shops, so that children cannot

browse them lightly.  This principle of differentiation was also

adopted by the Censorship Review Committee in 1992.

<br><br><i>Obscene publications</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our main target continues to be those who

seek  profit from distributing obscene publications.  Currently,

traffickers of obscene publications are referred to  the  Police

for action



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



to  be  taken under the Penal Code.  There are no provisions  to

deal with such cases under the existing UPA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 5 of the proposed amendments, those caught

trafficking    in   obscene   publications,   by   distributing,

exhibiting,   producing   or  having   such   publications   for

distribution,  can  be prosecuted under the UPA.   The  proposed

penalty will be a maximum fine of $10,000 and/or a jail term  of

up to two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 spells out what we mean by "obscenity":

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A publication is obscene if its effect or . the effect of

any  one of its parts or items is, if taken as a whole, such  as

to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely . to read,

see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.'



<br><br><i>Objectionable Publications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also included in the amendments the definition of

what  is  objectionable.   While some publications  may  not  be

blatantly  pornographic  or controversial,  they  may  still  be

objectionable in the way they promote promiscuous lifestyles  or

glorify criminal activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current legislation, other than confiscation, no

further  action  can  be taken against vendors  who  persist  in

selling objectionable publications.  The proposed amendment will

plug  this  present  loophole so that vendors  of  objectionable

publications can be prosecuted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the proposed amendments allows for penalties

against  such  distributors.   For distributing,  possessing  or

reproducing objectionable publications, the penalty would  be  a

fine up to $5,000 and/or a jail term for one year.  This maximum

fine is half that for obscene publications.

<br><br><i>Prohibited Publications</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to ban publications such as Playboy and

Penthouse.   We will increase the maximum fine for the  sale  of

such  banned  publications  from $2,000  to  $10,000.   For  the

possession of a banned publication, the maximum fine will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



raised  from $1,000 to $2,000.  No change is recommended in  the

jail terms as they are already a sufficient deterrent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always exercised the power to ban or gazette

publications sparingly.  This policy will continue.  We  are  in

fact  degazetting publications which, over time, are  no  longer

objectionable  on  moral, religious or  communal  grounds.   For

example, the Journal of Contemporary Asia and the Selected Works

of Mao Tse-tung have been recently degazetted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will continue to review its

censorship  rules  from  time to time to ensure  that  standards

applied  to  publications and videos are in tune  with  changing

social mores in Singapore and changes in the world around us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  support  the Bill.  I am pleased to note that in this  Bill,

attention  is  being  drawn  to the implications  of  rapid  and

widespread dissemination of undesirable publications, aided by a

new  medium, such as CD-ROMS, which are also easy to  duplicate.

The  revised  definition of publications, in my  mind,  is  long

overdue in the light of the changing nature in which obscene and

objectionable material is distributed and exhibited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new provisions for obscene publications in this

Bill  which  have  been previously absent  would  now  give  our

enforcement   agencies  ground  to  rein  in  on   distributors,

exhibitors and publishers of such materials and I appreciate the

tough stand that this Bill places on visual images as the impact

of  visual  images, as the Minister has just said, is  far  more

direct and damaging than the written word.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also serves to address the anomaly whereby

offending vendors who sell objectionable publications would have

their  publications confiscated but suffer no further penalties.

It is timely that penalties are now introduced and that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



these   vendors  have  to  be  directly  accountable  for  their

participation in the distribution and sale of such objectionable

materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am supportive of the measures in this Bill, I

would  like  to  seek clarifications from the  Minister  on  the

various  items.   The first question is: is this  Bill,  in  the

opinion  of  the Minister, a retrogressive step towards  greater

censorship  of  publications, or is it a  step  forward  in  our

effort  to  promote  a  reading  society  and  to  promote   the

publishing industry?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask this question because I am concerned that a

retrogressive  step  towards  censorship  would  impact  on  the

direction  and  the development of the literary  and  performing

arts,  an  area which we are consciously promoting in line  with

our  national objective to build a more gracious society.  Would

the  Minister  therefore update the House  on  the  Government's

latest thinking or policy towards censorship in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 13 of the Bill leaves it to the expert judgment

of  any personnel authorised under the Bill to determine whether

or not any publication is objectionable.  I understand that this

person or so-called controller will act from time to time  under

the direction of the Minister.  May I therefore ask the Minister

if he could tell the House what are the basic parameters guiding

the  actions of such officers and whether or not such parameters

should indeed be stipulated in this legislation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an area of clarification is also sought on the status

of  Internet  Service  Providers.   The  widened  definition  of

publications includes information stored by the use of computers

or  other  electronic device.  Despite the  existence  of  proxy

services, ISP cannot fully police all such undesirable web pages

and  prevent  access to such material, whether it  is  audio  or

visual,  available through the Internet.  Therefore, my question

to  the  Minister  is whether, with the passing  of  this  Bill,

operationally,   the  Bill  will  impose   an   overly   onerous

performance  obligation  on the part  of  the  Internet  Service

Providers.  Would the Minister please clarify?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I am pleased to note that within this

provision of the Bill which is the new section 16, the  Minister

is  able  to grant exemption to allow, for example, institutions

of   higher  learning  to  have  access  to  such  objectionable

materials for research purposes.  I think it is good.   However,

for the reassurance of this House that such discretionary powers

are  not  unilaterally  exercised,  could  the  Minister  please

elaborate  the  guiding  principles underlying  any  ground  for

exemptions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support this Bill as placed before this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tough stand that the Government has taken with

regard to obscene or undesirable publications on grounds of sex,

violence,  crime  or drugs is appropriate and deserves  support.

In  fact,  I  would  say that in view of the rapid  and  complex

technological  developments in areas of periodical publications,

media printing, there is a constant need to be more vigilant  to

ensure  that the current legislation be kept relevant  and  that

the  standards of morality, decency and propriety are preserved.

In  this  regard,  Sir, I support the proposal to  increase  the

penalties for such offences as stated in the amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new definition of what is objectionable, taking into

account new technologies in sound recording and reproductions of

pictures,  photographs from computers, would be considered  very

appropriate  and  timely.   However, Sir,  while  the  Bill  has

provided  for comprehensive guidelines to determine  whether  or

not  a  publication is considered objectionable, it would indeed

be   extremely  difficult  in  practice  to  determine  what  is

objectionable.   It  is sometimes difficult  to  determine  what

constitutes  torture, sexual and violent abuses and exploitation

of  nudity,  let alone having to relate this with considerations

for  the  literary, artistic, social, cultural, educational  and

scientific   merit   before  deciding   whether   a   particular

publication  is  indeed objectionable.   In  fact,  Sir,  it  is

acknowledged, under the new section 2B, subsection (3), that the

question whether or not a publication is objectionable is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



matter  for  expert judgment.  It is for this same reason,  Sir,

that  it  is in my view extremely difficult for any one  person,

such  as  the Chief Controller or delegated public officers,  to

exercise judgment over such a difficult matter and so decide  or

interpret the moral tone of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Sir, I would suggest that a more civic

participation involving a cross-section of our civil society  be

formed  under the supervision of the Chief Controller  to  guide

the Chief Controller in the interpretation and classification of

such  publications  and to facilitate the  smooth  transmission,

broadcast,  circulation and exhibition of this  publication  for

commercial considerations and yet in no way compromise our  high

standards of morality, decency and propriety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more practical note, Sir, it would be difficult for

any one person or corporation to determine what is objectionable

and  what  is  not.  It may take expert judgment to  decide  how

would  any person or corporation find it easier to make  such  a

decision.  A person would have to make a very difficult decision

whether  or  not to seek exemption or to determine that  he  has

with  him  a publication that can be classified undesirable  and

may  in  fact find himself convicted simply because of error  of

judgment.   Such a fear, Sir, would lead to the Chief Controller

being  inundated  with  publications  that  would  require   his

approval.   This could have detrimental commercial consequences.

I  seek  the  Minister's clarification and  assurance  that  the

mechanism to ensure the speedy and efficient processing of  such

publications is available.  We should also have mechanisms where

the  decisions  and objections to the Chief Controller  and  the

Minister  can  be  published and made readily available  to  the

public giving reasons for the objections for ease of reference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the new section 16, subsection (2), I wish

to  seek clarification from the Minister on the proposed fees to

be  imposed  for  seeking exemption for publications  which  are

prohibited.   In  view  of  the  low  cost  of  these  products,

especially  as a result of recent technology, such fees  may  be

out of proportion to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



cost of the product.  Further, a period of three months for such

publications and materials to be held in custody may be too long

as the product could have become obsolete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I think this is a good Bill and wish to

state my support for the amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for giving

me this opportunity to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Undesirable Publications Act goes back to 1938

when the colonial government first introduced it for the obvious

purpose   of  controlling  political  literature.   Things   had

changed.  In 1967, the Act was repealed and re-enacted.  Now, we

have further amendments to the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most civilised societies do not like to have

censorship either on moral or political grounds.  But we are not

living in an ideal society.  I think some degree of control  has

to  be  exercised  by  the  society  over  the  individual.   On

principle, I agree with the amendments and I support  the  Bill.

However,  I have some reservations and queries and I would  like

the Minister to give them his due consideration and I am sure he

will do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are an open society. We are in the age of

information  technology, satellite and cable  television.   Most

homes   have   access  to  Internet.   We  are   now   receiving

publications   from   India,   China,   Thailand,    Bangladesh,

Philippines, besides the traditional sources.  Therefore, it  is

desirable that publications from these countries should not have

anything that will undermine the social fabric of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago, an Indian publication which was sold in

Singapore  had a very undesirable photograph, though  it  was  a

beautiful   photograph,   in  the  middle   of   the   magazine.

Fortunately, Sir, I am pleased to note that this publication has

not  reappeared  in  Singapore.  I do not  know  whether  it  is

effective  supervision by the Ministry  or  whether  it  is  the

voluntary will of the distributor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have moved a long way from the days of yellow

culture  of  1959 when some publications had to  be  prohibited.

Times have changed.  We must allow publications that will enrich

our literary and artistic life.  And I congratulate the Minister

for  allowing this provision in the Bill.  This will ensure that

the scholars are not denied these works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a fundamental question which I would like to address

to the Minister.  This is regarding the new section 2B(1)(b).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a publication would be objectionable if it describes,

depicts  or  otherwise deals with matters of  race  or  religion

which is likely to cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or

hostility.   I  beg  the Minister to think of one  further  area

which  should be included, besides race and religion.   Language

is  a very sensitive issue.  Feelings of enmity and ill-will may

result  if  a  publication  makes offensive  comments  on  one's

language  or  makes criticism in such a way that it will  create

ill-will.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are a multi-lingual country. As a

result of political stability, the language fanatics are not  in

a  position  to  inflame feelings.  But not too  long  ago,  the

communalists were propagating supremacy of their language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, I would like to go back to the

early  days  of  our  Republic.  At the  Opening  of  the  First

Parliament  on 8th December 1965, His Excellency  the  Yang  Di-Pertuan Negara reminded the House and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There are people in Singapore who, even after a few months

of  separation, still talked raucously, albeit foolishly,  about

the implementation of one language - the national language -  in

teaching  at  all levels including the university.   If  such  a

policy  was  unwise when we were part of the wider framework  of

Malaysia,  now in the context of Singapore, the lunacy  of  such

statement should have been manifest to all.  Yet they are  being

made and considerable publicity in the Jawi press.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

We  no longer have the Jawi press or extreme Malay leaders.   It

is to the credit of the Malay leadership and the people that the

view of the sixties has been abandoned for the good.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, language extremism is not the monopoly of any one

group.   There  are  chauvinists in  every  group,  but  we  can

minimize the danger.  One small spark and the House is on  fire.

Let us have some fire prevention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that we do not have communal clashes must not

leave  us  to  believe everything is fine.  From time  to  time,

chauvinists  rear their ugly heads.  We must  try  to  curb  the

exuberance  of  chauvinists.  Language is a very emotive  issue.

People are prepared to die for it.  Some do die in the hope that

they will become martyrs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can learn from the experience of other countries where

language  groups clash.  The end result is chaos  and  disorder.

These  countries often experience riots.  We too  had  our  fair

share of riots and curfews.  I think there is a loophole in  the

Bill.  Let us cover it now to prevent a floodgate.  We have  not

seen  for sometime the language issue being openly debated,  but

it can reappear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pride ourselves as pragmatic people practising

prevention  and  looking  beyond the horizon.   We  enacted  the

Maintenance  of Religious Harmony Act.  The law has  a  salutary

effect.   The  fanatics  and  fundamentalists  have  adopted   a

moderate  line.   The  need to enforce the law  has  not  arisen

because of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I urge, in a similar vein, the Minister to consider

including  language in the sub-clause.  If he cannot do  so,  he

should  state  his stand on the matter so that a  clear  message

will be sent to the would-be mischief makers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome control of objectionable publications.

However,  I  would  like  to plead for  caution.   We  must  not

prohibit  publications  as  long as they  do  not  question  our

fundamental beliefs.  We must keep our windows open even  if  it

means  some foul air coming in.  The Bill is going to  give  the

Government wide power.  There is no way to check against abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that whenever the official decides to

classify any publication as objectionable publication, he should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



consult advisers who are drawn from outside the Government.   In

this  way,  the public would have confidence in the decision  of

the  official,  bearing in mind that there is no appeal  to  the

Court,  as the Minister's decision is final.  I therefore  plead

for establishing a Committee of Advisers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also must urge the publishers and booksellers to

have some degree of self-censorship.  Recently, my attention was

drawn  to  a  book  by  one of the popular  fiction  writers  in

America.   It is supposed to deal with the corporate world,  but

every  one  in  10 pages speaks of explicit sexual  acts,  often

fringing  on  perversity.  I will not mention the book  to  this

House but I will give the title to the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can do no better than to end my speech by quoting

again  the Address of His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

in 1965.  May I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Needless to say, the more extreme any community is about

one  race, one language and one religion, the more likely it  is

to  arouse  counter chauvinism amongst the other communities  to

the detriment of all.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this, I end my speech and I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the

Bill.    The   amendments  are  commendable.   The   policy   of

differentiation  the  Minister has explained  is  a  progressive

step.   In  deciding what is objectionable, the Bill  will  take

into  account different audiences and media and also  allow  the

recognition of merit on scientific, artistic and other  grounds.

I   believe  this  follows  the  Report  of  Prof.  Tommy  Koh's

Censorship Review Committee 1992.  I think this is something  we

should all support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, however, wish to seek one assurance from the Government

and  to  offer three suggestions.  The assurance I seek is  with

respect  to  the  meaning of "obscene".  The Bill  gives  a  new

definition  of the word.  This definition needs to be  clear  as

regards  other laws which use the same word.  There is a  degree

of  overlap  with section 292 of the Penal Code  which  provides

sanctions for the sale of obscene goods.  As such, the assurance

I seek from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister  is that there will be a consistent interpretation

and application of what is obscene under the different laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my three suggestions. My first

suggestion  is  in  respect  of  panels  to  assist  the   Chief

Controller.   The  Bill  defines "objectionable"  to  take  into

account   the   impact  of  the  medium,  artistic,  scientific,

educational   and  other  merits,  and  standards  of   morality

generally accepted by reasonable members of the community.  This

is  commendable.  Past Malaysian and Singaporean cases have  not

taken  such criterion into consideration.  In the past, we  have

seen  books  as  the  Tropic of Cancer by Henry  Miller  be  the

subject  of  criminal prosecution.  Similarly,  in  England  and

other  societies, there had been controversies  surrounding  D.H

Lawrence's  Lady  Chatterley's Lover.   Today,  such  texts  are

studied in University or even at `O' levels without controversy.

So,  as  the  Minister has recognised and this Bill  recognises,

standards change.  However, given this dimension of change  over

time  and  the reference to society's changing mores, and  given

the  expanded  criterion,  can the  Chief  Controller  alone  or

Controllers  within  the Administrative  Service  by  themselves

decide what is objectionable?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This then comes to my suggestion. The decision-making on

what  is  objectionable  should  include  both  specialists  and

representatives  of the community at large.  They  would  assist

and advise the Chief Controller.  I understand that the Ministry

has  done  this  informally  already.   The  process  should  be

formalized  and publicized.  This can be an area of  growth  for

civil  society, by which I mean that civil society, the citizens

of    Singapore,   should   progress   towards   greater   self-responsibility and self-regulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to my second suggestion. This is that

distributors of publications be allowed on a voluntary basis  to

make  prior submissions to the Ministry.  Sir, the Bill and  the

Act,  as  they exist, are largely reactive.  After a publication

is imported,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



the  Controller  can decide and require certain  actions  to  be

taken.   However,  import and distribution of  publications  for

sale  are  a  business.  Business requires certainty and  proper

planning.   Powers under the Bill should then be  proactive  and

pro-business.   My  suggestion  in  core  and  in  sum  is  that

distributors  have the option to submit on a voluntary  basis  a

sample copy to the Controller to have his permission for import.

There  should be a time limit given to the Controller to give  a

decision,  favourable or otherwise, and then if favourable,  the

books can proceed en masse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I understand this is the informal practice under

section 10 of the existing Act.  However, it is sometimes  after

mass imports have already been made.  My suggestion would reduce

uncertainty and risks for distributors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion is that the public should have greater

access  to  the list of objectionable publications.  Of  course,

not the objectionable publications themselves but the list.  The

new  section  2B of the Bill provides that the Chief  Controller

shall   keep   and   maintain   a  register   of   objectionable

publications.  The list serves to inform people.  However, there

is  no  provision that the register should be  made  known.   As

such,  my  suggestion  is  that it is  preferable  to  have  the

objectionable publications gazetted and, moreover, for practical

public  access,  the register should be listed on  Internet  and

copies of the register made available for inspection perhaps  at

main reference libraries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the Undesirable

Publications  (Amendment)  Bill is intended to restrict  obscene

and  other  objectionable publications, taking into account  the

technological  developments  in  Singapore.   It   also   raises

penalties.  The Bill, however, does not cover "films" which  are

covered by the Films Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is to be welcomed as it seeks to take into

account   the   gaps  in  the  law  which  have  arisen  through

technological  developments, especially electronic publications.

The definition of "publications"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



now includes computer-generated or stored graphics and sounds,

and  the definition of "supply" also covers the transmission  of

such publications through computers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "obscene" is the same as that used in the

new  Films Bill, though the latter does not contain a definition

of  "objectionable".  This means that there can be both  obscene

films and publications, but no "objectionable films".  It is not

clear why this is the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern that I have is the somewhat wide meaning of

"objectionable".  For example, in the new section  2B(1)(a),  it

is stated that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a publication is objectionable if ... it ... describes,

depicts,  expresses or otherwise deals with ... matters  such  as

sex,  horror,  crime, cruelty, violence or  the  consumption  of

drugs ... in  such  a  manner  that  the  availability  of   the

publication is likely to be injurious to the public good;'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

The  controllers appointed by the Minister are the guardians  of

the public good, as it is their opinions that count in the Bill.

In forming their views, they need not take evidence.  It is said

that  whether a matter is objectionable or not is a  matter  for

expert  judgment.  It is by no means certain how one can acquire

training  and  expertise to determine whether a  publication  is

likely  to  be  injurious to the public good, or what  level  of

injury  is  required  before a publication  is  declared  to  be

objectionable.  Further, new subsection 2B(3) is unclear  as  to

who  should  provide these experts with the evidence which  they

are  under  a duty to consider, if available.  All  in  all,  it

seems  to  be  an open-ended provision that may be difficult  to

apply,  and even more difficult to challenge.  I should like  to

know whether this is actually intended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I wish to raise is that the Bill does not

purport   to   deal   with  the  different  types   of   obscene

publications.   In the new Films (Amendment) Bill,  there  is  a

special provision on aggravated offences where a child or  young

person is involved.  A simple illustration will be sufficient to

expose  the anomaly in the proposed laws.   An obscene  film  is

made  using a young person.   The person who makes the  film  or

who  procures the young person to make such a film will  face  a

minimum of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



$20,000  fine,  with the possibility of a $80,000 fine  ceiling,

and  two  years  in  prison.  Another takes  a  set  of  obscene

photographs involving the same person is liable to a fine  under

this  Bill not exceeding $10,000 or two years jail or both.   In

the  days before photo-realistic images can be produced  on  the

computer or camera, it may be justifiable to distinguish between

film  and  publication.   But  now the  distinction,  I  submit,

appears to be spurious.  I would urge the Minister to take  this

point into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a distinction is not spurious, but where it is not

drawn in the Bill, is in the case of child pornography.  The new

Bill does not make this distinction.  The Films (Amendment) Bill

makes  such a distinction. What is the reason for the difference

in  approach?  It cannot be that a pornographer who  exploits  a

young person by taking photographs is morally less reprehensible

than  his  counterpart who makes a film.  In many jurisdictions,

child  pornography  has been singled out as  a  particular  evil

requiring  special sanctions.  In the US alone, about 15  states

have  enacted  special provisions to tackle  this  problem.   We

should do the same, as we have done in the case of films.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to quote the statement of Louis Freeh,

Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, giving evidence

before the Senate Appropriations Committee last year.  There  he

said, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our children are our nation's most valuable asset. They

represent  the bright future of our country and hold  our  hopes

for  a  better nation. Our children are also some  of  the  most

vulnerable  members  of  society.  ..  Protecting  our  children

against  the  fear of crime and from becoming victims  of  crime

must be a national priority.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to point out that the marvellous advances

in  computer and telecommunications technology "that  allow  our

children  to reach out to new sources of knowledge and  cultural

experiences" are also exposing them to exploitation and harm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore most earnestly urge the Minister to

review the existing and proposed legislation, with the following

considerations in mind.  First, there should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



be a distinction made between child pornography and other types,

with enhanced penalties for the former.  Second, there should be

no   distinction   made  between  pornography   in   films,   in

publications  and in broadcasting.  Third, there should  perhaps

be a refining of the definitions used in the legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill subject to what I have said above.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take

the Chair again at 3.30 pm.

<div align="center"><h4>UNDESIRABLE PUBLICATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  deal  with some matters of definition and address some  very

specific issues in this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Bill is meant to cover new computer technology and

the word "broadcast" is to have the same meaning as that word in

the   Copyright   Act,   and  "broadcasting"   has   a   similar

corresponding meaning.  There in the Copyright Act the  word  is

defined  as  "broadcast  by  wireless  telegraphy".   Electronic

transmission  is defined in this Bill as "excludes broadcasting"

while  supply of publication is defined by the Bill as  covering

electronic  transmission.  This leaves  an  area  of  electronic

transmission  where messages are broadcast, that  is,  they  are

sent  to several parties with one press of the button.   I  hope

the  Minister  would  confirm  whether  or  not  such  broadcast

materials  as,  for example, e-mail or fax, are subject  to  the

provisions of this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the word "publication" is defined to mean "any

book,  magazine  or periodical, whether in manuscript  or  final

form".   As far as form goes, Mr Speaker, Sir, electronic  books

and  magazines  are today feasible.  Are these in "final  form"?

It  is, I submit, necessary to add after the words "final  form"

some  words  like  "and  published in whatever  medium,  whether

tangible  or  otherwise", to clearly cover Internet publications

and so-called "E-zines" if this be the purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the word "supply" is defined. A similar word is

defined  in a slightly different way in the next Bill that  will

be  tabled before the House at a subsequent sitting, and that is

the  Films  (Amendment) Bill.  I would like to ask  if  the  two

definitions which serve the same purpose essentially  be  worded

in a similar way, please.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the word "obscene" is defined in this Bill, and

again  this word is also defined in the Films (Amendment)  Bill.

What  I  need  to say here, I may have to say it  again  in  the

debate on the Films (Amendment) Bill.  Suffice it to say, it was

Bertrand  Russell,  the sceptic, who said "it  is  obvious  that

obscenity  is  not a term capable of legal definition.   In  the

practice  of  the  courts,  it means anything  that  shocks  the

magistrate".   I  suppose  we  do not  want  such  an  arbitrary

standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I recall, an American judge was once asked to define

"obscenity".  I do not remember his exact words, so allow me  to

paraphrase.   He said in effect that obscenity is  not  easy  to

define.  Nevertheless, it is like an elephant.  "I know it  when

I  see  it".   Our legislative draftsman has boldly  proposed  a

definition.  Obscenity is defined, "such as to tend  to  deprave

or corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant

circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter .".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This definition of obscenity is archaic, or at least in

archaic  terminology.   It comes from the  1868  case  of  R  v.

Hicklin,  words, which were further developed, I understand,  in

the  definition  section  of the UK's Obscene  Publications  Act

1959.   Furthermore, it is too narrow in our modern  age.   Many

things which the majority of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans regard as obscene may not necessarily  be  seen  as

"depraved"  by some sectors.  The definition, however,  requires

all  who  see,  hear  or  read the publication  to  consider  it

"depraved" or in other words "evil".  With the decline of  moral

values,  even so-called family magazines and newspapers  display

full frontal nudes in the name of art or news.  Many would still

say  this  is obscene, but not all the same people may  actually

condemn  it  as  "depravity".  Depravity has very  negative  and

ominous  overtones,  and  is  reserved  today  for  some   truly

obnoxious  and  heinous behaviour.  Instinctively,  many  people

would hesitate to call full frontal nudity per se as "evil".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easier to note what is "lewd" or "indecent" or

"morally  unseemly"  in specific circumstances.   I  would  like

therefore  to update the definition of "obscenity" to  something

that  is  easier to apply, such as the words "such  as  to  lead

right  minded people to consider it lewd, depraved,  corrupt  or

morally unseemly".  Perhaps, in addition, we should also have  a

list  of  criteria such as in the new section 2B(2) to help  the

court or the Controller decide what is indeed obscene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>UNDESIRABLE PUBLICATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think much of what I

wanted to say has already been said by other speakers.  But I do

wish nevertheless to lend my support and voice the concerns that

have been expressed by several of the speakers who spoke on this

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Amendment Bill now seeks to assign or

to confine to persons, or a person it may be, to decide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



what  we  may  read, what we may see, or what we may  hear.   It

would appear from the Bill that the community is not to have any

say  on this, because there is no provision made for any appeal.

There  is no board, as it were, that is proposed which may  hear

any  appeals  from  any decision made by the Controller  or  any

authorised  officer.  So the society is not to have any  say  at

all in what it sees, reads or hears, but it has to be determined

by  an  officer.  We know not what the age of this officer  will

be.   He may be a fairly young man who is charged with the  task

of deciding what is good and what is not good for the society to

see, read or hear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act itself contains in section 3 a very wide blanket

power given to the Minister to prohibit any publication which he

considers  contrary to the public interest.  And that itself  is

without any appeal to either the courts or to any body set up to

consider the Minister's decision.  So I would have thought since

the Government already has this all-embracing power given to the

Minister,  objectionable and obscene publications could just  as

well  be brought under the scrutiny of the Minister for  him  to

exercise  his  power under section 3 of the Act.  But  now  this

Bill  proposes  to  add  two  other definitions,  "obscene"  and

"objectionable"  as  matters  on  which  the  decision   of   an

authorised person is to be final.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last speaker in his comment on clause

3  of  the  Bill on the   meaning of obscene, called it archaic.

It  is almost impossible for anyone to really understand what is

meant  by  a  publication  that tends to  "deprave  and  corrupt

persons".   It  is  an  all-catching phrase  and  there  are  no

criteria  set  out as to what should be considered as  depravity

and  what should be considered as corrupting persons.  And there

is  nothing  in  this Bill which says who is to decide  what  is

obscene.  There is, of course, a new section 2B, under clause 3,

which   leaves   the  question  of  determining  "objectionable"

publication to a person authorised by the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, the main object of this Bill

would appear to me to consign all our reading materials, all our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



materials  that we see or hear, to the judgment of  one  person.

Is  this  a fitting way to prepare us for the 21st century?   It

might  have  been  all  right in the 18th century  or  the  17th

century.   But is that how we are going to regulate  society  in

the  21st  century  that decisions about what  a  citizen  shall

read,  hear or see should all be left in the hands of  a  single

officer?  As  someone had said, is this Bill retrogressive or is

it  progressive?  Certainly, if you look at the control that  is

to  be  given to one particular man to decide what society shall

read or hear or see, it is retrogressive.  It does not take into

account the concern of the society and what the society thinks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the definition of "objectionable". In

clause  3  (new  section  2B(2)(d))  any  publication  would  be

considered objectionable if the officer takes the view  that  it

offends  the  standards of morality, decency and propriety  that

are  generally accepted by reasonable members of the  community.

How  is he going to determine the standards of morality accepted

by reasonable members of the community or will he impose his own

standards  of  morality, decency and propriety and say,  "That's

it.   This  is what I say should be your morals and  you  comply

with  it."   Equally, under sub-paragraph (c), he  is  asked  to

decide whether it has any merit, value or importance in relation

to literary, artistic, social, cultural, educational, scientific

or other matters.  Is he equipped, Mr Speaker, Sir, to make this

judgment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is time for us to trust our people to

take  judgments on what is good for the society as a  whole  and

not  to  continue to behave as though the members of the society

cannot  make  any  judgment  or  decision  for  themselves   but

everything must be made for them.  I think it was not very  long

ago,  the Economist  wrote about the Singapore nanny.   I  think

perhaps  we  can try and do a little less with the nanny  taking

charge of everything for the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been suggestions that perhaps a committee should

be  set up now which will decide questions of morality and other

questions as to whether any views or books are likely  to  cause

feelings  of  enmity,  hatred,  ill-will  or  hostility  between

different racial or religious groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would add my plea, the plea that has been made, that

the  questions  that I have raised should not  be  left  to  the

decision of one person but it is time that we set up a board  of

persons.  We have the Inter-Religious Advisory Board.   We  have

other  boards.  Is it not possible for us to get their  help  to

formulate  standards of morality and decency  that  the  society

should  follow?  I would urge the Minister that  he  should  not

move on to the Third Reading of the Bill this afternoon but that

he  should refer the Bill to a Select Committee now so that  the

views of the community may be heard as to what they think of the

Bill  and  its  definitions and, particularly, people  from  the

literary  and  artistic bodies, cultural bodies and  educational

bodies be heard on what should be considered as objectionable or

even obscene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a difficult question to decide what

is obscene.  To many, it would appear that the human body itself

is  obscene  if there is a drawing of the human body.   Is  that

what  we  consider  obscene?  Sometimes,  I  am  surprised  when

persons  are  charged with an obscene act where it would  appear

that  displaying the human body is considered to be  an  obscene

act.  So my plea is that the Bill should be referred to a Select

Committee  and  the  views of the community heard  and  that  we

should  not rush into passing this Bill this afternoon.  But  if

that  is  not  possible, then consideration should be  given  to

finding other ways than to consign the judgment on these matters

just  to  a  single person.  And even if that is not acceptable,

consideration should be given to providing for a  system  of  an

appeal to an independent board or body that will then be able to

pronounce on it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to

thank Members for making very thoughtful and helpful suggestions

on the Bill and for the general support of its provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me take Mr Chew Heng Ching's basic question.

Does  this  Bill  signify a change of policy on  censorship?   I

think  that  is the key question we must ask.  Are we tightening

or  are  we loosening?  In fact, it is neither.  It is  not  the

intention  of  this Bill to re-calibrate the general  policy  of

censorship  in  Singapore.  This issue we reopen once  every  10

years.   We had a review in 1981.  The last review was by  Prof.

Tommy  Koh  in 1992 and, in that review, they went  through  the

full  range  films, magazines, newspapers, the performing  arts.

And  many  Members are not aware that in fact there is quite  an

elaborate  mechanism  to  help the controllers.   Assisting  the

controllers, we have in fact an Advisory Panel consisting  of  a

large number of individuals drawn from a broad cross-section  of

our  society, men and women, different religions, different  age

groups, different professions, different marital status in order

that  for  different  categories,  like  for  cartoons  and  for

different  language publications, we have a group of fair-minded

jury  men  who will advise the controllers on their work,  their

internal guidelines and these guidelines are reviewed from  time

to time to adjust to changing mores and to the changing patterns

in the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision for appeal to the Minister. In fact,

very few appeals come to me.  And even when they do come to  me,

I would always cause it to be referred to a Publications Appeals

Committee  chaired by Prof. Eddie Kuo.  And it  is  very  rarely

that  I  disagree with their recommendations.  I am not sure  if

Members or indeed members of the public are aware of who are  in

the  Publications Appeals Committee and the Advisory  Panel.   I

think  I would now ask my officers, in order to reassure members

of  the  public  and  Members of the House that  in  fact  these

decisions are not taken in isolation, to publish a list  of  all

those  who  are  involved and they are long lists consisting  of

very upright, fair-minded people in the community.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is not to review censorship

provisions  or to change the way we censor books  or  comics  or

publications.  It is to catch up with multimedia technology, and

catching up with multimedia technology is breathtaking.  I think

all  of  us, as individuals, find it hard enough, and trying  to

maintain a certain level of censorship in this day and age  with

the Internet, with CD-ROMS, with VCDs, is an uphill task.  So we

have  got  to adopt a very practical approach in the way  we  go

about doing this.  The purist would say why not we start afresh.

As  Prof.  Chin  said,  how can there be a  distinction  in  the

electronic  media between film, publication, video  and  so  on.

That  may  be.   But  frankly,  the  Internet  phenomenon,   for

instance,  which  is a very recent phenomenon, has  exploded  so

rapidly  that  no  jurisdiction  in  the  world,  no  regulatory

authority in the world, has been able to fully catch up with it,

and  the  debate  is still swirling in all four corners  of  the

earth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is our general approach? Our general approach is

not to try and clean up the universe and anticipate all problems

caused  by  the  electronic media.  That is not  possible.   Our

basic philosophical approach is to creep.  In other words, where

do we start from?  We are used to films.  And in the old days, a

film  was a film.  It was a simple world.  Now films have become

electronic.  Films are no longer on reels.  They are on  videos.

They  are on CDs, VCDs, LCDs and what have you.  So what we have

tried  to  do is to creep from various acts into the  electronic

media.   Recently, we updated the Singapore Broadcasting Act  to

take into account some of the new multimedia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Newspaper and Publishing Act which also creeps

into  the electronic media.  We have the Films Act which  creeps

in the same direction.  We have the Undesirable Publications Act

today which also tries to creep in that direction.  Yes, in  the

pure  world of cyberspace, they all converge.  But in  the  real

world,  it will take some time before they converge and it  will

take  some time before our wisdom catches up with the challenges

posed  to  us  by this new technology.  So it is in that  spirit

that I table this Bill to you for your support and approval, not

to ask for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



change of policy on censorship, but please, to allow me to amend

the  law so that we keep up with the technology, so that we  can

maintain as best we can the level of censorship that we are used

to and which our community is comfortable with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, from time to time, our standards will change and

shift.   Lady Chatterley's Lover, once upon a time, shocked  the

community.  Today, it is a subject of historical study.   So  we

move  on.   Every  10 years, perhaps we take a  step  back.   We

appoint  an ecumenical council, gather all the Bishops  together

and  say, "Okay, let us make new pronouncements."  But we cannot

be  doing this year by year.  In the meantime, we have a  system

which  has worked well, which is practical in its administrative

simplicity,  which has served us well.  And why do I  say  that?

Because so few appeals in the end come up to me, which is a sure

sign that, by and large, Singaporeans are quite comfortable with

the way the present system is operating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether this Bill will place

additional  burdens  on Internet Service Providers  (ISPs).   In

fact,   ISPs  are  regulated  in  detail  under  the   Singapore

Broadcasting  Act and they are not required to blank  out  sites

unless  instructed  to  do  so  by  the  Singapore  Broadcasting

Authority.  We allow them to pass  through websites,  but  there

could  be  a conflict with this particular Bill.  We will  study

this  in  greater detail and if there is a need to, I  will,  by

special  exemption, exclude Internet Service Providers from  the

provisions of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of what is "obscene" and what is

"objectionable", Dr Toh See Kiat proposed a form of  words.   Mr

Jeyaretnam  takes  objection  to  the  existing  definition   of

"objectionable".  We can argue till the cows come home.  We will

never  agree  as  to what constitutes "objectionable"  and  what

constitutes   "obscenity".   Even  we  ourselves  in   different

settings  and  on different days may hold different  views.   It

depends so much on the context, on the mood, on the exigencies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



of  the  day.   It  is a futile exercise to  try  to  codify  so

precisely that a computer can interpret it.  It is not possible.

In  the  end,  it  is  a judgment by human  beings,  for  it  is

quintessentially a human matter.  And for this reason,  we  have

established  committees of jurymen who advise  us  and,  in  the

main, we will go by their advice.  And we accept that, from time

to time, as members in the committees change, as the public mood

changes,  their  views will also change and we creep  along.   I

think  that  is the wisest approach to take.  It is  the  method

which will set us most at ease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we as parents, as teachers, are uncomfortable, then we

can  have a debate in this House.  We can write letters  to  the

press.    We   can  post  messages  to  the  various  regulatory

authorities.   We can write to the Minister.  We  can  see  MPs.

And  all  these things will be taken into account, as they  have

been  sent to me from time to time, and then incremental changes

are  made.   There  is no need for dramatic moves  or  gestures.

What  we have inherited has served us well.  Let us just  modify

it,  tinker with it at the margins and move along.  This is  not

the time for us to make a major review of censorship policies in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various MPs have asked whether there are provisions to

allow  book  importers to submit in advance  samples  of  books,

magazines or comics which they hope to import, so that they will

not  be caught afoul of the law.  In fact, this is already done.

This  is  already the practice.  There already  exists  a  close

working  relationship  between the  controllers  and  importers.

They  are  called down for briefings regularly.   We  show  them

samples  of  what is at the margin,  of what is  acceptable  and

what is not.  When they submit samples, administratively, within

two  weeks,  a  reply  goes back to them.  We  will  even  allow

submissions  made in manuscript so that we can respond  quickly.

Our  idea  is not to place an additional hurdle on their  trade,

but to facilitate their work.  This is not a problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether our fees are excessive, no. They are just to cover

administrative costs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked whether it is possible to make

objectionable language an explicit provision in the Bill.   This

is  not necessary because in our determination of what should be

prohibited, of what is obscene and objectionable, language is an

integral  part of the determination process.  You  cannot,  when

you  are looking at the CD,  video, reading a book, magazine  or

comic  take the language out of it.  The language is an integral

part  of it.  It is part of the context and will always be taken

into account.  So I am more than happy to make this assurance to

Mr Shriniwas Rai and to my colleagues in the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is certainly not our intention to tighten our

standards  so  as  to  make it more difficult  for  artists  and

creative individuals to explore new possibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there checks against abuses? I have already explained

earlier that every controller has a panel to advise him.   Under

the  law, you can appeal to the Minister, and the Minister  will

first  cause  that appeal to be run through the  advisory  panel

before he makes a final decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked for consistent interpretation of the

word "obscene" under this Bill and as it is written in the Penal

Code.  I am not a legal expert but the lawyers tell me that they

are  entirely  consistent with the common law interpretation  of

what  is  obscene,  and  we  go by it.   And  certainly  in  the

implementation, there is no desire to have inconsistency between

these two laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sympathetic to Mr Tay's call for the process of

determining what is objectionable and what is obscene to be made

somewhat more formal.  I think for a start    I am not  sure  if

it is already made known to members of the public, but the lists

of  members  in  the  various panels and committees  are  freely

available  this evening, I will ask my officers to release  them

to  the media, so that we know who are the individuals  who  are

setting standards for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked whether we could provide the lists of

materials  which are considered objectionable.  These lists  are

made known to the trade and we make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



them  freely available to the public.  I will certainly consider

posting them on the Internet as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is gazetted is gazetted. So that is clearly available

in  the  public  domain.   What is objectionable  is  often  not

possible  to determine beforehand.  Take, for example,  Playboy.

We  all  know  what  Playboy is.  So that is  gazetted.   It  is

banned.  But there are any number of obscene magazines that  are

far  worse than Playboy, which are not banned, because  we  have

not  come across them yet.  We do not know what the titles  are.

So  they  are roughly classified under objectionable  materials.

By   definition,  it  is  not  possible  for  us  to  list   all

objectionable  materials.   They  are  listed  as  a  class   of

materials.   But  what  we  have already  objected  to,  we  can

certainly  list  them  and that list should  certainly  be  made

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung was concerned whether the evidence

placed before a controller is open ended or whether there  is  a

certain due process which allows the importer or the person  who

is  disadvantaged to challenge it or to make  appeals.   I  have

already explained that the controller does not make the decision

on  his  own.   He  is  guided by internal  guidelines  and,  in

marginal  cases,  by  committees  of  jurymen.   And  there   is

provision  for appeal and I am further guided by a committee  of

appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin was also concerned about the Films (Amendment)

Bill which has been postponed to the next sitting of Parliament.

He   reads  into  that  Bill  a  special  provision  for   child

pornography  and he asked why there is no special provision  for

child pornography in the Undesirable Publications Act.  In fact,

there is no special provision for child pornography in the Films

Act  about which we will have a debate later.  The provision  in

that Bill is to provide special penalties for those who make use

of  children either to assist in the making of a film or in  the

distribution  of  a film which we consider to be  objectionable.

It  does  not  cover the use of children acting in  pornographic

films.   In fact, in both Acts, there is no intention to make  a

special definition of "child



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



pornography".   Pornography  is  pornography.   It   varies   in

gravity.   It  does  not  mean that just  because  it  is  child

pornography,  it  must be worse than all other categories.   You

can  find  some  really  depraved  materials  involving  incest,

bestiality, the whole range which afflicts the human  condition.

We have not tried to identify these special categories either in

the UPA or in the Films Act.  Administratively, what we do is to

communicate  our concerns to the prosecutors.  They  would  take

the depravity of the pornographic material into account and I am

sure  the  judges  too  will take this  into  account  in  their

judgments and in the penalties that they mete out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we should abolish the distinction between films,

publications  and  broadcast, I have already  explained  earlier

that  while  there  may  be a case for this  in  the  electronic

multimedia, in the practical world, we start from where  we  are

and   the problems that we face today, even though we are  quite

sure  that in the future, the electronic media will be a  source

of  many of the problems.  What I envisage is that, from time to

time, our various Acts will have to be updated and maybe at some

point,  they  may  have to be fused.  But this must  take  place

slowly and through a process of evolution.  It is very difficult

to   attempt  a  comprehensive  omnibus  Bill  encompassing  all

aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked whether e-mails and faxes are covered

under  publications.  Yes, they are.  And if they are broadcast,

then they are also covered under the Singapore Broadcasting Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also asked whether the Act covers Internet

publications  for which it is difficult to decide  whether  they

are in intermediate form or final form.  On electronic magazines

or e-zines, they do.  If you read the words carefully, under the

various limbs, and under the various modes of transmission, they

cover  the whole gamut.  But if there is a need to make  further

clarifications later, because the technology keeps on  springing

up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



new surprises, then we will make the necessary amendments later.

But for the time being, there is no need to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Toh's question as to why there is a difference in the

definition  of  "supply"  here and in the  Films  Act,  that  is

because the intrinsic media, as they are now, are different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I have covered all the points

raised by Members.  I would just like to make one further  point

by  way of conclusion that, however hard we try, censorship will

not  seal  us hermetically from the world outside.  We know  the

challenges which the Internet poses to us and to the young.  But

there  is  also the postal service where you can put  things  in

brown  paper envelopes.  There are fax machines and there is  e-mail.   In  the end, what we are trying to do is to  distinguish

between  different  configurations of bits and  bytes  and  say,

"This  configuration I disallow."  It is not an easy  task.   It

can  only become more difficult in the future.  But what we  can

do  is  from  time  to time to take certain symbolic  stands  to

affirm   what  is  objectionable,  not  because  we  can  object

completely to their existence, but to make a point to  ourselves

and to the young that we look up to certain standards and we  do

not  try  to  legitimise everything which we  are  not  able  to

control.   That  really  underlies the  philosophy  of  all  our

various   attempts  at  censoring  publications  and  films   in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, may I ask the Minister by way of

clarification?  He assures us that there are advisory panels and

the  like.  But does he not think that there is a big difference

between having advisory panels and a board or a committee  which

makes  the decision and which can hear representations from  the

people who wish to put out the publication?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, the mechanism by which we

bring  in  public opinion and allow for standards and benchmarks

to shift from time to time was examined in great detail by Prof.

Tommy  Koh's Censorship Review Committee in 1992.  They were  on

the whole very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



satisfied with the mechanism that we had in place.  There may be

an  argument that sometime in the future we should formalise all

these panels and committees in statute.  As of now, this is  not

necessary.  They have worked well and they have served us  well.

Maybe in a few years' time

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> 21st century.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> When we make another overall

review, we can consider whether some of these mechanisms  should

be  made  more formal.  But what we really want is  a  mechanism

which  is  speedy and practical.  There are very few  complaints

today  from  the  trade.  As I have mentioned to  the  House,  I

myself have received very few complaints.  We do not really want

to  make the process so complicated.  Members will be amazed  at

the  number  of magazines and comic books that run  through  the

hands  of the censors.  My guiding principle is that they should

not  increase  their  staff.  In the old days,  they  would  run

through every video tape.  It is not possible now.  And when you

can  put  the  whole Encyclopedia Britannica into a  few  disks,

trying to censor everything is impossible.  We do it selectively

and in a practical way.  We have a practical mechanism in place.

It is not broken.  There is no need to fix it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment,

read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of this Bill is to enable the Government

to implement the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system.  Managing

demand for road use is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



important  and  key strategy in our integrated approach  towards

meeting our future transportation needs. We do this in two ways:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, ownership restraint measures which include

the Vehicle Quota System (VQS) and fiscal measures like ARF,

customs duty and road tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, usage management measures like the Area Licensing

Scheme (ALS) and Road Pricing Scheme (RPS).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ownership restraint measures, principally the VQS, has

enabled us to cap the growth of the vehicle population to 3% per

annum.   Our  vehicle population today stands at about  680,000,

about  double  the population ten years ago. We could  not  have

sustained  this  rate of growth if we had not during  this  same

period implemented the various road pricing schemes like the ALS

and RPS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have accumulated 23 years of experience in road pricing.

We  implemented the ALS for the Central Business District  (CBD)

since  1975.  In the last two years, we extended the concept  to

the expressways with RPS.  The decades of experience have proven

beyond  doubt  what most transport economists and town  planners

have  long  advocated, that road pricing is an effective  policy

for dealing with traffic congestion. Traffic conditions improved

significantly after road pricing. Motorists were willing to make

changes to their travel patterns, and viable travel alternatives

in  the form of bus and rail were available for commuters.    By

making the true cost of driving transparent, motorists have been

encouraged  to  choose a different route, destination,  time  of

travel,  or  even to decide not to make that trip at  all.  Some

have  also car-pooled, others have used public transport.  Those

who  choose to pay have been rewarded with a smoother and faster

drive.



<br><br><i>Reasons for Switching to Electronic Road Pricing System</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the current ALS and RPS schemes are manual

systems  and  they  have  several  inherent  shortcomings.   For

example,  they do not allow us to vary the road pricing  charges

according  to  the level of traffic congestion. Traffic  surveys

have shown that traffic flow during the peak hours vary, with  a

distinct peak-within-peak period. We should in theory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



levy a higher rate during this peak-within-peak period.  But  we

cannot do so under the manual system for practical reasons.  The

number  of licences for one would have to be increased from  the

current  14  types.    Both the motorists  and  our  enforcement

officers would be thoroughly confused, and enforcement would  be

much more difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another shortcoming of the present system is the need to

operate  and  maintain  a  wide distribution  network  including

roadside  booths  and  petrol  stations  to  sell  the   ALS/RPS

licences.  From the motorists' point of view, the need  to  look

for such outlets is always a major hassle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERP system will overcome the shortcomings of the manual

system.  It  will allow us to charge for road usage  in  a  more

flexible, efficient and equitable manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be able to implement a pricing structure that is

more  sensitive  to  the  actual  level  of  traffic  congestion

experienced on the roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system will be more convenient to motorists as it does

away  with  the hassle of queuing at sales outlets  to  buy  the

daily  or  monthly  licences.  An  automated  system  will  also

minimise  the  potential  for  human  error  in  the   area   of

enforcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, the ERP system will make motorists more

aware  of  the cost of road use. It will encourage motorists  to

choose  the  most optimal time, route and mode of transport  for

their journeys. The result will be a reduction in the number  of

trips made by private vehicles, more efficient use of our roads,

smoother flowing traffic and less pollution. As the roads become

less  congested,  we  can   review our vehicle  quotas  and,  if

feasible,   release  more COEs. Together, ERP  and  the  Vehicle

Quota  System will provide a long-term sustainable and effective

framework for managing the  traffic on our roads.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken us many years to realise the ERP System, from

conceptualisation to testing and now to final implementation. We

first started discussion on the concept in 1989.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International tenders were called for contractors to design

and supply the system. Tenderers were shortlisted in 1993.  Site

tests  were carried out on three prototype systems in  1994  and

1995, before we finally decided to go ahead with the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We virtually had to start from scratch. There was no system

similar to what we wanted elsewhere.  We could not refer to  any

other system at the time.  For example, we had some very special

requirements: the ability to process vehicles across many lanes,

and  to  process  them as they are travelling at  high   speeds.

That  was  one  requirement.   We also  called  for  reliability

standards  which  were higher than currently available   in  the

industry  and,  of course, there was the  need to customise  the

system to suit our local traffic and  weather conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ERP system has undergone extensive testing, both in the

laboratory as well as in the field, to ensure that it meets  the

highest technical standards. But as Members would appreciate, as

technology improves, there will be the need to  upgrade  and  we

will do so, and we will improve the ERP system over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA is currently in the midst of fitting the In-vehicle

Units  (or IUs) onto all vehicles. The exercise is scheduled  to

be  completed  by July this year.  The RPS and ALS gantries  are

also being progressively replaced by the ERP gantries.



<br><br><i>ERP Implementation Plan</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we will kick off ERP by implementing it

first on the East Coast Parkway before we extend it to the other

ALS  and  RPS points.  The reason for this phased implementation

is  prudent.  We want to ensure minimum hitches for  full  scale

operation of this complex system.  Motorists will also  be  able

to familiarise themselves with the system under this approach.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I announced recently that the two RPS points on the East

Coast  Parkway,  one  at Fort Road and the other  one  at  Ophir

Road,  will be replaced by the ERP system with effect  from  1st

April this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few weeks before the ERP begins at the East

Coast  Parkway  at  these two points, LTA will  be  testing  the

system using the five sets of gantries already installed at  the

East  Coast  Parkway, the Pan-Island Expressway and the  Central

Expressway.   This is to ensure that the various  equipment  and

the IUs installed on vehicles are functioning properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists are encouraged to insert Cashcards into their IUs

when  they  drive  through the gantries.  No deduction  will  be

made.  LTA will announce details of the tests shortly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERP rates - a matter of interest, I am sure, to Members

-  are now being finalised.  LTA is monitoring the traffic  flow

on  our  roads,  and will set the charges based  on  the  actual

traffic  pattern at the time of implementation.   We  will  also

make  full use of the flexibility of the ERP system to implement

`shoulder  pricing',  in  other words,  to  implement  different

pricing within the peak period and the period just outside that,

and  this  is  to spread out the traffic evenly during  the  RPS

operational hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, as I mentioned earlier, our experience has

shown  that  road pricing works.  It helps to bring  about  free

flow  of  traffic on our roads.  The ERP will be  more  than  an

improvement over the manual system of road pricing.   With  ERP,

we   are   able  to  fine-tune  the  charges  to  respond   more

specifically to the times and areas of congestion.  At the  same

time,  we will revise our vehicle tax structure and introduce  a

package of road tax rebates in order to shift more of the  fixed

cost of owning a vehicle to the discretionary cost of using  it.

I  will  be  announcing details of the new vehicle tax structure

and   the  road  tax  rebate  package  together  with  the   ERP

implementation plan next month before the Budget debate.  Before

we are able to make the requisite changes, we will have to amend

the Road Traffic Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the key provisions of the Road

Traffic (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill empowers the Minister for

Communications to prescribe road-user charges to be paid by  the

vehicle driver in connection with the use of any specified road.

The  Minister may also make rules to specify the roads for which

road-user  charges  will be levied, the days  and  hours  during

which a road-user charge is levied, the different charge amounts

for  the different roads, hours of the day, days of the week and

vehicle  classes or descriptions, and the manner  in  which  the

road-user charges are levied and collected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 also provides for the Registrar of Vehicles to

require a vehicle owner to produce his vehicle for inspection of

the In-vehicle Unit (IU).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill empowers an employee of the LTA to

require  a vehicle owner to furnish the identity and address  of

the  driver of his vehicle who is suspected to be guilty  of  an

offence under the Road Traffic Act or its rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill makes a vehicle owner liable for any

offence  under the new Part IA of the Road Traffic  Act  or  its

rules,  committed using his vehicle unless at the  time  of  the

offence his vehicle was stolen or illegally taken or used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Road Traffic Act is overseen by both the Minister

for  Communications and the Minster for Home Affairs, clauses  6

to  9  of  the  Bill  allow the Minister for  Communications  to

exercise the same powers under the provisions mentioned in those

clauses which are within his purview.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill relates to the authentication of any

notices, orders or other documents issued under the Road Traffic

Act or its rules.  It allows for documents such as summonses for

ERP   offences  to  be  generated  automatically  with  official

facsimile or electronic signatures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of ERP is a significant milestone in

the  history  of  land  transport  in  Singapore.   It  marks  a

fundamental  shift in the way we manage the use of our  roads  - from an ownership-biased regime to a more balanced one based  on

usage  as well as ownership.  This shift is necessary to  ensure

that  our  roads remain free from congestion to support economic

growth  and  a  better quality of life for  our  people.   I  am

confident  that the ERP system will help us manage  our  traffic

problems  well into the next century and bring us a  major  step

closer to our vision of a world-class land transport system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

to  speak in support of this Amendment Bill in the name  of  the

Minister for Communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill serves to tie up some of the administrative

and  legal  ends for the authorities to implement the electronic

road  pricing  system which is due to begin in  over  a  month's

time.   We  are all aware, as pointed out by the Minister,  that

this will be the first of its kind implementation programme  for

the  ERP in a big major city in the world.  Naturally there will

be  some nitty-gritty issues to tie up, especially to take  care

of the people who for one reason or another do not comply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can consider some grace period at the

beginning of this phasing-in to give the benefit of the doubt to

those drivers who may forgetfully miss the important thing to do

on those days.  A publicity blitz instructing drivers what to do

may be necessary to sink in the message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope the Minister can also allow not too costly

penalties in the beginning for offenders, in order to give  them

at  least  a  chance in the event that they commit the  offence,

especially as they may not be so familiar initially.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to seek a clarification on whether and how these

laws will apply to foreign cars, especially those from Malaysia,

whose drivers may be truly unaware of the hazards driving on the

highways  once the Amendment Bill is passed.  The  question  is,

for  those  Malaysian  cars, how to effect these  penalties,  as

mentioned  in  the  Amendment Bill, when  the  owners  of  these

vehicles, not necessarily the drivers, may be far away,  as  the

Amendment  Bill puts a lot of burden of penalties on the  owners

of the vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest also that some kind of leaflets, publicity

leaflets  on  the  ERP for foreign drivers,  may  be  necessary.

Also,  some kind of leaflets or publicity/introduction materials

on  planes may be necessary to familiarise the foreign  visitors

from  overseas.  In particular, I am not clear about new section

34E(6).   If a vehicle where the ERP device, the IU as mentioned

by  the Minister just now, is faulty or caused to be faulty, the

vehicle is seized, and if the vehicle after investigation is not

claimed,  it  may  be  sold and the net  proceeds  paid  to  the

Consolidated Fund.  Is the fault of non-compliance the fault  of

the  driver  or  the owner?  How is the burden of non-compliance

distributed  between owners and drivers?  Does pin-pointing  all

the cost and blame on the owners alone, as apparent in the Bill,

solve  the  problem?  Or does it provide a loophole  for  errant

drivers  to bypass the ERP process?  Should the Bill  not  place

some responsibility on the drivers who do not comply?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another section of the Amendment Bill, new section 34B

mentioned that the Minister may prescribe road-user charges.  As

mentioned  by  the Minister just now, he intends  to  make  this

announcement of the scheme of charges in the coming  Budget.   I

thank  the  Minister for pre-empting this point and in believing

that  this  principle of neutrality that he has  announced,  the

scheme  of  charges would be such as to generate neutral  budget

values.   If that is the case, I wonder whether it is  at  least

possible  to  consider announcing this scheme  of  charges  even

earlier, to let the public be informed on these various  schemes

of charges and adjustments so that there is ample time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



for the members of the public to re-evaluate switching transport

mode and for making investment decisions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill, but

I have two simple points to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the new sections 34C and 34D refer to "such

electronic or computerised or other facilities".  Because of the

ejusdem  generis principle of statutory interpretation, I  think

this  is not sufficiently broad to cover technologies which  may

use, for example, optics (or light), microwave, radar, sonic  or

other  non-electronic telecommunication media. Our  ERP  devices

would  be  using all these technologies too, I suppose,  and  in

fact  there is a word which would be broad enough to  cover  all

these technologies.  It is a word which is used in section 65 of

the  Evidence  Act.  I refer to the word "telematic"  and  would

urge  the  Minister to consider inserting that word in front  of

the word "electronic".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I refer to the new section 139A and would like

the  Minister  to  clarify  that "an official  facsimile"  of  a

signature would have certain control measures and safeguards  to

prevent fraudulent notices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my concern again is with

the  concentration of power, and before I finish, I  propose  to

read what a former Deputy Prime Minister of this Government  had

to say about this.  I see under the new amendment, clause 3, new

section 34B, "The Minister may prescribe road-user charges to be

paid  in  connection with the user of any specified road."   And

then  under  the  new  section 34D, he  is  allowed  to  specify

different charges for different time users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 143 of the Constitution enacts that no tax or levy

may be imposed, except upon the authority of law.  Of course, it

may  be  argued that section 34B is the authority.   But  it  is

questionable whether this complies with that Article because the

Minister would appear to be given a carte blanche as to what the

charge  or charges should be.  If he is in a generous  mood,  he

might reduce it.  If he is not in a generous mood, he might just

up it.  Is it right that a Minister should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



given the power to decide what tax or levy should be imposed  on

citizens   in   Singapore  when  under  the   Constitution   the

requirement is that it should first be authorised by  a  written

law,  that  is,  law  passed  by  Parliament?   Should  not  the

prescribed  road-user  charges be first approved  by  Parliament

before they are put into use or collected from road-users?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is again this concentration of power in the

Registrar  as  seen under the new section 34E, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

"The  Registrar may remove any device or appurtenance  which  he

considers to be fitted in contravention of any of the provisions

of this Part or the rules made under this section."  There would

appear  to  be no recourse for any owner or driver  against  the

decision of the Registrar or authorised officer.  Subsection (4)

deals  with  a  person who fails to comply with a notice  issued

under  subsection  (1) who shall be guilty of an  offence  which

would  suggest that a person who fails to comply with the notice

shall  be  prosecuted  in  court.   But  subsection  (1)  merely

requires  the  person on whom notice is served  to  produce  the

vehicle,  and  by  subsection (4), if he does  not  produce  the

vehicle,  then he may be prosecuted.  Subsection  (4)  does  not

seem  to apply to subsection (3) where the Registrar decides  to

remove  any device or appurtenance fitted into the car.   Is  it

not,  again  may I ask, right that a right of appeal  should  be

given  to  the aggrieved person, not to the Minister or  to  any

other  higher officer, but to the court so that the decision  of

the Registrar may be challenged in the court?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said at the beginning that I was going to quote what a

former Deputy Prime Minister of this Government had to say about

the  concentration of power.  May I just read what he said,  and

this is none other than Dr Toh Chin Chye who was a former Deputy

Prime Minister.  And he was reported to have said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now everything is centralised and the computer databanks

make  it  easier  for  more and more power to  be  concentrated.

Anyone  who applies for a job now has to fill in a form  with  a

complete  history.   Everybody  carries  an  identity  card  and

everything is in the computer.  I see that even people who  take

video tapes of people's weddings now have to get a licence.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



amount of control is just fantastic.  The danger is that we have

no  check  on the use of power.  [May I repeat that, Mr Speaker,

Sir, "the danger is that we have no check on the use of power."]

Yet,  few people understand the significance of this.  They  are

just resigned to it.  It is called democratic centralism.  Well,

it is centralised, all right, but it is far from democratic.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the Minister for Information and the Arts, in

moving  his Bill, said, "I have very few appeals.  I  have  very

few  objections."  Perhaps, I should have read this to him then.

Is  it  because  our people have become resigned  to  all  these

controls  and feel that they are just helpless in  the  face  of

power that is overwhelming?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  once  the  Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill is passed  today,

land transportation in Singapore will enter a new era.  It means

that from now onwards the Government can levy any charges on the

motorists at any time and  anywhere, or to increase the levy  on

any particular stretch of road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most countries in the world, when the government levies

charges or tolls on the motorists, it is to recover the cost  of

construction of the road.  In Singapore, our cars are  the  most

expensive  in  the world.  The Government has  imposed  so  much

taxes  on the cars that they far exceed the cost of construction

of  the roads.  It does not  have to resort to levies to recover

the  construction  cost.  It is said that the experts are of the

opinion that road pricing could help to  alleviate congestion on

the  road.   I am not an expert.  But I know that the system  is

operated  in Singapore in such a way that whenever  there  is  a

congestion  on  any  particular  stretch  of  the  highway,  the

Government   would levy charges for the use of this  stretch  of

road.  If  there is still congestion despite the levy, the  levy

will  be increased again and again until  such a point when  the

motorists  find it  too expensive to drive through that  stretch

of  road,  and  avoid  passing there. Then,  there  will  be  no

congestion and traffic will be flowing smoothly.  However,  when

the  motorists do not use that stretch  of  road, they will have

to  use other alternative roads.  As a result,  congestion  will

be transferred to another part of the island.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



Then  what would happen?  Eventually, are we going to have  road

pricing  on  each and every road in Singapore  and  to  keep  on

increasing the charges so that there will be no more congestion?

Is that a rational solution?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, the Government used the excuse of controlling car

population  in Singapore to implement the COE system,  resulting

in  the  cost  of  owning a car in Singapore  being  exorbitant.

Now,  with the quota system in place,  the Government says  that

with  the  introduction of  the ERP system, more  COEs  will  be

issued  so  that more people can own cars.  So on the one  hand,

the  Government says it wants to restrict the growth of the  car

population  in order to ease congestion, yet on the other  hand,

it is going to issue more COEs to increase the number of cars on

the  road.   The  fact   is that the Government  is  encouraging

people to buy cars, and when there are too many cars on the road

resulting in congestion, it would find justification in imposing

heavier  charges  for the use of the road,   and  the  motorists

will have to pay more to the Government.  Apart from paying road

tax for owning a car, the motorists have to pay again every time

they  use the roads.  This means multiple charges on the people,

and more revenue to the  Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are well-to-do, these road charges mean

nothing to them.  They can afford it, and by paying these  extra

charges, they enjoy congestion-free travelling on the road.  But

for those who have to depend on their vehicles for their work or

to  earn a living, the burden would be so heavy!  So, is this  a

fair  system?  The elite from the PAP Government introduced this

system  to  reap  in   more  levies and  more  revenue  for  the

Government.  But they do not seem to have solved the problem  of

congestion  on  the  road.   It  seems  that   the  Government's

solution  is basically to squeeze more money from the motorists.

Squeeze  them until they could not afford it, give  up  driving,

and    sell  their cars.  The Government will then say that  the

traffic congestion problem is now solved!  The policy of the PAP

Government  is to have this pricing mechanism.  Levying  charges

to  deter motorists from driving has very little effect  on  the

wealthy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



people.   But it certainly increases the burden of the  ordinary

citizens.   Under  this  monetary policy and  with  the  charges

increasing, of course, the cost of doing business  in  Singapore

will   keep   on  rising.   This  will  definitely  affect   our

competitiveness!

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first of all thank

the two speakers who supported the provisions of the Bill.  They

have  raised  several queries which I would like  to  deal  with

first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen asked several questions concerning the

publicity  for  the ERP system.  I do share  with  Mr  Chay  his

concerns about having adequate publicity and this is the  reason

why  I  have asked the LTA to launch a publicity campaign before

the  implementation  of  the  ERP.  And  this  public  education

programme was in fact started last year when the fitting of  the

In-vehicle  Units  (IUs)  was  started,  I  think,  sometime  in

September.  During this publicity programme, motorists  will  be

educated  not just on the operation of the system but  also  the

technical functions of the In-vehicle Unit.  Members may  recall

there  were  information booklets that  were  sent  to  all  the

motorists.   There was also a publicity blitz on television  and

newspapers  to explain the rationale for the ERP scheme  and  to

increase  the  awareness  of the ERP  scheme.   Obviously,  that

message  has not got through to Mr Low Thia Khiang  and  I  will

deal with his concerns later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publicity for motorists will not stop here of course

because  we are going to implement the scheme in April which  is

only 1 1/2 months away.  LTA would be stepping up  the  publicity

programme.   In  the  next  week, they will  be  announcing  the

testing  of the IUs whereby motorists will be invited  to  drive

through  the  gantries in order to allow motorists a  chance  to

actually make use of the IUs, to test them and be familiar  with

the  system.  The LTA will be giving some details on this  later

on.  Closer to the time of the implementation, which is sometime

in March, the publicity will be stepped up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asked about the foreign cars, what is going to

happen to foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



motorists.   By this, I mean Malaysian motorists in  particular.

Malaysian  motorists  will be subject  to  the  same  rules  and

charges  as  our local motorists.  So long as they use  the  ERP

price roads, they will be subject to the same charges.  And this

is in fact no different from the current manual system where all

the  ALS/RPS charges are also applicable to Malaysian motorists.

We  recognise the fact that Malaysian motorists do not  come  to

Singapore so frequently and they may not be aware or subject  to

the  same  campaign of publicity blitz.  We have therefore  made

special provisions to distribute brochures and leaflets  at  the

Causeway  as well as at the Tuas Checkpoint.  So every Malaysian

motorist coming in over the last few months has been given  this

brochure in order to make the Malaysian motorists more aware  of

what  is the ERP system, where they can fit the In-vehicle  Unit

if  they wish to, if they are frequent visitors to Singapore, or

if they do not wish to, where they can get a temporary IU.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also suggested that we may want to consider giving

some  publicity to those non-Malaysian motorists,  for  example,

those who arrive by air.  I think this is a good suggestion.   I

will  take it up.  For example, they may be coming here and they

rent a car.    We can certainly implement that suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the penalties for ERP violations, I would like to

inform him that the penalties will be consistent with those  for

similar violations of the ALS and RPS system.  Yes, this will be

a  brand  new  system.  It will be something that will  be  very

unfamiliar to many motorists initially, and I would expect  that

there  will  be a little bit of confusion in the  beginning.   I

take  his point and I assure Mr Chay that I will ask the LTA  to

be  flexible in its enforcement of the ERP system in  the  first

one or two weeks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, he asked about new section 34E. Section 34E

actually  talks about the liability of owners vis-�-vis  drivers

or  users of the vehicles.  What this section seeks to do is  to

allow the Registrar of Vehicles to detain a vehicle if the owner

fails  to  comply  with the notice to produce  the  vehicle  for

inspection and testing of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



the  IU.   This is really to cater for situations where the  LTA

suspects  that the IU has been tampered with.   We  are  talking

about  600,000  In-Vehicle  Units by  the  time  we  finish  the

exercise.  The possibility of tampering is a very real one and I

think  it  is  important, for the integrity of the system,  that

provisions  are put in place in order to allow any tampering  of

the  IUs  to  be  nipped  in  the bud  before  it  becomes  more

pervasive.   This provision is really to allow the Registrar  of

Vehicles  to actually call in a vehicle, test it and check  that

no  tampering has taken place.  I hope that clarifies the  point

for Mr Chay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> I am more concerned about the burden of

non-compliance  between  owners of vehicles and  drivers.   When

the owners comply, the drivers may be deliberately bypassing the

ERP process.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> In the same way that other provisions under

the Road Traffic Act require the owner to furnish particulars of

either  himself  or  the  driver, ie, whoever  was  driving  the

vehicle  at  that time.  So, in the same way, it is  up  to  the

owner to furnish the relevant particulars of the driver.  If  he

is  not the driver, then it is up to him to furnish the relevant

particulars.   Thereupon,  of course,  the  LTA  will  take  the

necessary  steps to either prosecute the driver  or  the  owner,

whoever is appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asked whether we can announce the scheme

earlier  in order to give the public time to consider  and  make

decisions.   I presume those decisions refer to whether or not a

person wishes to buy a car.  This is precisely the reason why  I

will  be  making the announcement after the Budget statement  is

made, because it will allow motorists, in fact, before the  next

COE  bidding cycle starts, to know what is the new tax structure

like,  what is it going to be, how it will affect him,  what  is

the  quantum  of  the  rebates that will be  given,  whether  he

decides  to  continue to bid for a car or whether he  wishes  to

look  for  other  alternative travel modes.  So sufficient  time

will be given whereby all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



motorists  or  would-be motorists will be able to make  such  an

informed  decision.  This will also allow Members in the  House,

during   the  Committee  of  Supply  debate,  to  further   seek

clarification  on  the matter or to debate  the  matter  in  the

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to Dr Toh See Kiat who made two points. The

first  point  was his suggestion, I believe,  to  add  the  word

"telematic".   I  think  the intent behind  this  suggestion  is

correct.  He is right in saying that it is likely that with  the

progress of technology, with the advancements in this particular

field,  that it is likely that we will use such technologies  in

the future.  I thank him for his suggestion and I will look into

this.  For the moment, I would like to inform him that I believe

the proposed provisions are adequate for the purpose today.  And

it  is not intended to preclude, of course, the use of such  new

technologies in the future, as and when they become available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also wanted to know what is the official facsimile.

Basically,  the  official facsimile refers to computer-generated

or rubber stamp signatures which I think some, if not all of us,

are familiar with when we receive either property tax notices or

even  traffic  violations  today.  It is  essentially  the  same

thing.   It  is  simply  a question of making  the  dispatch  of

notices,  offers of composition and so on more  efficient.   The

term,  as  I  said, refers to the computer-generated  signature.

Similar provisions exist in other legislation dealing with other

Government business like property tax and traffic summonses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have covered Dr Toh's questions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> My question was more on control measures.

Could  the Minister assure us on the control measures  for  this

because it is mass produced?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The control measures pertain to, first of

all,  signatures which can only be used by authorised  officers.

The   control   measures  are  contained  within  the   internal

housekeeping rules and regulations pertaining to the use of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



such important signatures.  These are in-house regulations which

are regularly audited to make sure that there is no abuse.  As I

said,  this  is  quite  a common practice for  other  Government

departments as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the points made by Mr J B Jeyaretnam. I

think the main thesis of Mr Jeyaretnam's point was that there is

too much concentration of power.  I do not know how that linkage

is  made  from  what  he  has quoted,  ie,  there  is  too  much

concentration of power, and new sections 34B, 34D and even  34E.

I  think the nexus is a very tenuous one.  I guess this is  just

another  opportunity  for  him to  make  his  favourite  speech.

However,  having made it, I think I owe him an  answer  in  that

respect.   Sections 34B and 34D are simply provisions which  are

actually  in  compliance with what is in the Constitution,  that

there  be no tax or no levy that can be imposed except upon  the

authority  of  the law.  And this is the reason why  I  come  to

Parliament to seek approval for such a charge to be imposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question may be: why do we not specify the charge in

this  particular Bill?  The answer is very simple.  The  charges

may change.  The levies may change from time to time.  It is not

uncommon  for  the  levies to change fairly  quickly  or  fairly

frequently  in response to changes in the traffic pattern.   And

this  is  precisely  the  reason why the  ERP  system  is  being

implemented  in  the  first place.  It is being  implemented  in

order  to respond to traffic patterns.  If we were to come  back

to  Parliament  every time we need to change  those  charges,  I

think Parliament is going to be utterly bogged down by all these

various  changes.   When we implemented  the  ALS  in  1975,  we

changed those charges after one month.  We implemented a certain

rate.   We  found  that it was too high because roads  were  too

free, underutilised.  We changed it one month later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, we have had occasions to vary those charges

depending on how the traffic pattern built up, depending on  how

the  traffic pattern moved.  It is quite within the  purview  of

the Ministry.  In fact, it is the responsibility of the Ministry

to keep track



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



of these things to make sure that the ultimate objective of this

scheme, which is to remove traffic congestion, is achieved.  And

you  cannot  achieve that by having to come to Parliament  every

time  just to change the levy from $1 to $2 or from $2 to $1.50.

I  do  not  think Members of Parliament are going to  take  very

kindly   to   that  kind  of  amendment.   So  it  is   a   very

straightforward  matter.  It is something  which  is  completely

within the purview and the responsibility of the Ministry or the

Minister  concerned, and this is the reason why we have sections

34B  and 34D.  Within these two particular provisions, it is not

just a question of what are the charges.  It is also the time of

the  charges, the location of the charges.  Do we have  to  come

back  to  Parliament every time we want to add a new  gantry  or

remove one?  Or every time we want to move the time from 7.00 am

to  7.30  am, or from 9.00 am to 9.15 am?  I think it is totally

unnecessary.   It is really quite an administrative matter which

should rightly be left to the Ministry concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a matter of whether the Minister is in a generous

mood  or  not that the charges are levied up or down.   I  think

even Mr Jeyaretnam does not believe when he said that.  However,

the fact is that he has given me an opportunity to explain again

why we have to change the charges.  Yes, the charges have to  be

varied  but it is only varied for the ultimate purpose of making

sure  that  the  traffic is free flowing.  And there  have  been

occasions  where charges have actually come down, as there  have

been  occasions where it has gone up.  Ultimately,  the  traffic

engineers will recommend what is the optimal charge.  We do  not

want the roads to be under utilised but we certainly do not want

them  to be clogged up either.  It is very simple.  Surveys  are

carried  out.   Recommendations are made by the  Land  Transport

Authority  and they are then discussed and decisions  are  made.

It is certainly not at the whims and fancies of the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to Mr Low Thia Khiang's concerns about the

ERP system.  They are not new concerns.  They are concerns which

have  been  voiced many times in this House by  him.   That,  of

course, does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



not  mean  that those concerns are valid.  It just simply  means

that  it  is politically expedient for him to make those points.

Why do I say that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What is wrong with that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> No, nothing wrong at all. But I will seek

to  explain  to the other Members of the House who  are  not  so

blindfolded in their thinking as to why those concerns  are  not

valid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year alone, I had occasion to monitor very closely

what  are  the  developments  in this  area,  road  pricing,  in

particular.   For this year, the question of traffic  congestion

and  road pricing has been discussed in many, many journals  and

magazines.   Asiaweek  wrote about the  traffic  jams  in  Kuala

Lumpur.   Asia  Magazine wrote about the traffic jams  in  other

Asian cities.  Newsweek wrote about traffic jams in Europe.  The

Economist wrote an article called "Road Pricing".  In  fact,  it

was  entitled,  on  the  front cover "Jam  today,  Road  pricing

tomorrow".  Let me take this opportunity to quote part  of  that

Economist article:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If roads continue to be operated as one of the last relics

of a Soviet-style command economy, then the consequences will be

worsening traffic jams and eventual Bangkok-style gridlock.  If,

on  the  other  hand, roads were priced like  any  other  scarce

commodity, then better use would be made of existing  space  and

the  revenues raised could be used to improve public  transport.

The  mere  fact  of making motorists pay their  way  would  free

capacity  to such an extent that bus travel would become  easier

and faster, and subsidies can be reduced.  Politicians have long

shied  away  from  this  approach because  it  is  difficult  to

persuade  voters to pay for something that has long  been  free.

But some governments are starting to accept that there may be no

alternative.   Charging for ownership rather than use,  as  most

tax systems do, make little sense.  Heavy fixed costs, including

vehicle  duties,  insurance and depreciation,  merely  encourage

drivers  to  use their cars more because the perceived  marginal

costs of motoring are so small.  The way forward must be to make

cars more expensive to use.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of the article goes as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Those who argue that road pricing is unfair because it

discriminates against the poor [I think this is what Mr Low Thia

Khiang has said] ignore the fact that the people too poor to own

a  vehicle  suffer  the  ill-effects of congestion  without  the

benefits of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



personal  mobility.  And if the revenues were  used  to  improve

public transport, the poor would benefit disproportionately.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So really the purpose of electronic road pricing is

fundamentally as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to restructure our tax system and restructure the way

we  manage  our traffic to manage our roads.  The  objective  of

this is to make our transport system more efficient, to keep our

roads  which are our economic arteries free-flowing.   Why?   So

that  Singapore  can  remain as a good  place  to  do  business.

Surely,  ultimately, that must be of benefit to  everybody   the

poor, the rich, the businessmen and the consumers.  Rather  than

saying that this is going to add to the burden of businesses,  I

argue  that  in fact a good transport system free of  congestion

actually  helps  to lower business cost in the long  run  rather

than  to add to their cost.  As the Economist article says,  you

do  not  say that the ERP penalises the poor and helps the  rich

because  the people who drive cars cannot be considered poor  by

any  means.  If they can afford a car, surely they are not  that

poor.   It  is the people who are in the buses who are the  ones

who are ultimately going to be one of the main beneficiaries  of

free-flowing roads.  So I say that, rather than looking upon the

ERP  as  an  enemy,  it is actually an ally of the  businessmen,

including the small businessmen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification from the

Minister?   First, the Minister refers to the Economist  article

for justification of the ERP.  My question is: will the Minister

say how much of the revenue collected from ERP will be committed

to  the  improvement of the public transportation system in  the

future?   Second,  we  are still fresh  in  our  minds  how  the

Government dragged its feet on building the North-east line  and

I  think  the  Member for Potong Pasir will tell  you  that  the

Government is very stingy in its expenditure on public transport

and  it is not going to build the Sennett line. Third, would the

current  ERP  system capture the identity of a car  that  passes

through  the  gantry?   If  so,  could  this  information  track

effectively the travelling pattern of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



particular car or the owner of the car?  How would the  Minister

propose to safeguard this information to prevent its abuse?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, there is really no need for this

Government to commit to expenditure on public transport.  We had

a debate in this House on the White Paper on land transport.  In

that  paper,  we  committed to the development of a world  class

public  transport system.  In order to develop that, the  amount

of  money  that  has  to be spent on public transport,  ie,  the

amount  of money that has to be spent on building MRT lines  and

LRT  lines,  is  well in excess of the amount of money  that  is

being  collected in terms of tax at any point in  time.   If  it

were  that  simple  that  we just link  the  collection  of  ERP

revenues  with  public transport, I think that  is  one  of  the

simplest  decisions we could take.   But that does  not  address

the  question about what kind of public transport we want,  what

kind of transport management measure we want, what kind of roads

we want, and what kind of infrastructure development we want.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify. What I am saying is that we need to

justify  every expenditure, every project, on public  transport.

If  we  can justify that expenditure, we will be able to proceed

to  build.   The North-east line is a classic example.   We  are

going  to  spend $5 billion on the North-east line.  We  started

ground breaking early this year.  Even as my Ministry is working

on  the  budget  for the North-east line, we have  gone  to  the

Ministry  of  Finance for funds and the Ministry of Finance  has

given  us  the  approval  to proceed  in  spite  of  a  possible

reduction  in  Government revenues, as a result of the  economic

slowdown.  This is because it is an economically justifiable and

worthwhile project.  It is not something that we created out  of

political  expediency.  Neither was it because of  Mr  Low  Thia

Khiang nor Mr Chiam See Tong that we took so long to build  that

line.   It  was because we needed to do the studies and convince

the Government that this was a project worth spending $5 billion

of taxpayers' money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it on a macro basis, expenditure on public

transport infrastructure is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



a  commitment that has been made.  This commitment was  made  in

this  House  when this House approved the White  Paper  on  land

transport.  I do not believe that the Member actually  made  any

comments in that particular debate.  But a major debate did take

place  in  this House.  Many Members spoke and one  of  the  key

recommendations of that White Paper was a major  change  in  the

way  we  fund public transport infrastructure, especially  heavy

rail  transport infrastructure. So I do not think there  is  any

need for me now to make any particular commitment on expenditure

of  public transport.  The developments this year and  the  next

few  years will amply demonstrate the amount of effort  that  is

being made in this area.  This is one of the key pillars of  our

total transportation policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficult part is to convince Singaporeans that

transport management measures and road usage management measures

like ERP and the Vehicle Quota System are beneficial in the long

run.  That  is  the difficult part.  But we know  that  this  is

something  that is worth doing and we know that  we  can  do  it

because, at the same time, we are using the money that has  been

collected for public transport expenditure.  Ultimately, as  the

Economist article puts it, when people see the benefits of  road

pricing  and the benefits of all these measures, it will  become

more acceptable.  Let me quote to the Member another part of the

article.  It said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Governments around the world are still nervous about the

impact  of road pricing.  But as more and more charging  schemes

are implemented and as the benefits of less congested unpolluted

roads  are felt, attitudes will change.  In 20 years' time  when

paying for road space will be regarded as the norm, people  will

look  back and wonder why they were ever prepared to put up with

the pollution, noise and paralysis of today's cities.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe he asked another question about the identity of

cars  passing through the ERP.  The system that we have adopted,

which  is the Cashcard system, bills cars only as they are going

through.    So  the identity of the vehicle is only captured  if

there  is  a violation.  In other words, if you pass  through  a

gantry  with your Cashcard inserted and fully loaded, the charge

is deducted, there will be no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



problems  and there will be no identification.  But, of  course,

if  there is some violation, whether it is insufficient  balance

in the Cashcard or  you do not have a Cashcard, or whether IU is

faulty,   yes,   there   will   be   an   identification.   That

identification  will  be captured by a camera  for  purposes  of

sending   you  the  notice  of  composition.   That   particular

information  will only be kept for so long as it is required  to

send  you  the  summons.   Thereafter, it will  not  be  in  the

system.   In  other words, there is no possibility of  violating

the privacy of any particular motorist.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister by way of

clarification?   He  mentions, really jibes,  about  my  Party's

concern  that  the whole thing is a discrimination  against  the

poor.   Will he not agree that the whole system of road pricing,

ALS, or what have you,  does not take into account the needs  of

the  small tradesmen or persons whose jobs needs them to have  a

car  to  get  around, which adds to their cost,  reducing  their

income  considerably  whilst allowing those  who  are  rich  and

wealthy to have unlimited access to our roads?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think it would be worthwhile perhaps for

Mr  Jeyaretnam to hold his fire on this one until I announce the

details   of  the  road  tax  restructuring,  the  vehicle   tax

restructuring  and the road tax  rebates.  Then  we  can  debate

this  in  the  Committee  of Supply.  It  can  then  be  a  more

meaningful  debate  because  at the  moment  he  does  not  have

information available.  If he raises this matter again after the

details are announced, we can have another discussion on that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment,

read a Third time and passed.

of any Member?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House resolves that, as representatives of the

people,  in  order  to show our solidarity with  them  in  their

hardships  during the current financial uncertainty,  we  should

voluntarily  take  a  reduction  of  25%  in  the  salaries  and

allowances  drawn by us as Ministers, Parliamentary  Secretaries

and Members.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Members present in this House and who were

Members in 1985 may recall that I moved a similar motion in  the

1985   recession.   The  Leader  of  the  House  recalled   that

immediately  when I mentioned it to him when I met  him  at  the

Australian Day function.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>5.34 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, read what I said then

because a lot of what I said then is relevant to this motion  as

it  was when I spoke in 1985.  But I do not propose to read what

I  said then.  I do not wish to burden Members who heard it once

to  hear  it  a second time.  I said then, however, that  I  was

quite  sure  that  the  then Leader  of  the  House  would  have

withdrawn the Whip to leave Members to vote according  to  their

own conscience.  But, of course, that was not the case.  So I do

not know whether it is too vain a hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



now that the Whip has been withdrawn and that Members would vote

according to their own conscience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said more than once that we

in  this  House,  I  suppose excluding those  who  are  here  by

nomination, by appointment, who have come into this House  after

going  to the voters to be chosen, to be in this House as  their

representatives,  are  the  people's  voice.   We  are  here  as

representatives and when we went to them to seek their vote,  we

were identifying ourselves - let me make that quite clear - with

their problems, with their hopes and with their aspirations.  So

when  seeking their vote we were claiming to be one of them,  to

represent  them  in this House and to speak on their  behalf  on

matters  that affected them or their families.  So that  is  the

central point - that we identified ourselves to be with them  in

their problems and in their hardships when we went to seek their

votes.   And that must not be lost sight of once we are  in  the

House.   As  I  said,  this is the people's  House,  not  anyone

else's.   It  is not the Government's House; it is the  people's

House.   And  we  are  here  as people representing  the  people

outside this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make another observation, and that is, it was

suggested in 1985 that my motion was a silly one because it  was

no  cure for the ills the country was then facing.  May I assure

Members if that suggestion is going to be made again, that  this

is  not being proposed as a cure for our economic ills.   It  is

proposed  simply and solely out of my conviction that we  should

try and identify ourselves with the people in everything.  There

are,  of  course, two differences between this  motion  and  the

motion  that  I moved in 1985.  One is that whereas that  motion

sought  to  make the resolution a binding one on  Ministers  and

Members  of the House, this motion makes it a voluntary gesture,

a decision to be made by each Member for himself or herself.  It

is  not a resolution to bind all Members but leaving it entirely

to the conscience or the political will of the Member concerned.

And  the  other difference, of course, is that, and I  shall  be

coming back to this, there is a huge difference now between  the

salaries that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



we  were  drawing  in  1985,  particularly  Ministers,  and  the

salaries we are drawing today in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That motion in 1985 was, not that I expected it to be

accepted, not accepted, was dismissed ,and I expect this  motion

will  probably  suffer the same result.  And I expect  that  the

same  jibes  will be made, as the jibes have been made  even  in

this present session of Parliament, that it is all publicity and

it  is  all  politics  of envy.  Whatever  may  be  the  result,

whatever may be the jibes, will not deter me from doing  what  I

think  is  right,  because  in the  final  analysis,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, it is doing the right thing by the people.   That

is the final analysis - doing the right thing.  And the question

that  has to be answered is whether it is the right thing to  do

at  this  particular  moment in our country's  history  for  the

leaders  voluntarily to take a reduction in  their  salaries  or

allowances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to dwell at length on the reasons for this

motion.   I think Members are only too keenly aware and we  have

heard  it  in  this  House, and we have read about  it,  of  the

economic  downturn  that  this country  is  facing  and  of  the

difficulties  that  our people will have in  trying  to  make  a

living  in  this place.  Of course, I am not talking  about  the

people  who draw huge salaries and have wealthy incomes.   I  am

talking about our citizens who draw $1,500 and less.  And may  I

remind the Members, as I did when I moved a motion on Ministers'

salaries  that  62% or so of our workers are earning  less  than

$1,500 per month.  They will find it very hard.  It is not  just

them.   There is the loss of jobs.  We heard and read of  people

being  laid off, retrenched.  I thought I might be able to  give

Members  the  numbers that have been laid off  since  July  last

year.   I wrote to the Ministry of Labour and I had been told  I

could  not have it now.  It would be released at the end of  the

month.   I  do not know why I could not have had the figures  to

release to the Members at this particular moment.  It cannot  be

an  official secret.  But be that as it may, there are many  who

have lost their jobs and there will be very, very many more  who

might lose their jobs, maybe not in the same degree or level  as

the  people  in Indonesia and in other countries  who  may  lose

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



jobs.   But  there will be people who will suffer,  who  may  be

thrown out of employment.  What are we going to say to them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the problem of re-employment for these

people.  I have come across several people, especially those who

are  over  40 or 45 years, who have told me that it is virtually

impossible  to  get another job and yet, we hear  from  time  to

time, "Oh,  re-employment is quite easy."  But we never have the

figures as to how many of them have been re-employed and  within

what period of time.  Only last week or so, we saw in the papers

that  62%  of our workers or the less well-to-do in our  society

have savings which will tide them over only for three months  at

the  most.  This was an independent survey that was carried  out

and  is  not something that I am just plucking out of  my  head.

But it may very well be that 10% or even 20% may not have enough

savings  to  tide them over even for one month.   But  62%  have

savings which can only tide them over for three months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the drop in the businesses. And we heard

this  afternoon from the Minister that there was a drop.   I  do

not  know what percentage he mentioned.  So life is going to  be

much  harder for most of our citizens.  For at least 60% or  65%

of  our citizens, life is going to be much harder.  We can  only

hope  that  it will not be a very long time, it will  be  fairly

short,  and that we could perhaps get back on the road.  But  we

have  got to deal with the situation as we now see it,  and  not

just tell our people, "Well, it is all right.  Don't worry.   We

will  be  okay  in 6 months' time."  They want to know  what  is

being  done for them at the moment and how they are going to  be

helped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this downturn in business leading to loss of

jobs,  parallel to it is the rise in the cost of living.   Since

the  last elections, price of almost everything has gone up.   I

mentioned  this  when I asked for a Parliamentary  committee  on

prices.   Transport, education, health, everything is going  up.

And  only  very  recently,  there was the  announcement  of  the

polyclinic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



charges going up.  I had a question for the Minister for  Health

to  ask him by how much had the cost increased.  But my question

was not reached.  So I am not able to deal with the increase  in

the  cost and how much is being collected by way of the increase

in the charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I meet people from time to time who tell me of the

heavy  cost  of  health  care  and particularly  for  the  older

citizens  who  need more health care than the young  ones.   And

they  say,  "We try and avoid going to the doctors  as  long  as

possible.  We try and avoid seeking medical treatment because of

the  cost involved."  I do not want to labour this.  I am saying

that  it must be quite clear to all of us that life is going  to

be very hard for 60% of our citizens in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister announced on 19th January this

year,  that there would be a cut back in the expenditure because

the Government expected a fall in the revenue.  It feels that it

would  not  be  able to collect enough.  He announced  that  the

Government  proposed  to cut back on the expenditure  except  on

defence  and education.  My Party responded to that announcement

and  expressed its disappointment that whilst the Government was

prepared  or  getting ready to cut back on expenditure  for  the

people, there was no suggestion or proposal that there would  be

a  cut back on the Ministers' salaries or the allowances paid to

the  Members.   There  was no response  from  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  on  that.   But we had a response  from  the  Minister

without Portfolio and his reply was that any saving by reduction

in  the  salaries was not going to help.  That it is negligible.

We  do not know what the saving will be.  We have got to tot  it

up  and  see what the saving will be and see whether  it  is  so

negligible that it is not worth implementing it.  I am  sure  it

is not that negligible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, I shall be reverting to this topic, and

that  is,  the  salaries drawn by our Ministers are  way  beyond

anything  drawn  by  ministers outside so  that  any  saving  by

reducing  their  salaries  by  25%  is  not  going  to  be  that

negligible.  Of course, it may not run into billions of dollars.

But I am sure it should run into one or two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



million  dollars at least.  But the point is not whether  it  is

going to be of any help.  That is to overlook and to ignore  the

other  point  and, that is, the identification  of  us  and  the

Ministers equally with the people.  That is the point  that  has

to  be  met squarely.  We have seen the PAP's slogan "More  Good

Years" and we said in our press release that it would appear  to

be  that  it  was always more good years for the  Ministers  and

people  in  high places whatever the economic situation  in  the

country is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to somehow get across the message to the people

that  we do care about them in their situation, that we do  know

of  their  difficulties  and their  problems  and  to  show  our

appreciation and our knowledge, we would ourselves identify with

them  in  their hardships.  But as I said, I cannot see the  25%

reduction  in  salaries for Ministers is  going  to  impose  any

hardship  on  them.  So it is, as I said, simply a  question  of

doing  the  right thing, and I am sure that Members  here  would

like  to  be  seen  as  doing the right  thing  and  identifying

themselves with the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I assure the Members of the People's Action Party, who

are  here from Cheng San, that the voters of Cheng San  will  be

watching very closely as to what their elected Members are going

to do.  Here is an opportunity.  Here is a wonderful opportunity

for  them to show themselves as identifying themselves with  the

people.   We will have to wait and see.  I see Mr Zainul  Abidin

is  trying to get on to his feet.  But hold on for a while.   So

here  is  a  wonderful opportunity.  Are we going to seize  this

opportunity and show our oneness?  That is it - show our oneness

with the people, not that we are a people who are set apart from

them,  not  telling them, as it were, "we are all  right,  Jack,

it's  your problem."  We have got to show them that we  consider

their  problem  our  problem and we  are  prepared  to  identify

ourselves with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am proposing is not just a cut-back and the money

remaining with the Consolidated Fund.  I am proposing  that  the

saving resulting from this voluntary cut-back in the salaries be

paid into an unemployment benefit fund for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



workers who are thrown out of employment or into a needy welfare

fund,  so  that  some use is made of the savings,  so  that  the

sacrifice, if it is a sacrifice, of the Ministers is put to good

use to alleviate the hardship of people who need help.  That  is

my  proposal.  Let it be paid into an unemployment benefit  fund

or a needy fund.  Will the Government accept that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in the 1985 motion, whatever the outcome, I

propose to do what I say.  If the Government does not set up  an

unemployment benefit fund, then I have to see into what fund the

reduction in my allowance by 25% may be put to.  But I hope  the

Government  will be able to find this channel for  me  and  say,

"Look,  we  are  setting  up an unemployment  benefit  fund,  Mr

Jeyaretnam.   Here you are, you can pay your 25% reduction  into

this  fund."  If, as I say, the Government proposes  not  to  do

anything of that sort, then I have to try and see how my  saving

can  be  used  in  any way and show my identification  with  the

voters in Cheng San and elsewhere in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education

(Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M): Sir, I will be brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked that we in this House do the right

thing  and  that this motion rests also on the need  for  us  to

identify  ourselves  with  the people  of  Singapore,  with  the

voters, because we are all representatives of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did not realise that the Member would really stand

up  here  this  evening  to  talk about  possible  miseries  and

difficulties  of  the people in Singapore  only  to  score  some

political  points.  Earlier, I thought there were  some  sincere

and  genuine  reasons  on the part of the  NCMP  to  table  this

motion.  May I say to him that over the last 40 years, the first

group  of PAP leaders and those in the Government had done  what

he  has  proposed.  They had exactly done what he  is  proposing

today, ie, doing the right thing and identifying ourselves  with

the  people, but not by way of moving a motion designed to score

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



political point.  What the PAP has done, which I thought I  must

say, so that it could be of some use to Mr Jeyaretnam is that

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Raise charges, taxes!

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> over the last 40 years, the

PAP  has  done its best to provide good government in Singapore.

By  governing the country wisely, it has done over the last four

decades  its best to promote investment in Singapore, to  create

jobs  and to provide job opportunities for our people.  We  have

done our best.  Our earlier generation of Ministers and MPs  has

left this House but I think we should not forget that under  the

PAP  Government and leadership, we have provided  education  and

training for our people so that they can fit themselves well  in

the new and modern economy.  And over the last 40 years, we have

done  our best.  The PAP Government has done its best to improve

the  people's income and the standard of living.  We  have  done

our  best to build almost one million flats in Singapore as part

of  a  long-term effort to promote home ownership at  affordable

prices.   We have done our best to encourage savings to be  used

in good times, to be used on rainy days and to be used in future

when they retire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all these are efforts that will probably continue.

I  hope  we will continue to have good government in the  future

And it also shows that the PAP Government actually cares for the

people.   I believe we have done the right things over the  last

40  years which is one of the few reasons why today we have  not

been   badly  affected by this economic turmoil  or  crisis.   I

think  that  is  the  best way to identify  ourselves  with  the

people, and not by moving a motion to score political points.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to share my views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is by no means clear that a national crisis has now

occurred   which   requires  collective   sacrifice   by   every

Singaporean.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



Individual companies may have their own problems.  They have  to

deal  with  them.  And every company and even households  should

spend prudently as the economic situation is unclear.  But if  a

collective sacrifice is required by all Singaporeans, eg, a  cut

in the CPF rate, a freeze on all bonuses and salaries, or even a

cut  in  salaries by all companies, the civil service and  GLCs,

then Parliament should take the lead by example and be the first

to  undertake the sacrifice.  Unless Government intends to  call

for  a  nation-wide  collective austerity  measure,  it  is  not

necessary,  in  my view, not even desirable, for  Parliament  or

Ministers to unilaterally take pay cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate Mr Jeyaretnam's compassion for the hopes and

dreams  of  the  people of Singapore.  But extending  compassion

must  be an equitable exercise for all including the Members  in

this  House.  Is it fair that we ask the Government to  shoulder

this  responsibility  alone?  What about those  businessmen  and

professionals who earn even more than Ministers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, such symbolic populist actions are undesirable

because they appear emotional, without addressing the fact  that

the  measures which will really benefit our economy have nothing

to  do with a cut in Ministers' salaries.  The right thing to do

is  to find solutions to cure the ills of the economy.  There is

no running away from this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam's motion perhaps implies that while other

Singaporeans suffer a drop in standards of living, our Ministers

are  unfairly  insulated.  This is not  the  case  from  what  I

understand, because our Ministers' salaries are benchmarked to a

set  of  private  sector criteria.  As private  sector  salaries

drop,  so  do  Ministers'  salaries.  Our  leaders,  like  other

Singaporeans, do see their incomes rise or fall depending on the

state  of  the  economy.  I hope the Minister will clarify  this

point and in response to the motion state when and how much  the

last adjustment was made on Ministers' salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was sampling for opinions on this matter, I gathered

different views.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



There are those who feel that if the Government wants to be seen

as  leading  by  moral  standards  -  and  moral  leadership  is

important - then Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and MPs should

take a pay cut to show their solidarity with the people.  Hence,

reaping  political capital from this gesture.  There are  those,

including  myself, who reject this view because we do not  agree

to  Government  making  symbolic gestures in  policy  decisions.

Among these, some even think that Ministers' wages should not be

a  political  issue  in the first place.  Even  as  a  political

issue,  it  should be a separate evaluation exercise  from  this

concern on the financial uncertainty of the region.  However, if

Ministers  and all Members in this House would like  voluntarily

to  donate  25%  of their salaries to charity to  express  their

solidarity  with  Singaporeans, it is their private  commitment.

It is a personal gesture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us would agree that the job of this Government is

to  govern,  to find the most effective measures to address  the

current  banking and economic difficulties.  A symbolic  measure

such  as cutting Ministers' salaries has limited impact  on  the

scale of events to justify its adoption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should look at other measures, more significant ones, to

moderate the difficulties ahead.  In the next few weeks,  during

the Budget debate, I think a lot more attention will be paid  on

this concern.  Yes, there are difficulties ahead and I think  Mr

Jeyaretnam  has  rightfully  pointed  out  that  there  will  be

possible unemployment and the rest of it.  All the more, we need

to stay rational and identify concrete and constructive measures

to ride out this difficulty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I raise some concerns for this House to debate on and

I  would  like to hear more persuasive reasons from  Members  to

help  clarify  and  reinforce my own.  But at this  juncture,  I

hesitate to support this motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the point I was trying to raise has

already  been  mentioned  by the Nominated  Member.   Ministers'

salaries  are  in  fact pegged to the top  earners  of  the  six

professions in the private sector and if the private sector



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



is  doing well, I believe Ministers' salaries will go up and  if

the  private sector is not doing well when there is an  economic

downturn,  accordingly the salaries of Ministers  will  also  go

down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, there is now a downturn in our economy. In

fact, we have heard just now from Deputy Prime Minister, BG Lee,

that  the banks' business had dipped 30%.  We have also read  in

the  papers  that  about 200 lawyers have left  the  profession.

Probably  those  who  have  left  were  doing  conveyancing  and

conveyancing is rather slow these days.  We also see that  there

are  in  fact retrenchments in the electronics sector.  We  have

heard that the retail trade is down and that the stock market is

also not doing that well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely, there is evidence that businesses are going

down.   If that is so, I would imagine that the salaries of  the

top  earners  in the private sector would also drop accordingly.

If  indeed the salaries of top people in the private sector have

dropped,  then  the  Ministers' salaries should  accordingly  be

scaled  down.   The  question is this: Have Ministers'  salaries

been  scaled down?  If they have been, how much?  If  not,  why?

Ministers cannot give an excuse and say that their salaries need

not be scaled down because it makes no difference to the economy

or  that  they have done a good job and Singapore has  weathered

the currency turmoil relatively well compared to other countries

in the region or that our currency has not been devalued as much

as  the  others  vis-a-vis  the US  dollar  or  that  Ministers'

salaries comprise only a small percentage of the GDP.   But  the

point  is  that  the  standard has been  set  by  the  Ministers

themselves.  If this standard is to be adhered to, then  if  the

salaries  of  the  top earners of the private sector  have  gone

down,  the Ministers' salaries should drop accordingly.  I would

like  the  Minister  to let us know whether  or  not  Ministers'

salaries have been scaled down.  If so, when and by how much?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what we are

facing  is  not  an ordinary cyclical downturn in  the  economy.

This is the most serious crisis which the region has faced since

at least the 1960s.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One country after another has succumbed to the contagion,

starting with Thailand, then Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea and Hong

Kong.   The country now facing the most serious situation, whose

well-being  will  affect  the  region  and  Singapore  the  most

profoundly, is Indonesia. We have fully discussed this earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been lucky to be spared the worst of this

crisis.   But it has not just been luck.  We are different,  and

people  have recognised that we are different.  And  if  Members

read  articles  in the foreign media who are not  by  any  means

uncritical admirers of Singapore, they will see that  they  have

recognised  this.  I just cite you four examples..  One  in  the

Financial   Times  earlier  this  month,  an  article  entitled:

"Singapore's  strengths  protect  it  from  turmoil"  by  Sheila

McNutty.  She wrote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In spite of its sound economic fundamental, Singapore's

exposure to the region is dragging it into the turmoil.  But the

very  strengths that put the city-state ahead of its  neighbours

before  the crisis began  its eagerness to adjust to changes  in

the  world  around it  have convinced economists it will  emerge

even  further in front when it ends. . The Singapore  Government

is,  meanwhile,  moving  to widen the  competitiveness  gap  its

neighbours had been closing before the crisis began. . Singapore

.  has pressed on with plans to open up.  Economists say foreign

investors cannot help but be impressed.'



This is the Financial Times reprinted in the Straits Times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New York Times, also not an admirer of ours, Thomas

Friedman writing in an Op-Ed column earlier this month about the

crisis   in   an  article  entitled  "Good  governance only

protection" said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Of those Asian nations who were fully plugged into the

market,  those  with  the  most  non-corrupt,  transparent   and

accountable  financial  systems  Taiwan,  Hong  Kong,  Singapore

have been hurt the least.'



That  is in the New York Times.  Analysts write us up. They have

to tell as it is because otherwise nobody will read them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent Strategy is one of them and last year in July

it  reported  on emerging markets and the title was:  "Singapore

Sun-drenched in a grey sea".  They gave the reasons why this was

so:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore does stand out in the continuing Asian currency

crisis.   It  runs a surplus when other countries run  deficits.

Singapore's  balance sheet with the rest of the  world  is  also

super  strong.  Nor does Singapore have an asset bubble  or  any

sign  of  a  major overhang of unproductive capital as  in  most

other Asian countries.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in July. Come October, Jardine Fleming Research

published two reports.  One said: "Singapore  Distinct from  the

ASEAN-4" and the other one said, "Singapore's monetary policy is

different".  It said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore was the only Southeast Asian country which had a

correct  currency  policy,  one sensitive  to  global  financial

dynamics with practically no barriers to trade and capital flows

and  because  it  uses  currency to  check  imported  inflation,

Singapore's  policy is aligned to the global inflation  profile.

Of  the  region's central banks, only the MAS has  its  currency

policy in tune with the underlying `fair' value.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whatever Mr Jeyaretnam says about inflation and the

state  of  the economy, the analysts know the true state.   What

has made this difference?  Clean, competent Government.  Why  do

you  think  we  have a financial system which has  been  tightly

supervised,  a  property market where the incipient  bubble  was

pricked  in  time and a prudent budget surplus with  no  foreign

borrowing?   By chance?  Because of the quality of the  NCMP  in

the  House?  No.  Because there have been capable committed  men

in  the  Government  who will pursue sound policies,  anticipate

problems and find solutions to them in good time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been able to deliver this quality of Government

precisely  because  we have paid Ministers  and  civil  servants

properly.   We  did  this,  opposed by opposition  MPs  like  Mr

Jeyaretnam at every step.  But the policy has worked and it  has

made Singapore different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we face a major regional crisis, what has the

opposition  done?  Has it called on Singaporeans to close  ranks

and  work  together?  No. Has it produced any  useful  ideas  to

tackle  the problems?  Neither.  No opposition MP has filed  any

questions in Parliament on this momentous development, except to

query  the  constitutionality  of the  Government's  actions  on

totally  spurious grounds, and then failed to follow up  in  the

courts when challenged to do so.  Instead the task of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



raising  the issue in Parliament and debating it, explaining  it

and  reflecting people's views and concerns has been left to PAP

MPs and Nominated MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam's only contribution to this debate has

been to cut political salaries by 25% and he had the honour  and

the courtesy to remind us that in fact it was an old record from

1985 which he was rehashing again.  It is a meaningless populist

gimmick.   If  everybody  has to tighten belts,  then  naturally

Ministers and MPs should also do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I say Singaporeans will have to tighten

their belts.  I am saying that.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> For example, in the 1985 recession,

there  was  a  CPF  cut  and it applied  to  everybody.   If  Mr

Jeyaretnam had suggested that everybody in Singapore should have

wages cut by 25%, then we could have a serious debate.  We would

disagree with him that this was necessary, but it would  not  be

an  absurd proposition.  But how does cutting political salaries

help  us  to tackle the regional crisis?  Indeed, Mr Jeyaretnam,

in moving the motion, concedes that it would not, but presses on

in characteristic fashion nevertheless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must focus on the real problems. The crisis has not hit

us  directly.  But we will still suffer the side effects of  the

region's  problems.  Trade and tourism are down.   Uncertainties

in  Indonesia and other countries will affect the whole  region.

Loss  of  confidence  affects our stock  market,  and  also  our

exchange  rate, although less than other countries.   There  may

also  be  direct  spillovers to us if  there  are  more  serious

problems.   For example, the latest Political and Economic  Risk

Consultancy (PERC) Report on Singapore speaks of the possibility

of  a  "population  exodus that could  result  in  thousands  of

economic refugees with little money or marketable skills seeking

food and shelter in Singapore".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an alarmist prospect. It may not happen, but you

cannot  tell  what  may happen.  The crisis is  far  from  over.

Nobody  predicted the last eight months of turbulence.  Not  the

IMF, not the World



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



Bank,   not   the  pundits,  neither  the  countries   and   the

Government,  not even the hedge funds.  If Indonesia  stabilises

after  the  elections in March, the rupiah recovers  its  value,

companies  can service their debt, workers have their  jobs  and

can  earn  a  living  and  buy food  and  essentials,  then  the

situation in the region will gradually return to normal.  But if

Indonesia's  economic  problems  continue,  and  there  is  high

unemployment,  inflation,  food  shortages,  and  people  cannot

afford  to buy oil or flour or milk powder for their babies,  or

sugar  or medicines, then we too will feel the effects.   Nobody

can predict how events are going to unfold over the next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are our priorities now? I would put three: First, to

rally  Singaporeans to be prepared for rough  weather,  to  keep

Singapore on an even keel despite the storm.  Second, to help to

restore stability and growth in the region, within the limits of

our  capabilities, eg, through our active diplomacy,  discussing

the  matter, lobbying, suggesting proposals to other  countries,

through  visits,  as  the Prime Minister has  visited  Indonesia

three times, and Malaysia recently.  Third, to prepare ourselves

for  the longer term and strengthen our competitiveness, so that

when the region starts growing again, we will be well poised  to

prosper for the region. So despite the uncertainty, despite  the

mood  of  gloom  and  despondency, Mr Peter Seah  published  his

report  on financial services, and the Government has responded,

accepting nearly all its recommendations, not to deal with  this

year's  growth rate for the financial sector or the GDP, but  to

position us for the medium term when the region recovers for  us

to have all the pre-conditions in place, engine already running,

step on the accelerator and you are off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to work together as one country on these urgent

tasks.  It is not going to be an easy year.  Growth is going  to

be  slower.   Companies  will make less profits.   Workers  will

receive   smaller  bonuses.   Some  will  be  retrenched.    The

Government  budget  will be tighter, leaving a  smaller  surplus

available for asset enhancement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily we are competitive, compared to other countries.

Unlike  in 1985, our costs are not out of line.  If you  measure

exchange rates against the US dollar, the baht, the ringgit, the

rupiah  and  the  won  have all gone down  much  more  than  the

Singapore  dollar.  This had made these countries  cheaper  than

us,  in  a  way,  more competitive than us.  But the  effect  is

smaller  than  these  numbers suggest, because,  firstly,  these

countries have not been able to increase their exports  sharply.

They   lack  trade  financing  (which  our  multilateral   trade

guarantee  proposal is meant to deal with). And also  the  lower

exchange rates have been offset by very high interest rates  and

a credit crunch.  So they are unable to export and therefore our

exports are maintaining market share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we export a different mix of products than the

countries  do.   We  are higher end, more technology  intensive.

They  are  still  mostly in the textiles and garments.   So  the

competition  is less.  There is some overlap in electronics,  in

disk  drives, which has been affecting us.  But it is a  partial

overlap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, over time high inflation will erode the cost

advantage  of  their  sharp depreciation  of  their  currencies.

Already  this  is happening in Indonesia.  Between December  and

January,  the inflation was 7% in one month in consumer  prices.

In  fact, the risk is hyperinflation.  So although the cost  may

have gone down temporarily, it is not an advantage which can  be

sustained because workers need to be fed, need to live.  If they

cannot eat, they may riot.  And if they are paid more, then that

would  spiral  through, and you will be back  at  your  starting

point  but  with an extra zero on your currencies  and  on  your

salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So overall, although the exchange rate of the Singapore

dollar has gone down much less than our neighbour's, I am  still

confident that our exporters can compete.  They have problems if

they are working in the region.  They have problems if they  are

in  difficult  businesses, like disk  drives.   But  it  is  not

because we are out of line and uncompetitive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we should still watch our costs this year, to

make  sure  that we do not stray out of line.  One  cost  factor

which  we  can control is Government rates and charges.   As  Dr

Tony  Tan said, the Government will be careful not to raise fees

this  year,  except where it is essential.  So, for example,  as

the  crisis  developed  last year, JTC and  HDB  took  steps  to

moderate  or defer rental increases for its lessees and tenants.

But  the rise in PUB water tariffs, announced last year,  to  be

phased  in over three years, with another adjustment this  year,

will  continue.   Firstly, because water is  a  vital  strategic

resource.   And secondly, because the impact of the increase  in

water  rates on lower income households will be fully offset  by

the  Government  rebates  for utility  bills.   So  we  have  to

proceed, and we have seen to it that we are proceeding in a  way

which does not hurt the lower income groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key cost factor is wages. In the 1985 recession,

when  wage  costs became too high, we had to cut employers'  CPF

contributions  by  15% points, from 25% down  to  10%.   But  we

learnt  from that experience the importance of wage flexibility.

So we have used the good years since 1985 to build up the flexi-wage system, precisely to meet a situation like this one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant part of wages is now in the variable

component,  both  public sector wages and  also  private  sector

wages.   And  as a matter of policy, we have kept  the  variable

component separate from the fixed wages, so that employees  will

be  psychologically prepared for it to go down as well as to  go

up,  depending on economic conditions.  We have not consolidated

it.  We have not built it in.  We have kept it separate, and  we

have  marked  it separate, and every time we have increased  the

amount we have reminded people this is variable - it can go  up,

it  can  go  down.  It is a cushion which we can trim  back,  if

necessary, without causing too much hardship to workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the public sector, the variable component makes up at

least  20%  of wages.  Civil servants and ministers  receive  an

Annual  Variable  Component of two months'  salaries  per  year.

They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



also  receive a monthly Non-Pensionable Variable Payment (NPVP),

which includes all the NWC adjustments since 1993.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if it becomes necessary for us to reduce wage costs, the

public  sector  will  do  so  by trimming  the  Annual  Variable

Component, which will not affect the monthly pay packet.  And if

we still need to trim by more, we can adjust the NPVP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will know if it is necessary to trim the Annual Variable

Component  or the NPVP for Ministers and civil servants  by  the

time  the  NWC  makes its recommendations  for  the  year.   The

Government  will  as usual decide on its NWC payment  for  civil

servants and Ministers after that.  It will then decide  whether

to trim the Annual Variable Component or NPVP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mdm Claire Chiang and also Mr Chiam pointed out,

Ministers'  and  civil servants' salaries are not  fixed.   They

rise and fall automatically with private sector incomes, because

they  are pegged by a formula to salaries in the private sector,

and they are revised every year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Staff Grade 1 is set at 60% of the average of 24 people

(the   top  four  individuals  from  six  professions:  bankers,

accountants,  engineers, lawyers, local manufacturing  companies

and  multi-national companies), ie, the average principal earned

income  of  the top four in each of these six professions.   And

Staff Grade 1 is 60% of that, and we have said eventually it  is

to reach two-thirds of that over four years from1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superscale G is the average principal earned income of the

15th person who is aged 32 years old, belonging to the same  six

professions,  because  that is the point  where  a  young  civil

servant  should be reaching at that age and is making a critical

comparison at a key point in his career.  So compared  with  his

cohort, 32 years old, let us get the people in these professions

ranked at 15th.  If you can make it to "G" by 32, you should  be

equal to them and deserve to be paid as well as them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a two-year lag in this formula, because we need

two years to work the data.  The 1998 adjustment this year is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



based  on  private sector incomes which were paid in  1996,  and

assessed  by  IRAS in 1997, and would be adjusted by  the  civil

service  for Ministers in 1998.  But despite this two-year  lag,

the  formula maintains the right relativities between Ministers'

salaries and private sector earnings, whether the economy is  up

or  down.   So,  for  example, last year (1997),  the  benchmark

declined, so the Ministers' salaries were cut by 7%.  It happens

automatically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the benchmark would be based on 1996 private

sector earnings.  On that basis, the average 24, which means the

Staff  1  benchmark, has increased by 12.8%, and the 15P32,  the

Superscale  G benchmark, has increased by 4.0%.  If we  subtract

from  these  two  figures the 4.5% NWC wage adjustment  in  July

1997,  then this year's Staff 1 salary, which also carries  with

it  Ministers' salaries, should go up by 8.1%, just to  maintain

60% of average 24.  And the Superscale G salary should come down

by 0.4%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These adjustments would normally take place on 1st July.

But this is an exceptional year.  We still expect the economy to

show  positive  growth,  not negative  growth  or  a  recession.

However,  there are major uncertainties ahead.   And  if  events

take an unexpected turn, all bets are off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Government has decided to suspend this

year's  adjustment for the Staff 1 benchmark.  In  other  words,

the  Staff  1  salary  will  be frozen  this  year,  instead  of

increasing  by  8.1%  on 1st July.  The 0.4%  reduction  in  the

Superscale  G salary will proceed.  This applies to  both  civil

servants  and  political office holders.  Other grades  will  be

correspondingly adjusted.  In effect salaries of all grades will

be  frozen  or very slightly reduced this year.  Promotions  and

normal  increments  will  continue,  and  if  there  is  an  NWC

adjustment  this year, it will apply to all officers,  including

Ministers and MPs.  Next year, when we have the IRAS figures for

1997 earnings, we will review the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some employers have already decided to freeze their

salaries  for this year.  Others who are still doing  well  will

want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



reward their workers.  The NWC will deliberate on the guidelines

which employers and workers will follow.  But by suspending this

year's  salary adjustment for Ministers and civil  servants,  we

will set the tone for the private sector as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone should be restraint and caution. We must take the

crisis  seriously but in our stride.  We did not wish  for  this

crisis,  but it will draw us together.  Let us work together  as

one  people to tackle this challenge.  Then we will sail through

the storm safely, and emerge ahead once more.  [Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to

detain our Members much too long from their dinners.  Yes, it is

long  enough.  They do not like to hear any proposals for taking

a  reduction in their salaries.  Of course, they do not wish  to

hear  that.   They  do  not wish to hear  anything  about  being

setting  an example.  That is the last thing they want to  hear.

So,  of course, the response, "Shut up!  Mr Jeyaretnam, and keep

quiet.   We don't want to hear all these.  It is painful  to  us

that you ask us to set an example."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that this debate has run

true to form.  There is nothing that I have heard this afternoon

in  answer which I did not expect.  I knew what was coming.   It

has  run true to form.  The Deputy Prime Minister says it  is  a

rehash  of my 1985 motion.  What is his?  If it is not a  rehash

of  what we heard in 1985 from the then Minister of State  -  he

has  of course gone up the ladder, he is now a Cabinet Minister,

and  I  see he is not replying - what is it, but a rehash.   But

before  I reply to the Deputy Prime Minister, may I make  a  few

responses to the others who have spoken.  Again, as I said, this

is  nothing new.  It is running true to form.  The first speaker

tries  to  dismiss it as mere politics, trying to make political

capital.  I think perhaps he would do well, if I may just say to

him  to  go and speak to his own constituents and find  out  for

himself,  at  first  hand, whether it is  political  capital  or

whether  it is something quite different.  It is a call for  him

to identify himself with the people.  I suggest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



he  goes and speaks to his own constituents because I have heard

this   I cannot call them "my constituents"  from the voters  in

Cheng  San, when I go round, they know what I am talking  about.

It is not political capital.  You will find out for yourself, if

you do go round and mix with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, running through to form, he says, "Oh, the PAP

Government  has  done all this, done all this, done  all  this."

This  is  what  we  have heard ad nauseam.  And  the  people  of

Singapore  also know what the PAP Government has done all  these

years.   Why  do you not go and ask them what the PAP Government

has done?  The cost of living has gone up.  Life has become more

and more a struggle.  Life is too regulated and controlled.  Why

do  you not go and ask them instead of trying to score political

capital in this House in front of the Members here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not think that I need to waste any time with the

first  speaker's reply.  It is nothing new.  But may I  ask  him

this?   He says the PAP Government has provided all the  savings

that  they  can use during their hard times.  What  savings  are

there for the people during the hard times that lie ahead?   Let

us have some concrete proposals instead of words, words, words.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the Nominated Member of Parliament, Mdm Claire

Chiang.   I was surprised that she took up cudgels on behalf  of

the Government.  That was to be expected, Nominated MPs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I take exception to that remark by

Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, I am not withdrawing. I said this

was to be expected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> You are not being fair to the Nominated

Members of Parliament.  We are here not to represent either  the

PAP or the Opposition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have the floor.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have the floor.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Well, if you want to have the floor,

continue to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Again, the Nominated Member of Parliament

repeats  what we were told in 1985 and what we heard  afterwards

from  the  Deputy Prime Minister that if it is necessary  for  a

national  reduction in salaries, then perhaps  Ministers  should

set  the lead.  There you have it.  "No, we are not going to  be

the  first.  You do it first.  If you do it first, then we  will

follow."   That is the sort of leadership we have  got.   It  is

not,  "We  will set you an example so that others  may  follow."

That is the kind of leadership one expects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominated Member of Parliament asks: will the others

also  follow  suit?  Well, who knows, they will follow  suit  if

they  see  that  the Ministers have decided to set  an  example,

people in the industries and people in the banks may follow suit

and  decide  that  they  will make their  contribution  as  well

because  you  have  the Ministers setting  an  example  and  the

Members  of  Parliament setting an example.  So do not,  please,

wait  for  someone  else to set you an  example.   You  set  the

example yourself first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominated MP again says my motion is a political or

emotional  issue.   This  is not just a  gimmick.   The  British

Cabinet,  the  Labour Government and, in particular,  the  Prime

Minister, after he was elected - and that country is not  facing

any  crisis  or economic downturn - said he would not  take  any

increase  and, in fact, would take a cut in his salaries.   Then

it  was followed by other Ministers because the people could see

the  great  disparity  between the  ordinary  salaries  and  the

Ministers' salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the example over the Causeway, which I

mentioned  in  1985.  Immediately upon the commencement  of  the

crisis,  the Prime Minister announced he would take a  reduction

and  he  was followed by other Ministers and even judges of  the

High Court.  So let us get it right.  Everyone will follow if we

lead  instead of waiting for somebody else to start.  And is  it

to  be  suggested  that  the salaries  have  not  gone  down  or

beenreduced  in the private sector?  Mr Chiam was talking  about

earnings  of  lawyers but I am not just concerned with  lawyers.

Is it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



not a fact that people who are earning are earning less now than

what they were?  So have they not taken a reduction?  And I  see

that  the  Deputy  Prime Minister has attempted  to  answer  the

question.  But Mr Chiam's question was, if the salaries  in  the

private  sector  have gone down, are the Ministers  prepared  to

take a lower salary?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps Mr

Jeyaretnam will allow me to clarify the point which he has  just

raised.  As I have explained, the Ministers' salaries are pegged

to  the  private sector.  When the private sector's salaries  go

down,  the Ministers' salaries will also go down as soon  as  we

ascertain what the private sector's state of affairs is.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Have you ascertained now, because they have

gone down?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> As I have just explained, the latest

data we have are 1996 salaries reported to the IRAS in 1997, and

declared  in 1998.  So in 1997, I imagine that wages would  have

gone  down  some,  because the crisis started in  mid-year.   In

1998,  it would go down some more.  So correspondingly in  1999,

Government's salaries will go down, and in the year  2000  also.

It  follows.   So  there is no magic to this.   If  you  have  a

formula  and  the  peg, you have to follow up and  you  have  to

follow down.  So I do not see what the difficulty is.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am afraid the Deputy Prime Minister does

not  see the import of my motion and, that is, action now in the

midst of a crisis, not action in the year 2001 when we will  see

whether we need to take a reduction in our salaries.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have

explained  what we are doing, which is to suspend the adjustment

which  is  due  this year, and we will watch the  situation  and

decide  what happens next year.  The test of the policy  is  not

whether  you  have  done  a histrionic  gesture  and  the  Prime

Minister has taken the lead and he has volunteered; and then his

Deputy   Prime   Ministers  volunteer;  his  Cabinet   Ministers

volunteer, and the MPs do, and even NCMPs hasten not to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



be  last.  The test is who gets into a bigger hole and  who  has

avoided the hole and got out faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985, he moved a motion to cut salaries. We turned it

down.  But we did not stay in the hole.  We got out of the hole,

which  is  why we have had 12 years of growth since  then  until

this   regional  problem  came.   That  is  the  test  of   good

government, identification with the people and the competence of

the team in charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The import of Mr Jeyaretnam's motion is that we will make

voluntary cuts.  He says it is not a political gimmick.  What is

it?   If  he  wants  to  make  a voluntary  cut  in  his  NCMP's

allowance,  he  can do it.  Why does he have to tell  the  whole

world?  Why does he have to wait for the whole world?  Why  does

he  care  whether anybody else makes voluntary contributions  or

otherwise?   There  is a Malay saying that when  a  turtle  lays

eggs,  it  lays 100 and nobody hears about it.  When  a  chicken

lays eggs, the whole village is awakened by the cackling of  the

hen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, that is very funny, Mr Deputy Speaker.

Mr  Deputy Speaker, it just shows how the whole of the import of

this  motion is lost.  It is just evasive, because that  is  all

that  the Members of the ruling party are capable of, evade  and

nothing  else, not capable of any reasoned answers.  The  Deputy

Prime  Minister  says the answer is to try and get  out  of  it.

What  is  your message?  What is your message to those who  have

lost  their  jobs and who find that they cannot make their  ends

meet?   They  have no savings at all.  What is your  message  to

them?   The  Deputy  Prime Minister says we have  got  to  rally

Singaporeans.  But what is your message to these people?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The message is very simple. We have

been broadcasting it for years except that Mr Jeyaretnam has not

heard  it.   It  is  that life is uncertain,  the  international

economy  is uncertain.  No job has security.  Ministers  do  not

have  job security.  If you are in a job which pays well  today,

you cannot be sure that it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



be  there  for  the rest of your working career.   You  must  be

prepared for an upset, you must be prepared for something  which

is  unexpected, and the way to prepare for it is  to  train,  to

gain skills, to have something valuable which you can contribute

to.  So when you lose one job, you can get into another one, and

to  put  aside and save for a rainy day, instead of  saying,  "I

will  spend  this.  The Government will provide."  And  that  is

what we have done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have retrenchments. Can we avoid it? Yes, by not

having  disk  drive companies, by not going regional,  by  going

back  to  farming  in  your backyard and planting  potatoes  and

tapioca.   That is possible.  But if you want to plug  into  the

world economy, then you must be prepared to see the ups and  the

downs, and you must provide for these downs when they come.  The

same MP who complains about the nanny government is also the one

who says, how about coming to do something straightaway.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Prime

Minister.   We  have  had it again from the horse's  mouth.  The

Government's  answer to these people would appear to  be,  "It's

just  tough  luck, old man.  Tough luck, old chap.  Hard  times,

you just have to put up with it.  We hope we will be able to get

you  round to good times.  But at the moment, you just  stay  in

your little hole and suffer.  Whereas we are all right.  We  are

not going to do anything to alleviate your suffering."

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps Mr

Jeyaretnam might suggest to the House any other country  in  the

region where we might be better off than in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Again, that is not the answer. I cannot see

that  taking us very far.  It is just that you are not  grasping

the  whole point of the message.  And that is to give a  message

from  this House to the people who are facing economic  problems

and  difficulties.  They have heard ad nauseam how well the  PAP

has managed Singapore.  They have heard ad nauseam about the GDP

growth, but that is not what they want to hear now.  What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



they want to hear now is this:  "What are you going to do for us

in our present situation?  How are you going to help us?"  And I

have  suggested that even if it is a little, even  if  it  is  a

gesture, that you set up an unemployment workers' benefit  fund.

What is wrong with that?  Then at least the people will see that

there is some sincerity, some determination to help them.  May I

know  what  steps the Government is going to take to help  those

who  are thrown out of jobs and perhaps do not have any savings,

other  than to preach and to sermonize and say, "It's just  hard

luck.  It is an economic downturn.  You wait for the economy  to

pick  up and then you'll be all right."  May I know what message

you have?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a message, ie, do something, set up a little fund

from the reductions that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



you voluntarily give up and help these people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I must remind hon. Members that actions

or   words  they  use  should  not  border  on  imputations   or

accusations.

<div align="center"><h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>JOBS FOR FRESH GRADUATES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether, given the present economic conditions,  there

will  be  sufficient jobs in the coming year for fresh graduates

from the universities and the polytechnics and others new to the

job market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the financial crisis in the region and expected

slower  economic growth this year, there will be some moderation

in  labour demand from the high levels of recent years.  As more

companies  adjust  to cope with the situation,  we  will  see  a

general slowing down in the hiring of new staff.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, weakness will not be even across sectors.

Although new hiring in the financial and business services,  and

commerce  sectors is expected to weaken, the employment  outlook

for  the  manufacturing  sector is relatively  more  optimistic.

EDB's   latest   survey   of  business  expectations   for   the

manufacturing sector shows that it will continue  to  invest  in

productive capacity over the next 12 months.  The public  sector

also  requires more staff, for example, the teaching and nursing

professions.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the labour market has been very tight,

resulting in the import of a large number of foreign workers and

a  high  rate of labour turnover.  The cooling of the employment

market  will moderate this situation.  New entrants to  the  job

market  should be able to find employment if they possess skills

and  are  not  too  choosy with jobs.  Older and  lower  skilled

workers  should  make  use  of  this  period  to  enhance  their

qualification  and  skill  levels  to  make  sure  they   remain

productive and employable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To satisfy its pipeline of incoming investment projects,

EDB  estimates that two out of three new jobs to be created will

require  skilled  workers with minimum NTC-2 qualification.   On

the  whole,  we still expect the labour market to remain  fairly

tight  for  professional and skilled manpower, such as engineers

and technicians.

<div align="center"><b>REGULATING FLOW OF FOREIGN TALENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Labour how the

Government  will regulate the flow of foreign talent  to  ensure

that  they  will not be allowed to come here to take  over  jobs

held by Singaporeans simply because they are cheaper to hire.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has explained on several occasions that

foreign  talent  is  needed  to supplement  the  local  pool  of

talents.  Our small workforce of 1.9 million is a major limiting

factor.  With increasing global competition, our economic growth

will be severely constrained by a shortage of talent.  There  is

a   limit  to  what  we  can  generate  ourselves  through   our

universities and polytechnics.  For instance, NUS  and  NTU  can

generate  about 9,000 graduates yearly.  This is much less  than

the  projected requirement of 17,000 graduates per year by  Year

2000 to sustain economic growth. Foreign talents are thus needed

to  supplement  our  very  own so that economic  growth  can  be

sustained.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infusion of foreign talents will enhance our

competitiveness.    In   an  intensely  competitive   globalised

economy,  Singapore  has  to  stay ahead  by  restructuring  our

economy  towards  more  knowledge-based and technology-intensive

industries. Already, some competitors are fast becoming  a  real

challenge   in   many  areas  where  we  have  had   comparative

advantages.   We  need to tap new growth areas and  move  on  to

higher value



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



added   activities   in  order  to  stay  ahead.    To   transit

successfully  into  a  knowledge-based  economy,  we  need   the

infusion of top talents to supplement our own citizens. Imported

talents  will  bring with them new ideas, innovation,  and  good

practices that will help us in our upgrading efforts.  They  can

help us to remain competitive in the face of future challenges.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should not feel threatened by the admission

of  foreign talents. Employment of foreign talents is not a zero

sum game.  Rather than displacing local workers, foreign talents

fill  up  the  gaps in our manpower resources  and  help  us  to

achieve higher rates of economic growth.  By helping us to  grow

the   economic  pie,  foreign  talents  can  contribute  to  job

opportunities and rewards for Singaporeans.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign talents do not always cost less than locals. In

fact,  the top talents we are eyeing are in demand globally  and

they  command high wages.  Companies in Singapore would have  to

compete  vigorously to attract these talents.  In the same  way,

companies  would  also need to step up efforts to  retain  local

talents  who  are  equally  mobile  and  in  demand.   The  real

challenge  facing  Singapore would  be  one  of  attracting  and

retaining  talents,  whether foreign or local,  to  sustain  and

enhance   our   economic  competitiveness.  Rather   than   feel

threatened, Singaporeans should rise up to the challenges ahead,

and  upgrade  their  knowledge and skills to raise  quality  and

productivity.   The exposure to competition will invigorate  our

workforce, sharpen our skills and stimulate dynamism within  the

economy.  A globally competitive workforce, incorporating  local

and foreign talents, is the key to our longer term success.

<div align="center"><b>INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY TARIFFS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  (a)  whether Singapore Power Ltd,  in  increasing  the

electricity  tariffs  by an average of 5.4%  from  1st  February

1998, has taken into consideration the difficulties faced by the

local  industries in their attempt to reduce operating costs  to

ride  out the regional financial turmoil; (b) what is the  basis

of  such a high rate of increase in the electricity tariffs; (c)

whether  the  cost savings resulting from increased productivity

and  operational efficiency of Singapore Power Ltd can be passed

on  to  the local industries in this difficult period;  and  (d)

what  is the mechanism in place to prevent any unjustifiable  or

untimely increase in the electricity and gas tariffs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity tariff comprises two components: fuel and

non-fuel costs.  Fuel cost, which is passed on to consumers,  is

adjusted  quarterly to reflect changes in the market  price  for

fuel  oil.   There  is  a time lag between  the  dates  of  fuel

purchases  and  usage.   The  fuel  cost  for  this  quarter  is

determined by the prices paid over the previous months.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel oil prices in US dollars increased by 11 % from

June  1997 to October 1997.  In addition, over the same  period,

the  US  dollar  appreciated by about 9% against  the  Singapore

dollar.   As  a  result,  the fuel price  in  Singapore  dollars

increased  by  about 21%.  The tariff increase of 0.7  cents/kWh

for  the quarter February to April 1998 is mainly to offset  the

higher-than-expected fuel cost in the previous quarters.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since October 1997, fuel oil prices in US dollars have

fallen but the US dollar has continued to appreciate against the

Singapore  dollar.   The  net effect of these  changes  will  be

reflected  in  the tariff review for the next quarter.   If  the

downward  price  trend  persists and the exchange  rate  remains

favourable, tariffs will be lowered for the next quarter.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-fuel costs refer to labour, depreciation,

maintenance  and  other  operating costs.  Singapore  Power  has

frozen  the non-fuel cost of electricity tariff for the past  12

months  despite increases in operating expenses.   It  has  been

able to do so through productivity improvements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-fuel cost component of the electricity tariff is

regulated  by the CPI-X formula.  Singapore Power  will  not  be

allowed  to  increase this tariff component  by  more  than  the

percentage  change  in  the  Consumer  Price  Index   less   the

efficiency  gain X.  The X factor has been set at 1%  for  three

years from 1st April 1997 in the first instance.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity and gas tariffs have to be approved by the

Public  Utilities Board, the regulating authority.  My  Ministry

and  the PUB are mindful of the need to keep our electricity and

gas tariffs competitive.

<div align="center"><b>FOREST FIRES IN EAST KALIMANTAN AND SUMATRA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for the Environment

whether  the forest fires burning in East Kalimantan and Sumatra

are  likely  to  affect  Singapore with haze  pollution  in  the

foreseeable  future and whether Singapore has given  or  offered

technical, financial or other forms of assistance to  deal  with

the fires.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the current Northeast Monsoon season, there is

little likelihood of Singapore being affected by smoke haze.  At

worst,  there may be the odd day when a change in wind direction

may  bring  in some smoke haze, causing our sky to  be  slightly

hazy.  The probability of this happening is however quite low.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is little threat from smoke haze during

this time of the year, my Ministry has continued to work closely

with  the Meteorological Service in monitoring the region's  hot

spot  situation  through satellite pictures.  In  the  past  few

weeks, satellite pictures have started to show some hot spots in

eastern  Kalimantan, and more recently in central  Sumatra.   My

Ministry  has  forwarded  the  satellite  information   to   the

Indonesian  authorities to assist them in locating  and  putting

out the fires.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winds will become more variable in April, when the

inter-monsoon  period sets in.  If there  are  still  fires  and

smoke haze in Kalimantan and Sumatra during this period, some of

the smoke haze may be blown over to Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's assistance to Indonesia is within the

framework   of  the  Regional  Haze  Action  Plan  which   Asean

Environment  Ministers   have agreed to.  We  will  install  the

intranet  system  by  March  1998  which  will  allow  Indonesia

immediate access to our satellite-based fire monitoring system.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asean Environment Ministers and senior officials

will  meet again on 24th and 25th February in Kuching, Malaysia,

to  discuss  the progress in the implementation of the  Regional

Haze  Action Plan, and we will find out if Singapore can  be  of

further assistance within the context of this Plan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Dr Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Minister for Finance what

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to regulate time share schemes is still

being undertaken to determine how best the law could be reformed

to  capture not only time share schemes but also other currently

unregulated investment schemes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study to regulate soft commodity brokers is also

under  way. Again, this study will require in-depth examination,

especially  to  ensure  that any regulation   to  be  introduced

should   not   adversely  affect  the  interests  of  legitimate

commodity traders.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it should be recognised that no regulatory

system  can completely protect investors from making any losses.

Singaporeans  are  advised to stay away from investment  schemes

which  are  dubious  and claim to promise  unrealistically  high

returns.  Rubber and coffee are currently being  traded  on  the

Singapore  Commodity Exchange, which is regulated by  the  Trade

Development  Board. Members of the public who are involved  with

companies  dealing in commodities contracts, other  than  rubber

and   coffee,  can  take  the  following  actions  if  they  are

suspicious of any company:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Direct their queries or complaints to the

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share buy-backs will give companies greater flexibility

However, safeguards will be necessary to prevent abuse.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing prohibition on share buy-backs in the

Companies  Act  followed UK law. But the UK, and  several  other

Commonwealth  countries  including Australia,  New  Zealand  and

Canada  have since changed their laws to permit share buy-backs,

with appropriate safeguards. Their experience is relevant to us.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) what

are the planning guidelines for the construction of new schools;

(b)  what  are the capacities and standard facilities  provided;

and  (c)  how data are obtained to ascertain the demand for  new

schools.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of planning for new schools takes into

consideration HDB's building programme and the planned  increase

of  dwelling  units, both public as well as private.   6-monthly

updates  of the HDB building programme for the next 5  years  as

well  as  the  scheduled completion dates  of  the  new  housing

developments are obtained from HDB.  Similar regular updates for

private  dwelling  units  are  obtained  from  URA.  From  these

updates,  new  schools are planned to be constructed  in  tandem

with  housing developments. The objective is to provide adequate

school  places for residents  including those moving into  their

new homes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a better estimate of the demand for school

places,  MOE from this year has also made an adjustment for  new

HDB  housing estates where the population comprise mainly  young

families with school-going children. The demand projections  are

scaled  upwards  to reflect higher demand for school  places  in

these new estates.  Similarly for mature HDB estates, where  the

demand  has  levelled off due to a population shift towards  the

older  generation and grown-up children, the demand  projections

are  moderated  downwards.  Statistics  from  HDB  are  used  to

determine the scaling factors.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are provided on the basis of an area covered by

a  Development Guide Plan (DGP).  For example, the Bukit Panjang

DGP  will  cover the whole of Bukit Panjang new town (the  Bukit

Panjang  ward of Sembawang GRC and a part of the Chua  Chu  Kang

Constituency).   The Ministry has planned for 5 primary  schools

in  this  DGP.   One  of  the schools,  West  View  Primary,  is

currently  functioning at a holding school in the  adjacent  DGP

across  the road, and is within 1 km from the permanent site  of

West  View Primary.  Overall the number of places in the schools

within the DGP area will be adequate for those living within the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned capacities for individual schools are 2,100

for  double session primary schools and 1,260 for single-session

secondary schools.  These planning norms are based on 35  pupils

per  class but schools can operate up to a maximum of 40  pupils

per  class.   The current primary school building  specification

standard  provides  for  36  classrooms,  4  language  rooms,  1

language laboratory, 10 special rooms for arts, music, computer,

science  and  mathematics  and the rest  of  the  administration

offices,  library, hall, etc.  For secondary schools, there  are

<div align="center"><b>SCHOOL CLUSTERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) how

are  schools grouped into clusters of schools; (b) what are  the

organisational structure and composition of members of a  school

cluster   management;   and  (c)  what   are   the   roles   and

responsibilities of a school cluster management.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 9 school clusters, with 6 to 7

schools  per cluster.  Three clusters comprise secondary schools

only;  one cluster has a mix of secondary schools and  a  junior

college;  one a mix of primary and secondary schools;  and  four

comprise  primary  schools only.  Cluster  schools  tend  to  be

geographically  close  to each other.   This  is  to  facilitate

personal interaction and maximum collaboration among schools  in

the  pooling  of  personnel, financial and  physical  resources.

School  variety  is another factor. Variety in  terms  of  pupil

intake,  stage  of  development  and size add  richness  to  the

cluster experience.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each school cluster is led by a Superintendent. He is a

senior education officer who chairs the Cluster Management Board

(CMB) comprising principals of the member schools.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important tenet of the cluster scheme that

individual schools be given maximum freedom to develop  its  own

ethos  and  character.  The CMB is therefore to  facilitate  the

sharing  of ideas and resources, but not dictate the running  of

the   schools  for  which  final  authority  remains  with   the

individual  principal.  The CMB collects  feedback  from  member

schools  through  sharing sessions, self-appraisal  and  regular

contact  sessions with staff members.  The Superintendent  works

with the individual principals in appraising the performance and

potential of key personnel, and see to the grooming of promising

officers.

<div align="center"><b>MAKING EXPRESSWAYS SAFER</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. <b>Mr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for Communications

what  measures the Government will be taking to make  travelling

on  our expressways safer by more stringent regulations of heavy

service vehicles used in the maintenance of the expressways.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To forewarn motorists of stationary maintenance works,

contractors have to abide by the Temporary Signing Manual issued

by  LTA which spells out the guidelines on the placing of signs,

barriers  and  traffic cones.  This manual follows international

practice,  and  gives  motorists  sufficient  warning  of   road

maintenance works and obstructions which can pose safety hazards

to motorists.  All contractors undertaking works for LTA and the

various  utility service agencies such as PowerGrid, Power  Gas,

PUB and Singapore Telecom have to comply with the provisions  of

this manual.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA also conducts refresher courses regularly to remind

contractors  and  service agencies of  the  importance  of  safe

practices  when carrying out their works along the road.   LTA's

contractors  and  service  agents  who  do  not  adhere  to  the

guidelines are liable to be fined and suspended.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow moving trucks undertaking maintenance works on the

expressways,  such  as  water tankers  and  road  sweepers,  are

required  to  be  fitted with bright warning hazard  lights  and

large lighted moving arrows at their rear to forewarn motorists.

LTA  and  the Traffic Police (TP) will work closely together  to

ensure  that all service vehicles carrying out works  along  the

expressways are properly equipped with adequate signage.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, LTA has required the use of a shock

absorber called the Truck Mounted Attenuator mandatory  for  its

contractors  carrying out works on the expressways.   The  shock

absorber, to be located in advance of the stationary works, will

absorb  the impact of a vehicle that strays into the work  area,

without injuring the occupants.  The LTA and TP are working with

the  other  utility  service agencies such  as  NParks  and  the

Ministry  of the Environment to use the device when their  water

tankers and sweepers are working on the expressways.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To forewarn motorists of broken-down/accident vehicles

or  any  other  obstructions,  the  Expressways  Monitoring  and

Advisory  System,  or  EMAS  for short,  when  implemented  will

provide  advance warning signs to inform drivers of any incident

and  obstruction,  so that they can negotiate the  area  safely.

EMAS  will be implemented along the Central Expressway in  March

1998 and subsequently extended to other expressways.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, motorists must also play their part to make the

expressways  safer by observing traffic rules and  safe  driving

practices.   They should be alert to changing traffic conditions

and  look  out for warning signs.  According to TP, speeding  is

the  major  cause  of the 85 fatal and serious injury  accidents

along  our  expressways  last year.   In  conjunction  with  the

Automobile Association of Singapore and other organisations,  TP

also  holds regular road safety campaigns every year to  educate

road  users on the need to adopt good driving habits.   Some  of

these  campaigns  include "Ride Safely, Stay Alive",  the  Anti-drink  Drive  and Speed Management Campaigns.  TP  is  currently

undertaking a comprehensive review of the Road Traffic  Act  and

Rules  to enhance road safety.  TP will also install more  speed

detection cameras on the expressways to curb speeding.

<div align="center"><b>APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry

what incentives have been given for apprenticeship training; how

successful  has the concept been here; and whether  more  places

will be created in future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apprenticeship Training Scheme complements the full-time training system. Apprenticeship comprises On-the-Job

Training  (OJT)  and  Off-the-Job  Training  (Off-JT).  OJT   is

provided  by  the company which employs the apprentice.  Off-JT,

which  consists of classroom instruction and workshop  practice,

is  conducted  in  an  ITE  institute or  an  approved  industry

training centre.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skills Development Fund (SDF) provides financial

assistance,   in   the  form  of  grants,   to   companies   for

apprenticeship  training.  A  company  will  be  given   up   to

$11,000/trainee  for training an unskilled apprentice  to  NTC-2

skill  level. These grants cover about half of a company's total

training  cost. To date, SDF has approved about $40  million  to

support  some  6,620 apprentices, of whom more than  5,000  have

completed  their  apprenticeship. The  Institute  for  Technical

Education  (ITE)  acts as the organisation  for  certifying  the

training as well as disbursing SDF incentive grants. Many  small

employers have benefited from ITE disbursing grants at  year-end

rather  than at the end of each trade course, which may take  up

to three years.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apprenticeship Scheme has received good response

from  employers.   Driven  by industry  demand,  the  number  of

apprenticeship courses has expanded from 70 in  1996  to  75  in

1998, covering 21 trade clusters.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years, employers have been offering

an  average  of  2,500 apprentice places a year. However,  these

places  have  not  been fully taken up because the  majority  of

technical students still prefer to pursue full-time training  in

the  ITE. Typically, only 18% of this group chooses to enter the

Apprenticeship Scheme. Also, the introduction of  the  Secondary

Normal   (Technical)  course  four  years  ago  has  temporarily

constrained  the  number  of trainees entering  the  Scheme.  We

expect  the yearly number of trainees joining the Apprenticeship

Scheme to increase to 1,700 (from 1,000 in 1997) when the  first

batch of Normal (Technical) school-leavers enters the job market

this year.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to promote apprenticeship

as  an  attractive and cost-effective mode of training  to  both

employers and school-leavers.

<div align="center"><b>IMPACT OF REGIONAL CRISIS ON OLDER WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Labour what the

Government will do to prevent employers from using the  regional

currency  crisis as an excuse to get rid of Singaporean workers,

especially the older ones who can work until they are  62  years

old, before the retirement age is extended from 60 to 62 on  1st

January 1999 and how the Government can help cushion the  impact

of  the regional economic crisis on workers worried about losing

their jobs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional currency crisis is likely to slow down

Singapore's growth rate this year.  Companies, especially  those

with  business exposure to the region, will be affected  by  the

currency turmoil.  Some may have to restructure their businesses

and  downsize.  So far, there is no evidence that local workers,

particularly  the  older  ones,  have  been  singled   out   for

retrenchments.  The  main  reasons for  the  retrenchments  were

business  failure,  industry downturn and  companies  undergoing

restructuring.  Of the 9,784 workers retrenched last year, 68.7%

of  them  were  local  workers with the  remaining  31.3%  being

foreign nationals.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Nee Soon Central is concerned

that  before  the  retirement age of 62  is  legislated  on  1st

January  1999, some employers may quickly discharge the  workers

so  as to avoid retaining them up to the age of 62.  This should

not  happen.   In fact, my Ministry is encouraging companies  to

voluntarily extend the retirement age to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



62 even before 1st January 1999.  So long as the older employees

are  productive and can continue to contribute to  the  company,

employers are unlikely to terminate their services.  Such a move

would  be short-sighted as the employers would find it difficult

to recruit experienced workers when business conditions improve.

In  the  event  that an employee is unfairly  dismissed  by  his

employer on account of his age or for other reasons, he can seek

assistance  from the Ministry under the Employment  Act  or  the

Retirement Age Act.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of more workers being retrenched in the

months  ahead as a result of the regional financial crisis,  the

Ministry    has   set   up   a   Tripartite   Panel   comprising

representatives from the EDB, NTUC, SNEF, PSB and MOL to  assist

retrenched workers seeking re-employment.  The Panel would  also

explore alternatives such as adjustment of wage costs under  the

flexible  wage  system to avoid retrenching their  workers,  re-deployment  and implementing shorter work week.  Employers  will

also  be  encouraged  to  take advantage of  available  training

incentives  to  improve the skills of their workers  during  the

lull  period.  The workers, on the other hand, are urged to take

training and skills upgrading seriously so that they can  remain

employable in an increasingly difficult economic situation.

solution  to  the problem.  It is for this reason  that  in  May

1996,  Singapore announced a two-year export moratorium on  APLs

without self-neutralising or self-destructing devices.   It  was

intended that this two-year moratorium period be used to  review

Singapore's  position  on APLs and to consider  whether  or  not

Singapore was in a position to sign the Ottawa Treaty.  (This is

carefully, to see whether we can accede to it.  We will consider

signing the Treaty when we are certain that we can fully  comply

with all its provisions and obligations, taking into account our

<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will

furnish a schedule of all investments, acquisitions or takeovers

made by Government-owned and Government-linked companies year by

year,   for   the  years  1988-1997,  showing  the  investments,

acquisitions or takeovers made by each company and  the  profits

made  or  losses  suffered by the company from the  investments,

acquisitions or takeovers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investments, acquisitions and takeovers made by GLCs

are   driven  by  their  corporate  strategies  for  growth  and

diversification.  They are long term investments  and  are  made

after due diligence.  Until they are sold or disposed of, it  is

often  not  meaningful  to  determine the  capital  gains/losses

arising  from the investment made as these are still unrealised.

When  the  investments  are divested, the  realised  profits  or

losses will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



reflected  in  their  accounts.  However, since  most  of  these

investments,   acquisitions   and   takeovers   are    long-term

investments and have yet to be realised or disposed of, it would

not   be  meaningful  to  try  to  furnish  a  schedule  of  the

investments, acquisitions or takeovers made by the GLCs, and  to

determine the profits/losses made arising from them, as the NCMP

has requested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP may wish to note that the contributions of

operating  profits  or  losses from their major  investments  or

acquisitions are included in the annual accounts of the GLCs  in

accordance with standard accounting treatment for the  reporting

of  the  accounts of a company.    In addition, for  the  listed

GLCs,  like  other companies under SES regulations,  they  would

have  to seek shareholders' approval for major acquisitions  and

divestments.   There is therefore already a considerable  amount

of  transparency and public scrutiny over major investments  and

acquisitions  made by our GLCs, as well as their performance  or

non-performance.

<div align="center"><b>SCHEME FOR EDUCATION OF THE ILLITERATE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry

(a)  the number of people in Singapore below the age of 45 years

who  are illiterate and (b) whether the Government will start  a

scheme  to give them some form of education so that they can  be

more productive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1997 Labour Force Survey showed that there are 117,500

economically-active persons in the workforce aged 45  and  below

who  have  either  never attended school,  or  have  only  lower

primary  education. This represents 6.4% of  the  labour  force,

down  from 15% in 1985.  These workers are especially vulnerable

to structural unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, the NTUC and community self-help

organizations have put in place several programmes to help

upgrade these workers.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basic Education for Skills Training (BEST) programme,

launched in 1983, caters to those who have missed out on a basic

education.   BEST allows workers to study English  Language  and

Mathematics up to Primary 6 level.  As of December 1997, 217,600

workers  have  enrolled in at least one BEST  module.  To  date,

57,100  have  received the BEST Module 4 Certificate (equivalent

to  Primary  6)  in either English Language or  Mathematics,  or

both.   23,000  (40%) of them have progressed to  other  courses

like  the  WISE (Worker Improvement through Secondary Education)

or MOST (Modular Skills Training) programmes.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast Forward is another such programme. A national tele-video training scheme offered by the Productivity and Standards

Board  (PSB), it is specially designed for the worker  with  low

education  and  little  time  for training.  About  33,300  have

completed or are still engaged in the programme.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC, EDB, PSB and ITE have launched the Skills

Redevelopment Programme (SRP) to help unskilled and semi-skilled

workers  increase their employability. To date, a  total  of  50

companies have signed up to train 5,900 unskilled workers in ITE-certified courses under the scheme.  The SRP will be expanded to

train more workers during this period of economic downturn.

<div align="center"><b>REVITALISING THE RETAIL SECTOR</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry, given the severe downturn of retail businesses in

general, how the Government will help to revitalise this sector

and what measures have been thought of, eg, lower rentals or

subsidies for computer modernisation, to make retail owners more

competitive as this is an important value-added sector for

attracting tourists to Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding the motor vehicle trade, the retail sector has

grown  at  an  average of 3.5 % per annum in real terms  between

1993  and  1997, slower than the growth of 5.9 %  over  1988-93.

The  sluggish growth is caused by a number of factors,  some  of

which  are  structural  in nature and existed  even  before  the

regional financial crisis.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To counter the decline in visitor arrivals, the Singapore

Tourism  Board  (STB) is intensifying its promotion  efforts  in

markets  such as the USA, Europe, Australia, Taiwan, and  China.

Singapore  hotels and SIA are establishing joint promotion  tie-ups  in  Europe and the US.  These efforts should have  spin-off

benefits for Singapore retailers.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STB will continue to spearhead schemes to help retailers

restructure and upgrade through the following programmes:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Singapore Gold Circle. This is a quality recognition

and  branding programme.  It will set performance benchmarks for

participants,  facilitate collaborative  marketing  and  quality

promotion, and assist individual members in business development

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Tourism Development Assistance Scheme. This is aimed

at  encouraging  the development and upgrading  of  the  tourism

industry.  For example, grants will be provided to retailers  to

assist  them  in  developing new marketing  ideas  and  flagship

stores,  as  well as to collaborate and form economic  groupings

(e.g. central warehousing).

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Mall of Singapore Thematic Zone. The first prototype

of  the  Mall of Singapore will be Orchard Road.  This  aims  to

make Orchard Road more retail friendly.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Great Singapore Sale. Launched in 1995, this

helps  retailers present a more vibrant and attractive  shopping

experience for Singaporeans and visitors.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

Within  the  more  domestically-oriented retail sector,  several

schemes  and measures are targeted at helping retailers  improve

their performance.  Examples are :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Encouraging retailers to join franchises or form

economic groupings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Using Information Technology (IT) to help small shops

improve shop management, eg, ShopNet (grocery trade) and BookNet

(books and stationery trade).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Generic upgrading programmes for retailers in areas,

such  as  stock control, visual merchandising, housekeeping  and

customer service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning rentals, HDB and Pidemco have provided some

assistance.   In the private sector, the market  trend  is  also

towards lower rentals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MP for Hougang has requested for the development costs

and  selling prices of four building contracts at Sengkang  N  2

C27,  N3 C1 and N2 C28 and Jurong West N6 C26. The flats in  the

first  two  building  contracts in  Sengkang  were  offered  for

booking in 4th Quarter 1997, whereas the third building contract

is  scheduled for booking in 1st Quarter 1998. The new flats  in

Jurong  West N6 C26 have not been offered for booking and  their

development costs and selling prices have yet to be finalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development costs and selling prices of the three

building  contracts in Sengkang as requested by the  MP  are  in

Table 1 below. The prices of flats in the Sengkang contracts are

generally  higher than those of other towns. This is mainly  due

to  factors  such as better building designs, higher demand  and

good location near the MRT station and Town Centre. Sengkang  is

also the first town to be built with the LRT incorporated in the

town  planning  and  the  LRT built before  the  town  is  fully

developed.  The  average market subsidy of a  Sengkang  flat  is

$103,300.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy is to subsidise the smaller flats

more  heavily than the bigger flats. To encourage applicants  to

choose the less popular towns in Jurong West and Woodlands,  the

flats  in  these estates are priced lower than in  Sengkang  and

hence the development loss is greater (see Table 1).

* Excludes subsidy incurred for the purchase of 3-room resale

flats at market prices for sale at subsidised prices to the

lower income families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above table shows that for new HDB flats offered for

booking in 1997, HDB is expected to suffer a development loss of

$280 million. This loss will be funded by the Government through

the annual grant given to HDB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MP has also asked about the pricing of HDB flats. In

the  last Parliament sitting, I have explained that the  selling

prices  are  determined  by  the location,  floor  area,  design

features, and finishes as well as other attributes of the flats.

Other factors like good view, proximity to MRT/LRT stations, the

demand  for  flats in the different towns are  also  taken  into

account  in the selling prices of the flats. The selling  prices

of  flats  offered  for  booking are therefore  derived  from  a

combination of factors depending on their individual  attributes

and  are  not directly comparable from one building contract  to

another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure affordability of HDB flats to the lower income

families,  the Government is committed to pricing the HDB  flats

such  that 90% of the first timer households can afford at least

a  3-room flat and 70% of the first timer households can  afford

at least a 4-room flat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry already has a Research & Information Technology

Division  which conducts studies and research.  It is  currently

embarking  on two major studies on the family. The first  is  on

the  Singapore Family which will provide data on the  impact  of

work  pressures on working couples and dual-career parents.  The

concerns raised by the NMP on issues relating to family and work

and  the  increasing  pressures and  prevalence  of  dual-career

families  will  be  addressed in the study.  The  findings  will

enable  the ministries and other agencies to formulate  policies

and programmes to strengthen the family.  The second study is on

the  impact  of  foreign domestic maids on  the  care  of  young

children.  In both studies, MCD has consulted and involved other

ministries  and  agencies to benefit from their  inputs  and  to

ensure that the findings will be relevant to them.

studies  on  family  issues.  It will continue  to  network  and

collaborate with individuals, including those from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



tertiary   institutions   and  other  organisations,   including

ministries  who have strong interest on family issues.   A  more

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's approach in helping low income families is

to  help  them to overcome their difficulties and improve  their

well-being through the support given by both the Government  and

the  non-government  sectors. Through  the  Many  Helping  Hands

approach,  the  Government, together with the voluntary  sector,

has developed a network of social services to assist families in

need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of services and programmes covers the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Financial assistance through the Public Assistance Scheme,

the   Rent  &  Utilities Assistance Scheme, the  Small  Families

Improvement  Scheme,  Medifund and other  financial  schemes  of

Government  departments, charitable organisations and  self-help

and religious groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Counselling, information and referral services at Family

Service  Centres to help families to sort out their  family  and

personal matters and help the children in tuition and supervised

homework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Centre-Based Financial Assistance Scheme for Child Care

(CFAC) and the Subsidy for Before And After School Care (BASC)

provide affordable child-care for low income families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Training awards available at the various community self-help groups help low-income and low-skilled workers pay for

skills upgrading courses.  Such training awards cover between

75% and 95% of the course fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In the area of housing, HDB has various schemes such as the

Low  Income Family Incentive Scheme, Sale of 3-room Flats  under

the  Registration for Flat System and Sale of Flats  to  Sitting

Tenants Scheme to help low income families own HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Families who have elderly or disabled members can use the

various  support services such as day care centres,  counselling

services,  home  care  services,  respite  care  services,   day

activity centres and residential care facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information on the various types of schemes and services

available are provided in the "Directory of Services to Help Low-Income  Families".   MCD and the Community Development  Councils

(CDCs)  have  jointly launched a Public Education  Programme  On

Social Services targeted at about 98,000 households residing  at

the  1-  and 2-room HDB flats in December 1997. Volunteers  from

the   CDCs,   Residents'   Committees  and   voluntary   welfare

organisations  visit  these households to  explain  the  various

schemes  and services and how to go about seeking assistance  in

times of need. The booklet  "We are Just a Call Away" is used to

brief the households. Copies of this booklet which are available

in 4 languages are also given to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDC National Helpline launched in January 1998 enables

residents to call for assistance.  Residents need only  remember

the  Helpline  number to gain access to various  services.   The

Helpline is published through a brochure issued by the CDC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various CDCs are actively working with the voluntary

organisations to set up new services and schemes to better  meet

the needs of the residents.

the  Government  will give priority to the inclusion  of  shared

values as a component of national education.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of Shared Values was first mooted by PM Goh in

the  late  1980s  as  a  way  for us to  develop  a  Singaporean

identity.    The  five  Shared  Values  were  then  adopted   in

Parliament in 1993 after a nation-wide discussion and debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shared Values are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Nation before community and society above self.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Family as the basic unit of society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Community support and respect for the individual

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Consensus not conflict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Racial and religious harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shared Values are an integral part of National

Education.    As   National  Education   is   about   developing

responsible  citizenship  and a sense  of  rootedness  in  young

Singaporeans,  the  Shared Values fit  naturally  into  National

Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong.

<br>We want to keep our heritage and our way of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We must preserve racial and religious harmony.

<br>Though many races, languages, religions and cultures, we pursue one destiny.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility.

<br>This means opportunity for all, according to their ability and effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- No one owes Singapore a living.

<br>We must find our own way to survive and prosper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We must ourselves defend Singapore.

<br>No one else is responsible for our security and well-being.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We have confidence in our future.

<br>United, determined and well-prepared, we shall build a bright future for ourselves.
