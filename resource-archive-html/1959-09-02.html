<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE'S FINANCIAL POSITION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to report to the Assembly  on

certain aspects of our financial position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we assumed office, we made a detailed

investigation of the finances of the country.  The

Government  has  reported that a  deficit  of  $14

million  has to be disposed of. The sum itself  is

not  very large but what was of greater import  is

that  for  some time past current expenditure  had

been  financed out of the reserves of the country.

This  points to a basic imbalance between  revenue

and expenditure which needs looking into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Revenue balance now stands at about

three months' revenue. It is therefore a matter of

common prudence that the revenue balance shall not

be  permitted  to go much below this limit  unless

new sources of liquidity are readily available. It

has  therefore been necessary to take a number  of

steps some of which have been severe in character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has frozen all vacancies arising

in  the establishment without making a distinction

as to the reasons for such vacancies, whether they

arise  from retirement or resignation, or  whether

they  are newly created posts. Special Expenditure

has  also  been frozen so that a careful  scrutiny

can  be  made  to  weed out items  which  are  not

absolutely  necessary.  A  Cabinet  committee  was

formed,  consisting  of  the  Prime  Minister   as

Chairman, and the Deputy Prime Minister and myself

as   the  other  members.  We  have  gone  through

applications  from Ministries and departments  and

have set up the most stringent standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently all Ministers have been asked to

scrutinise the state of the vote and to report  on

what economies are possible. This whole process of

freezing and vetting of expenditure constitutes  a

major   operation.   As   a  result,   substantial

economies have been effected and the total  amount

of  reduction  has  reached the  figure  of  $25.7

million. Of this, $20.1



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



million  were reductions in the Ordinary Estimates

and  $5.6  million were savings in the Development

Estimates. This is a considerable achievement  and

has been made possible through the co-operation of

all departments of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to pay a special tribute to senior

Treasury officials who have had to put in long and

punishing  hours  of work in the  course  of  this

exercise.  I  also want to acknowledge  the  full-hearted  support of my colleagues in this  economy

drive.  My colleagues and I work as a team and  it

is  because  we work as a team that  it  has  been

possible  to  reduce the estimated expenditure  by

this substantial amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be idle to pretend, however, that the

slashes in the economy drive of this magnitude can

be  brought out painlessly. Everyone is  aware  of

the  pained  reaction  to  the  cuts  in  variable

allowances.  Because of the freeze  on  vacancies,

many Ministries have to work short-handed and this

means that everyone works harder. Then many of the

schemes  which have been entered in the  Estimates

after  years of tussle with the Treasury have  now

to be jettisoned or at least postponed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation has not been a painless one but it

is   necessary,  in  the  interest  of   financial

solvency, that one sets one's face sternly against

the cries of anguish coming from the stricken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now in the happy position to report to the

Assembly  that, as a result of our exertions,  the

finances  of  the Government have now  attained  a

healthier  state. Before I present the  facts  and

figures,  there is one point to which  I  wish  to

draw  attention.  And this is that  not  only  had

authorised expenditure exceeded estimated  revenue

by  a  substantial amount when we took office  but

there were signs that certain items of revenue had

not been keeping up with the estimated levels.  In

particular, the tobacco revenue has declined  very

seriously  as compared with the amount  estimated.

This  has  increased  both  the  difficulties   of

balancing the Budget and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



the  urgency to do so. I show in summary form  how

the  finances  of the Government  now  stand.  The

figures  are  given in Table 1*  which  have  been

distributed to Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Appendix I, cols. 629-30.

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1959/19590902/19590902-HA-0110629.pdf"">APPENDIX I(Cols 0629-0630)</a><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the reductions by Ministers and sub-divisions of expenditure are shown in Table 2+.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+Appendix II, cols. 629-30.

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1959/19590902/19590902-HA-0110630.pdf"">APPENDIX II(Cols 0629-0630)</a><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general position is that we are now faced

with  a small deficit of $2.9 million. This  is  a

comparatively  small sum. It  is  likely  that  we

shall  end the year on an even keel. There may  be

need  for  additional expenditure  in  respect  of

claims  already submitted by Ministries and  which

are  under  examination. As against  this,  it  is

possible  that we may tap new sources of  revenue.

As  stated  in the policy speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, this Government will not consider

revenue   increases  until  all  possible  economy

measures  have  first been applied.  We  have  now

reached  this  stage  and  are  free  to  consider

proposals to increase revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said before that we shall probably

"balance" the Budget, I used the word in reference

to the accounting practice adopted in the past. It

had  been  the practice for some time  to  finance

part  of  the  development  by  depleting  reserve

funds. In 1959, this practice has continued in the

Estimates. Members will note in Section B  3  (iv)

in  the  first Table that $18.5 million is  to  be

transferred  from the General Revenue  balance  to

the  Development  Budget. As I  said  earlier,  we

should  not  allow the General Revenue balance  to

fall  much  below its present level  and  it  will

therefore  be  necessary to finance  part  of  the

Development  Expenditure by loans. The  Government

has  already announced its intention to float  two

loans of different maturities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this assessment of the financial position of

the  country, I must therefore make some reference

to   the   state  of  the  public  debt  and   the

accumulation  of  funds which the  Government  and

various statutory bodies under its direction  hold

locally and abroad.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the Government is concerned, the public

debt has been very small. This has its virtues. At

the same time, it must be borne in mind that there

is no merit in not borrowing money from the public

if  this  means  retarding  essential  development

schemes  and services which are necessary  to  the

growth  of  the  economy.  More  especially  where

public  savings are available, it  is  foolish  to

deny  these sound opportunities for investment  in

this   country - investments  which  would   promote

further  expansion  in  various  sectors  of   the

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as this Government itself is concerned,

the  position is that the total public debt stands

at  $115 million. Of this, sinking funds have been

accumulated  which  amount to about  $75  million.

There  is  therefore  a net  public  debt  of  $40

million or some $25 per head of population.  There

are  very few governments which have a public debt

as low as this. Further, we must take into account

the various reserve funds which the Government has

accumulated  in the various funds  and  the  loans

advanced  to statutory bodies. These latter  total

some  $190 million of which $172 million are still

outstanding. The Government itself emerges  as  an

overall creditor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assess the financial standing of the country

as  a  whole, it is necessary to take into account

not  only  the resources of the central government

but  those  of the statutory bodies.  I  give  the

total  investments held in funds under the control

of   the  central  government  and  its  statutory

bodies.  The details appear in Table 3**  which  has

been distributed to Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Appendix III, cols. 631-2.

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1959/19590902/19590902-HA-0110631.pdf"">APPENDIX III(Cols 0631-0632)</a><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total value of all these funds comes to

$417.6  million.  Of  this,  $144.6  million   are

accumulated in local investments. The  balance  of

$273 million is invested abroad. The breakdown  of

the   overseas   investments  of  Government   and

statutory  bodies is illuminating and the  figures

are  given in Table 4++.







The picture which  emerges

is  an  extraordinary one. While we  in  Singapore

have always



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;++ Appendix IV, cols. 631-2.

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1959/19590902/19590902-HA-0110632.pdf"">APPENDIX IV(Cols 0631-0632)</a><br>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



cried  aloud for the entry of foreign capital,  we

have  been unaware that we have enormous  sums  of

money  invested  abroad  for  the  development  of

countries most of which are far wealthier than us.

If   we   take  into  account  private   Singapore

investments abroad, the value of our total foreign

investments will be even much greater. The  latest

estimate  in  respect  of banks,  places  the  net

assets   of   Singapore  banks  held  in   foreign

countries  at $325 million. In addition,  we  have

taken into account investments abroad by insurance

firms  operating  in  Singapore.  There  are  also

foreign   investments  by  companies  and  private

individuals resident in Singapore. The figures for

all these are not readily available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above account of our investments abroad does

not  take into consideration the currency  Reserve

Funds.  These  funds,  of course,  do  not  belong

solely  to  Singapore. We  are  only  one  of  the

participating    members    of    the    agreement

establishing the Currency Board, the Federation of

Malaya,  North Borneo, Sarawak, and  Brunei  being

the other parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The currency reserves are considerable, the

latest figure being $1,110 million. All these  are

invested   abroad.  The  future  of  the  Currency

Agreement   is   under  discussion   between   the

participating countries, and I do not wish to  say

more about this. I am not saying that there is any

need  to take precipitate action to withdraw these

funds  abroad  for investment in Singapore.  There

are advantages in holding investments abroad. From

the  Government point of View, funds  invested  in

London  have the great advantage of liquidity.  No

doubt   similar   considerations   have   led   to

investment of bank balances in London. These  bank

balances  are primarily used as a Reserve  Balance

in  the  financing of our foreign trade,  and,  as

such,  serve a valuable purpose. Considering  that

Singapore's  imports and exports  totalled  $6,880

million  in 1958, there is no ground for believing

that   these   bank  balances  held   abroad   are

excessive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make this brief review of Singapore's overseas

balances  in  order to underline two  points.  The

first is that, as a great trading centre, we are a

part  of  the  world economy, and  have  important

financial and economic links in many parts of  the

world.   Our   continued  prosperity  depends   on

strengthening these links, and if we disrupt these

links, we do so at our own peril. The second point

is  that  we  have invested large sums abroad.  In

return, there has been a substantial investment of

foreign capital in our country, though the  totals

have  not  been reliably computed.  It  is  almost

certain  that after taking these into account,  we

emerge very much on the credit side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the end of World War II, it has become

fashionable among the modern industrial nations of

the  world  to speak of the need to assist  under-developed  regions, especially by way  of  capital

investment.  But in Singapore the relationship  is

exactly  the reverse of what has now  come  to  be

accepted  as normal. I do hope that when  we  have

occasion  to ask for loans from abroad,  we  shall

not  be  treated as poor relatives  in  quest  for

assistance,  for  our moral position  in  this  is

surely very strong.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>Fourth Supplementary Estimates, 1959</b></div>



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Fourth Supplementary Estimates of

Expenditure for 1959 (Paper Cmd. (New  Series)  18

of 1959).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are amendments. The first is on Head 7,

Chief Minister/Prime Minister, in the name of  the

Member for Farrer Park, in relation to subhead  1,

item  (33).  This amendment, I have  indicated  to

honourable  Members,  is in  respect  of  an  item

similar to items under Heads 61 and 62. Therefore,

for convenience, discussion on the first amendment

may  range over the other two amendments, in which

event  there  will be no further debate  when  the

other two amendments are reached. I trust that  is

clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 7 -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (33) of subhead

1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for

making  it  possible for me to speak on the  other

heads  of  expenditure; it  will  save  the  House

considerable  time if I speak  on  all  the  three

amendments at the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, soon after the present

Government  was returned to power and  soon  after

the  Prime Minister and his ministerial colleagues

had taken office, one of the first statements that

he  made  was  that  it  was  the  desire  of  the

Government to cut down Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



expenditure and that it would be right and  proper

in   those   circumstances  that   the   Ministers

themselves should suffer the first cut.  That  was

very laudable, and the Government proceeded to  do

it,  thereby  giving an indication to  the  public

that  the cost of ministerial Government certainly

was  going  to  be  reduced.  Let  us,  therefore,

examine that statement in the light of events that

have happened subsequently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now find that requests are being made for

Political     Secretaries.    Beyond     Political

Secretaries, Parliamentary Secretaries  have  also

been  appointed  to Ministries,  where  previously

Assistant Ministers had not existed. I venture  to

suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the total costs of

the  Ministers  together with their  Parliamentary

Secretaries and Political Secretaries - such  as  we

know  them - perhaps exceed the total cost  of  what

the  Ministers  and  the Assistant  Ministers  had

previously  drawn - when I say  "previously  drawn",

Mr  Speaker,  I mean by Ministers  and  Assistant

Ministers in the previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appointment of Political Secretary is

something  which  certainly is not  known  to  the

Constitution of Singapore. Therefore, it would  be

interesting to find out what this appointment  is.

Firstly, are these posts civil service posts? That

is  the  first  question,  and  I  would  like  it

answered.  If they are civil service  posts,  have

these  appointments already been made? If  so,  by

whom? If they are not civil service posts, and  if

these appointments have already been made, who are

the  holders  of  these posts  and  whether  these

holders  are members of the P.A.P. and  have  been

given  these posts merely because they  have  been

useful to the Party in bringing them to power? And

lastly,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I would like  to  know

whether there are only three Political Secretaries

attached  to  the three Ministries set  out  here,

namely



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 7 Chief Minister/Prime Minister



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 1 item (33) Personal Secretary

(Political).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 61 Ministry of Culture



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 1 item (3) Personal Secretary

(Political), one ($1,400); one ($1,100).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



For   the  Minister  for  Culture,  not  one,  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  but  two  Political  Secretaries.

Under -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 62 Ministry of National Development

Subhead    1   item   (3)   Personal   Secretary

(Political).



<br><br>I  do  not  know whether there are other  Personal

Secretaries  (Political)  attached  to  the  other

Ministries, but these are the only posts which the

House is aware of in these Estimates.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another curious feature of the Personal Secretary

(Political) is that, as described here, the  Prime

Minister carries a Personal Secretary (Political),

the Minister for National Development also carries

a  Personal  Secretary  (Political),  whereas  the

Minister  for  Culture carries two,  one  Personal

Secretary  (Political) at $1,400 a  month,  and  a

second Personal Secretary (Political) at $1,100  a

month.  If they are given the value for the posts,

I suppose the gentleman who is holding the post at

$1,400  must  be  holding the more valuable  post.

Perhaps  the  House  could  be  told  why  it   is

necessary,  if  at  all it is necessary,  to  have

Political  Secretaries,  that  the  Minister   for

Culture should have two Personal Secretaries,  and

one at a rate which exceeds all the other Personal

Secretaries by $300 a month.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is "That the sum to be

allocated for Head 7 be reduced by $10 in  respect

of  item (33) of subhead 1 therein." As indicated,

the debate may range over Head 61, subhead 1, item

(3) ,  Personal Secretary (Political), $17,500,  in

respect  of  which  an amendment  appears  in  the

Supplement to the Order Paper in the name  of  the

Member for Farrer Park:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 61 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (3) of  subhead

1.



<br><br>Similarly with regard to Head 62, subhead 1,  item (3).



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker, I must congratulate the Member for Farrer

Park for his ingenuity in calculating the costs of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



present  Ministries  as  against  those   of   the

previous  Government, and coming to the  brilliant

conclusion that we are costing the people more.  I

have  to  disillusion him, because  he  forgot  to

include  in the previous Government the officials,

of  which there were three, who were colleagues of

the  present Member for Geylang Serai. If you look

under  the  Heads,  "Chief Secretary",  "Attorney-General", all under the Ministerial side, and  the

cost  of  the linen and the crockery and  all  the

rest  of  it, you will find that it comes to  much

more than what we are costing now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I welcome the opportunity to

clarify  the  appointment of Personal  Secretaries

(Political).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Minister, to assist him in the discharge of

his    responsibilities,   has   a   Parliamentary

Secretary,  a Permanent Secretary and  a  Personal

Secretary (Political). As has already been pointed

out,  the Minister for Culture, according to  Cmd.

Paper   18  of  1959  is  carrying  two  Political

Secretaries. I congratulate the Member for  Farrer

Park for his assiduous study of this Paper and for

having  anticipated  an amendment  which  will  be

moved  by the Minister for Culture to clarify  the

designation  of one of those two posts.  In  fact,

there  is only one Personal Secretary (Political).

The  other, at $1,400, is not a Personal Secretary

(Political).  I  shall  not  anticipate  what   my

colleague  will  be  saying  when  he  moves   the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first delineate briefly the duties of the

Parliamentary Secretary and the Personal Secretary

(Political)?  Everybody knows what  the  Permanent

Secretary  is supposed to do. His duties  are  set

out in the Constitution itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary, as the term designates, carries the burden of the Minister's

parliamentary duties, and to the extent  that  the

Minister  designates or delegates, he carries  the

burden  of the Minister's ministerial duties.  The

Personal    Secretary    (Political)    has     no

administrative duties. He has no direct access  to

the Civil Service. He is a personal appointment of

the Minister, and his role is really that of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



Minister's  closest  confidant  on  the  political

implications of the moves, plans and  policies  of

the various Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that there have been three

appointments, and that there will be three more in

the  near future. Ultimately, all the appointments

will be filled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, my own personal appointment. He is Mr

Jek.  The second is Mr Woodhull whose appointment

is  Personal Secretary (Political) to the Minister

for  Health. The third is Mr Rahim Ishak, who  is

Personal Secretary (Political) to the Minister for

Culture. They are, Mr Speaker, Sir, our political

chiefs  of staff, so to speak, political  backroom

boys,  the people who have the aptitude, the skill

and touch in these matters which are of invaluable

assistance, I hope, to all Ministers, to avoid the

unnecessary  faux pas which would  otherwise  fall

their  way  if the presentation and implementation

of  policies  were  left  entirely  to  the  Civil

Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows, therefore, that they are all

political  appointments. I am unable to  enlighten

the  Member  on  the  actual  procedure  on  these

appointments.  I shall leave that to  my  Minister

for   Finance,   who  is  more   acquainted   with

establishment matters. What it amounts to is this.

This   is   the   Minister's  Personal   Secretary

(Political). It says what it means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say to the House that one of the problems

which  this Government faces - and I have said  this

on   many  previous  occasions - is  not  only   the

carrying  out of our plans and policies, but  also

the  manner  and method of presentation  of  these

policies to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jek was a former newspaper man on a Chinese newspaper. He also went to gaol for some time in

1957/1958  for  alleged subversive activities.  He

was  released,  presumably because the  Government

discovered   that  the  allegation  of  subversive

activities  was unfounded. He is not the  type  of

person whom we would want to give a job to for the

sake of rewarding him. If the last Government  had

a  fraction of the skill and devotion to duty, the

political know-how that these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



types  of  persons have, they would not have  come

such miserable croppers as they did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are open political appointments, and I

venture  to  suggest  that succeeding  governments

will  find  that  this  is  a  sound  and  healthy

practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me just refer you to one instance of the kind of difficulties those people

extricate us from. You will remember, Mr Speaker,

that we were making arrangements for the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to deliver the first speech to this

Assembly in Malay. The permanent staff was  there,

the  skilled translators in the former P.R.O. and

those  you had prudently recruited beforehand.  It

was a difficult first task - 18 pages of translation

were  almost unintelligible. But Mr Rahim  Ishak,

who  I hope will continue to give the Minister for

Culture  the political touch, was in the space  of

24 hours able to reduce what was an unintelligible

verbatim  translation into one which I hope  Malay

Members  on  the  other  side  will  agree  was  a

coherent  and  smooth passage from  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara in the national language.  He  was

able to do that because, amongst other things,  he

used to be the leader writer in the Utusan Melayu.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I should like to draw the attention

of the House to Head 61, subhead 1, item (3) which

now  reads  "Personal Secretary  (Political),  one

($1,400); one ($1,100)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry if I have slightly confused the Member

for Farrer Park, but I think he will have a better

understanding of what all this is about if  I  say

that  this does not reflect the staffing  position

quite  accurately. It should now read,  "Publicity

Liaison   Secretary  (Political)   ($1,400),   and

Personal Secretary (Political) ($1,100)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this new designation is to

indicate  more precisely the functions of  one  of

the  Secretaries.  The post of  Publicity  Liaison

Secretary   (Political)  is  also  an  appointment

personal  to the Minister, but it involves  duties

and functions which are in some respects different



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



from those of Personal Secretary (Political). When

the  Supplementary Estimates were  submitted,  the

post  of  Publicity Liaison Secretary  (Political)

was   then   designated  as   Personal   Secretary

(Political),  because  at that  time  it  was  not

possible to define precisely the functions of many

of  the  officials in the Ministry. As  you  know,

Sir, the Ministry of Culture is a new Ministry. It

has  to  be put together from scratch, and  it  is

still  today  in  the process of creation.  It  is

therefore  not possible to predict in detail  what

responsibility would fall on what officer and what

function they would be required to perform.  After

all,   Mr  Speaker,  there  are  many  Government

departments  which  have  been  in  existence  for

nearly a century, and there are officials who  are

still  not quite sure where they fit in, and  what

their  precise  tasks  are.  Therefore,  when  the

Ministry  of  Culture, which is only  about  three

months old, occasionally gives new designations to

one  officer, I do not think the Member for Farrer

Park should see anything more sinister in it.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Ministry of Culture is more or less

complete,  the  need  for what  I  have  termed  a

Publicity Liaison Secretary (Political) has become

more apparent. His functions are those imposed  by

the  very nature and structure of the Ministry  of

Culture.  As  you  know, Sir, my  Ministry  is  in

charge  of  a variety of publicity services - radio,

information,  posters, films, publications  and  a

public  address system under which field  officers

go  out every day to broadcast necessary and vital

information  to the public. This wide  variety  of

publicity  services have not only to be  fed  with

suitable  materials but it is also necessary  that

they  function  as a co-ordinated  unit.  It  will

therefore be one of the functions of the Publicity

Liaison  Secretary to see that there is  such  co-ordination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why my Ministry requires two appointments

which  are  personal to the Minister,  here  again

they  are imposed by the very character, functions

and  structure  of the Ministry of  Culture.  This

Ministry is concerned with shaping people's  ideas

and mental attitudes. To



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



quote  from  the  speech of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara, one of the functions of this Ministry will

be  to  create "a sense of national identity among

the various races in Malaya" and "to instil in our

people  of  all  races the will to be  a  nation".

This,  therefore,  involves not only  taking  into

account  such things as sentiments, attitudes  and

reactions  of  people  in  general  but  also  the

attitudes, sentiments and reactions of the various

cultural   and  racial  groups  in  this  country.

Therefore,  Sir, in the case of my  Ministry,  the

bricks  and mortar with which this Ministry  works

are  of  finer material than may be the case  with

some  other Ministries. In a multi-racial  society

like  ours,  it is necessary for this Ministry  to

have  people  who can advise it on the  political,

social and cultural reactions of the various races

and  communities in Singapore. Therefore,  one  of

these posts requires someone with a knowledge  not

only  of  the Chinese language but also of Chinese

trends, thought and reactions and also a knowledge

of   (on  the  purely  technical  side)  publicity

methods and organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other post requires someone with a knowledge

of the Malay language and Malay thought, reactions

and  attitudes. In view of this, I feel, Sir, that

there  is  every  justification  for  having   two

political secretaries because they will guide this

Ministry  which deals mainly with ideas, attitudes

and  sentiments, to gauge accurately reactions  to

Government  measures or Government  programmes  on

the  part  of these communities. I am  quite  sure

that  if, as the Prime Minister mentioned earlier,

the  previous  Government had a  little  bit  more

foresight  in  this matter and not  felt  its  own

pulse  and  mistaken it for the  pulse  of  public

opinion, it would not be where it is today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I want to make one point in

further elucidation which I had taken for granted,

when I first stood up to speak on this motion.  It

is  this: that every act of the Government  is  in

fact  being  interpreted in four different  worlds

and, very often, with four different results:  the

Chinese-speaking world, the Malay-speaking  world,

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



Indian-speaking  world  and  the  English-speaking

world.  And  we  have as yet no  Minister  who  is

educated to straddle all these four worlds.  Quite

a  number  of  my Ministers are ambidextrous,  who

have  been  educated in more than one  world.  The

appointment of political secretaries is to make up

this deficiency. I am English-educated. Sometimes,

an  act  which to the English-educated temper  and

reaction may sound reasonable, correct and proper,

may  require some amendments in order that it  can

be equally welcomed by the Chinese-educated world.

Hence  the  appointment of my political  secretary

who  is  a  man well conversant with  the  Chinese

world. In the case of the Minister for Health,  he

is   Malay-educated  and  his  appointment  is  to

compensate  for his lack of touch of the  English-speaking world with which he has a great  deal  to

do in his Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague the Minister for Culture has said, a

new Malayan culture will be built basically around

the  Malay language and it was essential  that  he

should   have   someone   who   has   the    right

understanding    of   the   reaction    and    the

susceptibilities  and  the sentiments,  the  whole

political  and philosophical outlook of the  Malay

people.  This  is  a  factor  which  we  must  all

remember.   If  a  government  wishes  to   govern

effectively  with the support of the people,  then

that  is  a government whose every action must  be

judged as successful not only in one world, but in

four  worlds.  I hope that distributed  among  the

eight  Ministries  there will be enough  political

talent  to  keep  us  in touch with  all  possible

susceptibilities,  moods and tempers  of  all  the

worlds  that  we have to face in our multi-racial,

multi-lingual and multi-cultural society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all I

welcome the Prime Minister's statement that  these

Personal  Secretaries  (Political)  will  have  no

direct access to the permanent Civil Service. I am

much  obliged  to  him for making  that  statement

quite  categorically  without any  qualifications.

The  statement, as I understand it,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, means this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



That  in so far as the Civil Service is concerned,

the  Political Secretaries will not interfere, and

that any interference with the civil servants will

be   from   the  Minister  through  his  Permanent

Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it will be a sad day for Singapore

if   the  Political  Secretaries  take  over   the

departments rather than the Permanent Secretaries,

who  are  directly  responsible  to  the  Minister

himself.  One must always keep in mind that  these

are political appointments and, as such, they must

inevitably be given to persons who are high in the

esteem  of  the  Party in power and  who  possibly

helped  to put that Party in power. That  is  what

strikes   me   as  being  dangerous  about   these

appointments, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sympathise with the Prime Minister and the

difficulties  of his Government in a  multi-racial

society. I appreciate his statement that what  may

seem right to the English-speaking groups may  not

seem so right to the Chinese-speaking groups,  and

so  with the Tamil-speaking groups and the  Malay-speaking groups. Perhaps if the former Government,

as  he  says, Sir, were as alive to it as his  own

Government is, they might not have been where they

are today. There may be something in that too, Mr

Speaker,  Sir. But, the point of the statement  of

the  Prime  Minister is this. His proud  boast  to

this  House and to everyone outside is this.  That

his  Party is deeply rooted in the masses  of  the

people,    his    Ministers,   his   Parliamentary

Secretaries, his Assemblymen, they are all deeply,

inevitably and inextricably rooted in the  masses.

If  that  proud  boast is true, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

what  is the point in all these appointments? Each

Minister,  as  I  understand  it,  has   his   own

Parliamentary  Secretary. May I  congratulate  the

Prime  Minister on the way in which  he  has  made

these  appointments  of  Parliamentary  Secretary?

Where he has an English-educated Minister, he  has

very  thoughtfully  put a Parliamentary  Secretary

whose education is derived not through English.  A

very  sensible and, if I may be permitted  to  say

so, a very good idea. He has therefore distributed

throughout his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



Ministries  persons  who  deeply  understand   the

English-speaking   groups,  the   Chinese-speaking

groups, the Indian-speaking groups and the  Malay-speaking  groups.  Now, if he has  among  his  own

Ministers  and  his Parliamentary Secretaries,  16

persons   to   understand  the  four   trends   in

Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I again  ask  the

Prime  Minister what is the necessity  for  making

these  political  appointments, unless  it  is  to

distribute largesse to people who have put him  in

power?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are

nowhere near the American spoils system yet, but I

would suggest to the Member that if it is largesse

that  we  wish to distribute, there are much  more

convenient   and   less   conspicuous   ways    of

distributing it among the victors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to him that when we say

our  Party-we are, basically, modest men by nature

and we do not say each individual is rooted in the

masses-we  mean that collectively as a  Party,  we

are  rooted in every section, every sector,  every

stream of opinion and thought of this society. All

the appointments are, of course, appointments made

from those who are very close to the Party. I have

not  the  slightest compunction in  persisting  in

saying that my Party is rooted in the people. Each

and  everyone  of the political secretaries,  when

they are appointed and those who have already been

appointed, is rooted in the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should we have more talent at our disposal?

Why  not? We have got the talent and we intend  to

use  it. If the Member for Farrer Park and his old

colleagues  who  have  now  disappeared  from  the

political  scene,  had won  in  the  1955  general

elections  (I  heard a great deal of  their  plans

when  they were planning to get into office  then)

they  would have had nothing else other than  they

themselves. They have no talent and no  background

to fall back on. We have a broad stratum of skill,

ability and talent and we intend to utilise it  to

the best of our ability and the maximum benefit of

the people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no doubt the Prime

Minister  is interested in the people of Singapore

just  as I am and just as every decent citizen  in

Singapore must be, but what the Opposition is  not

satisfied with is this. These appointments are not

primarily  made for the benefit of the  people  of

Singapore  but  for the benefit  of  the  People's

Action  Party, so that during these five years,  a

line  of propaganda will be let out on the  people

of  Singapore which will enable the Party to  come

back at the end of five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hooray!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If that equates to the interest of the

people  of Singapore, certainly the Prime Minister

is  right,  but  there are quite a few  people  in

Singapore who say that it does not equate  in  the

way  that the Prime Minister would like to  equate

it to. Therefore, if the main underlying motive in

these  appointments is to bring  the  P.A.P. back

into  power  at  the next elections,  why  do  the

P.A.P. not  pay for them themselves? Nobody  will

then  question these back-room boys  working  hard

for  the P.A.P. Nobody is saying that they  should

not have these persons appointed at the behest  of

the  P.A.P. But what is being queried here  today,

Mr Speaker, Sir, is this. These posts have to  be

paid for out of public funds and public funds  are

not yet P.A.P. funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the point raised by the Minister for

Culture,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is that by a dexterous

change  of  name, the P.A.P. Government  seeks  to

make a rose into something else. He said that  the

first  post  is not Personal Secretary (Political)

but  Publicity Liaison Officer (Political).  As  I

understood it from the Prime Minister, the purpose

of  these  appointments was to keep the Government

in touch with the people. This does not seem to be

very  different  from  Publicity  Liaison  Officer

(Political).  It seems to mean the same  thing  to

me.  I  do  not know how the Minister for  Culture

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



to   draw   a   distinction  between   these   two

appointments.  The  post  of  Personal   Secretary

(Political) is exactly the same as the post which,

in his Ministry, is going to carry $1,400 a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that the Minister for Culture

impliedly made is that one post is to contact  the

Chinese  masses and the other post is  to  contact

the  Malay-speaking  group.  I  hope  I  have  not

misunderstood  him but that was the  impression  I

got  when he was speaking. If it is publicity  and

putting over the policy of the Government  to  the

people  of Singapore that is the vital purpose  of

this  appointment, probably the  other  Ministries

also  need  two Personal Secretaries  (Political):

one to get at the Chinese masses and the other  to

get at the Malay-speaking group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still feel, Mr Speaker, Sir, that these

appointments are not for the benefit of the people

of  Singapore  but  are largely intended  for  the

benefit of the Party in power.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, may I just make

this  observation?  It is the  business  of  every

government  to see that it governs in such  a  way

that  it  is returned to power at the end  of  its

mandate,  and  the fact is that there  is  nothing

improper in this purpose. It is the whole business

of  a  government to govern in such a way that  at

the  end  of  its term of office, the people  say,

"Yes,  we  shall have more of it. We  entrust  our

fate  to you for another term of office." And  the

fact  that  our  Personal Secretaries  (Political)

are,  I  hope, going to assist this Government  in

achieving  that aim does not disqualify them  from

being  paid  openly  out  of  the  funds  of   the

Government,   because  they  are   assisting   the

Government, not the Party.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Member  for  Farrer  Park drew  attention  to  the

anomaly  existing  between the salaries  of  three

Personal  Secretaries and that of  the  fourth,  I

thought that he was in the running for appointment

as the Secretary to any possible trade union or as

a  Personal  Secretary (Political)  should  it  be

formed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



But  I  am afraid that the Member for Farrer  Park

has brought into consideration different standards

of  judgment  in  assessing  the  value  of  these

appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Mr Speaker, that in 1955 when

the  first  election under the Rendel Constitution

took  place  there  was  a  Party  contesting  the

election  and it was called the Progressive  Party

of  which  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  was   a

distinguished member. Now, this Progressive Party,

which  has transformed itself into different names

and under different guises, found it necessary  to

acquire experts to give them political advice  and

they  duly  appointed  an English  woman  who  was

formerly  a  member of the Liberal  Party  or  the

Conservative Party - I forgot which.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Liberal-National.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The result was that the

Progressive Party came a hideous cropper and, true

to form, changed its name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when we consider this whole problem of why our standards are more exacting than the

standards to which the Member for Farrer Park  has

been  accustomed, I can assure you  that  a  great

deal  of  what he has said on the subject  is  not

only  irrelevant  but,  if  listened  to  by   any

government in this country, would lead it  rapidly

to its ruin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after listening

to  the  Member for Farrer Park, I  think  that  I

should   let   loose   our  Personal   Secretaries

(Political) on him, because I am quite  sure  that

after half an hour he will understand why we  need

Personal Secretaries (Political) to help us in our

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also claimed that my Ministry has merely

changed  the  name of one Personal Secretary  into

Publicity Liaison Secretary (Political)  in  order

to  make  the  whole  thing  smell  a  little  bit

sweeter.  In  view  of  the  fact  that  the   new

designation involved four words, I will expect the

Member  for  Farrer Park to be a bit more  scared.

Because  Publicity  Liaison Secretary  (Political)

takes four words



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



and  the original Personal Secretary are only  two

words,  he  is  a  bit  more suspicious  and  sees

sinister meaning behind each of the words.  But  I

think  I  have  explained quite clearly  that  the

Publicity   Liaison   Secretary   (Political)   is

involved  in certain technical functions connected

with   publicity,  that  is,  radio,  information,

posters, films, and so on. At the same time, it is

essential that whatever information is put over at

any  one  time  should  be properly  co-ordinated,

unlike the previous Government which used to speak

with different voices. We are interested in seeing

that  at  least we speak with one voice  and  that

whatever  we  put  over is properly  co-ordinated,

instead  of  one  section of  the  publicity  unit

conflicting with another section of our  publicity

unit. Sir, it is a skilled technical function,  to

be   able   to   co-ordinate  radio,  information,

posters, films, and so on, and that is why one  of

the  Secretaries  is  called a  Publicity  Liaison

Secretary (Political). The job is more responsible

and  the  officer  therefore  is  entitled  to   a

slightly   higher  remuneration  than  the   other

Secretary  whose  functions  do  not  involve  any

technical  tasks connected with the  co-ordination

of publicity services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I would lice to assure the

Minister  for  Culture that I now  understand  why

this  gentleman with more technical qualifications

and  holding  a  more complicated  designation  is

drawing  $300 more a month than the other  officer

who is just a trained man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the statement of the Minister for Finance,

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  he  has   entirely

supported my point, if I may say so with  respect,

when  he said that when the Progressive Party made

an   appointment,  that  was  paid  out   of   the

Progressive  Party  funds, not out  of  Government

funds.  That is what I am suggesting the  Minister

for  Finance  should do: pay for it out  of  party

funds and not out of Government funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 7 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (36) of subhead 1

therein.



<br><br>Mr Chairman, Sir, this concerns the Information Officer for Singapore in the United Kingdom. Recently there appeared a report in the Press to the effect that this Information Officer had been recalled from the United Kingdom. In view of that, Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



some explanation as to why it is  necessary  that

this vote should be provided for in the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b>

Mr Chairman, Sir, the answer is quite simple. When you recall an officer from a certain post, or if you are to transfer him from one post to another, you do not delete that post purely for that reason. There may be occasions in the future where a more suitable person may appear and be appointed to that post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, do I understand that the vote is kept alive with a view to a future appointment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am satisfied and may I have the amendment withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 7 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 14 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, this concerns the sum of $12,000 provided for in the Estimates for Language Training Facilities for Assemblymen. It has been kept a very quiet, and deep secret. Although I am an Assemblyman, I know nothing about it. Perhaps the Minister might like to explain what I am supposed to do, and for what.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There is no enigma about

this. It  means  what  it says - Language  Training

Facilities for Assemblymen. All of us  know  that

there are  four languages used in this  Assembly,

and that nobody in this Assembly speaks all  four

languages. It  has,  therefore,  been  considered

proper that  facilities should  be  provided  for

every Assemblyman,  if he so  desires,  to  equip

himself with knowledge, to read, write and  speak

any one of the four languages in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained just now the difficulties of

presenting Government  policies  and  Government

programmes to   a  multi-racial,   multi-lingual

society. Apart  from  the hope  to  overcome  the

difficulties by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



building up a composite leadership which contains

all the  skills and all the talents from each  of

the different educational worlds,  there  is  the

other hope that every one of the Members will  try

to straddle  more  than one world.  Some  of  the

Members on the Government side of the  House  who

have been  co-opted  into  the  various   Select

Committees are unable to follow the proceedings as

expeditiously as they otherwise  would,  if  they

understood a  certain amount of English,  and  if

they were  able to read a certain amount  of  the

Minutes without having to get it  translated  for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time I suggest that perhaps Members

on the  Opposition side will  join  some  of  the

Members on the Government side, who are  English-speaking, in  trying  to  master  the   national

language. On  the Government side, Sir,  we  hope

that before three years you will be able to  join

us in a debate in the Malay language. And if  the

Members from the S.P.A. - these three who obviously

do not seem to be in need of any moral rearmament,

appearing to be sufficiently sturdy to  withstand

the misfortunes   that   have   befallen   their

colleagues - could make the  effort,  perhaps  even

they might  survive, as the appendix survives  in

the human being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules and regulations are being framed. The only

reason why  the Member for Farrer  Park  has  not

heard about them is because of the difficulty  of

trying to  formulate rules. I have the rules  and

regulations for the civil service  to  use  as  a

model. To make sure that the facilities are  being

properly used and not wasted - e.g. when the teacher

comes he  finds the pupils absent, and the  State

loses funds - there will be periodic tests  to  see

that progress is being made. In the  examinations

next year, I even hope to follow the civil service

procedure and give a bonus where a bonus  is  due.

The difficulty is to find a uniform  examination,

because the standards of the 51 Members  of  this

Assembly vary. One never knows whether it is  fair

to ask an aging, balding man to do as much work as

a vigorous,   young,   stalwart-looking   trade

unionist. But I assure Members on the  Opposition

side that this is intended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



for the  benefit  of  the  people  of  Singapore,

because if  they have leaders who understand  not

just one sector but two or three, or may be  even

four sectors of the population, then so much  the

better for the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One slight correction. There are 52

Members in the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg your pardon,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I hope that the 52nd Member will also take advantage of this facility that I am asking for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the changes in our

this  Bill  is  one  of  a series  of  legislative

measures setting out in detail and simplifying the

procedure to be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the present Bill is to provide by

law  for  the  authorisation and  control  of  all

capital   expenditure  under  one   process,   the

approval of a Development Budget by estimates laid

before the Assembly of expenditure to be paid  out

of  a  Development Fund. The Bill is a simple one,

paragraph 1 of the Schedule, it says, in the third

line,  "replacement  of other capital  assets  (including vehicles, vessels, aircraft)" etc.  I  was

always  under  the impression, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

that  replacement of vehicles and things like that

would  be  provided for out of other funds  rather

than out of loan moneys, like a depreciation fund.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is true as a general

practice.  When  vehicles  and  other   types   of

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the

Criminal Procedure Code proposed by this Bill  may

conveniently be dealt with under four heads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this Bill seeks to increase the

jurisdiction  and powers of the Criminal  District

and Magistrate's Courts. It will enable a Criminal

District Court to deal with all offences which are

punishable  with a fine only or  with  a  term  of

imprisonment not exceeding seven years,  and  also

with  certain offences punishable with  a  heavier

Sentence  which are made punishable by a  Criminal

District Court in Schedule A to the Code, and also

power  is given to a Criminal District Court  with

the  consent  of  the  Public Prosecutor  and  the

accused  to  deal with all cases other than  those

punishable with death or imprisonment for life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of the Criminal District Court are

increased to enable it to impose imprisonment  not

exceeding  three  years, or a fine  not  exceeding

$5,000, or to pass a sentence of caning up  to  12

strokes,  and  to impose sentences  of  corrective

training  and preventive detention. In appropriate

cases,  as  when  an accused person  has  previous

convictions, the Criminal District Court may  pass

sentences of imprisonment up to seven years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the jurisdiction of

the  Magistrate's  Court  has  been  increased  to

enable  it  to  deal with all offences  which  are

punishable  with a fine only or  with  a  term  of

imprisonment  not  exceeding  three   years.   The

Magistrate's Court is also given power  to  impose

sentences of imprisonment not exceeding one  year,

a  fine not exceeding $2,000 and caning up to  six

strokes,  and  in appropriate cases,  as  when  an

accused  person has previous convictions,  it  can

award  the full punishment for an offence  triable

by it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions generally follow the provisions

of  the Federation Criminal Procedure Code and the

Courts  Ordinance relating to the  powers  of  the

Sessions Court and the Magistrate's Court.  It  is

further   considered,  Mr  Speaker,  that   these

provisions  will enable a large number  of  cases,

which  are at present tried in the High Court,  to

be tried in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



the  Criminal District Court, and they will result

not  only  in a saving of time of the High  Court,

but  also, by reason of the fact that it will  not

be  necessary  to hold preliminary  inquiries,  it

will   result  in  the  saving  of  time  of   the

Magistrate's Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to

make  admissible caution statements to the Police.

The Police in Singapore have complained for a long

time that the results of their work are restricted

by the provisions which forbid statements recorded

by  them,  even  if taken in compliance  with  the

Judges' Rules in England, which provide safeguards

against  statements extorted by force or  threats,

to be given in evidence in the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hongkong and Sarawak, the English practice in

this  respect  is  followed, and although  in  the

earlier stages the Police investigators there made

the  mistake of relying on obtaining a  confession

to  prove a case, the practice has, I am  glad  to

say,  since  worked very well. The  experience  in

Hongkong  has shown that Police investigators  can

learn, by training and experience, the proper  use

of the Judges' Rules, and that the possible abuses

of  the  admissibility  of caution  statements  in

evidence can be avoided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statements and confessions can be challenged

in  Court  on the ground that they were improperly

taken,  and  the Court can always  rule  out  such

evidence if the rules are not observed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

statements  made  to  police  officers   be   made

admissible  in Court subject to the safeguards  as

imposed  in England. The amendment to the Criminal

Procedure Code which will effect this is  set  out

in   clause   15  of  the  Bill.  A  consequential

amendment  will  also  have  to  be  made  in  the

Evidence Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England and Hongkong, there are no

restrictions  in  regard to  the  rank  of  police

officer to whom the statements are made, and  such

caution statements made to any police officer  are

admissible  in evidence. It is proposed,  however,

that, as a start in Singapore, only statements  to

police  officers not below the rank  of  Inspector

will be admissible in evidence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "Inspector" has been defined to include

a  cadet  inspector, but the effect will  be  that

statements  made to the ordinary police constables

or  corporals or sergeants will not be  admissible

in evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government realises that there is a risk in

the  admission of caution statements,  and  it  is

felt  that  it  would  be better  to  confine  the

admissibility of such statements to those made  to

police officers of and above the rank of Inspector

who  are,  on  the  whole,  better  educated  and,

therefore,   more   likely   to   understand   the

principles and application of the Judges' Rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto in Singapore where caution statements to

police  officers  have  been  made  admissible  in

evidence  as,  for example, under the Preservation

of   Public   Security   Ordinance,   1955,   only

statements  made to police officers of  and  above

the  rank of Inspector are made admissible. If and

when  it  appears  that the higher  ranks  of  the

Police  Force have learned the proper use  of  the

Judges'  Rules, and are able to direct  and  guide

the  lower ranks of the Police, consideration will

likewise then be given to removing the restriction

in  regard  to the rank of the police officers  to

whom the statements are made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is recognised that the

greatest  care  would have to be  taken  to  avoid

encouraging  an  attitude  of  mind  among  police

officers  which  tended to rely on confessions  to

the  detriment  of  other  available  evidence  in

support of the prosecution. Control or supervision

would  remain in the hands of senior officers  who

are  fully  aware that it would be detrimental  to

the Force and prosecutions in Court if confessions

were   sought   to  be  adduced  in  evidence   in

circumstances  where the voluntary nature  was  in

doubt.  It  is  appreciated  that  there  may   be

difficulties over language barriers; for instance,

if  the accused speaks only a Chinese dialect  and

the  constable who arrests him speaks only  Malay.

These difficulties are not likely to disappear for

many years and it will always be for the Court  to

decide   in   any  individual  case  whether   the

circumstances justify the evidence to be  admitted

or not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the third amendment proposed by

the  Bill relates to trial by jury. It is proposed

that  following the practice in the Federation  of

Malaya, trial by jury be normally only required in

cases  where the punishment authorised by  law  is

death.  In  all other cases of trial in  the  High

Court,  the  trial will be by a Judge alone.  This

will appear to be a fundamental change in the  law

and  Opposition  Members may shed tears  over  the

passing  of  the English institution of  trial  by

jury.  Even  in  England, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the

institution  of  trial  by jury  has  not  escaped

criticism  from  such  legal  authorities  as  Dr

Glanville  Williams. In the independent  State  of

the   Federation  of  Malaya,  a   committee   was

appointed   to  consider  the  matter   and   this

committee recommended the introduction of trial by

jury only in capital cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments will undoubtedly speed up

trials  in  the High Court. Although it  might  be

said  that the proposals imply a distrust  of  the

jury  system,  they  undoubtedly  show  that   the

Government has full confidence in the ability  and

competence  of  our  Judges  to  deal  with   such

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the provisions in the Federation,

power  is  given in the law to the Chief  Justice,

with  the approval of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,

to  order that the trial of all offences or of any

particular type of offences before the High  Court

shall  be  by jury. If it should therefore  appear

desirable in the future to extend trial by jury to

other  than  capital cases this can be done  after

consultation   between  the  Chief  Justice,   the

Cabinet  and the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. I  should

like,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in this  connection,  to

quote the following summary of the recommendations

of the Law Commission of India which was set up in

1955,  under  the  chairmanship of  the  Attorney-General of India. This is what the Commission  has

to say on the jury system in India:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The jury system is time consuming and expensive.

It  is difficult to find jurors of the right  type

and  such  jurors as are generally  available  are

easily  approachable and can  be  moved  by  extra

judicial consideration. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



system  which  has had a long trial in  India  has

been a failure and therefore should be abolished."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the committee stage of this

Bill, I propose to introduce the insertion of  two

new clauses in the Bill to provide that where,  in

a trial by jury of a person charged with a capital

offence, the jury returns a verdict of not  guilty

and  the  accused  is discharged,  the  Judge  may

convict  the  accused of a minor offence  or  some

other  offence if he is satisfied from  the  facts

that  the accused is guilty of such offence.  This

amendment  will have the effect of  confining  the

jury's  verdict  only to the  capital  charge  for

which the accused is tried.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill makes a

number  of minor amendments to improve the  system

of  criminal procedure. Provision is made for  the

service  of summonses to witnesses issued  in  the

Federation.  Power  is  given  to  the  Court,  in

sentencing  an accused person, to take account  of

outstanding  offences  against  him.   The   power

authorising    police    officers    to    conduct

investigations  is  extended  to  enable  suitable

officers even below the rank of corporal to be  so

empowered.  The  word "caning" is substituted  for

the  word  "whipping". The offence of cheating  is

made  a  seizable  offence, and  the  offences  of

causing  grievous hurt, voluntarily  causing  hurt

with  a  dangerous weapon, and voluntarily causing

grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon are made non-compoundable.  A  police  officer  conducting   an

investigation into a seizable case is empowered to

search the house of an arrested person, and  power

is  also  given to a police officer not below  the

rank  of  inspector to search  a  house  where  he

suspects the person is being confined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to

alter  a  number  of things which have  long  been

established  as part and parcel of our  system  of

criminal justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the first point mentioned by the Hon.

Minister  for Labour and Law, that the Bill  seeks

to give wider powers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



to the District Court and the Police Court, I have

nothing  to  say, except that where  the  District

Courts  and  the  Police Courts are  given  powers

which  are  now exercisable by the High Court,  it

follows  that the District Courts and  the  Police

Courts should be strengthened. There seems to be a

tendency  in  the District Courts  and  the  lower

courts for a weakening rather than a strengthening

of  these  Courts.  In  the  context  of  what  is

happening  in  the lower courts  at  South  Bridge

Road,  I  view  with  some  alarm  the  giving  of

extended and extensive powers to the lower courts.

However, Mr Speaker, Sir, everything being equal,

I  would myself say that taking away some  of  the

exclusive  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  and

passing it over to the lower courts (that is,  the

District  Court and Police Court) is a good  thing

in itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important point which the Bill deals

with  is  trial by jury. The Minister for Law  has

cited  Mr  Glanville Williams  as  a  person  who

disagrees with the jury system. He is no doubt  an

eminent  lecturer  and,  like  all  lecturers  and

theorists, he has his ideas and views of what  the

criminal  law should be and how it should develop.

But,  if  I  may  say  so, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

consensus  of opinion among practising  barristers

in  the United Kingdom is that trial by jury is  a

system which should not be scoffed at and disposed

of  lightly,  as it is intended to  do  here  this

afternoon. The system of trial by jury has been in

force in Singapore since criminal law was enforced

under the Criminal Procedure Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our code, Mr Speaker, is derived from the Indian

Code  and, although the Indian Code did not permit

a  number  of  things which we have  followed,  it

instituted the system of trial by jury in the High

Court.  The  quotation by the  Hon.  Minister  for

Labour  and Law of a statement by the chairman  of

the  1955  Commission, or Committee, investigating

the  criminal law in India may perhaps be true  in

the  light  of  events that have  taken  place  in

India. It could well be that the jurors are easily

accessible  there and possibly it is a  matter  of

public knowledge that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



jurors  are easily accessible. Possibly in  India,

the  system  of  trial by jury is held  in  public

contempt.  And  when a system of criminal  law  is

held  in public contempt then, of course, it  must

be changed because, in order to uphold the rule of

law,  it  is vital that the processes whereby  the

rule  of law is upheld should be held high in  the

esteem  of  the public. It could well be  that  in

India  trial  by  jury  is  discredited.  But  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, with respect, I have not  heard  it

said in Singapore that the system of trial by jury

is  disadvantageous to the public. There has  been

no  suggestion  that  our  jurors  here  could  be

tampered with or could be reached. Sometimes it is

said that the jury has brought in a wrong verdict.

But  that,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  a  matter  of

opinion. Whether they, the jury, have brought in a

wrong verdict or not is a matter of opinion. Crown

counsel  invariably thinks that the wrong  verdict

has  been brought in when an acquittal is  awarded

by  the  jury.  And, similarly,  counsel  for  the

accused  usually thinks that a wrong  verdict  has

been  brought  in when his client has  been  found

guilty. But those are matters of opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trial by jury, Mr Speaker, Sir, has this

advantage,  that it distributes the responsibility

for   conviction  on  a  number  of  persons.  The

prosecutor  presents  his  case  as  best  he  can

objectively.  The  defence  counsel  defends   his

client  as permitted to him by the ethics  of  his

profession and according to law. The judge  merely

sums up the facts as have been adduced before him.

The  jury  takes the responsibility for convicting

on    the   facts   placed   before   them.    The

responsibility   for   conviction    is    equally

distributed between three or four separate  groups

of  persons.  It has been a system which  has  not

been found lacking. As far as I know, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  there has been no complaint that the  system

of  criminal  law in Singapore is  failing  merely

because  trial by jury is being employed. Where  a

system  has been found to be effective and working

within  reason,  then one should not  change  that

system for the sake of merely changing it. One



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



must  have adequate reasons for changing it either

in the light of developments or of conditions that

exist in Singapore itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr Speaker, Sir, the last point on which I

wish to touch is this complete departure from  our

conception  of  the admission of evidence  in  our

Courts.  It is not without reason that the  Indian

Criminal  Procedure Code says that  any  statement

made  by  any person who subsequently  becomes  an

accused person, particularly if that statement  is

made  to a police officer, should be inadmissible.

Now  the Indian Criminal Procedure Code was  drawn

up  by  eminent  jurists  from  England  and  they

devised a system of law which was suitable to  the

needs  of the country having regard to the ability

of  that country to work that particular system of

law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in a multi-racial society such as we have in

Singapore,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I think  it  is  an

unwise  step to change the existing provisions  of

the  Criminal Procedure Code which disentitle  the

police  to allow statements of accused persons  to

be put in evidence against the accused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore, police

investigations do not solve all crimes brought  to

the notice of the police. The majority of cases in

Singapore are solved through information given  to

the  police  by  outsiders  whose  names  are  not

revealed or brought out in court, or through  work

done  by  detectives at the lower  levels.  It  is

public  knowledge, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that  these

detectives are recruited on the basis  of  `Set  a

thief to catch a thief.' That is public knowledge.

They  do  not  exactly come from  the  law-abiding

classes.   Most  of  the  detectives   have   been

recruited  from  groups of persons who  themselves

have  once indulged in criminal activities or have

been  in  very close contact with those  who  have

indulged  or are indulging in such activities.  It

is through these two means that crime in Singapore

is  mostly  solved.  I  venture  to  suggest,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that in the circumstances  here  it

would be highly unwise to bring in an amendment of

this nature.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section as drafted is very wide and gives

powers  to  the  police to bring in any  statement

brought  to  the  knowledge of a  police  officer,

whether that statement has been interpreted to him

by  any police officer or any person concerned  or

not  in  the  arrest.  Now  it  is  a  fundamental

principle  of  the  law as we  now  know  it,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that in any translation which  seeks

to  lay  the  blame on the accused, the translator

should not be a person who should be interested in

the  arrest  or  in the furnishing of  information

which   brings  about  the  arrest.  That   is   a

fundamental principle of the law recognised by the

courts  of  law  here. Now, that is  sound  common

sense,  Mr Speaker, Sir, because where everything

depends  upon the interpretation then if a  person

is interested in the arrest of a culprit it is not

improbable  that  the  interpretation   might   be

slightly  tinged  in favour of  bringing  about  a

conviction against the accused person.  I  do  not

say that it will happen in all cases but the risk,

Mr  Speaker, is so great that it would be  highly

unwise - nay,   dangerous - to   bring   about    this

amendment  at  the present stage. I  dare  say  in

Hongkong   it  is  possible  because  in  Hongkong

everybody  speaks Cantonese. The population  speak

Cantonese,  the  police speak Cantonese  from  the

lowest  to  the  top  whereas  in  Singapore   the

composition  of the population is such  that  some

speak  Cantonese,  others  speak  Hokkien,  others

speak   Teochew,  some  speak  Tamil,  some  speak

Malayalam, some speak Mandarin, some speak  Malay,

and  so on. And it would be highly dangerous in  a

society which uses several languages to let in  as

evidence this statement where the police inspector

himself  would  not be the person  who  hears  the

statement  direct and comprehends it  direct  from

the  person  making the statement; but the  police

inspector  would have to comprehend it through  an

interpreter  who,  the section says,  could  be  a

person interested in the arrest of that person.  A

very dangerous situation indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

police have for a number of years - this is not  the

first    time   that   the   police   have    made

representations;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



they have made representations for the last 20  to

30  years - to bring about such an amendment because

if  this  amendment is brought about  it  will  be

easier for them to secure convictions. It is  well

known,  Mr  Speaker,  that when  the  prosecution

presents a case in the court and when a confession

is  sought to be put in evidence, in 99 cases  out

of  100, you will find that the confession is  the

only  evidence that links the accused to the crime

with  which  he  is charged. It  could  not  be  a

coincidence that in 99 cases out of 100, in  cases

where  confessions are produced, there is no other

link  of  evidence connecting the accused  to  the

crime. This amendment, Mr Speaker, will make  the

position  even worse than what it  now  is.  In  a

confession the person confessing has to  be  taken

before  a  magistrate who, after certain questions

put to the accused and satisfying himself that the

statement  is  not only voluntary but volunteered,

then  records  a statement from the  accused.  But

here  the  statement would be made by  an  accused

person to an inspector, either to him directly  or

in  his hearing. It takes it even further. It need

not  be  made to the inspector. All that  need  be

done  is  that  it should be made in his  hearing;

then  a  person  interested in  the  arrest  could

translate   it   to   the  inspector.   In   these

circumstances, it would appear that the  statement

would  be  admissible in evidence.  Members  might

say,  "If  he is guilty, why should his  statement

not  be  put  in?" Certainly, if he is guilty,  he

should  be  convicted.  But the  great  difficulty

about  these matters, Mr Speaker, Sir, as we  all

know,  is to sift the truth from the untruth,  and

in  a  system of criminal justice, not  only  must

justice  be done but it must be seen to  be  done.

Mr Speaker, Sir, if this Bill is carried through,

the  inference might well be that justice  is  not

seemingly being done.



<br><br>4.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not

here  early enough to know whether the Member  for

Farrer Park prefaced his remarks by saying that he

had the concurrence of the majority of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



the  Bar  in expressing the views that he  did.  I

learned from the Minister for Labour and Law  that

the  Bar  Committee have been consulted  and  they

have  not expressed any views on the matter up  to

date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of the administration of justice is

to   do   justice  according  to  the  law.  Where

according to the law justice is being flouted  and

not  being  done, then it is the business  of  the

legislature to see that the law is changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was early enough to listen to the objections of

the hon. Member to two different points. He is  in

favour  of retaining jury trials for all  criminal

matters. But he is against the change in admitting

evidence  made by an accused person  to  a  police

officer after arrest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first case, he asked, "Why change a system

which  nobody has found anything wrong with?"  Let

me  state quite simply that it is common knowledge

at  the  Bar  that  the  law  as  it  is - not  only

unfortunately in jury cases but also in other than

jury  cases - becomes a game at which the skill  and

the  agility of the lawyer, plus the obstacles put

by  the legislature on the prosecution, should, if

the lawyer is sufficiently skilful, and his client

is  sufficiently intelligent, enable the lawyer to

get  his  client off. That is not the business  of

the administration of law. It is to do justice and

to see that right is upheld and wrong is punished.

Let  me  tell  the hon. Member that there  is  one

basic  defect in jury trials in Malaya which makes

it  fundamentally quite different from  what  jury

trials  are supposed to be. In England from whence

this  concept first arose, the theory is  that  if

you  are  accused by the State of having committed

an act which entitles the State to punish you, you

should be found guilty by your peers. If you are a

noble lord, then your peers are the members of the

House  of  Lords. If you are an ordinary commoner,

then  you  will have 12 common jurymen sitting  to

hear the evidence and decide for or against your



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



innocence.   Now,  unless  we  are  to   introduce

multilingualism  on  a quite unprecedented  scale,

nobody is ever tried by his peers in this country.

He is tried by the English-educated if you have  a

jury  trial.  If you are tried by a special  jury,

you   are  tried  by  an  English-educated  elite.

And - the Member for Farrer Park knows this as  well

as  I do - every time the box containing the list of

jurors  is taken out, the first question  you  ask

the  Registrar is, "Is this a special  jury  or  a

common  jury?" Everybody knows that if you  get  a

special  jury, the chances of getting a conviction

increases. Let us be reasonably honest  about  all

this. A jury trial is a foreign implantation which

works reasonably well, but it requires a very high

degree  of skill both from the Bar and the  Bench.

It requires also a state of affairs which can only

exist  in an ordered and settled state of  society

where everybody is prepared to come up and say, "I

saw A stab B," and he feels that it is his duty to

tell the world that he witnessed the scene.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is justice being thwarted? I say `Yes', on pure

technicalities. Every member of the Bar knew  that

a  certain  person in the famous Green Bus  murder

case  took a tin of petrol, threw it into an  air-conditioned room, lit it, the whole room  went  on

fire  and  five  persons died. The  case  went  on

trial. The jury had not the slightest doubt as  to

the  guilt of the accused and, they convicted  him

unanimously. Unfortunately, in the course  of  his

summing - up    to    the   jury - these    are    all

technicalities of the law - the Judge did not put to

the jury the possibility that there was the chance

that the accused person might have done it in self-defence. Therefore, there was an acquittal and the

Government ordered a new trial on other charges - as

there  were  five  murders, therefore  four  other

murders  had  still to be tried. When the  accused

went before a second Judge, the Judge said, "Is it

not  a  pity that a man should be persecuted twice

in   this  way?"  And  the  Attorney-General,  for

reasons  which must have weighed very  heavily  on

his  mind,  but  which I am unable  to  see  could

possibly have existed, withdrew



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



the   prosecution,  and  a  man  who  undoubtedly,

according  to seven jurymen, committed murder  was

let  off  free. I say that if we continue  to  pay

attention  and  respect to forms and  not  to  the

substance  of  the  rule of  law,  then  we  shall

collapse,  because the law will be held  in  utter

contempt.  A  law  that is unable  to  punish  the

guilty, because it has got itself involved in  the

intricacies  which  our  experts  have   not   yet

mastered,  is  a law which is unsuitable.  Nobody,

certainly  not the two practising Members  on  the

other  side of this House, would suggest that  our

Judges cannot make up their minds on facts as well

as  the jurymen can. I do not think they will make

that  allegation. If they are wise, I do not think

they will even mention it. I suggest let us get on

with the business of seeing that justice is done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have to defend the preservation of jury

trials for murder - we are not dispensing with it in

the  case  of murder. It is because the Federation

had  decided  to move in that direction  and  have

jury  trials  for  murder. This is  one  of  those

things  that  have  happened.  We  have  to   move

closer - so we line up with their law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having elected to defend this, an English

importation - the  Member  says,  "Keep  it,  it  is

good."  He then says, "Let us not have an  English

practice,"  namely, a policeman  giving  evidence.

According  to  the  practice  in  England,   every

policeman  can give evidence on what  the  accused

person  has  said. But the Member for Farrer  Park

does  not  want  that, because that  will  help  a

conviction.  So  he is not interested  in  English

practice;   he   assiduously  avoids   the   whole

argument. He talked about Indian practice, and how

wise   the   Indians  were  in  preventing   their

policemen  from  giving evidence, but  how  unwise

they were in getting rid of the juries. Let us not

have  it  both  ways. Every person knows  when  an

accused person's defences are down and that is  at

the  time when he is caught in the act. Before  he

has  had  time  to think out a clever defence - that

his grandmother was ill on the blank day of blank,

but the policeman thought he saw him there, and he

produced the grandmother,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



grand-uncle, and two great grandchildren who  said

that  he was at such and such an unnumbered  attap

hut  in an unknown village. We could have gone the

whole  hog  and said, "Let us accept the  practice

for the whole of the police force." But because we

appreciate  the  difficulties in  a  multi-lingual

society and the fact that, in some cases,  as  the

Member  for Farrer Park has alleged, in  the  past

there  was this practice of employing a  thief  to

catch  a  thief, we have therefore restricted  the

scope  of  the new provisions to police inspectors

and  above.  Nobody, let alone the two  honourable

and  learned Members of the Bar on the other side,

would  suggest that the English-educated, who  are

good  enough to be inspectors, would go into Court

and   perjure.  This  is  a  step  in  the   right

direction.  If  we  are able quickly  to  set  the

police  force  right and get out the  thieves  who

were  employed to catch the thieves, we  shall  be

happy to come back to this House, after these  new

provisions   have  been  successfully   put   into

operation, to report that we have a better  police

force, that no more thieves are employed to  catch

thieves,  and  we  will ask for the  extension  of

these provisions to the whole of the police force.



<br><br>4.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after listening to

the forensic ability displayed by my colleague and

leader  here, I think there is very little for  me

to  say  in reply. I would, however, like to  make

this  point: that the Member for Farrer Park seems

to  be  confused as to what this Bill really  sets

out  to  do. He has accepted the position that  it

would be reasonable and necessary to increase  the

jurisdiction of the Lower Courts. That  being  so,

Mr  Speaker,  I  suggest that less  and  less  of

criminal cases, other than capital cases, will  be

finding their way into the High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think that the

Government  as  such  has  expressed  any  adverse

dislike  of the jury system as is practised  here.

It  is  not the intention that the jury system  be

abolished in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



this  territory. The Government is  proceeding  to

follow,  not  what is the practice in India  where

there  has  been a recommendation  that  the  jury

system  be  abolished, but rather the practice  in

the Federation of Malaya where the jury system  is

retained for capital cases only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have written into this law certain safeguards.

If  it is found desirable to extend trial by  jury

to other than capital cases, there is provision in

our law for this to be done. On the recommendation

of  the Chief Justice, and with the consent of the

Government,  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  can  so

agree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of caution statements, I must

say,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that this Government  also

has  been  able to resist pressure from the  local

police   who  have  sought  to  make  all  caution

statements   made  to  police   officers   to   be

admissible in evidence. However, we are trying  to

give  the  new  system a fair trial.  We  are  not

proposing  that  caution statements  made  to  all

police  officers  should  be  admissible.  We  are

restricting  these  caution  statements  only   to

officers   of  and  above  the  rank   of   police

inspector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will see how the new system works. If it

works  well, I have no doubt that it will be  able

to  develop,  as do other systems.  If  precedents

elsewhere  are a good guide, I have no doubt  that

the  police  here will be able to discharge  their

duties  in as satisfactory a manner as the  police

in   England,  Hongkong,  and  Sarawak.  So,   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I do not think that there is  cause

for   us   to  be  in  any  way  alarmed  at   the

improvements  that the Government  is  seeking  to

introduce  into  our system of  administering  the

criminal law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>REGISTRATION OF CRIMINALS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this Bill is partly due to the

attainment  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya  to  a

sovereign independent status. The Registration  of

Criminals  Ordinance  requires  the  Registrar  of

Criminals  to maintain a register of, inter  alia,

persons convicted of any offences committed within

any scheduled territory and persons ordered to  be

banished,  expelled or deported from Singapore  or

from  any Colony, protectorate or protected  state

for  the time being included in the Third Schedule

of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two places at present included in the Third

Schedule  of  the Ordinance are the Federation  of

Malaya  and  the  State of Brunei. Singapore,  the

Federation  of  Malaya and  the  State  of  Brunei

together  form  the  principal  registration  area

under this Ordinance. Both this Government and the

Government of the Federation of Malaya have agreed

that  Singapore and the Federation of Malaya  only

will  form  the principal registration area  under

the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is thought desirable to

remove Brunei from the principal registration area

and  to  treat that territory in the same  way  as

North Borneo and Sarawak, that is, as part of  the

British  possessions, protectorates and  protected

states outside the principal registration area, in

respect  of which the same registrable particulars

of  criminals may be recorded with the approval of

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara under section 5 of the

Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill gives effect to these

intentions   by   deleting   the   definition   of

"scheduled   territories",   and   amending    the

definition  of  "principal registration  area"  to

include  only  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken in clause 2

to   make   a  consequential  amendment   to   the

definition  of "registrable particulars",  due  to

the  inclusion  in  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code

(Amendment)  Bill, which was before  the  Assembly

today,   of  a  provision  to  take  into  account

outstanding  offences  in  sentencing  an  accused

person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of the Federation of Malaya has

also agreed to the continuation of the system of a

single  Criminal Records Office located  in  Kuala

Lumpur. As the Registrar of Criminals would almost

certainly,  under the present arrangements,  be  a

Federation officer, it is therefore necessary that

this Government's statutory powers under section 3

of  the  Registration  of Criminals  Ordinance  to

appoint a Registrar of Criminals should be amended

to  provide  for the appointment of  a  Federation

officer to be the Registrar of Criminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill, therefore, enables the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara,  with the concurrence  of  the

Government of the Federation of Malaya, to appoint

a   Federation  officer  to  be  a  Registrar   of

Criminals  or  an  Assistant  Registrar  for   the

purposes of this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 9 of the

Registration of Criminals Ordinance to empower the

Police   to  take,  in  addition  to  finger-print

impressions, the photograph of a convicted  person

where such a photograph has not already been taken

under the provisions of that Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 6 introduce amendments which are

merely  consequential to the amendments introduced

in clause 2 of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, this Bill is rendered

necessary  in  view of clause 15 of  the  Criminal

caution  statements by accused persons  to  police

officers admissible in evidence. If that clause is

enacted as law, Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, it will

be  necessary  for  sections  25  and  26  of  the

<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT NO.2) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr (Deputy) Speaker, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill which seeks to amend the Criminal Law

(Temporary  Provisions)  Ordinance,  1955,  is   a

further manifestation of the determination of  the

present   Government  in  taking  strong  positive

action  for the good and well-being of the  people

as  a  whole  to  fight gangsterism  and  thuggery

relentlessly  and vigorously, and  to  adopt  more

drastic measures if necessary to break the back of

the  secret society menace which has plagued  this

land of ours for some time now and terrorised  the

law-abiding people in this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the Bill, drastic as it may

be  but drastic only against evil-doers who  flout

the rule of law and order and seek to continue the

present  state of lawlessness, will meet with  the

wholehearted support of all law-abiding members of

the  community.  In  fact, I believe  that  public

opinion  demands  that more  drastic  measures  be

taken  by  the  Government to maintain  peace  and

order  in the face of the prevalent abnormal crime

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the new Government came into power, we have

taken several measures against gangster haunts and

their sources of income. We have closed down  pin-tables and juke-box premises which were the haunts

of   gangsters   and  thugs.  We  have   dissolved

societies which are purely gambling dens under the

protection of secret society members. We have  not

hesitated to go for the really big shots as recent

events have shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special police squads have struck fear into

the  hearts of these gangsters, a number  of  whom

had  met  with  death. We will  go  on  waging  an

unrelenting  campaign against them.  There  is  no

place for relaxation of efforts and vigilance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional powers asked for in this Bill are

part  of this campaign. Sir, before I come to  the

details of this Bill, I would like to stress  that

it  is  because  of  the  present  state  of  gang

lawlessness  that the Government is seeking  these

additional and exceptional powers contained in the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government, like any democratic Government,

does not wish to lightly deprive the individual of

his liberty by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



executive action, nor for that matter for a longer

time than is absolutely necessary. But when we are

dealing  with  unruly and unprincipled  thugs  and

gangsters  and because of the terrorism they  have

spread,  the ordinary process of law is inadequate

to  deal with the crimes and misdeeds committed by

them.  Special powers such as those  contained  in

this Bill are therefore necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In adopting these measures the Government is

conscious that they provide but temporary remedies

and  that  in dealing with these secret societies,

account has to be taken of the social and economic

causes  which  have contributed to the  growth  of

gangsterism     and     lawlessness.     Increased

unemployment,    slum    conditions,    lack    of

purposefulness  in directing the energies  of  the

young,  lack of recreational facilities,  constant

exposure to yellow culture, undesirable literature

and - films  all these have caused secret societies

to flourish and have lured youth to their ranks by

the glitter of sensationalism and easy money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is aware, the Government has

taken  a strong line in the banning of undesirable

publications  and in tightening the censorship  of

films.  Some of the causes can only be tackled  by

long-term  measures and their solution  cannot  be

achieved  quickly. But the Government has  already

taken  action  on  these permanent  remedies.  For

example,  the  provision of better  housing,  more

open   spaces,   more   recreational   facilities,

community   centres,   schools,   etc, and   the

encouragement  of industries, the full  impact  of

which can only be felt in the years to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the details of the Bill, the main

provisions  are  (1) to extend  the  life  of  the

Criminal   Law  (Temporary  Provisions)  Ordinance

which  expires  in October this year  for  another

five  years;  (2) to give the Minister alternative

powers  either  to  impose  detention  orders   on

persons  associated with activities of a  criminal

nature  or  to  order that they  be  placed  under

police  supervision; (3) to extend the  period  of

detention made by the Minister from six months  as

at  present  to  one year; (4) to  impose  special

restrictions on those persons placed under  police

supervision and special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



penalties on them for breaking the restrictions or

for being convicted of specified offences; and (5)

to  issue special identity cards to those  subject

to police supervision under this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of the principal Ordinance will lapse on

20th  October,  1959, and clause  2  of  the  Bill

extends  its life for another five years. In  view

of  the  intention that the maximum initial period

of supervision should be three years with the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara being empowered to extend  this

period  if  he thinks fit - it is only logical  that

the  life of the Ordinance should be extended  for

at  least five years instead of extending  it  for

another year and then introducing further amending

Bills to extend its life from year to year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential threat of violence is still with us

and we still have need for the continuance of this

Ordinance.  Furthermore, the  knowledge  that  the

Ordinance will be in force for another five  years

will  be a deterrent to both present and potential

gangsters  and,  I  hope,  will  also  make   them

seriously  consider  the advantages  of  reforming

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 is a clause which empowers the Minister

either   to   order  the  detention   of   persons

associated with activities of a criminal nature in

the  interests of public safety, peace,  and  good

order  for a period up to one year or to  make  an

order  directing that they be placed under  police

supervision  for  a  period  not  exceeding  three

years.  The  extension of the period of  detention

order by the Minister from six months to one  year

is  aimed  at the real hard-core criminal  leaders

and fighters who must be removed out of commission

for  an  effective period of time.  On  the  other

hand, there are many gangsters including some  who

are  already detained, who are really  misled  and

misguided  persons, often teenagers, who  are  not

all  lost to the society of decent people and  who

should   be  given  a  second  chance  to   redeem

themselves   and  go  straight.  This   class   of

gangsters  could  be put under police  supervision

instead  of being detained. They would be released

and  returned  to  the intimate  circle  of  their

relatives and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



friends. They would be subject to restrictions but

they  could  lead comparatively normal  lives  and

participate in remunerative employment. They  will

not  be bothered so long as they do not break  the

restrictions  imposed on them  or  commit  certain

specified crimes of violence for which the penalty

is deterrent prison sentences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 replaces the existing procedure of

persons  under detention orders being released  on

suspension orders and provides for the Minister to

make  orders for police supervision in respect  of

persons  who are already detained under  detention

orders, or under detention orders the validity  of

which  has expired. I can give the assurance  that

the  orders under these two clauses will  be  made

with  the  greatest care and examination.  I  must

also  point out that the powers conferred  on  the

Minister by clauses 7 and 9 would still, as in the

principal Ordinance, be subject to the consent  of

the  Public Prosecutor being obtained and  subject

to  confirmation  by  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara

after  consideration of reports from the  Advisory

Committee  appointed  under  section  51  of   the

Ordinance.  The Minister therefore  does  not  act

completely  on his own. There are these  important

safeguards which I have just mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 makes persons directed to be under

police  supervision subject to other  disabilities

and  provisions  intended to  make  it  easier  to

control  their  activities and to  prevent  or  to

deter  them from committing crimes. If they  break

the  restrictions  imposed  on  them  under  these

police supervision orders or if they consort  with

other   persons  subject  to  similar  supervision

orders  without permission, or if they  are  found

loitering in public places or are found at  places

where  breaches of the peace have been  committed,

or are found in the company of two or more persons

subject  to  supervision  without  being  able  to

account  for themselves satisfactorily,  they  are

liable   on   conviction  to  be   punished   with

imprisonment for a term not exceeding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



three  years and not less than one year. Also,  if

such  persons are convicted of any of the offences

included  in the Third Schedule to the  Ordinance,

they will become liable to double the maximum term

of  imprisonment imposed therefor and will also be

liable  to  caning.  Sir,  we  are  not  alone  in

imposing  these special restrictions on  specified

offences for they are taken from the Prevention of

Crimes   Ordinance   recently   enacted   in   the

Federation  of  Malaya. This clause also  provides

for   the   taking  of  photographs   and   finger

impressions of such persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 makes corresponding provision for the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to extend the validity  of

detention  orders  for periods not  exceeding  one

year  at  any  one  time to be in  line  with  the

initial  period  of  up  to  one  year  for  these

detention orders. The existing provision  that  no

detention  order  shall extend  beyond  two  years

still  remains. The clause also empowers the  Yang

di-Pertuan   Negara  to  extend  the   period   of

supervision orders from time to time.  As  in  the

case  of  detention  orders  under  the  principal

Ordinance, he may also refer any supervision order

for   further   consideration   by   an   Advisory

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 gives the Minister powers to make rules

providing,  inter alia, for the issue  of  special

identity   cards   to  all  persons   subject   to

supervision orders. This is desirable for purposes

of  their easier identification by the police  and

the control of their movements and activities.  It

is  not  the intention, however, to issue identity

cards of a conspicuous nature like having a big  X

endorsed  on  them, or having a  different  colour

from  the ordinary cards. They will be made easily

identifiable by the police without making them too

obvious. This is desirable because it is felt that

persons  subject to police supervision under  this

Ordinance  should  not  be hampered  by  a  public

branding   from   obtaining  and   succeeding   in

legitimate employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other clauses which should perhaps be

mentioned  are  clause  6  which  now  gives   the

Minister the power to amend, add to or vary any of

the Schedules in the Ordinance, and clause 12



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



which   now   empowers  the   Minister   to   make

appointments to the Advisory Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken of

incorporating  in  the Bill  a  number  of  formal

amendments, for example, the substitution  of  the

words  "Governor  in Council" by "Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara", and "Chief Secretary" by "Minister".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few amendments either for clarification or of a

purely drafting nature are also incorporated,  for

example, the renumbering of Schedules due  to  the

fact that the First to the Fifth Schedules in  the

Ordinance  have been repealed by Ordinance  34  of

1959 dated 26th March, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these then are the aims and objects of this

Bill. The additional powers and measures asked for

are  drastic but, as i stressed earlier on, we are

dealing  with  unruly and unprincipled  thugs  and

gangsters who have no regard for the rule of  law.

The  present Government is determined to  end  the

present  state of gang lawlessness and I am  sure,

with  this  end  in  view, the Bill  will  commend

itself  to the House and to the law-abiding public

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to congratulate the Government on this  Bill

to amend the principal Ordinance. But there is one

aspect of this Bill which I would like to bring to

the attention of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been enacted in order that the

public  safety, peace and good order in  Singapore

might  be  preserved, and there is no  doubt  that

there are elements in the country doing their best

to  upset public safety, peace and good order.  In

this  connection, too, Sir, and in respect of  the

point  I  wish  to make, I wish to  bring  to  the

attention of the House the Preservation of  Public

Security  Ordinance  which is  also  an  Ordinance

designed  to secure public safety, possibly  at  a

different level, but nevertheless to secure public

safety. In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



Preservation  of  Public Security  Ordinance,  Mr

(Deputy)  Speaker,  there  is  provision  for   an

appeals  tribunal  to which  any  person,  who  is

detained  under the provisions of that  Ordinance,

could  appeal. Now, the appeals tribunal comprises

a High Court Judge and two District Judges, and to

this  appeals  tribunal any person  who  has  been

detained  under the provisions of the Preservation

of  Public  Security Ordinance  could  put  in  an

appeal.  The  appeal is heard in camera,  but  the

appeal  is  heard,  and the  detained  person  has

opportunities  of making his defence  before  that

tribunal. In other words, Mr (Deputy) Speaker, he

himself  might be able to say something or  adduce

some  evidence which has not reached the  ears  or

the  eyes of the Minister in charge. There  is  no

doubt  that when the safety of the State is  being

threatened, the executive must be given sufficient

powers  to  combat that evil. But the greater  the

powers  that  are given to combat that  evil,  Mr

(Deputy) Speaker, I venture to suggest that  there

must be corresponding provisions which will enable

persons   who  possibly  should  not   have   been

accused - maybe one in a hundred; but even  in  that

exceptional case that person should be  given  the

opportunity of presenting his case with a view  to

determining whether or not his detention has  been

right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance  makes  provision  for  that.  In   this

Ordinance, Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, there is  an

Advisory  Committee  which has  the  powers  of  a

Court;  it  can subpoena and administer oaths  and

take  evidence. But there is no provision in  this

Ordinance  which gives the right to a  person  who

has  been  detained to prefer an  appeal  to  this

Advisory Committee. The Ordinance merely says that

his   case   may  be  submitted  to  the  Advisory

Committee.  It  is not obligatory but  permissive;

the  Minister or some other person in  charge  may

submit his case to the Advisory Committee. As  far

as  I  have  been able to ascertain, Mr  (Deputy)

Speaker,  Sir,  the  position  now  is  that  this

Advisory Committee is only given papers which  the

Minister himself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



has seen. Now, where the Minister himself has seen

the papers and satisfied himself on the advice  of

the  Public  Prosecutor, it stands to reason  that

the  Advisory  Committee  itself  must  also   be

satisfied.  After these safeguards, it  is  hardly

likely  that the Advisory Committee could come  to

any   other  conclusion.  But  what  I  would   be

interested to see, Mr (Deputy) Speaker,  Sir,  is

for the person detained to be enabled to bring  as

of right to this Advisory Committee evidence which

has  not  been placed before the Minister himself.

In order to do this, I think some provision should

be  made  in  the  Bill  which  will  enable  this

detained person to make his appeal in the same way

that the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance

enables  persons detained under its provisions  to

make the appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for that observation, Sir, I am entirely in

support of the Bill.



<br><br>6.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, I heartily support this

Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment No.

2)  Bill.  This amending Bill is to eradicate  the

misdeeds   of   the  previous  Government,   whose

attitude was based on partial changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, in the light of the

written language contained in this Bill, it  seems

that  this  Bill is drastic and harsh. But  if  we

examine it and take into consideration the  threat

to   a   person's  safety  under   the   wave   of

gangsterism,  then  this  amending  Bill  is   not

drastic  and harsh enough. The new Government  has

its  responsibility to the people, and it  has  to

bear  in mind the interests of the masses  of  the

people.  In  order  to  ensure  security  in  this

country, we have to enact proper laws, and  if  we

cannot  do  so,  then we will  be  just  like  the

previous  Government. Because of this,  therefore,

this  amending  Bill  is  decisive.  We  must   be

decisive  and provide in this Bill means to  check

the activities of gangsterism. The amending



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



Bill is a good prescription. It is `tasty' to  us,

and to those who are aware of the implications  of

this amendment, they will know that it is to their

own interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must know what is gangsterism. We must know

their  origin.  Since  the 18th  century,  Chinese

immigrants  have  poured into  this  country  from

every   corner  of  China.  From  the  inflow   of

immigrants  into Malaya and Singapore, there  came

the   Ang   Bin  Hoay.  This  Ang  Bin  Hoay   was

established in Singapore, and its purpose  was  to

overthrow  the Manchurian Government and reinstate

the  Ming Dynasty in China. But because of changes

in the society, this Ang Bin Hoay dissolved itself

into many small gangster groups. We must not under-rate  the activities of this organisation. It  has

its  own traditions and its own merits. If we  can

witness a ceremony of these gangsters and can look

into some of the regulations of this organisation,

we  can then easily find that they strongly uphold

their  unity  and  justice. From  these  came  the

theory  of  gangsterism. It is based on what  they

call  justice to unite the gangster members. Their

principle  has  been handed down  since  the  18th

century  to  the  present society.  Although  this

organisation looks very simple, their influence is

widespread.  At  the same time,  because  of  this

influence,  the  leadership in the  ranks  of  the

gangsters is able to continue up to the present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that this Government has taken office, I

believe  the  masses  of the  people  realise  its

attitude  towards  the gangsters.  My  Party,  the

P.A.P., stands for the principle of socialism, and

this  gangsterism is detrimental to socialism.  We

must know why these gangsters become gangsters.  I

believe that a gangster becomes one because he was

not  properly brought up when young and living  in

obscurity. The old social institutions contributed

much  to the organisation of gangsterism. We  want

to  suppress  gangsterism. We  must  think  of  an

alternative  to  help to reform gangsters  and  to

lead them to the road of happiness. Today we amend

this    Criminal   Law   (Temporary    Provisions)

(Amendment  No. 2) Bill in order to  suppress  the

obstinate elements of gangsterism. We must make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



them realise their present situation, for they are

responsible for the disorderliness in the  present

society. On the one hand, they can kill a  dog  to

give  a lesson to the monkey. This can be said  to

be  a lesson to the new members of the gangs.  The

previous   Government  were  different  from   the

present   Government  in  their  attitude  towards

gangsterism.  The  previous Government  adopted  a

partial  policy towards gangsterism. When  certain

things happened they put all these gangsters  into

gaol.  They just put them in there for  a  certain

period  without educating them and without  giving

them  any  opportunity to reform themselves.  This

was  the policy of the previous Government towards

gangsterism.   Therefore   I   support   the   new

Government  unconditionaly to amend  the  criminal

law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, we give them an opportunity to

get  their places in life again and, on the  other

hand,   we   make  them  realise  that  they   are

responsible  for  the state of insecurity  of  our

present society.



<br><br>6.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as my colleague, the

Minister for Home Affairs



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I would like to draw

the  attention of hon. Members to the correct form

of  address. It should be "Mr Deputy Speaker" and

not "Mr Speaker."



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my colleague and friend,

the  Minister for Home Affairs, has already  drawn

the  attention of this House to the  magnitude  of

the  threat  which is facing society here  through

organised  thuggery. The situation,  Mr  (Deputy)

Speaker, Sir, is not an ordinary situation whereby

some  misguided people get into criminal activity.

The  situation is one of real seriousness  whereby

the   whole  organisation  of  society  is   being

threatened by criminals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



who  are  organised  in gangs.  The  situation  is

extraordinary and, therefore, it is necessary that

the  Government seek extraordinary powers to  deal

with this very abnormal criminal situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, I can assure the

Member  for  Farrer  Park  that  we  dislike   the

necessity for this Bill as much as he does. But if

we  are to be realistic, and if we are to be  able

to  deal  with the situation, it is very necessary

that we get these extraordinary powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also, Mr (Deputy) Speaker, Sir, seen to

it that there are provisions written into this law

to  ensure that the powers that we seek are not in

any  way  abused.  As  my  colleague  has  already

pointed  out, these powers cannot be exercised  by

the  Minister unless he first gets the consent  of

the Public Prosecutor, and when the detention  is

made  by  the  Minister or police  supervision  is

imposed  by  the  Minister  in  pursuance  of  the

exercise  of these powers, the detainee still  has

further safeguards, Sir. The Bill does not in  any

way  deprive  the detainee of the  right  to  make

representations  before  the  Advisory   Committee

(which is the Committee which advises the Minister on  all  matters  appertaining to detentions),  so

that,  Mr  (Deputy) Speaker, Sir,  I  would  like

again  to point out to the Member for Farrer  Park

that  in all these things one has to be realistic.

In   a  situation  fraught  with  danger,  it   is

essential that we seek these extraordinary powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Now. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read the Third

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take this opportunity to reply to some

of  the remarks made by the Member for Farrer Park

just  now.  The  Member  for  Farrer  Park  is  an

advocate and solicitor, and I presume he is  aware

of  the  Criminal  Law Advisory  Committee  Rules,

1958.  The rules enable the Advisory Committee  to

carry out a full enquiry. There is provision under

rule 4, subsection (1) , and rule 5 subsections (1)

and  (2)  of  the Criminal Law Advisory  Committee

Rules,  1958,  for  a  person detained  under  the

Criminal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



Law   (Temporary  Provisions)  Ordinance,  to   be

notified  of  the date, time and  place  when  the

Advisory Committee will consider the grounds  upon

which his detention order has been made and he may

then appear personally to make representations  or

have his representations made by his advocate  and

solicitor,  or,  in place of oral representations,

have  his  representations made in writing.  There

is, therefore, provision for a detained person  to

appeal  to  the Advisory Committee,  which  is  an

outside  and impartial body, consisting  of  three

members  of the public, one of whom, the chairman,

is  a  member  of the Bar. The Advisory  Committee

takes into consideration not the police papers and

documents    alone,    but    also    hears    the

representations  of the detained  person  and  the

representations of any of his witnesses.  Further,

there  are several checks and counter-checks  when

the  police  statements and grounds for  detention

are   considered   by   the   Minister   for   the

prosecution, the Advisory Committee,  and  finally

the  Cabinet. So, I can assure the Members of  the

House  that in exercising the powers contained  in

this  Ordinance we shall exercise every  care  and

consideration. As I have pointed out earlier, this

is  an abnormal situation and therefore we require

extraordinary powers to deal with the situation.

Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main purpose of this Bill is to effect a

simplification and, I hope, an improvement in  the

law  relating  to the limitation of  actions.  The

present law in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  is based on the Indian law,  which  was

passed  in  1877 in India and was introduced  into

the former Straits Settlements in 1896. The Indian

Act and the whole law is extremely complicated. It

lists  over  100  different kinds of  actions  and

provides  varying  periods of limitation,  varying

from  one  year  up  to  60  years.  Many  of  the

variations are extremely arbitrary and the  Indian

courts have varied in their interpretation of  the

Act.  The complication of the laws has given  rise

to   the  need  for  bulky  commentaries.  In   an

introduction  to  one of these  commentaries,  Mr

Justice Walsh said: "Was it necessary in order  to

prevent  a  man from sleeping over his  rights  to

devise 183 methods of defeating him, or is  it  to

be   that   in  order  to  appreciate  the   right

interpretation  of  these 183  methods,  a  lawyer

should be forced to investigate no less than 8,000

reported decisions?"



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Federation, a committee

was set up in 1950 to consider the law relating to

limitations.   This  committee   recommended   the

adoption  of  the  English law of  limitations  as

contained  in  the Limitation Act of  1939.  As  a

result,  the  Federation,  in  1953,  enacted  the

Limitation Ordinance. The Singapore Bar  Committee

has also considered the matter and has recommended

that  legislation  on  the lines  of  the  English

Limitation   Act,   1939,   and   the   Federation

Limitation   Ordinance,  1953,   be   enacted   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad principle of the Bill is simple. It

makes the limitation period for nearly all actions

six  years. The principle exceptions to this  rule

are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. In the case of actions on judgments;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Actions to recover land; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Actions to recover money secured on a

mortgage or charge of land or personal property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of limitation proposed is 12 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of actions to recover a penalty or

forfeiture under any written



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



law  (not  being  a  criminal  fine)  and  actions

arising out of certain revenue matters, the period

of limitation proposed is one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill, Sir, sets

out in some detail the principal provisions of the

Bill,  and  I  do  not propose to repeat  what  is

stated there. I commend the Bill as one which will

help  to  make this particular branch of  the  law

simpler  and  one which can be clearly  understood

not only by lawyers but by the public at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that

this sub-clause is the exact duplication of clause

<br><br>7.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's  recommendation  in

regard to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is, as stated in its

long  title, "to make provision for the regulation

of moneylending".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill deals with

its provisions in detail and I need only refer  to

some of the salient features of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Bill, moneylenders

will  be  required  to take out licences  annually

from  the Registrar of Moneylenders. A loan by  an

unlicensed  moneylender will be unenforceable.  To

qualify  for  a  licence,  the  moneylender   must

satisfy  the  Registrar that  he  is  resident  in

Singapore,  is of good character,  is  a  fit  and

proper  person to hold a licence, that he has  not

been  disqualified from holding a licence and that

he has not, after the coming into operation of the

Ordinance, lent money to a person under  18  years

of  age.  In  the case of a company or  firm,  the

manager must so satisfy the Registrar. The licence

would  show  the  moneylender's  true  name,   his

business  name  and the address  at  which  he  is

authorised  to  carry  on  business.  A  list   of

licensed  moneylenders will be  published  in  the

Government Gazette. A moneylender who is refused a

licence may appeal to the Minister, whose decision

shall  be final. A court is authorised to  suspend

or  forfeit the licence of any person convicted by

it  of  an  offence  under the  Ordinance  and  to

disqualify any such person from obtaining a  fresh

licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lending money, moneylenders are required to

have  a written memorandum in the English language

signed by the borrower containing all the terms of

the contract, particularly the date, the principal

and  the rate of interest. At the Committee  stage

of  this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose to move

an amendment to provide that the memorandum shall,

where  there is more than one borrower, state  the

amount  paid  to  each of the  borrowers  and  the

amount  payable  by  each  of  the  borrowers   or

sureties. A copy of the memorandum must  be  given

to the borrower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the loan is for $100 or more, payment of

the loan is required to be made by crossed cheque,

crossed  postal order or crossed money order.  The

purpose of this provision is to protect the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



borrower  from  acknowledging  the  receipt  of  a

greater  sum than that actually received  by  him,

and it will also incidentally help the moneylender

in  proving  the  amount of the  money  lent,  the

burden of which is placed on him under the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moneylender is required to state his licence

number   on  the  note  or  memorandum,  including

promissory  notes, setting out the  terms  of  the

loan,  and he is also required to hand a  copy  of

such  notes  or  memoranda to the Commissioner  of

Stamps,  who is then required to forward  them  to

the Comptroller of Income Tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every moneylender is required to keep, in

permanent  books, regular accounts of  each  loan,

and also prescribed books of accounts including  a

cash  book.  The Registrar may inspect  the  books

under conditions of secrecy and the moneylender is

required  to  submit quarterly statements  of  his

cash and loan accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court is authorised to reopen moneylending

transactions  and to give the debtor relief  where

the  interest  is  excessive and  the  transaction

harsh and unconscionable, so that we may get  into

a  situation where some moneylenders may appear as

defendants in our courts, and the courts  will  be

able to order these moneylenders to refund part of

their  unjust  earnings to those  whom  they  have

hitherto held in thrall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A debtor, Sir, may apply to the court for relief

at  any time and not merely when proceedings  have

already  been  instituted  against  him   by   the

moneylender.  Where the interest  exceeds  18  per

cent  per annum on unsecured loans or 12 per  cent

per annum on secured loans, such interest shall be

presumed  until  the  contrary  is  proved  to  be

excessive   and   the   transaction   harsh    and

unconscionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moneylenders are not allowed to charge for

expenses other than stamp duties, fees payable  by

law  and  legal costs incidental to the loan,  and

cannot   receive  interest  under  the  guise   of

expenses.  Borrowers who have  paid  such  illegal

charges are allowed to recover them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The borrower is allowed to repay any money lent

or  interest  thereon by cheque,  money  order  or

postal  order, and where a cheque, money order  or

postal order has been posted to the moneylender at

his  authorised  address, the  presumption  arises

that  the amount stated in the cheque, money order

or postal order has been paid to the moneylender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where borrowers do not understand English, the

note   must   be  attested  by  an  advocate   and

solicitor,  or  magistrate  or  other  responsible

person  who shall explain the note to the borrower

and  certify  that this has been done.  The  money

must be paid over in the presence of the attestor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moneylenders who make any note or memorandum, or

who  take  a security for their loan, a promissory

note or other contract for the repayment of money,

in  which the principal or rate of interest is not

fully   stated   or  is  left  blank   shall,   on

conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding $500

and,  in  the  event  of  a second  or  subsequent

conviction,  imprisonment of  not  more  than  six

months or a fine of not more than $1,000 or both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-operative societies, bankers, pawnbrokers and

certain  corporations and societies and all  those

who  only lend money doing so merely in the course

of  and for the purpose of any business not having

as  its  primary object the lending of money,  are

excluded from the definition of "moneylender"  and

are therefore not affected by the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government does not pretend

that this Bill will put a stop to the malpractices

that  are  carried on by certain very unscrupulous

moneylenders  in Singapore but it seeks  to  serve

notice  on all those who are taking part in  those

malpractices that as and when reports are made  to

us  and  if the public is able to show that  there

are  loopholes  in  this Ordinance  through  which

moneylenders  can escape, I can  assure  them  all

that  we  shall do our utmost to see that  further

legislation  is introduced to put a complete  stop

to these malpractices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am glad that the Minister for Labour  and

Law  assured us that if malpractices are found  in

the future, further legislation will be enforced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rising to support this Bill, I would like to

make a few comments. This Bill is laudable for the

fact  that it protects the poor from the  clutches

of  unscrupulous moneylenders. This  Bill,  in  my

opinion, should be implemented as soon as possible

to  ease  the hardship of those already victimised

and  to  prevent those who, because  of  financial

difficulties,  may be victimised  in  the  future.

However,  I  do hope that Government will  give  a

thought to the seemingly unavoidable loopholes  in

the  Moneylenders Bill which the moneylenders will

find,  as  the  Minister  himself  had  said.  The

Government's  fight will not be only  against  the

moneylenders but also against those who  abet  the

moneylenders.  Strange as it may  seem,  the  very

people  whom this Bill is supposed to protect  are

the  worst  offenders.  To  mention  one  example,

clause 16 (2) reads as follows



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... no security given by the borrower or by

any such agent as aforesaid in respect of any such

contract  shall if the amount of the loan  is  one

hundred dollars or above be enforceable unless the

money  lent was given to the borrower or his agent

in  the form of a crossed cheque or crossed postal

order  or crossed money order made payable to  the

borrower or his agent."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of this, nothing prevents the

borrower  from  agreeing to  return  part  of  the

amount  that appears on the cheque even  when  the

loan  is  in the form of a cheque. He may even  be

required  to  provide the difference  between  the

actual  loan  and the amount that was signed  for,

before the cheque for the full amount is handed to

him.  Moreover, clause 16 (2) - the one I have  just

read - only  provides for loans  of  not  less  than

$100.  It  is the very, very poor, Sir,  who  need

protection  most, who usually take loans  of  less

than $100, and I think that they are the ones  who

should be protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sunday Mail of 30th August reported:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Horse-racing, character lotteries, mahjong and

cards  in  that order caused the downfall  of  the

thousands now in the clutches of the moneylender."



<br><br>Sir,  it must be admitted that people who get into

debt because of horse-racing, character lotteries,

mahjong  and  cards are irresponsible people,  and

when  irresponsible people are desperately in need

of  money,  "reckless" is a mild term  to  use  to

describe them. They therefore will be prepared  to

break  all  rules and regulations  and  even  abet

moneylenders so long as they get the  money,  some

in  spite  of the knowledge that it is detrimental

to  themselves; and there are some who  will  sign

any  form of contract, because they have  not  the

slightest  intention of abiding by  the  contract.

Sir, this is a more difficult obstacle to overcome

than  the  difficulty  posed by  the  moneylenders

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that with the experts that the

Government has in the Ministers and with the legal

mind  of  a brilliant lawyer that is in our  Prime

Minister,  it should not be impossible to  find  a

way  of overcoming this difficulty. The Government

claims  to  have  been  very successful  in  their

education  campaign  in  literacy,  language   and

politics.  Perhaps I may be permitted  to  suggest

that   Government   launches   another   education

campaign  to  educate irresponsible  and  reckless

people  who  do damage not only to themselves  and

their families, but also to innocent and deserving

parties. It is the irresponsible actions of  these

reckless people that raise the degree of risk that

moneylenders  have to take. To  cover  this  risk,

moneylenders  resort  to all  sorts  of  means  of

raising  interest illegally. And the poor man  who

is  desperately in need of money for  a  deserving

cause, like illness in the family maybe, will have

to  suffer  the same consequences as the  reckless

gambler.  Bearing  this  in  mind  for   a   later

improvement   on   the   Bill,   I   support    it

wholeheartedly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point for the Government to bear in mind

in connection with this Bill is that the very poor

people, who have no status to support them and may

find   it   very  difficult  to  get  loans   from

moneylenders, go to pawnshops with articles  which

they  can hardly do without - sometimes as  bad  as

their own coats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



or  their wives' sarongs - just to tide them over  a

difficult  period of, let us say,  illness.  These

are  the  people who deserve pity  and  should  be

helped. And these are the people who are paying 24

per cent interest on a loan, sometimes 30 per cent

if  the  loan is less than $5, as against  12  per

cent  as  provided  in the Moneylenders  Bill  for

secured debts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope in the spirit of this Moneylenders

Bill,  the  Government will consider in  the  near

future  amending the pawnbrokers' rate of interest

to  bring it to a fairer balance with that of  the

Moneylenders Bill.



<br><br>7.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, whenever we hear the word "moneylender",  two

communities are associated with it, even  if  they

are good - the chettiars and the Sikhs. If we have a

good  Sikh  friend  who visits the  house,  people

around would think that we are borrowing money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from my point of view as a

worker, I would like to stress a particular point.

In  the  trade union movement, it is usual to  see

pickets  before an office when they are on  strike

to  fight the employers. But on pay days, Sir,  we

see  two  kinds of picketing without  placards - one

with  a  turban and beard, and the  other  with  a

dhoti  and an umbrella. Such picketing can  always

be  seen in front of Government offices, the  City

Council,  the  Harbour Board, or  any  other  well

established  offices, on any pay day  at  about  4

o'clock, and the pickets are waiting for borrowers

to  come  forth from offices. And these  employees

when  they  are  badly  in need  of  money  easily

succumb  to the grip of the moneylenders, who  use

nice words, and show no interest in recovering the

principal  loan, but simply say, "Kalau wan  tidak

ada wang, ta'apa. Baya bunga dahulu." [If you have

no money, it does not matter. Paying interest will

do.]  Mr Speaker, Sir, if a man borrows $200,  he

might  agree  to  pay the moneylender  12  monthly

instalments of $30 each to clear the debt. And  if

the  man  is financially tight on a pay  day,  the

moneylender  would usually pay him  $10  and  say,

"Kalau



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



tuan ta'apa wang, ta'apa. Sim pan dahulu." [If you

have no money, it does not matter. Keep it first.]

This  $20  is paid as interest only, and  this  is

carried  on for years, and the capital remains  as

it  is - $200.  And  therefore the  moneylender,  in

about four years, would have collected about  $800

as   interest  with  a  capital  of   $200   still

outstanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about moneylending, there are many

cultural  traditions that Indians have brought  to

Singapore  and Malaya. Among these is  the  money-lending  culture. Of the Sikh community,  Sir,  if

you  look through the passport of a Sikh who comes

to  Malaya,  never  can you find their  occupation

stated as moneylender; almost all come for jobs - as

jagas,  or watchmen. And wherever they work,  they

begin   lending   money,  and  accumulate   money.

Sometimes  they form a money-lending  association,

and  usually  we find that about 99  per  cent  of

these Sikh moneylenders are not licensed. If  they

cannot  find a borrower in his office, they  would

go  straight to his home. And if he is not  there,

they  would  intimidate his wife  and  say,  "Look

here,  if you are not going to pay my interest,  I

am going to prosecute your husband."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, when a man is employed,

he  cannot do any money-lending business. But this

is going on in Singapore; there are people working

and  also doing moneylending business. So when  we

combat   these   two   types  of  moneylenders - the

chettiar community and the Sikh community - I should

say  that  the  chettiars are more reasonable  and

have consideration for the borrowers' difficulties

than  the Sikhs. Mr Speaker, Sir, the law  states

that  for  a loan of more than $100, it should  be

paid  by a crossed cheque and, as the hon.  Member

for  Mountbatten  has just mentioned,  maybe  some

bargaining  may  be  made in the  signing  of  the

documents, such as after the borrower has got  the

money from the bank he must pay to the moneylender

whatever  difference he has agreed to pay  between

the stated loan and actual sum received. In such a

case it is up to the borrower



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



himself  to  decide, once he has got  the  crossed

cheque,   whether  or  not  he  should   pay   the

difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point which I am strongly in favour of in the

Bill  is the prohibition of moneylenders besieging

places of employment or residence. As it is, these

moneylenders would not allow the borrowers to  sit

in  their offices, to go to their houses, or  even

to  a coffeeshop to drink coffee. That is the main

thing.  If  a  man needs money, he  can  go  as  a

gentleman  to a licensed moneylender  and  sign  a

loan, because the moneylender has a furnished  and

licensed office with a notice board. So this is  a

very good clause. And even if the rate of interest

is  18 per cent or 12 per cent, it is in line with

the Federation's policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when this Bill is passed, most of the

unlicensed  moneylenders now would  be  unable  to

issue summons for past contracts. In the past, the

borrowers just signed promissory notes with  which

the moneylenders could sue them and say, "Look, if

you  are not going to pay, I will summon you.  So,

if  you  cannot  pay all, you had better  pay  the

interest."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is a great

relief  for  the  workers, and it  is  my  earnest

belief  that  the majority of the workers  support

the Government on this Bill.



<br><br>7.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support this

Moneylenders  Bill,  moved  by  the  Minister  for

Labour   and  Law.  Indeed  there  are  still   in

Singapore many unscrupulous moneylenders who  hold

the  poor  people in their clutches. We know,  and

the   general   public   knows   too,   that   the

moneylenders, licensed and unlicensed, are  cinema

attendants, godown jagas, and many other watchmen,

who  are  also prepared to lend money to the  poor

people, and suck the blood of the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is another point I would like to mention. I know about this matter personally.

For instance, a man borrows $100, but he signs for

a loan of $200. The borrower accepts the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



terms  because  of  forced  circumstances,  or  of

hardship. But the moneylender has no pity or mercy

for the poor or those who are in need of help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker. When the time for

payment  comes, i.e. at the end of the month - as  I

personally have witnessed or known - almost in every

office in Singapore the moneylenders would wait in

a   long   queue,  reminiscent  of  the   Japanese

occupation when there were long queues to purchase

cigarettes,  with people pushing here  and  there.

These  moneylenders would queue up in that  manner

in order to recover money loaned to the borrowers.

This,  if left unchecked, will, I think, not  only

be  detrimental to the borrowers but also  to  the

moneylenders.  It  may be that the  borrowers  are

working  for  a certain employer and the  employer

will  no  doubt  act,  with  a  dismissal  of  the

employee. With the Bill moved by the Minister  for

Labour and Law, I believe and I am confident  that

this  will  bring  about  an  improvement  to  the

conditions  for the benefit of both  the  borrower

and  the  lender.  And another  factor  that  also

strengthens the case for approval of this Bill  is

that  it can educate those people who are  in  the

habit  of  borrowing money from moneylenders,  and

that  the  moneylenders will come to  realise  the

hardship  of  the  borrowers and  abide  by  these

regulations.  There is a certain  section  of  the

people who do not have difficulty in getting food,

Mr Speaker, but nevertheless they land themselves

in  difficulties;  not because  of  the  force  of

circumstances,  but because they  want  to  attend

cinema  shows or purchase luxuries. And  there  is

another  section  who  wish  to  observe  marriage

traditions and fulfil certain obligations to their

brothers or sisters and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am confident that if this Bill is enforced, I am sure the moneylenders who are

always  lending money will realise the  conditions

of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>7.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Mountbatten  just now asked why it  was  that  the

Bill did not require loans of less than $100 to be

made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



by  way  of  a crossed cheque. She suggested  that

such an omission would defeat the very purposes of

this  Bill  in the sense that this Bill  has  been

designed  to  protect borrowers of small  sums.  I

would remind the Member for Mount-batten that  the

majority  of the people who are held in thrall  by

the moneylenders are poor people, and most of them

are  the  people who take loans of less than  $100

from  unscrupulous moneylenders. It has  been  the

practice  in  the past for these moneylenders  who

lend  sums of less than $100 to these poor  people

to  require  them  to  sign promissory  notes  for

larger amounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that will not be possible under this

present  Bill  because  the moneylenders  will  be

forced  to  enter a sum of less than $100  on  the

note and cannot require them to sign for more.  If

he requires them to sign for more, he will have to

pay them by way of a crossed cheque, and it is for

that reason that loans for less than $100 are  not

required to be made by crossed cheques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other point that the Member for

Mountbatten has made. She said, and I  agree  with

her, that this Bill itself is not likely to put  a

stop    to   fraudulent   practices   and    other

malpractices   on   the   part   of   unscrupulous

moneylenders. If she knows of other  dodges  which

are  being  used  to defeat the purposes  of  this

Bill, I would invite her to bring these dodges  to

the  attention of the Government. I can assure her

that  we  will  introduce, if necessary,  amending

legislation to put a stop to these dodges, because

we   are   determined  to  see  that   all   these

malpractices are put an end to immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Byrne].

<div align="center"><b>ENEMY PROPERTY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of this Bill are simple and

straightforward. The Bill is designed to indemnify

those  persons  who, acting in good  faith,  dealt

with  property  erroneously assumed  to  be  enemy

property  and also to provide for the disposal  of

in, come  derived  from enemy property,  and  any

copyright  of an enemy nature infringed  owing  to

the  War. The Bill is based on the United  Kingdom

Enemy Property Act, 1953, and follows in the  main

the Federation Enemy Property Ordinance, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom Act has three main purposes:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To indemnify persons who dealt with property

erroneously assumed to be enemy property, provided

they  were  acting in good faith and in  purported

compliance  with  the  Trading  with   the   Enemy

legislation. Titles to such property actually sold

are  validated  but  the real  owner's  rights  to

recover  the  property are protected  when  it  is

still  in  the custodian's hands or  when  it  was

leased to an ostensible owner without payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. It provides for the disposal of income from

enemy property. This income is used, first, to pay

interest in respect of property erroneously  taken

into custody. The balance of the income is paid to

the exchequer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. It provides protection in the case of

infringement of German-owned copyright for the use

of   German-owned  patents  and  designs  and  for

transactions  involving reparation materials  sent

from  Germany  to  the United  Kingdom,  where  no

legislative saction or authority existed for  such

infringement, use or transaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason why claims may arise is because

of   the  peculiar  difficulty  in  war  time   of

determining what was enemy property and  what  was

not.  The  definition of enemy  property  depended

upon the residence of the owner regardless of  his

own  nationality, because if the owner  was  under

enemy control, his property might be available  to

the  enemy. Consequently when owners moved between

enemy   and   neutral  countries,   or   companies

operating  in  enemy territory were controlled  by

other  companies in neutral territory,  there  was

difficulty  in  determining the  status  of  their

property.  The  rule  was  adopted  that  property

should be treated as enemy property when there was

any   doubt  as  to  its  true  status.  In  these

circumstances, mistakes were inevitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the factors leading to the passing of the

United  Kingdom  Act  are  similar  to  those   in

Singapore,  there are other factors  to  be  taken

into  account. The most important is the  fact  of

the Japanese occupation and the confusion cause by

it,  together  with  the  considerable  amount  of

legislation passed in Singapore to deal  with  its

after-effects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Bill therefore specifically

includes  the  Custodian of Property Proclamation,

the Custodian of Property (Vesting) Ordinance, and

the Custodian of Property Ordinance as legislation

authorising  dealings  with  enemy  property,   or

property  which was assumed to be enemy  property.

The Bill will provide indemnities for dealings  in

such   property  which  was  in  fact  not   enemy

property.  It  has  not  been  necessary  to  make

special   provision  in  respect  of  patents   in

industrial  designs, because registers of  patents

and  designs  in Singapore are mere extensions  of

the English registers. Consequently,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



the  protection  afforded by  the  United  Kingdom

Enemy Property Act against claims by the owners of

patents  and designs, whose rights were  infringed

during  the  War, apply equally to individuals  in

Singapore   and   in  the  United   Kingdom.   The

provisions  of  the United Kingdom Enemy  Property

Act relating to copyrights and disclosure of trade

secrets have been included in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom when property was

erroneously taken into custody and later  restored

to  the  owner,  interest was paid  to  cover  the

period of seizure by the Custodian. With regard to

Singapore,  however, it is proposed that  interest

should be paid only from the date of resumption of

Civil  Government on the 1st April, 1946,  or  the

date  when  the  property was taken into  custody,

whichever is the later. This proposal is  in  line

with  the  policy adopted in connection  with  the

moratorium. During the Occupation and until  Civil

Government  was  resumed, it was not  possible  to

administer enemy property nor to return to  owners

property erroneously taken under control. Just  as

some  of  the  loss caused by the  Occupation  was

placed  upon  the  owners  as  a  result  of   the

moratorium,  so  some of the loss  in  respect  of

property seized by the Custodian should also  fall

on  the owners. It is proposed that interest shall

be   payable,   following   the   United   Kingdom

precedent,  only on property that was never  enemy

property at any time. Interest on the property  of

allies  and  others taken into custody when  their

countries  were  occupied  by  the  enemy  is  not

payable  to  the  owners.  The  reason  for   this

decision  is  that,  in very many  instances,  the

amount  payable would be trivial and the  work  of

calculating  the interest for varying  periods  on

small     but    numerous    sums     would     be

disproportionately costly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to draw special attention to a

major  deviation  from  the  United  Kingdom  Act.

Clause  12  (2)  of the Bill provides  that  where

property   is  taken  into  custody  as  non-enemy

property under the Custodian of Property Ordinance

and  the proceeds of the realisation paid into the

War  Damage  Fund,  such payment  was  not  to  be

disturbed even though the true owner may  be  able

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



establish his claim to the property. Clause 12 (3)

applies  the  same rule to property  certified  as

enemy  property under section 24 of the  Custodian

of  Enemy Property Ordinance where the identity of

the owner could not be established at the date  of

taking  it  into  custody. These two  clauses  are

necessary  in  order to support one of  the  chief

aims of the Custodian of Property Ordinance, which

was to set a time limit on the making of claims on

property  whose ownership could not be ascertained

as  a  result  of  the conditions created  by  the

occupation.  While  on the one hand  hardship  was

suffered  by  owners  unable  to  establish  their

claims within the time limit, on the other hand  a

substantial  proportion of their  number  received

compensation from the War Damage Fund  into  which

had   been  paid  proceeds  realised  from   their

property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protected Places and Areas Ordinance, 1955,

was  enacted  to  provide for the  more  efficient

protection  of  goods  and  supplies   stored   in

protected   places   and   protected   areas.   In

furtherance of this object, authorised persons are

empowered by sections 4 and 5 of the Ordinance  to

search  persons entering or seeking  to  enter  or

being  in  protected places and  areas.  It  would

appear,  however, that authorised persons are  not

empowered to search vehicles or vessels which  are

in  such  places. This would mean,  for  instance,

that while being empowered to search the driver of

a  vehicle, an authorised officer is not empowered

to  search the vehicle itself even though  he  may

strongly suspect that it contains stolen property.

The  Bill therefore seeks to remove all doubts  as

to  the power of that authorised officer to search

a  vehicle or vessel entering or seeking to  enter

or being in a protected place or area.

<br><br>8.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's  recommendation  in

regard to this Bill, and I beg to move, "That  the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, is to

provide  for the licensing and control of  massage

establishments which are defined in the Bill as-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...any premises used or represented as being or

intended to be used for the reception or treatment

of persons requiring massage, manicure, chiropody,

light,  electric, vapour or other baths  or  other

similar treatment;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are, as far as the police know at

present.   16   massage   saloons   operating   in

Singapore.   The  reason  why  it  is   considered

necessary  to  license  and control  such  massage

saloons and similar establishments is that  it  is

known  that  many of these establishments  provide

cover   for   undesirable   activities   including

prostitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that no person may, after the

appointed  day,  carry  on  an  establishment  for

massage  without  a  licence  from  the  Licensing

Officer authorising him to do so. The issue of the

licence  is  at  the discretion of  the  Licensing

Officer,  who  may impose conditions for  securing

the  proper conduct of the establishment  and  who

may, before issuing a licence, require security to

be  given that the provisions of the Ordinance and

the  conditions  of  the  licence  shall  be  duly

observed.  An  appeal  from the  decision  of  the

Licensing Officer will lie to the Minister,  whose

decision  shall  be  final. No  licence  shall  be

issued  to any person who is under the age  of  21

years or to any person who, in the opinion of  the

Licensing  Officer, is unsuitable to hold  such  a

licence,  or in respect of any premises which  the

Licensing Officer considers unsuitable or which is

being carried on in contravention of the Ordinance

or rules made thereunder. Moreover, power is given

to  review  the  licence in cases  where  curative

treatment  is  or  may  be  administered  in   the

establishment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



Unless  there is a qualified person to  administer

such treatment, the licence may be revoked by  the

Licensing  Officer  who is required  to  give  the

grounds  of the revocation, and appeal  from  such

revocation lies to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is given to enter and inspect premises and

to  make rules to carry out the provisions of  the

Ordinance. The provisions of the Bill will not  be

applicable    to    any    hospital,    infirmary,

institution,  nursing home or other  establishment

maintained   by  the  Government  or   any   local

authority, or to other establishments notified  to

be   hospitals  by  the  Minister,   or   to   any

hairdresser  who  gives face or scalp  massage  or

manicure treatment to female customers only or  in

full view of all customers. Power is given to  the

Minister   to   exempt  any  premises   from   the

provisions of the Ordinance.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

like  most things that will forever look  for  the

line  of  least  resistance, so  we  see  so  many

massage   establishments  mushrooming   all   over

Singapore.  Those who read Chinese  newspapers  no

doubt  will  see daily advertisements  which  show

pretty  faces  and  also tell prospective  clients

where to go for a pleasant massage. But in medical

practice,  Sir,  massage is a  form  of  treatment

advocated  for the loosening of stiff  joints  and

tired  muscles  [Laughter] and helping - excuse  me,

Sir - to promote a free blood flow [Laughter] to the

affected  parts, thus increasing [Laughter] - sorry,

Sir - the  outflow of waste products  and  generally

stimulating the activity of the human body. But of

course  the snag is that there are many  parts  of

the body [Laughter]-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think probably the Member

for  Queenstown is anticipating a pleasant massage

after this sitting!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am sorry, Sir,I shall try

to  control  my emotions. I was saying,  Sir,  the

snag  is  that there are many parts  of  the  body

which can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



stimulated, and by the wrong people. And with such

people closely associated with yellow culture  and

the  practice  of yellow arts, the  good  curative

action of massage has been grossly misused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, I heartily support this Bill

which  is  consonant  with the Government's  anti-yellow campaign. Bona fide masseurs should have no

reason  to  fear this Bill and they  should  thank

Government  for  this  action  against   irregular

trespass.

Labour and Law, this time concerning the licensing

that   in  Singapore  there  are  many  unlicensed

virgin   girls  who  are  without  the   necessary

qualifications. As conditions exist at the present

time,   the   aim  and  objective   of   such   an

establishment  is  not to apply massage;  but  the

object is sinister, that is, to make it a place of

prostitution; because Mr Speaker, as  a  masseur,

one must be qualified - one must know, for instance,

enough about blood circulation. If there is a pain

in the neck but the massage is applied to the leg,

then something must be wrong somewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is making an effort to

eradicate  yellow culture, whether it  is  in  the

form of dances, cinema shows, etc. And in the case

of  massage establishments, we should also tighten

or  impose  stronger legislation  and  investigate

this  matter so that the malpractices which  occur

at the present moment will be stopped. That is all

I wish to say.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council,

1958,  provides in section 121 (2)  (d)  that  any

reference  to the Attorney-General in any  written

law shall be construed as a reference to the State

Advocate-General  if the subject  in  relation  to

which  the  reference is made concerns the  powers

conferred  on  the State Advocate-General  by  the

Order  in  Council, and in any  other  case  as  a

reference  to  the  Minister for  the  time  being

charged with the responsibility for that subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers that are conferred on the State

Advocate-General by the Order in Council are those

relating   to   the   initiation,   conduct    and

discontinuance of criminal proceedings.  In  these

matters  the powers of the former Attorney-General

have   been  formally  transferred  to  the  State

Advocate-General  by the Singapore  (Constitution)

Modification  of Laws (No. 2) Order,  1959,  which

were  made  by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara   in

exercise of the powers conferred by subsection (4)

of  section  121  of the Singapore  (Constitution)

Order  in  Council.  Of the remaining  powers  and

functions  of  the  former Attorney-General,  some

relate  to  his  ministerial  responsibility   for

certain  Government departments, and these  powers

and  functions  have  been taken  over  by  me  as

Minister  for Labour and Law. There are,  however,

certain  powers  and  functions  relating  to  the

conduct  of  civil proceedings and to professional

matters  relating  to  advocates  and  solicitors,

which  can be more appropriately performed by  the

State    Advocate-General.   To   take    a    few

examples - proceedings   under   the   Crown   Suits

Ordinance were formerly brought in in the name  of

the  Attorney-General, and similarly suits against

the  Government were instituted in the name of the

Attorney-General  as defendant. It  is  considered

that  such proceedings should be conducted in  the

name of the State Advocate-General as plaintiff or

defendant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney-General was formerly a Member of the

Rules   Committee  constituted  under  the  Courts

Ordinance, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



it is considered that it would be more appropriate

for  the  State Advocate-General, rather than  the

Minister, to take his place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, petitions under the Advocates and

Solicitors  Ordinance  and the  Divorce  Ordinance

were  required  to  be  served  on  the  Attorney-General,  who could appear on the hearing  of  the

petition. Here, too, it is proposed that the State

Advocate-General should take over the  powers  and

functions of the former Attorney-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<div align="center"><b>MAINTENANCE (FACILITIES FOR ENFORCEMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>8.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill, Sir, is to facilitate

the  enforcement of maintenance orders. Under  the

present  law, if a person neglects to comply  with

an  order of maintenance made by a Court under the

Married    Women    and   Children   (Maintenance)

Ordinance, the Court is given power to direct  the

amount  to  be  levied in the manner provided  for

levying  fines imposed by the Magistrate's  Court,

or  to  sentence the person to imprisonment, which

may extend to one month for each month's allowance

remaining unpaid. The Criminal Procedure Code thus

provides  for a fine to be levied by distress  and

sale  of  the property belonging to the  offender.

But  this provision has remained a dead letter  as

the Criminal District and Magistrate's Courts have

no facilities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



and no officials to levy such distress. The effect

is  that  a  person who refused to comply  with  a

maintenance order can only be sent to prison,  and

in  fact,  in the period 1st of January, 1958,  to

30th  of  June, 1959, 26 persons were so sentenced

to imprisonment by the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a maintenance order made by the

Shariah Court, the position under the present  law

is  that where a person neglects to comply with an

order  of  the  Shariah Court, the  Shariah  Court

itself can do nothing. The aggrieved wife would in

such  a  case have to go to the District Court  to

seek  enforcement  of  the order  of  the  Shariah

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to give power to the Court,

including the Shariah Court, to make an attachment

of  earnings  order, to make it  mandatory  on  an

employer  to  deduct the amount of the maintenance

allowance  from  the  wages  or  other  periodical

payments  made  to the person liable  to  pay  the

maintenance, and to pay such sums into the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "earnings" is comprehensive,

and,  in  short,  this legislation  will  make  it

easier   for   wives   and  children   to   obtain

maintenance due to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>8.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we have paid special  attention

to  this  Bill before it is passed. We  have  come

across  certain  women who have complained  to  us

that  they  have been neglected by their husbands.

They  want  to  seek employment, but  the  present

employment  problem is very serious.  It  is  very

difficult  for  them to find employment.  Even  if

they  can find employment there is nobody to  look

after their children at home. In view of all these

difficulties and inconveniences, we have therefore

decided to pass this Maintenance Bill. The passing

of  this  Bill is of great significance.  On  this

point, I give my full support to this Bill.



<br><br>8.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat (Siglap)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  I wholeheartedly support  the  Bill

moved by the Minister for Labour and Law. We, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



the Government, should introduce this Bill because

this  is  one of the methods to protect women  and

children  who  have  hitherto been  victimised  by

their  own  husbands and fathers  for  the  simple

reason  that  their parents have  neglected  them.

Although  at  the moment the Court  has  power  to

order  the  fathers to pay maintenance  for  their

wives  and children whom they have deserted,  some

of  them have failed to comply with the orders  as

instructed  by  the Court. Therefore,  we  as  the

Government  have made provision in  this  Bill  so

that employers are obliged to deduct the wages  of

the  husbands of these women. Now, the Court  will

know  the wages the husbands are drawing, and  not

as  in  the  past,  where in certain  cases  false

information was given. This serves a good purpose.

If this Bill is put into operation, every employer

will have to pay the maintenance money due by  his

employee direct to the wife or the children by way

of  deduction from his wages. This is  good.  This

will  ensure protection and safeguard for the wife

and  the children. Otherwise, how could the  wives

look  after  the  welfare of their children?  They

will be helpless and will not be able to find  the

means  of  livelihood  to support  themselves  and

their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I wholeheartedly support this Bill.



<br><br>8.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Maintenance Bill

moved   by  the  Minister  for  Labour  and   Law.

Concerning  this  problem of maintenance,  we  can

analyse  the present social institution.  Men  and

women  should be put on an equal footing  both  in

employment and in life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can reflect for a while that in the 140 years

of  colonialism in this country, women  have  been

oppressed. Therefore, whether in family life or in

employment, they have lost their opportunity. When

women  are oppressed in the family, and forced  by

their husbands to get a divorce, an order from the

Court  for  maintenance is not in the interest  of

the women but in the interest of the children. The

order for maintenance is made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



with  a view to looking after the interest of  the

children  and  not of the women themselves.  Their

problem is decided by the Court. But we have  seen

that the husbands who are ordered by the Court  to

pay     maintenance     have     avoided     their

responsibilities. We cannot allow  this  condition

to go on. The Government in its Five-Year Plan has

stated  that it will see to it that women are  put

on  an  equal  footing with men.  But  during  the

transition  period, we have to think of  ways  and

means to maintain their legal position. Under  the

present  circumstances,  they  are  victimised  by

those   persons  who  are  avoiding  their   legal

responsibility towards their family. Therefore,  I

think that the passing of this Bill today is  very

proper, and will solve the maintenance problem.

<br><br>8.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, may I refer you to "The Tasks Ahead", Part 1,

page 12, second paragraph, where the Minister  for

Culture says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of the inevitability of a Malayan nation, we

are  convinced.  Our  concern  is  with  how  this

Malayan is to be brought into being - whether it is

to  be  brought about painlessly and  smoothly  or

whether  it  must  be  attended  by  tragedy   and

suffering,  bitter communal conflicts  and  inter-racial carnage."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no reason why it cannot be brought

into  being  painlessly and  smoothly, especially

when  a  Malayan culture and a Malayan nation  has

already  been  brought into being a hundred  years

ago. But instead of receiving encouragement, there

was  an  attempt  in  the early  20th  century  to

annihilate  it. But the attempt was  not  entirely

successful, for there still exists in Singapore  a

people  called  Peranakans. The  Peranakans,  Sir,

include all the people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



regardless  of their race, born in Singapore,  and

of  all  social standing, from all walks of  life,

who  do not claim allegiance to the land of  their

forefathers,   but   claim  Singapore   as   their

motherland and their homeland. There are  Chinese,

Malay,   Boyanese,  Eurasian,  Indian   and   Arab

Peranakans. As a matter of fact, two nights ago  I

met  some  Arabs.  They were  too  proud  to  call

themselves    Peranakans.    These    non-communal

Peranakans  from the different social  strata  are

indeed  the  sons  of the soil and  have  to  some

degree  been  successful in developing  a  Malayan

language, custom, tradition and culture. They  are

the  people  who,  having adapted  themselves  and

risen  to  meet the needs of Singapore at  a  time

when  the  value of English education was scarcely

recognised, and realising that the prosperity of a

colonially  governed  Singapore  depended  on  the

ability  of  the people to be able to read,  speak

and  write the language of the ruling race, worked

hard    to    equip    themselves    with    those

qualifications, while the others  were  busy  over

their  trading  to make money to  send  abroad  to

their  homeland.  Did  these  wealth-seekers   who

reaped  Singapore's harvests  just  to  send  them

abroad,  help to build Singapore? No.  It  is  the

Peranakans  who, though comprising several  races,

for    various    reasons,   some    because    of

intermarriage,  have  decided  to  make  Singapore

their homeland. It is these people who have rolled

up  their sleeves, Sir, and formed the backbone of

the  civil  service - the civil service,  which  has

brought Singapore to what it is today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to the multi-racial Peranakans that we owe

the  present prosperity of Singapore, not to those

traders  who, far from caring to equip  themselves

with  the  necessary fundamentals for the building

of  a Singapore or Malayan nation or culture, were

draining this island of its wealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a report on the status of women in South-East Asia, published under the joint auspices of

U.N.E.S.C.O. and the Asian Relations Organisation.

It says



<br><br><b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of information. If the hon.

Lady will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> At the end of my speech,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Lady will give way at the

end of her speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> When the tent has folded up!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> "A further major division

exists  between  the China-born whose  ties  (kin,

cultural,  and  probably economic) with  the  home

country   remain  very  strong  and  the  Straits-born - the Malayan Chinese - whose speech, custom  and

outlook  have been more or less deeply conditioned

by  the  South-East Asian environment."  Sir,  the

strength of the ties of the immigrants with  their

home  countries can be seen when they  refused  to

allow  their children to learn either the language

of  the governing race or the national language of

the  island, which is Malay, and insisted on their

being  educated  in the language  and  culture  of

their  home  country.  This  patriotism  to  one's

homeland surely could not have helped towards  the

building of Singapore or a Malayan nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to this attitude, the Peranakans, be

they of Malay, Chinese, Indian or Eurasian origin,

owing  no  allegiance to any other country  except

the   land  of  their  birth - Singapore - went  about

identifying  themselves as the sons of  the  soil,

with  the result that a Malayan nation and culture

was  slowly  and unconsciously brought into  being

during    the   100-odd   years   of   Singapore's

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Peranakans receive any encouragement in

this  nation  building? No.  The  English  schools

knowingly or unknowingly were helping to kill  it.

In  the  early  20th  century, pupils  of  English

schools  were  discouraged  from  speaking   their

mother tongue. In some schools (I happened  to  be

in one of them) the pupils were even fined if they

spoke in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



the  vernacular.  And when they  talked  of  their

customs,  traditions and superstitions especially,

they  were looked upon as queer and even  made  to

look  silly. Eventually, these students learnt  to

accept  the fact that the only language or culture

worth  being proud of is the Western language  and

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy then that in spite of this,

they  have not, as the Prime Minister remarked  in

his  speech at the Union of Journalists  luncheon,

"taken  to the English set of values and  ideals".

When the Prime Minister said "the English-educated

are  divided, almost emasculated as  a  result  of

deculturalisation", I am sure he was not referring

to  the Peranakans, because, in my opinion, all is

not  yet lost with the Peranakans. There are still

traces  and  remnants  of this  Malayan  culture,

although outmoded and ignored today. Those who are

jealous of the privileges that the Peranakans have

earned  through their foresight, their loyalty  to

Singapore and the trouble they have taken to equip

themselves for the position they now hold may deny

that  there was such a Malayan nation and culture.

But even those jealous people cannot deny that the

people  who have in the course of over  100  years

developed a language, literature, drama, songs and

dances,   traditions,  customs,   costumes,   hair

styles, cuisine, games and religion of their  own,

have  the right to claim that they have founded  a

Malayan nation and culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine these claims one by one. Let us

first take up their claim on language.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Mountbatten  will  agree  that  she  is   probably

referring to her notes a bit too much. There is  a

Standing Order which says that a Member shall  not

read his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sorry, Sir! The people of

Kelantan  and Trengganu speak a dialect  different

from  that  spoken  in Johore  or  Singapore.  The

Hokkien in Penang is different from the Hokkien in

Singapore. Therefore, there is no reason  why  the

Peranakans in Singapore should not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



allowed  to speak the dialect of Malay  that  they

now   have  in  Singapore.  If  Hokkien,  Teochew,

Cantonese  and all the different Chinese  dialects

can  be spoken without prejudice to Mandarin being

the  national  language,  then  why  cannot  these

different states-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mandarin is not the national

language.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No, it is the national

Chinese language. Why cannot the different  states

of  Malaya,  Singapore  as well,  have  their  own

dialects  in  Malay - each state  speaking  its  own

Malay  without  prejudice to  the  "Bahasa"  Malay

being  the  national  literary  Malayan  language?

After  all,  this Malay that the Peranakans  speak

has  been  generally accepted by many races.  Many

races  are  speaking  it.  In  fact,  the  Chinese

understand it better than the real Malay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also thought it a strange thing that the English-educated Chinese from

Malaya should find more in common with the English-educated  non-Chinese  in  Malaya  than  with  the

English-educated Chinese from other countries. For

me,  I  do not think there is anything strange  in

that.  I  feel that it is further proof  of  their

loyalty  to Singapore and their sense of a Malayan

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to literature, legends from China

have  been  translated into this Peranakan  Malay.

Bibles  and  hymns  are also  translated  in  this

Malay.  The pantun Peranakan is still very popular

in  Singapore  amongst the Peranakans,  especially

among the Chinese Peranakans, and their poems  and

proverbs  are  also translated  in  the  Peranakan

Malay.  Many  of these proverbs and poems  can  be

traced  back  to Malay literature; a  few  are  of

Chinese origin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for songs and dances, we have already been

told  recently  by  an expert from  Radio  Malaya,

Kuala  Lumpur, that the kronchong was  of  Chinese

and  Indonesian origin and the ronggeng, which  is

very    popular   among   Chinese   and   Eurasian

Peranakans, has a Portuguese origin. Though  in  a

very amateurish fashion, the Peranakans have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



attempted a small operetta called the "Chik Siti".

It  is  very  amateurish, I admit.  But  it  is  a

nucleus  to start with and a foundation  to  build

up.  The  Peranakan songs were very  popular  once

upon a time. In fact, I believe there is a club in

Singapore which tries to keep this culture  alive.

They  meet regularly and they get together to sing

these songs so as to keep them alive. Such efforts

to  keep  the  culture of their forefathers  alive

should, I think, receive encouragement. As for the

drama,  again  I  suppose  the  plays  are  of  an

amateurish  fashion. Yes! But  the  Peranakans  do

have  their Wayang Peranakan which is very popular

amongst  not  only  Chinese  Peranakans  but  also

amongst  very many races. I am sure the Government

would  do  well and would be doing  a  service  to

Malayan culture if they were to try and raise  the

standard  of  what has been going on  rather  than

look  down upon it with contempt, as the  Colonial

Singapore was inclined to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their customs and hair styles here are a classic

example of the Peranakans selecting the best  from

the  different  races and making  it  a  Singapore

fashion.  The sarong is of Malay origin; the  long

dress, not that of today [I am talking of what  we

call  the old fashioned dress which is of  Sumatra

origin and the head-dress] is a copy of one of the

Chinese  hair  styles. These  have  made  such  an

attractive  combination that years  ago  not  only

Chinese  Peranakans but Eurasian and Indian  women

also  wore these costumes. In fact, even today  we

find  Eurasian  and Indian and also  some  Chinese

women  wearing them - very few, but there are  still

some.  And  the  strange  thing  is,  whereas   in

everyday wear the dress is of Malayan origin,  the

headdress  is  of Chinese origin,  in  the  bridal

trousseau,  the grander and richer Chinese  bridal

costume has been adopted, and the hair style which

is  partly of Malayan and partly Indonesian origin

with  a touch of the Siamese in the jewellery worn

on the hair has been selected to go with the grand

Chinese costume of the bride.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for customs, here again is something which is

very  peculiar  and  unique  amongst  the  Chinese

Peranakans,  or as they sometimes term themselves,

"Singaporeans".  To  quote  one  example,   in   a

wedding,  besides  the real  parents,  the  bridal

couple have to have ceremonial parents. The  bride

has  to have a ceremonial mother who has to  be  a

Chinese Singaporean or a Chinese Peranakan  woman,

but the bridegroom has to have a ceremonial father

who  preferably  has to be a  Malay  or  at  least

dressed in Malay traditional costume. This is  out

of date now. Very few people marry in this fashion

now  but  it was the fashion some time ago.  As  I

said,   the  customs  and  traditions   of   these

Peranakans have been looked down upon as something

queer and not something to be proud about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not related all this just to

entertain  the hon. Members of the  House  or  the

gallery-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You want to revive it!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> - but I have made an attempt

to  show  that  the synthetising of  cultures  and

customs  which the Minister for Culture  hopes  to

foster  had  already begun to take  shape  over  a

hundred  years ago, and that it is ideal to  build

on this foundation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is already very late and if I were to

describe some of the Peranakan dishes, they  might

make  us feel hungry. So let it suffice for me  to

say that the Peranakan cuisine, though obviously a

conglomeration of Malayan, Indonesian, Indian  and

Chinese cuisine, is unique in taste and flavour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for religion, here again the non-communal

spirit can be seen. Every ninth month of the year,

the  Chinese Peranakans especially - there are  some

Eurasians  and some Indians too - go to Kusu  Island

and worship the kramat. Now, opposite the building

that houses the kramat is the building that houses

what is called the "Tua Peh Kong" [Laughter]. I do

not  know why there is so much laughter about what

has  been  done for so many years. After  all,  we

should respect the customs of the people of  those

times, especially those of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



our  forefathers. The main fact is that  they  are

non-communal  and  they  worship  in  a   building

housing  a  Malay kramat and also the Chinese  Tua

Peh  Kong.  This is an example of the non-communal

spirit that existed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Straits Times, the Prime Minister,

referring to the English-educated, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, said Mr Lee, they have been most

favourably placed and treated in colonial  Malaya.

The British not unnaturally preferred to deal with

people  who  could  speak their language  and  who

understood their manners and mannerisms. Therefore

the  English  educated have risen to  the  highest

positions both in Government service and in  their

professions."



<br><br>Sir, this is further proof of the intelligence  of

those  people  at that time, who  knew  what  they

needed  to get to those positions. Those were  the

days of the colonial government no doubt, not  the

self-governing  Singapore. The  requirements  then

were   different  from  the  requirements   today.

Nevertheless,  I am confident, Sir,  that  if  the

English-educated  multi-racial   Peranakans   were

given justice, a fair deal and a chance, there  is

no doubt that they will again rise to the occasion

and  adapt themselves to the present situation and

co-operate   with   Government   in   the   social

revolution, as the Prime Minister wanted  them  to

do. The possibility of this has been manifested by

the  remarks  of  the  Prime Minister  of  Malaya,

Tengku  Abdul Rahman, which made headlines in  the

Sunday Mail of 30th August. It says:



<br><br><div align="center">"ENGLISH-EDUCATED PRAISED BY TENGKU"</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They helped me greatly in my job as Premier and

never  gave any trouble. I am sure I can  rely  on

them and with their help and moral support we  can

achieve our aim."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is very little difference between the

English-educated  in  Malaya  and   the   English-educated  in  Singapore, and  I  am  sure  if  the

English-educated in Malaya could be so helpful  to

the  Prime  Minister there, the  English  educated

here can be just as helpful to our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister if they were given a chance.  Much

depends on the Prime Ministers themselves!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Straits Times of 21st August, the Ministry

of Culture was quoted as saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As far as the P.A.P. Government is concerned, it

will  try as far as it is within its power to  see

that a Malayan culture and a Malayan nation emerge

peacefully."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

hon.   Lady  hopes  to  have  a  reply  from   the

Ministerial Benches, because if she does, I  might

remind her that there are only six minutes left.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, a Malayan nation and a

Malayan  culture have already emerged  peacefully.

So peaceful was the emergence that it has not been

noticed by many. It is now up to the Hon. Minister

for   Culture  to  revitalise  and  nurse  it   to

maturity. Even the Deputy Prime Minister advocates

the  use  of  what is already in  existence  as  a

basis, for he was reported in the Straits Times of

23rd August as saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is important that if we wish to make Malay a

popular national language in the shortest possible

time  then  we  should  use  what  is  already  in

existence as a basis."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a basis to work on, Sir, It depends on

whether we want to use it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again in "The Tasks Ahead", page 12, the

Minister for Culture says-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Bible!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I think the Government

should  be proud that their book has been used  so

much  by  the opposition. The fact that  even  the

Opposition makes use of this book shows that it is

useful [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The biggest obstacle in the way of a Malayan

nation today is communalism."



<br><br>And he goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perhaps the major role of the present generation

of politicians will be to stamp out communal fires

before they spread."



<br><br>I agree with him entirely, Sir. But may I add that

stopping communal wars is not sufficient.  I  hope

Government  will  not  tolerate  any  attempt   at

promoting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



class   war,  for  it  is  more  destructive   and

dangerous  than  communal war. If a  communal  war

should  break out in Singapore, we have  religious

leaders  and community leaders to whom the  masses

will  listen,  but should a class war  break  out,

there are no recognised class leaders who will  be

able to influence the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the classes who are not English-educated have

had  a  raw  deal in the past due  to - to  use  the

phrase   of  the  Prime  Minister - "the  historical

situation",  let us pull our weight  together  and

lift them out of this deplorable situation without

embittering them against the others. This  is  the

safest,  surest and quickest method  of  achieving

the  goal  of  a  Malayan  nation  and  a  Malayan

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that what I have said will be

taken in the right spirit. I have no intention  at

all  to  criticise the Government for the sake  of

criticism. I firmly believe that the only  way  an

Opposition of 8 against 43 can serve the public is

to   behave   in   a  sincere,  constructive   and

responsible mariner, giving credit where credit is

due  and  offering constructive criticisms  if  we

feel  that  they are in the paramount interest  of

the people. I fully realise that we can never hope

to  out-vote  the Government and my only  hope  is

that  Government  will  reciprocate  our  sincere,

constructive and responsible behaviour with a fair

and  reasonable attitude, taking our  bouquets  as

our  sincere compliments and our criticisms as our

honest  opinion.  Government need not  necessarily

concur  with  our  opinions but they  should  give

credit  to  the  fact that there  can  be  another

school of thought and that the Opposition although

representing the minority, democracy demands  that

we  be given our chance to express our views which

should be given due consideration. I have no doubt

that  if  the Opposition behaves in a constructive

and  responsible  manner, it would  embarrass  any

democratic government to ignore or treat  it  with

contempt.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering how that

ties in with Malayan culture. We have 1� minutes

left.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I have finished, Sir, I just

wanted  to make it clear that I am not making  all

these  remarks  in the spirit of  criticising  the

Government.



<br><br><b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister, you have just

one and a half minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I am quite

sure  the  hon. Lady from Mountbatten  can  hardly

expect me to reply in one and a half minutes.  But

I have just about enough time to say to her that I

do  not think peranakan is what we like to  be.  I

opened  up the Malay-English dictionary by  R.  O.

Winstedt, who is supposed to be quite an authority

on  these matters. I took this dictionary from the

C.P.A.  Room,  although I must confess  I  am  not

quite  sure whether the notice in the C.P.A.  Room

means  "Do not remove any book from the  room"  or

"Do not remove it from the building". I hope it is

"Do not remove it from the building".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says here - on page 4 - "peranakan" means

"foreigners but locally born", "Jawi peranakan  is

Muslim  Tamils born in Malaya often with  a  Malay

mother."  I  do not know about the latter,  but  I

certainly  object to anybody - and  I  have  already

objected    to    the    Member    for     Kampong

Kembangan - calling us bangsa asing. Bangsa asing or

peranakan - that   is  not  a  matter   which   this

Government accepts with equanimity. We are  Raayat

Malaya.  For  the convenience of ladies  like  the

Member for Mountbatten who teaches English  in  an

English  school,  we  are the  people  of  Malaya,

called Malayan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at fourteen

minutes to Nine o'clock p.m. and the Debate having

continued  for half an hour, Mr Speaker adjourned

the  House without Question put, pursuant  to  the

Standing Order.
