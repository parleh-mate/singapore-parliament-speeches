<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>SLIMMING PILLS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Regulation of importation and sale)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Minister for Health what

are  the  steps  taken  by the Health Sciences  Authority  to

regulate  the importation and sale of slimming pills  and  to

ensure that such drugs are safe for consumption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, synthetic pharmaceuticals for treatment of obesity,  for

which  safety,  quality  and efficacy can  be  scientifically

assessed,  are  regulated as Prescription-Only  Medicines  in

Singapore.    Currently,  we  have  approved   five   Western

synthetic  drugs for treatment of obesity in Singapore.   Due

to  the presence of generics, these five approved drugs  come

in eight brands.  These medicines are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>



effective but can only be prescribed by doctors as  they  may

sometimes have serious side-effects.  Such medicines are used

in   the   short-term  treatment  of  obese  individuals   in

conjunction  with  an  overall  weight-loss  programme  under

medical supervision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All synthetic medicines, commonly known as Western

medicines,  are  stringently  evaluated  by  HSA  for   their

quality,  safety  and efficacy before marketing  approval  is

granted.   After  marketing approval has been granted,  these

products  are  subjected to post-marketing surveillance  that

includes quality compliance testing and Adverse Drug Reaction

monitoring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these synthetic pharmaceuticals, there are a

number  of  other products, ranging from Chinese  proprietary

medicines (CPM) and health supplements to other complementary

or  traditional medicines, which are promoted as being useful

for  weight  reduction.  These claims cannot be evaluated  by

HSA  since rigorous scientific data to validate efficacy  and

benefits are generally not available.  Instead, such products

are  regulated  on  the basis of safety and  quality  of  the

product.  This is a risk-based approach that is in line  with

the  systems  adopted  by regulatory  agencies  in  developed

countries like the US, UK and Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to synthetic pharmaceuticals, traditional and

complementary  medicines  are  generally  considered  to   be

relatively less toxic, because they usually comprise herbs in

low individual concentrations and, in the case of traditional

medicines,  because of long historical usage.   However,  the

manufacturing  processes may result in contamination  of  the

products with toxic heavy metals and micro-organisms, or  the

products may be adulterated with Western medicines.  In  view

of  this,  for CPM, the main group of complementary  medicine

remedies  used  in Singapore, HSA's system is more  stringent

than  that  of  the  US and UK which do not  have  pre-market

assessment of CPM products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, control measures to ensure that CPM meet

appropriate quality



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>



and safety standards comprise the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the licensing of CPM dealers - importers,

wholesalers,  manufacturers  and  re-packers  -   to   ensure

accountability for the safety and quality of their products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, pre-market product assessment to ensure that

products  are  from licensed manufacturers,  sold  freely  in

country  of  origin,  do  not contain  Western  medicines  or

naturally  occurring toxic substances, and that  heavy  toxic

metals,  such  as  mercury, arsenic,  lead  and  copper,  and

microbial counts are within permissible limits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, submission of test reports and written

declaration of the absence of any synthetic drugs or  poisons

as  defined in the Poisons Act by the licensed importers  for

every consignment imported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, approved product labelling in English to clearly

specify the ingredients, indications for use, dosages,  batch

number,  expiry  date and the identity of the  importers  and

manufacturers.  Labels and packages must not stipulate any of

the 19 diseases or conditions specified in the First Schedule

of   the   Medicines  Act,  such  as  cancer,  diabetes   and

hypertension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is any doubt on the documents submitted by

the   applicants,  product  samples  are  tested   by   HSA's

laboratories  to exclude suspected adulterants,  and  analyse

toxic heavy metals and microbial contents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently no licensing requirements for the

import, manufacture and sale of health supplements and  other

traditional  remedies  like Jamu and Ayurvedic  preparations,

but  dealers are required to ensure that the products do  not

contain  any prohibited substances and the toxic heavy  metal

content does not exceed legally permissible limits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HSA also carries out regular post-marketing surveillance

and  runs a quality-testing programme on products sold in the

market to ensure compliance with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>



legal  requirements.  HSA also has an Adverse  Drug  Reaction

(ADR)  Monitoring System to detect any adverse  reactions  of

products used in Singapore, and this is tied to international

ADR networks to pick up early signals and intelligence on any

problems with health products.  Health care professionals are

requested   to   report  suspected  adverse  drug   reactions

encountered  to  HSA so that unsafe products can  be  removed

from the market as and when they surface.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, synthetic pharmaceuticals for weight

loss  can  only  be used under a doctor's supervision.  Where

consumers are considering self-medication with other products

that claim to cause weight loss, they have to be cautious and

discerning  and  exercise care in the selection  and  use  of

these products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HSA will look into how the labelling of complementary

and  alternative medicines can help the public to make better

informed  choices  as to whether to use a health  product  or

not.   HSA  will  also  review  and  refine  regulations  and

guidelines  governing slimming products to ensure safety  for

users.   HSA is developing a regulatory framework for  health

supplements, targeted for implementation in phases from 2003.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

case  of  the Slim 10 product, I understand that the  routine

laboratory  tests discovered the presence of  two  controlled

substances, nicotinamide and fenfluramine, after the  product

had  been put on the market.  My question to the Minister  is

why  can the tests not be conducted before the product is put

on sale and, in the case of Slim 10, why was it allowed to be

sold for five months before any action was taken by HSA?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me go through

the process of how Slim 10 came in. Slim 10 was imported from

China, and for the ingredients declared by the company,  they

claimed that the product contained five common Chinese herbs,

with dosages within those recommended in the official Chinese

pharmacy literature.  So this product was, therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>



classified  as Chinese proprietary medicine.  HSA  had  these

products tested and found that they were indeed based on  the

tea leaves and the Chinese herbs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that basis, they were allowed to come in. Each time

a  consignment comes in, the importer has to declare that the

consignment does not include any of the items in the  Poisons

Act  and  that the product does not have any toxic metals  or

microbial  contents exceeding the legal requirements.   Based

on  those declarations, they were allowed to be sold.   Then,

as  I  have  explained  earlier, HSA runs  the  Adverse  Drug

Reaction  Monitoring System and, based  on  that  system,  in

early April, HSA received reports from doctors about patients

with serious adverse drug reactions.  So HSA went to test the

product from the shelf and discovered that there were  indeed

these  adulterants in these batches.  So HSA took  action  to

withdraw these samples.  That is how the issue became public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to say is that for Chinese proprietary

medicine,  the  procedure is, first,  anybody  who  wants  to

import a Chinese proprietary medicine submits the application

to  HSA  and tells HSA what the product contains.   HSA  will

test  the  product  and  make sure that  the  product  is  as

declared.   On  that basis, HSA will allow it in.   On  every

consignment, the importer will then have a declaration to say

that  the consignment of the product coming in does not  have

any  of the items in the Poisons Act, does not have any heavy

metals or any microbial contents above the legal limits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible for HSA itself to test the items

because, as you can appreciate, the CPM is a very wide  range

and,  therefore, we use the regulatory regime of  making  the

importer declare that whatever they bring in is in accordance

with what they indicate as ingredients, and that they do  not

have  any  of the poisons in the Poisons Act and any  of  the

other toxic heavy metals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, why can the laboratory tests not

be taken when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>



importer submits the declaration at the same time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have explained, this is not a

synthetic  pharmaceutical.  For the  Chinese  medicine,  they

claimed  that these are the ingredients in it.  HSA can  test

that  indeed  these  ingredients are there,  but  it  is  not

possible for HSA to test what else is not there.  We will  be

testing for a lot of things.  We can test for the poisons, we

can test for a few toxic metals, but they could be putting in

a lot of other things, eg, steroids, all kinds of adulterants

in  it.  So it is not possible for HSA to put upon itself the

responsibility  of  testing  what  is  not  declared  by  the

importer, because you do not know what to look for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give another analogy. When I was in charge of

the   Ministry  of  National  Development  and  we   imported

vegetables from Malaysia and we had this problem of pesticide

residue.   We  could impose a very strict regime because  the

number  of known pesticides used is limited and we  can  test

for  the  10 or 15 pesticides and make sure that the  residue

does  not  exceed the level that we set.  Therefore,  we  can

have  a  very  tough system in testing every consignment  for

those  10  or  15 pesticides and make sure that it  does  not

exceed the residue level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we come to Chinese medicine, we do not have a

similar  list of things we can say that you cannot put  these

in  the Chinese medicine.  We can have a list of the poisons,

but  they will be put in steroids and all kinds of stuff, and

they  may put in things which are above the safe dosage.   So

it  will  be  very  difficult for us to  do  tests  on  every

consignment  and  to  test  for  what  is  not  declared   as

ingredients in Chinese medicine.  That is why in  1999,  when

we  were  looking  at  how to regulate Chinese  medicine,  we

decided that it is not possible for the HSA to license  every

product  and  every  consignment.   Therefore,  we  put   the

responsibility on the importer, the wholesaler, to make  sure

that  whatever  they  bring in they  must  declare  that  the

product  they bring in does not have the items in the Poisons

Act,  do  not have heavy metals, and the ingredients  of  the

product are clearly labelled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I ask

the  Minister whether the Ministry has any plans  to  control

other  slimming treatments, such as the use of equipment  for

slimming,  the use of slimming oil and body wraps,  and  also

whether  the Ministry will help CASE to investigate into  all

those complaints on slimming treatment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The whole issue of medical devices is

currently  not  regulated, and we intend to regulate  medical

devices  when we put up legislation towards the end  of  this

year  or  next  year.  So, medical devices and devices  which

claim  to have health benefits, these we intend to put  under

regulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rest, slimming oil, body wrap, these cannot

be  regulated.  If you want to wrap plastic or elastic around

your  waist and claim that you will be slim, there is no  way

we can tell you not to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In helping CASE to look after the products, I am sure we

can work together.  But as I have said, health products cover

a  wide range and when it relates to pharmaceutical products,

the  so-called Western medicine, because these are synthetic,

and chemicals, they pose higher risks.  The HSA's stand is to

regulate this stringently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the spectrum, when it is Chinese

medicine,  because these are herbs and plants, and these  are

traditional  medicine which have been in use for hundreds  of

years  and  proven to be reasonably safe, we have to  take  a

different approach.  Unfortunately, the problem now  is  that

many  people  bring  in Chinese medicine  but  actually  they

adulterate it with Western medicine, and they come  in  under

the  guise of pure Chinese medicine.  This is the middle area

that  we  have  to review and make sure that even  though  we

cannot  regulate the efficacy, we must regulate  for  safety,

and that is the intention that we set out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I was a bit surprised by the

Minister's  answer.   I thought it was  the  job  of  HSA  to

safeguard public confidence in the quality safety and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>



efficacy  of healthcare products.  Is he not aware that  last

year,  there  were  561 cases of people suffering  from  side

effects  from approved medicine which were reported  to  HSA?

Does  that  not  say something about the way HSA  goes  about

doing its work?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, even for Western

medicine,    the   synthetic   pharmaceuticals   which    are

manufactured  by the big pharmaceutical companies  with  very

stringent quality control, which have certificates  for  good

manufacturing  practice and a series of  clinical  tests  and

approved  by the home regulatory body, whether it is  FDA  in

the  US,  etc, even for such drugs, you cannot test  for  the

full  range of adverse drug reactions.  Sometimes, even after

such  a  stringent  process, you do  come  across  unexpected

adverse  drug reactions.  Even for synthetic pharmaceuticals,

you get products being withdrawn because some of these after-effects were not encountered during the clinical trials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is that even at this end of the

spectrum,  where we have such a strict regime, together  with

the   western   countries,  we  also  have  unexpected   drug

reactions,  and through this Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring

System,  we  have  to pull products out.  When  you  look  at

Chinese medicine at the other end of the spectrum, generally,

we   do   not  face  this  problem  because  these  are   low

concentrations which have been used for a long time,  through

historical  and  traditional use,  the  adverse  reaction  is

minimal.  When we come to the middle area, this is where  the

problem arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained just now, we cannot adopt wholesale the

Western medicine approach of regulating it, in line with what

other  countries do.  In the US, for example, when they  come

to   traditional  medicine  or  complementary  medicine,  the

approach  is that you take it at your own risk. FDA does  not

regulate.   If  you  take  traditional  medicine  or  Chinese

medicine, it is entirely at your own risk.  In Singapore,  we

realise  we  cannot  adopt  that hands-off  approach  because

traditional medicine or Chinese medicine has a wide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>



following in Singapore.  Since 1994 and then in 1999, we have

put  in  place  a  system which tries to address  the  unique

characteristics of Chinese proprietary medicine and,  at  the

same time, put in some safeguards.  One of the safeguards, as

explained  earlier,  is when somebody wants  to  bring  in  a

product,  HSA  tests the product and makes sure  that  it  is

qualified  under  Chinese medicine, and not Western  medicine

disguising as Chinese medicine.  Having allowed the  importer

to  bring it in, we make sure that for each consignment,  the

importer declares that whatever he brings in has the  minimum

safety standards of not having poisons or heavy metals in it.

What  happens  in  some of these cases is  that  the  quality

control  in the manufacturing of these products in  China  is

not   tight   and   sometimes,  it  gets  adulterated.    The

laboratories  that  test  these products  are  not  stringent

enough,  so  it  gets through the net.  We are reviewing  the

system.   One of the things that we may consider is  to  only

accredit qualified laboratories to make sure that the testing

is  done by certified laboratories, and not just laboratories

from  different parts of China.  This is one of the  measures

that we are considering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our objective is to ensure safety but if it is

prescription-only medicine, we have a higher level of  safety

because  there are more checks, the doctor is  in  charge  of

prescribing  it, we ensure that the pharmaceutical  companies

which  manufacture them have good manufacturing certificates,

so  there  are  more  stringent checks.   When  it  comes  to

traditional medicine, I am afraid that the regulatory  regime

is  quite different, as practised everywhere else.  There are

a  lot  of grey areas, whether it is medical devices,  health

supplements  or  food products, they are now coming  in  with

different claims.  It is very difficult for us to say that  a

food   product  cannot  be  adulterated.   If  somebody  puts

adulterants  into food products and thinks he  can  get  away

with  it,  unless you go round checking every item and  every

consignment,  there  is  no  way we  can  prevent  that  from

happening.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, it seems

that the present procedure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>



does  not seem to have worked because Slim 10 has got in  and

has  caused  harm to the people.  May I ask three  questions?

Firstly,  could  I ask the Minister to review  the  procedure

whereby  in  the  first instance, although  an  importer  may

declare  certain substances, he will not be so stupid  as  to

declare  disallowed items, so he probably  declares  all  the

allowed items.  Could the Ministry consider asking the HSA to

conduct  limited testing of other disallowed products because

if  the product, for example, is for slimming, they can  test

the limited range of products that are used for such effects,

but  maybe  not allowed for health reasons?  At  least,  that

will help to give better protection to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, after the products are allowed to come in,

when  the products are being sent in by batches, to do  batch

testing of the products.  At least, they are being tested and

monitored regularly by batch testing through the HSA  getting

samples from each batch being imported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is: if deterrence is the way the

Ministry  wants to go about doing it, then what is the  level

of  deterrence we are having now?  For example, what kind  of

penalty  do  we  impose  on  these defaulter  importers,  and

whether this can be reviewed as a procedure?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the

sentiments  of some of the Members here that even though  our

procedures are stricter than in UK or US and about  the  same

as  Australia,  because  of  the widespread  use  of  Chinese

proprietary medicine in Singapore, we ought to re-look at the

procedures  and see how we can tighten this up.  We  are,  in

fact, doing this review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I do not want to give the House the

wrong  impression that whatever we come up, it  is  going  to

ensure  100% safety.  I think we can improve, but it  is  the

nature  of  such products. I have many meetings  with  Health

Ministers  from the region.  When I meet the Health  Minister

from Taiwan or Hong Kong and we discuss the problems we face,

this  is quite a widespread problem in Taiwan and Hong  Kong,

where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>



they  bring in Chinese proprietary medicine.  So, we are  all

grappling with this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, with regard to Mr Leong Horn Kee's

suggestion,  we  will  take this up.  We  do  conduct  random

testing.  HSA does not have the resources to test every batch

and  everything  that  comes in.   But  HSA  will  do  random

testing,  and we indeed do that as part of our post-marketing

surveillance mechanism.  Mr Leong also suggests  that  we  do

batch testing.  We will review that but it means we are going

to  slow down and, in fact, it will affect the trade  and  it

will raise costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bulk of the Chinese medicine that comes in, the

herbs and grasses are fairly innocuous.  They have been  used

for  hundreds of years and they are reasonably safe.  But  if

an  importer wants to adulterate such stuff, then it is  very

hard  for us to prevent them from doing so.  We must  have  a

regime  that  does not penalise the bona fide  importer.   We

cannot treat every importer as a possible crook.  But I agree

with Mr Leong that we must have in place a regime that deters

and  which can ferret out those who are unscrupulous.  As far

as deterrence is concerned, our present Act allows for a two-year  jail  sentence for those who bring in items  which  are

adulterated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I have three questions. First,

if HSA does not have the resources to test everything that is

imported,  can  this  work be done by  private  laboratories?

Second,  in  the  case  of Slim 10,  I  understand  that  the

decision  by HSA to ban Slim 10 was made on 15th April.   Why

was the public informed of the ban through press release only

on  30th April?  Why was there a wait of two weeks?  My  last

question:   is  there a way for HSA to inform the  public  as

soon  as it is possible of dangerous drugs, instead of having

to wait, as in this case, for two weeks?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, this is the

current  regime.   We  try to use the  private  laboratories.

This  importer  came  with  the declaration  from  a  private

laboratory.  We accepted the report of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>



private  laboratory. Now, we are saying that  maybe  not  all

private laboratories can be trusted, and therefore, we  ought

to  have a shorter list of accredited laboratories.  This  is

one of the things that we are thinking of doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the time difference, according to the report given

to  me,  when  HSA first received the report of adverse  drug

reaction,  they went out to the market and picked up  samples

from  different  batches to test.  They  found  nicotinamide,

which  is  a B3 vitamin.  This is not banned, but the  dosage

that was found in this Slim 10 was beyond safe levels.  It is

not a banned item, but it is above the safe dosage.  HSA told

the  importer  to  withdraw  the item  and  the  product  was

withdrawn from retail. HSA also sent out an advisory  to  all

the doctors to say that they have received these adverse drug

reactions and asked for other confirmation from the  doctors.

It  is  after  HSA sent out this advisory that other  doctors

also  sent  in  reports and HSA then suspected that  what  is

adulterated is beyond B3.  From the kind of reports that they

get  from  the  doctors,  they came to  the  conclusion  that

excessive dosage of Vitamin B3 could not have caused some  of

these  reactions.   These  reactions  were  not  just  hyper-thyroidism  but  also,  in some cases,  hepatitis.   So  they

investigated further, and this is where they found traces  of

fenfluramine, and this is where they put up the press release

and   took  action.   HSA  took  action  according   to   the

investigations, because when you bring in these products  and

send  them to the laboratories for testing, the test  results

do not come in immediately.  They take about a few days to  a

week for the test results to come in.  So I have examined the

report and the procedures.  I do not think HSA was laggard in

their  reaction.  I think what they put out was  commensurate

with  the test results, and when they found this banned item,

then  I  think they make it very clear, not only to  withdraw

the product, but also to warn the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I want to pick up the point from the

Minister about the penalty.  It seems that the two-year  jail

penalty  is a bit light for a case when the medicine  brought

in can be very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>



poisonous.  Could the Minister reveal whether this  needs  to

be  reviewed  because if the importer brought  in  substances

that  can  cause not only permanent damage to a  person,  but

even  death to several people, I think the penalty should  be

even more deterrent than just a 2-year jail sentence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> HSA is still in the process of

investigating and the 2-year jail deterrent is under the Act,

for  the  violation of the Poisons Act.  If the  consequences

are more serious, HSA will consult AG's Chambers to see under

what other Act we can pursue the importer, which will carry a

heavier penalty.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether there is

any  watchdog  body that scrutinises the efficacy  claims  by

drug  distributors  on  over-the-counter  drugs  and  Chinese

medicine?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The answer is "No". To be able to

evaluate  the  efficacy  claims,  if  you  want  to   do   so

scientifically,  then  you must have  the  whole  process  of

evidence-based   medicine,  you  must  have  proper   trials.

Unfortunately,  for  some of these products,  whether  it  is

supplements, or natural products, or herbs, they do not  have

this  kind  of  records.  So there is no way we can  evaluate

such  items  for efficacy claims.  That is why we state  very

clearly  that  for  such products, our primary  objective  is

safety.   And,  where  the rules for  safety  are  not  tight

enough,  I  can  assure the House that we will tighten  them.

But  there  is  no  way we can evaluate, or  justify  to  the

public, the evaluation of efficacy claims.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head T of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Dr Teo Ho Pin].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br>1.05 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, my time has been slimmed down considerably,

so I will get straight to the point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, Dr Teo Ho Pin raised his concern about

promoting family members' desire to stay together.   I  agree

that it is a very laudable objective.  That is the reason why

HDB  gives higher housing grants for couples who want to  buy

resale  flats near their parents.  Also, I think  he  may  be

aware  that in our balloting exercise for new flats in mature

estates, we give a higher weightage to these couples so  that

they  have a higher probability of success.  So, as a  result

of  these pro-family measures, HDB estimates that around  40%

of  HDB residents with married children live with the married

children,  or within the same estate.  This is based  on  the

findings of a survey that HDB did a few years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of shorter tenures, I think Dr Michael

Lim,  as  well  as  Dr  Amy Khor, raised the  possibility  of

shorter tenures for HDB flats so as to enhance affordability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to make on this is that

even  with  99-year leases, currently HDB flats  are  already

affordable.  As Members may recall last Saturday I cited  the

fact that the typical four-and-five room flat applicants last

year  needed to use only about 15% of their household incomes

for   their   monthly  mortgages.   That   attests   to   the

affordability  of flats currently even on 99-year  lease,  so

there is really no need for us to introduce shorter leases on

the  basis  of affordability.  But we do have shorter  leases

for  specific purposes.  For example, we have 30-year  leases

for  studio  apartments for the elderly.  So the question  is

whether we want to expand this to other flat types.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the fundamental objectives of our housing policy

is, of course, home



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>



ownership.  Should we shorten the lease period significantly,

as  some  Members  have suggested, this would  actually  make

housing a consumption item, rather than investment.   So  how

different  would  that  then be,  for  example,  from  rental

housing?  Would that not run counter to our objective of home

ownership?   And,  of course, there is also the  question  of

acceptability.   Will  such  short  tenured  HDB   flats   be

acceptable  to members of the public?  So these are  some  of

the  issues that we would need to consider, if we  are  going

for shorter tenures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few Members have also highlighted the issue of

the  housing  needs  of the singles - Mr Ang  Mong  Seng,  Ms

Indranee,  Dr Michael Lim, among others.  Sir, let me  remind

Members  of  the  House,  that public housing  is  subsidised

housing.   So the subsidies have to be justified  because  it

promotes  some  social objectives.  And, in  this  case,  the

social  objectives  in question would  be  the  promotion  of

social  cohesion and family values.  And that is  the  reason

why public housing comes with many rules and regulations,  as

some  Members have pointed out.  We, of course, try  to  keep

such  rules down to the minimum.  But even then I must  admit

that  the  rules are quite bewildering, even for me.   But  I

would like to assure the House that such rules are necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the question of housing for singles,

let  me state upfront that our public housing policy is  pro-family  in  orientation, and this is to  support  our  social

objective of promoting family formation and bonding.  But, at

the  same  time, we also recognise that single citizens  have

housing needs, and that they have made valuable contributions

to  our  society and to our economy.  And that is the  reason

why  we  have reviewed the rules and we have allowed singles,

age 35 and above, to buy 3-room resale flats, on their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to Ms Indranee's claim that they are not

eligible for subsidised housing, in fact, they are.   Singles

can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>



apply  for a housing grant of $11,000, if they buy  a  resale

flat.   And,  if they combine with another single  to  buy  a

resale  flat  jointly, the grant is double,  it  goes  up  to

$22,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the minimum age of 35? We have to have a cut-off,

to  be  consistent with our pro-family approach.  We  do  not

want  to  inadvertently encourage singles to live  away  from

their  parents at too early an age.  So we checked with other

agencies, and the advice was that marriage rates for  singles

tend  to be much lower after this age, and this is the reason

why we chose 35 years as the cut-off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are they eligible only for 3-room flats and not

larger  ones?  Sir, anyone who is familiar with a 3-room  HDB

flat, which has got 2 bedrooms, about 70 square metres, would

agree with me that this should be more than adequate for  the

housing needs of a single person, particularly in land-scarce

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also suggested allowing singles to rent HDB

flats on their own.  Our current policy on this is to reserve

HDB's  heavily  subsidised rental housing  for  lower  income

families who cannot afford home ownership.  There is always a

certain  segment of the population who will never be able  to

own  their  own homes, and for them, they will  have  heavily

subsidised  rental housing.  We do not encourage  singles  to

rent  HDB  flats on their own, partly because of the  limited

stock  of such rental flats, but mainly because we want  them

to  look  first to their family for support.  We do not  want

them to look to the State in the first instance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has suggested that we build HDB flats

purely for singles to encourage social interaction.  Is  that

correct?   That  was what I think I heard him  saying.   Sir,

many  Members of this House have actually asked  the  HDB  to

review its roles.  Some have said that HDB is actually  doing

too  much  and it should be doing less.  Sir, even  while  we

review the role of HDB, I can categorically say that HDB will

not  take  on  this role of providing more opportunities  for

singles to meet.  I think there are many other agencies and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>



many other organisations which are much better placed to play

such a role, organisations like SDU, SDS, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me take up a point which Ms Indranee and others

have  raised, and that is that it is difficult  to  obtain  a

waiver  of policy from HDB.  Let me state at the outset  that

policies  are  set  by  the  Government,  and  HDB   is   the

implementing agency.  The rules and regulations  are  put  in

place  to  support existing policies, and for  good  reasons.

Nevertheless, as with all rules, there are always gray  areas

at  the  margin,  and  this is the reason  why  we  have  got

mechanisms  in  place  which  will  allow  HDB  to   exercise

judgement and discretion on a case by case basis.  Exceptions

to  the  rule do take place.  Camels do get through, quite  a

few of them, in fact, and big ones too.  But they are not the

norm,  I must admit.  In fact, there are not as many as maybe

Members  of  this  House  would like,  and  it  must  be  so.

Because, if there were too many camels getting through,  then

surely there is something wrong with the policy in the  first

place, in which case, we should review the policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, policies are not cast in stone. Members recall

that  the  housing policy for singles, in fact, was  revised,

and reviewed, only last year, whereby we allowed the purchase

of  3-room  resale  flats in all estates,  not  just  in  the

suburban  estates.   This, I believe, has been  very  popular

with the singles.  We will continue to review and refine  our

policies, when necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MPs sometimes raise specific cases in the House, on

behalf  of their constituents, and to illustrate their point.

There  is  nothing wrong with that.  In fact, that is  to  be

encouraged  because  they are doing their  job.   However,  I

would  like to point out that sometimes, there is often  more

to each case than what MPs are told.  And it is only when HDB

interviews  their residents, to see how it can  assist  them,

that all the facts surfaced.  So, my advice is, do not listen

to one side of the story before you make up your mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go on to the other issues that were

raised, particularly the one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>



about  the review of public housing.  This is a matter  which

many  Members have raised, and I would like to take some time

to touch on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget landscape for the Government in the

future  will  not be the same as before.  Our public  housing

expenditure  would  have  to adjust  according  to  what  the

Government  can  afford.  In the past five  years,  we  spent

about 1.1% of our GDP, or more than $1.5 billion annually  on

public  housing.   This includes things like  the  subsidised

flat  prices, the housing grants, upgrading and so on -  1.1%

of  GDP, which is considerable.  In the future, we will  have

to be more prudent and more efficient in the way we spend the

public housing budget.  For a start, we have already embarked

on  a review of the way our public housing budget is managed.

We will be looking at all options pertaining to the financing

of  HDB flats, taking into account, amongst other things, our

budgetary and financial position.  We are also reviewing  the

roles  and functions of HDB, in particular, its role  in  the

development  of  public  flats.  HDB has  been  spectacularly

successful  in  building  affordable  public  housing.    The

expertise,  the experience, and the achievements  of  HDB  in

this area, have won world-wide recognition.  For example,  in

1991  it was conferred the World Habitat Award for developing

Tampines  Town, and my residents are extremely pleased  about

that.   This  was  done  against strong  contenders  such  as

Vancouver and Boston.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, property development is a much more

mature  industry.  And recognising this, HDB  has,  over  the

years,  been  gradually  increasing the  involvement  of  the

private sector through, eg, its premium apartments.   We  can

further increase private sector involvement to enable  us  to

respond faster and better to changing needs, and the changing

preferences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a first step, we are looking into the feasibility of

corporatising HDB's Building and Development Division  (BDD).

Since the inception of HDB 40 years ago, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>



Building and Development Division has accumulated a wealth of

experience  in the design and development of HDB  flats.   It

has  gathered considerable expertise in various  areas,  from

surveying  to  architectural  design,  from  engineering   to

project management.  It is especially strong in comprehensive

township development.  All the HDB estates  -  the new  towns

- have  been conceptualised and drawn up in the drawing rooms

of  the BDD in HDB..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND and HDB are currently studying the implications of

such  a  corporatised BDD.  A key consideration is to  ensure

that  corporatisation does not bring about any adverse impact

on the delivery of our public housing programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of corporatisation include giving them the

autonomy and flexibility to build on their current strengths,

to  venture  overseas  and to establish  an  external  market

leveraging  on  the HDB brand name.  It will enable  them  to

unlock  their value and potential, because they have a  skill

and  track  record  that few organisations around  the  world

have.    At  the  same  time,  the  public  housing  building

programme  can  be  gradually opened  up  to  private  sector

developers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the outcome of the review, let me reassure

Members that there will be minimal impact on the public.   We

would  ensure  that  the fundamentals of public  housing  are

preserved.  Singaporeans will continue to enjoy high  quality

housing at affordable prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would like to assure Mr Othman Haron

and  Mr  Iswaran that the Government appreciates the valuable

contribution  of  HDB's staff.  They  have  given  loyal  and

sterling  service to HDB and the public, and their  interests

will be looked after in the review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have announced some changes to our public housing

policies  and programmes.  I have also outlined some  of  the

key  areas that MND will be addressing and the considerations

that we will bear in mind.  We will weigh the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>



options before us carefully, keeping in mind the impact  that

fundamental  changes in public housing policy  will  have  on

Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,

the HDB introduced lift upgrading in the last few years as  a

special   upgrading  work  that  will  benefit  only  certain

residents in HDB flats.  These residents are required to  co-pay  part  of the lift upgrading cost.  Yet, as I  understand

it,  in  the  sales and purchase agreement that lessees  sign

with  the  HDB, it is clearly stated that any external  works

to be done outside the flat at the block will be borne solely

by  the HDB.  Lift upgrading is clearly external works.   Can

the  Minister  kindly  explain if it is violating  a  legally

signed contract by demanding that the affected residents  co-pay for the upgrading works?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan Cheng Bock is not here. Mdm

Halimah.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, I am indeed very glad

to hear the Minister say that there are no policies which are

cast  in  stone;  therefore, implying that  policies  can  be

revisited.  Most certainly, there is one policy which I  hope

that  the  Minister  will revisit, and that  is  the  current

policy  of  the HDB of not installing lifts in  4-storey  HDB

flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the flat dwellers purchased these flats 15 or

more  years ago, they were much younger.  There was a  spring

in  their  step.   They were definitely much more  nimble  in

running up and down four storeys of the HDB flats.  But  now,

after  many  years, there is less of a spring in their  step,

the  knees  are  getting a bit wobbly,  and  I  think  it  is

extremely  difficult  for  them to  climb  up  and  down  the

staircase,  particularly  for  the  women  who  have  to   go

marketing in the mornings.  They have to carry heavy  baskets

and  climb  up  the  staircase; it can be quite  a  difficult

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really hope that the Minister will revisit this

particular  policy, taking into account  the  fact  that  the

population has aged considerably.  I also hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>



in  his  reply,  the  Minister will not  just  cite  economic

arguments, but will also look into the social aspects of  the

issue that I have mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a related issue, which was raised by two of my

colleagues,  Mr  Othman  Haron  Eusofe  and  Mr  Iswaran,  on

Saturday, the Minister had kindly given a very good assurance

in  this House that the restructuring efforts in HDB will not

affect  the interest of the workers.  I am very glad to  hear

that.   I  am  also happy to inform the House  that  the  HDB

management is in close contact with HDB staff union and  NTUC

on  this  matter.  And I am very glad to say that it is  none

other  than  the  Minister himself  who  had  instructed  the

management to work closely with the union on this issue. As a

labour  MP, I appreciate his concern and I am confident  that

with  his personal interest in the issue, we will be able  to

face changes without much disruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the information of the House, in our

discussions  with  the  Board,  the  NTUC  has  conveyed  the

following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the need for adequate notice to prepare workers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, effective communication to ensure that everyone

understands the rationale and basis for the change,  and  how

it affects them; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, appropriate assistance must be given to workers

who  are  affected,  particularly  in  relation  to  training

programmes for the affected staff.  In this regard, the  NTUC

Skills  Development  Department is currently  working  out  a

programme  with  the  management to  put  staff  on  training

programmes.   So, I am very glad to say that we  are  working

very closely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to my first point, I would appreciate a

response from the Minister.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>



overtaken  covered  linkways  as  the  single  most   coveted

upgrading item by residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I visit my residents, the question of when

there  will be lifts at every floor inevitably crops  up.   A

resident  who has a wheelchair-bound father asked if  we  can

speed  up  this programme, so that it will be more convenient

to  bring his stroke stricken father out.  Many other elderly

residents also appealed for the lifts to be upgraded, so that

they stop at every floor.  Arthritis and rheumatism have made

it increasingly difficult for them to climb stairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, we have a fast-ageing population, and

facilities which enhance mobility and accessibility, such  as

lifts  stopping  at  every floor, are not only  welcomed  but

indispensable.  Such facilities are also much needed  by  the

handicapped whose interest sometimes we tend to overlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of my precincts in Hong Kah North was fortunate

to  have  been  selected  last year for  the  lift  upgrading

programme.   All the residents in this precinct  are  eagerly

awaiting  their  new lift system, except those  in  the  four

blocks of 4-storey walk-up flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first question to the Minister relates to the 4-storey blocks of walk-up flats which have been excluded from

this  programme because, I am told, they are very costly  and

too  few  residents benefit from this, compared to the  high-rise blocks.  My question to the Minister is: what medium and

long-term plans does the Ministry have for these flats?  This

is  because  residents living in such blocks  have  expressed

their  concern regarding the lack of lifts.  Some, especially

those living on the top floors, say that they are thinking of

moving out.  In fact, during my block visits, I noticed  that

some flats have been vacated, and I was informed by residents

that  the  flats have been empty for some time.   Sir,  I  am

worried  that,  over time, these blocks of flats  may  become

urban slums when the residents move to other flats with lifts

stopping on every floor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within the Bukit Batok division of my Hong Kah

North  constituency alone, I have a total of 30 blocks of  4-storey  walk-up  flats with 603 units.   Many  older  estates

would  have  such  blocks of walk-up flats interspersed  with

high-rise blocks, and would suffer the same fate with  regard

to the lift upgrading programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to seriously look

into  and  resolve this issue with a definitive plan soonest.

Although  it  may  be costly to provide such  lifts  to  such

blocks,  the Ministry could look at providing, say, only  one

set of lifts and using a cheaper lift system for such blocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also submit that since these residents have been

paying the same conservancy charges as similar sized flats in

high-rise  blocks  all  these  years,  they  should  also  be

entitled to the same upgraded facilities. Alternatively,  the

Ministry could look into selective en-bloc redevelopment  for

these  blocks as clearly, over time, such flats  will  become

increasingly unattractive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Sir, I would also like to request that the

Minister   consider  giving  the  lift  upgrading   programme

priority  over  the general interim upgrading  programme,  as

having  accessibility  and mobility with  lifts  stopping  on

every  floor appears to rank highest on the wish list of  HDB

residents in the older estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with

the launch of the Interim Upgrading Programme, the Government

is  also  considering  upgrading lifts  and  installation  of

lifts  to  blocks  of flats which have no  lifts.   This  has

received   very   popular  response   from   the   residents,

particularly  the aged residents.  During  my  visit  to  the

residents,  many  of  them said to me  in  Teochew  that  our

Government  and  Ministers are very good.  They  said,  "They

understand our problem and they have installed lifts for  us.

This  is  very  good.  I will vote for them."  This  response

shows  that installation of lifts is very important to  them,

particularly to the elderly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has also installed lifts to three blocks of 4-storey apartments. These blocks are among the first to be

installed  with lifts, and the residents are very happy  with

the  lifts.   They  were  very happy  when  I  visited  them,

particularly  the  old folks.  However, under  the  new  Lift

Upgrading  Programme, the 4-storey blocks are  not  included.

Two of my parliamentary colleagues have raised concerns about

this  matter.  I think this is a very important  issue  where

the residents are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the installation of lifts, why is the cost so high?

In  Bukit  Gombak,  there  is a practical  example.   When  I

appealed for the installation of lifts, they said that  there

must  be at least 60 units in the block before they could  be

considered  under this scheme.  Under the prevailing  policy,

ie,  linkways  have  to  be built to link  the  three  blocks

together and this costs a lot.  However, if there are  common

corridors,  these linkways need not be built,  and  we  could

save two-thirds of the cost.  For high-rise flats, so long as

there  are  20 units, they qualify for lifts to be installed.

Why  is  the  standard different for 4-storey blocks?   Also,

there  may be other considerations if the Government  is  not

willing  to  install lifts for 4-storey blocks.  There  could

also  be redevelopment plans for the block of flats.  If this

were  so,  we  should announce well in advance  so  that  the

residents can decide whether to move out or to stay on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Government will look into this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, like several of the

preceding speakers, I want to raise a plea on behalf of those

who  have,  as Mdm Halimah Yacob put it, lost the  spring  in

their  stride.   It  makes  me  wonder  whether  there  is  a

statutory board they can turn to for help!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has pointed out, quite accurately,

that  we  have a financial constraint going forward,  and  we

need  to  ensure that the dollar we spend is spent well.   In

that  regard, I want to raise two points for the Minister  to

consider.  The first is whether we can indeed prioritise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>



the  Lift  Upgrading  Programme over  the  Interim  Upgrading

Programme.   Because,  essentially,  the  Interim   Upgrading

Programme has lift upgrading plus covered linkways, and  then

an assortment of other general municipal works, many of which

can  be  undertaken  by Town Councils on a progressive  basis

from money they generate through the S&C charges.  That being

the  case, the big ticket item is the lift upgrading, and  it

is  also  one  that  is  heavily sought.   The  Minister  has

overseen the study on the ageing situation in Singapore,  and

he is well aware of the pressing needs on behalf of those who

are  getting on in age, and they need this facility, in terms

of the lift stopping on every floor.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is whether the programme can be

accelerated.   In other words, quite apart from  prioritising

it  over the IUP, whether we can, in fact, allocate even more

resources to ensure that more flats benefit from this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is of scant consolation to a 65-year old to say

that the lift upgrading programme is a 10-year programme  and

it will come to his flat or block in the fullness of time.  I

hope the Minister can consider this request.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, where I come

from,  Eunos  in  Aljunied GRC, we  have  a  relatively  high

percentage of senior citizens.  Eunos is a relatively old HDB

estate.   However, I am sure I speak for other similarly  old

estates  and older flats built before 1990 where we  did  not

have lifts on every floor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand why HDB did not build the older flats with

lifts on every floor, as the priority then was to build flats

fast  and  cheap.  But now, when that generation of residents

has  grown older and some aged, this consideration for  lifts

on every floor is now more urgent, especially when we want to

ensure  that more of the elderly continue to play  an  active

part in our lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Eunos, only one block of those flats built before

1990 has been given a Lift



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>



Upgrading  Programme  (LUP) programme.   There  are  64  more

others  waiting.   Every visit I make  to  the  older  flats,

invariably,  I get this question asked: when do  we  get  our

LUP?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that there are 4,000 such flats in Singapore

awaiting  LUP, and during these days of downturn and expected

slow   GDP   growth,  MUP/IUP/LUP  could  be  far  from   the

Government's priority.  But can the Minister indicate when we

can  expect  LUP  for  more of the older estates  and  flats,

including those at Eunos?  I urge the Government to  expedite

the process, as soon as we are ready to LUP.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it is evident from the Members'

comments  that  upgrading is very popular, particularly  lift

upgrading.   But let me point out that upgrading in  general,

whether  it  is  Main  Upgrading or Lift Upgrading,  is  very

expensive and very heavily subsidised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to make the best use of the limited budget that we

have for upgrading, MND has to constantly review the scope of

these upgrading programmes in order to make sure that we  can

bring these programmes to as many residents as possible,  and

also to provide improvement items which residents value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we introduced the Lift Upgrading Programme

(LUP),  and  this is to allow lifts to be provided  on  every

floor,  where feasible.  The feedback has been very  positive

and I can understand why, because it does fulfil a real need,

particularly  for  those who have lost the  spring  in  their

steps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me also stress that the Lift Upgrading

Programme, which we introduced last year, does require a  lot

of  resources.  Mr Steve Chia asked why residents have to co-pay.   It is precisely for this reason.  It is a very heavily

subsidised  programme.   The number  of  blocks  which  still

requires  lifts on very floor numbers something  like  4,000.

This is not inconsiderable.  And he must appreciate, and I am

sure every other Member here must appreciate, that, given the

limited resources that are available for upgrading,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>



there  must be a certain level of priority.  I think Mr  Chia

wants to say something.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I want to clarify. I

understand that it is very expensive and that maybe there  is

a need to co-pay.  I appreciate that the residents have to co-pay,  but  I  am  asking  whether the Ministry  did  actually

violate a legally signed contract in this case.  What is  the

Minister  going to do about this violation of a contract,  if

there is a violation of contract?  That is my main concern.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The short answer is there is no

violation of any contract.  He can rest assured of that.   Of

course, external works which are of a general benefit to  the

residents, Government will subsidise, and residents will have

to  co-pay.  In the case of lift upgrading, it is  even  more

clear  that the benefit is to the residents, and this is  the

reason why we have asked them to co-pay.  That has been  made

clear  to  residents.   I think it is well  accepted  by  our

residents.   In fact, all the precincts that have polled  for

the  Lift Upgrading Programme have given us full support  for

this  programme.   So, it is well understood.   It  does  not

violate  any  legal contract whatsoever.  That much  I  would

like to assure Mr Steve Chia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with the lift upgrading, of course, there

is  the  Interim Upgrading Programme which preceded the  Lift

Upgrading  Programme.  What the Interim  Upgrading  Programme

does is to provide some kind of upgrading works for precincts

which  are not yet eligible for the main upgrading.   Interim

upgrading centres more on block and precinct works.  But  all

Members  who  have spoken have expressed a  desire  for  more

resources and more priority to be given to lift upgrading.  I

do  share that sentiment.  Within the resources that we  have

available,  we  will  try  to do so.   For  that  reason,  my

Ministry  has  decided to combine the IUP and Lift  Upgrading

Programme (LUP) into a new programme which we will call  "IUP

Plus".  What IUP Plus does is that it will bring IUP and  LUP

works  together at the same time to residents.  It  would  be

offered to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>



residents  at the same time.  It will be carried out  at  the

same  time,  so  that we would no longer  have  to  have  two

separate  programmes,  one interim  upgrading  and  one  lift

upgrading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By combining these two programmes into one, hopefully,

we  will  enable more flat owners to have the lift  upgrading

works  done  earlier.   At  the same  time,  they  will  also

continue to enjoy interim upgrading works which will be  done

at  the  block and the precinct level, including things  like

linkways,  etc, which, I think Members also agree,  are  well

appreciated by residents.  So, we will try and have the  best

of both worlds, as it were.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 138,000 flats, which were built between 1981

and 1986, will qualify for this new programme.  There will be

no  change  in the polling and co-payment arrangements.   HDB

flat  owners,  who  will  stand  to  benefit  from  the  lift

upgrading  works, will be required to poll and pay  for  such

works  under  the  IUP  Plus.  As for the  interim  upgrading

works, it will continue to be fully funded by Government, and

no  polling  is required.  IUP Plus will be introduced  later

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Lift Upgrading Programme itself will

continue  to be available for all high-rise blocks which  are

not  eligible  for the interim upgrading type  of  works,  in

other words, a separate LUP programme for those which are not

eligible  for this IUP Plus.  These will be flats  that  were

built  after  1986  or flats that were  in  the  earlier  IUP

batches  which did not enjoy lifts stopping on  every  floor.

So  those that have already been done are still eligible, and

they can be nominated as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quite a few Members have touched on the issue of

lift  upgrading for low-rise 4-storey blocks.  Again, I  must

explain   to   Members  that  there  is  a  real   need   for

prioritisation.  We do not have unlimited funds.   Given  the

circumstances,  we  need  to see  where  the  Lift  Upgrading

Programme can give more value and more benefits to residents.

The  Lift  Upgrading Programme was introduced last year.   We

still have about 4,000 high-rise blocks, as I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>



said  earlier, which do not have lifts on every floor.   Lift

Upgrading  for  high-rise blocks will benefit more  residents

than low-rise blocks.  Furthermore, the provision of lifts to

low-rise  blocks is expensive, as Mr Ang Mong Seng  realised,

and I think he has cited some figures.  But if there are low-rise   blocks  with  redevelopment  potential,  as   Mr   Ang

mentioned,  we  will  certainly  consider  them  for  en-bloc

redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come now to the Main Upgrading Programme. To

provide  better  value  for money under  the  MUP,  MND  will

concentrate  on  providing improvement  items  which  are  of

tangible benefit to HDB flat owners.  What we are going to do

is  to  classify  the upgrading improvement  works  into  two

categories - the "core" and "non-core" categories.  HDB  flat

owners,  through  the MUP Working Committee,  will  be  given

greater  flexibility in choosing the works which  they  value

most.  When I talk about core items, I am referring to things

like  upgrading of toilets, covered linkways, etc, which  are

very  well  appreciated by residents.   Certain  items,  like

toilet upgrading, will be enhanced to include the replacement

of  wash  basins.  As for non-core items, the  list  will  be

expanded to include, for instance, the replacement of  refuse

hopper.  Again, this is based on feedback from MPs where some

flat  owners have suggested that we include this item as part

of the MUP.  But we will put this under the non-core category

because not everybody would like to have it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the revisions I have just highlighted reflect the

feedback, as I said, from MPs as well as from residents,  but

also  from  our  own experience with past MUP projects.   The

changes will give us value for money and optimise the use  of

our  upgrading  resources.  I am pleased  to  inform  Members

that,  despite the economic downturn, the Government will  be

able  to sustain the same pace of upgrading this year  as  we

had done for the last five years.  In terms of the number  of

precincts,  we are going to announce the number of  precincts

later.   But  the number of precincts for this year  will  be

similar to the number of precincts for the last few years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government remains committed to upgrading. We

are  facing  quite  significant changes  in  our  social  and

economic landscape.  So, we will have to review our upgrading

programme  continuously,  taking into  account  our  economic

performance.  The Government's financial position  will  also

have  to  be taken into account.  Of course, as Members  will

realise, we will also need to look at the competing needs for

funds   and   other  priority  areas,  like  healthcare   and

education.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, in the

Minister's reply earlier, he said that the housing policy  is

pro-family.  Many singles are pro-family and indeed take care

of  their  aged parents almost single-handedly.   Often,  the

parent, usually the mother, is the co-owner of the flat  with

a  single.   But  when the parent passes  away,  a  traumatic

experience in itself, the single finds herself or himself ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Ng, are you making a speech or are

you asking a clarification?



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> No. It is a clarification.

The  single is faced with the possibility of losing the flat,

unless she can find another single to share the flat.  But it

is  not  because the single is not pro-family that she  finds

herself  without  a  mother or a father.   Can  the  Minister

consider  reviewing this policy?  In fact, many singles  tell

me  that  HDB has been quite compassionate in their  appeals.

But   I  thought  if  it  can  remove  the  uncertainty,  and

reconsider this policy, it would be good.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think that is another question. Mr

Mah, you do not have to answer it.  Mr Iswaran.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification from the

Minister?  The IUP Plus initiative is in addition to the  $43

million  Lift  Upgrading  Programme  that  has  already  been

indicated  in the Budget book for the coming financial  year.

My main concern is whether the LUP will cover more flats as a

result   of  this  initiative,  or  whether  it  is  just   a

redistribution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> It is partly a review of both the LUP

and the IUP programmes.  By



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>



combining  these, we hope that we will be able to get  better

value for money and therefore more flats will be eligible for

lift upgrading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, before I come to my next

cut,  can  I ask a clarification from the Minister?   On  the

limited  resources  that we have, and  he  said  that  he  is

lumping  together LUP with IUP, in terms of priority,  should

we not be giving more resources to LUP first, because IUP can

wait?  LUP is more urgent because of the senior citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, what we will do is that we will

have  a  total  block budget for lift upgrading  and  interim

upgrading,  but we will combine the two into  one.   In  this

way, we will be sharing some of the overheads, etc.  This  is

what  I  mean by getting value for money.  In the process  of

doing so, I expect that there will be more opportunities  for

lift   upgrading  to  be  done.   Of  course,  in  terms   of

prioritisation, specifically which blocks will get it  first,

this  is  ultimately  left to the Members  to  recommend  and

nominate to the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind Members that when asking for

clarification, you may ask the Minister something  which  you

do  not understand or something you want to be clarified, but

not  to raise a new question.  I do not want to let too  many

camels in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> I thought that was a

clarification I was seeking.  My next cut is on economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>



downturn  and home ownership.  Much of what I wanted  to  ask

has  been  answered in the Question for Oral Answer and  also

the new policy of HDB.  But I just like to add one more point

and,  that is, I agree with the Minister that, sometimes,  at

MPS,  we do get all kinds of sad stories and they may not  be

the  complete stories.  But I would like to urge the Minister

to  take  MPS  cases seriously and we have more than  80  MPS

cases  and  feedback  from  MPS  cases  would  serve  as   an

indication about the kind of problems faced by residents, the

kind  of  policy  changes that are needed.  In  the  case  of

downturn  and  home ownership, it is not  just  a  matter  of

rescheduling  payments  but also people  who  are  asking  to

change, in terms of application for flats, from 5-room to  4-room,  4-room  to 3-room.  I would like to get  clarification

from  the Minister whether the new policy in fact would  take

care of that kind of problem without much penalty being faced

by the residents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min is not moving. Mdm Ho

Geok Choo.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, in the last few

days,  many  cries  were heard of need to  do  more  for  the

jobless.  Suggestions ranged from rebates to training to  job

placements.   We all know too well that, for some,  the  jobs

lost  are  gone  forever.   We are  not  just  battling  with

structural unemployment.  Increasingly, we will be faced with

under-employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the fact that there are a number of our

people  who  have been displaced by the current recession,  I

feel  it is necessary to help some of them to tide over their

temporary   difficulties   by   providing   them   with   the

opportunities  to  earn some income in the informal  economy.

Despite  the  proliferation of national efforts  expended  to

train  and  retrain displaced personnel, we have  to  contend

with the fact that there are pockets of our workforce who are

not  trainable and therefore not employable, and pockets  who

despite being trained are not able to find jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I understand from the ground and from my

experience  at the MPS, many displaced employees  attempt  to

try another means of living.  Many have applied to be hawkers

and  canteen operators, but since the number of stalls in our

hawker centres and schools is necessarily limited, they  find

themselves  waiting  a  long time for their  licences  to  be

granted,  only  to find out that they may not get  a  licence

after all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was this Malay single mother who came crying with

four  young children to see me over her plight.  She has been

seeing  me  in the last six months and earlier my predecessor

for not less than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>



six months, so I was told.  She could not go on living on the

charity of MUIS, public assistance and the EDRS, so she said.

She has only Secondary Two education and finds difficulty  in

looking  for  a  job.  She needs to earn  money  for  a  more

definite future.  But there is hope.  She can bake and  cook.

If  she cannot operate a hawker or canteen stall, can she  do

some home-based cooking and baking as an alternative?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As raised by Mayor Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, it is appropriate

for  an informal sector to be established in Singapore.  This

sector  can  also be a spawning ground for the under-employed

to  unleash  their potential, remembering that the  giant  HP

started  from  the  home  garage  and,  closer  to  the  food

business, Colonel Sanders of KFC also started from  his  home

kitchen after his retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am well aware of the possible consequences of

nuisance,  disturbance and unsightly cluttering  of  utensils

and  cartons  along  corridors.   All  these  could  lead  to

complaints  by  neighbours.  However, such concerns  are  not

good   reasons  for  not  exploring  ways  to  address  these

concerns.  Working in concert with the town council  and  the

CDCs, conditions can be spelt out to ensure good housekeeping

and  orderliness.  Vigilant spot checks can  be  carried  out

through  the CDCs, or town councils, whose set-ups have  been

premised  on  the  ground as decentralised units.   They  can

therefore   be  more  flexible  in  serving  the   needs   of

constituents  under their charge.  In fact, to better  manage

such  small-scale food operators, can they not be  registered

under  a central registry for easy access to them?  The  town

councils  and CDCs could mount a briefing to inform  them  of

the  dos and don'ts.  After all, with HDB being an expert  in

regulations, they should have no difficulty coming  out  with

further rules, except that this time round, the rules may win

them  better  support  since they are meant  to  help  create

temporary jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that HDB is in the business of

housing,  and not jobbing.  But, Sir, if you wish to  nurture

entrepreneurial spirit, we must surely allow for MOM and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>



top  entrepreneurs to mushroom readily and spontaneously from

their  homes  without their often feared cost of  capital  of

doing  business.  In fact, that was how Bengawan Solo started

years back and it was after it had sufficiently built up  its

reputation  and  accumulated gains  that  it  turned  into  a

roaring business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should not the remaking of Singapore stretch the courage

and  imagination  of  the HDB to bring  spring  to  the  drab

weather  that we are now in?  And let those who have  plucked

up  enough courage to start something on their own so  as  to

spring   forward  to  reach  their  dreams.   Without   being

disrespectful  to one of our MOSs in this Chamber,  I  recall

reading  of  his  mother's food enterprise of satay  prepared

from her flat dwelling.  I have no doubt that that enterprise

had  contributed  to  the nurturing and  shaping  of  one  of

Singapore's  sons who, today, is contributing to the  nation.

I  urge HDB to open up its regulations to accommodate such  a

worthy  request to help the needy and remove the  OB  markers

that  may  snuff out the entrepreneurial spirit,  instead  of

uniting it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, I will not labour over the issue

of food preparation, hygiene and standards, which the HDB may

raise  as concerns and reasons for not supporting my request.

I  shall  be  addressing  that  with  the  Minister  for  the

Environment.   Sir,  I  will request that  the  HDB  consider

granting  temporary  permits of  6-12  months  to  unemployed

people  to  operate small scale food business of a  specified

approved  type  from out of their homes.   In  the  meantime,

these  people  will  have  to  work  hard  to  look  for   an

alternative  job  or  eventually  transfer  their  home-based

business to proper locations once they are successful.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I

like to raise the issue of heavy vehicle parking.  Owners  of

heavy  vehicles  often face the problem  of  finding  parking

space  near their homes.  As a result, many of them get fined

very frequently and these fines eat into their meagre income.

It is not uncommon to find many of the heavy vehicle drivers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>



who  have  a  parking lot which is very far away  from  their

homes.   So someone who lives in Jurong may have his  parking

lot  in  Tampines, and vice versa.  The Ministry may want  to

consider  a once-off rationalisation exercise to allow  heavy

vehicle owners to change their parking lots so that they  can

opt  for  a space nearer their home.  This will go  some  way

towards alleviating the problem for these drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new towns like Punggol New Town and Sengkang New

Town,  it  is  surprising that there are no plans  for  heavy

vehicle  parks  even  though there  are  plans  for  a  light

industrial  estate on the southern fringe of  Sengkang  town.

Furthermore,  there are large tracts of land  which  are  not

likely  to  be  used for the next 10 years.   Surely,  it  is

better to put a piece of empty land to productive use, rather

than  to leave it idle for the next 10 years.  If the MPs  in

Pasir  Ris-Punggol GRC and Ang Mo Kio GRC cannot be convinced

by  the  reasons given by HDB and URA that there is no  space

available  for heavy vehicle parking in Sengkang or  Punggol,

how can we convince our residents that that is so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, Government's policy

has  been that the cost of ownership of cars would be reduced

over  the  long  run,  but the cost of usage  will  increase.

Hence,  we have increases in ERP charges.  We have ERP almost

everywhere,  or soon to be everywhere, that we are  going  to

have  ERP  day and night.  I think very soon, ERP  will  mean

"every  road pay".  Sir, the day will be quite soon when  the

only safe place to leave your vehicle is at home, if you  are

lucky  enough to own a landed property.  You can well imagine

that, one day, if I drive out of my house, the first thing  I

hear would be this "beep" sound coming from the little device

on  my  dashboard, and everywhere you go, you will be hearing

"beep, beep, beep", instead of car horns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister of State for National Development was

quoted as saying that HDB is going to suffer $99 million loss

a  year  in  running the car parks.  Therefore, it  needs  to

increase its car park charges



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>



to  cover  this deficit.  Whereas his Minister was quoted  as

saying  that the reason why HDB wants to raise the  car  park

charges  is that it would have more money to build  more  car

parks  in future in order to anticipate the increase  in  the

number  of cars in Singapore.  So I would like to know  which

is  which, and to be more precise, I would like to hear  from

the  Minister how much does it cost for HDB to build one  car

park  lot, uncovered and covered.  I hope we will have enough

time so that I can follow up with more questions after we get

the figures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, in this Budget the

Finance  Minister  announced that car park charges  would  be

revised, and he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where HDB residential parking is concerned, the

existing charges do not cover the costs of building  the  car

parks, leaving HDB with a large deficit."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I assume, is the justification for the increases

in  HDB  season parking charges.  Of course, I  do  not  know

whether  the  HDB will take this opportunity  to  revise  the

hourly parking charges as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have checked from the HDB's Annual Report and

found that in 1994/1995, the deficit from car park activities

was less than $6 million.  In 2000/2001, the deficit went  up

to  $99  million.   The  bulk of the  increases  in  expenses

resulting  in deficit were interest expenses and depreciation

which  formed $62 million in 1995, increased to $140  million

in  2001,  and interest expenses went up from $84 million  in

1995 to $186 million in 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know how these changes in the

financial position of HDB car park activities came about.  Is

the  HDB dumping the cost of building multi-storey car  parks

in  the  new estates and upgraded precincts into the account?

If  this  is the case, is it fair to increase all HDB parking

charges across-the-board, including those old open car  parks

in  HDB  estates  built in the 60s and 70s?  Is  the  deficit

incurred  as  a result of HDB building more multi-storey  car

parks,  bearing in mind that HDB continues to collect parking

fees  even  for  car parks they already have, probably,  zero

depreciation value?  Building of car



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>



parks is therefore equivalent to a long-term investment.  And

if  the depreciation is zero and the cost of building the car

park  has been recovered long ago, I suppose, those built  in

the  60s and 70s, where is the justification to increase  the

parking fees in these car parks by reason of HDB incurring  a

huge  deficit?   And if the justification is to  recover  the

huge deficit in car park operations, then is the HDB prepared

to just break even for car park operation in the long run?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue I want to bring up is whether the

HDB  has  a cyclical work plan to improve the car  parks.   I

wish  to inform the Minister that car parks in the estate  in

Hougang constituency have not undergone any major improvement

by  the HDB since they were built together with the flats  in

the  70s.   The  condition of most of the  access  roads  and

parking  lots has been bad.  I would like to ask the Minister

whether  the HDB would pay for improving the car park  access

roads and the parking lots in Hougang constituency.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, the new towns, such as

Sengkang  and Punggol, are lovely to look at.  However,  like

all new towns, they were initially beset with the problem  of

lack  of  physical facilities and social services.   On  this

note,  I  must  commend and thank the Minister for  the  town

development  task  force which he set up in  Sengkang.   This

pilot  project,  which  has brought  together  more  than  20

Government  agencies  and different community  organisations,

has  made it possible for residents in Sengkang New  Town  to

have   significant   improvements  made   to   their   living

environment,  and  a  rapid response  time  to  many  of  the

problems that they have faced.  The improved coordination and

better understanding between the different organisations have

vastly  improved  the  quality of life of  the  residents  in

Sengkang  town.   There  are two other  areas  where  further

improvements can be made.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, better designs. One of the problems of the new

town  is that although the facade looks beautiful, there  are

many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>



problems with the designs which have become regular irritants

to   many  of  the  residents.   The  block  signs   are   so

aesthetically designed and well concealed that they cannot be

easily seen by visitors or residents.  The sheltered walkways

are  bright, airy, with beautifully-designed roofs, but leave

the  user  with little protection from even a gentle drizzle.

The  drop-off  points are strategically placed  with  arching

canopies  that invite rain to fall into the shelters,  making

one  wetter  than if one stood under an umbrella.   The  lift

lobbies  are so cosily designed that you can hardly see  each

other  in  the  day time, unless the lights are switched  on.

The lift buttons blend so well that you cannot figure out the

numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am all for creativity and aesthetic designs. However,

more  importantly,  we  must  take  into  consideration  that

functionality  and practicality must not be forgotten.   Much

money will have to be spent to correct these design problems.

In  future,  the  Minister may wish to  consider  a  feedback

committee  formed  from the community organisations  or  town

councils,  which  will  give feedback  to  HDB  before  these

designs  are  approved in the new estates.  This will  ensure

better  designed  public flats which are both  beautiful  and

functional.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, designation of land use. In this age of

increased  transparency, URA and HDB should openly state  the

designated  use  of  land,  eg,  for  churches,  temples  and

mosques.  Flats next to a designated religious site may  have

less  appeal  for  many but at least those who  choose  these

flats  do  not feel that they have been given a big  surprise

and  will be better adapted to the environment.  The Ministry

should  pre-designate  religious sites  in  advance  of  flat

selection.   This transparency will bode well  for  new  flat

owners.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the early days,

the HDB always provided for wet markets in the old estates so

that  the  residents  could go and purchase  their  food  and

market  produce.  The wet markets have all sorts  of  produce

offering the residents very good choices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>



The  residents enjoy buying their food there because they can

pick  and choose, and can even bargain for cheaper buys. But,

in  the supermarket, there are no such facilities. The choice

is limited and the prices are fixed and not bargainable. Most

importantly, at the wet market, residents can mingle with one

another  and talk about anything under the sun, even national

issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, recently, in all the new towns, the HDB has stopped

building  wet  markets.   They have only  the  so-called  dry

markets  which are actually housed in shops.  These are  very

small and there is hardly any space for the residents to move

about.   The  situation is even worse when it  rains.   These

shops,  when they are operating as markets, are not  hygienic

and   people  are  not  very  happy  with  them.   Residents,

particularly housewives, would prefer to go to the wet market

because  they  like this concept of wet market  better.   For

example,  in  Boon Lay, Jurong or Chong Pang, all  these  wet

markets  are  very popular with the people and  the  business

there is very good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the officers in HDB why they have stopped

building  wet markets, and they told me that the wet  markets

were  very messy, and that was why the Government had stopped

building  wet markets. I do not believe that the wet  markets

are  messy.  Perhaps, they were referring to the great number

of  people moving about in the area, and the wet markets were

always bustling with activities. So, if these officials think

that  they  should  not build wet markets  because  they  are

messy, then I am afraid they are terribly wrong.  I hope that

HDB will reconsider this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, a lot of people queue up to buy HDB flats in

the  mature estates. When Channel News Asia interviewed these

people  why  they  were flocking to buy flats  in  these  old

estates,  the spontaneous response was, "Because there  is  a

wet  market, it is very convenient here.  That is  why  I  am

applying to buy a flat here."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since most residents like the wet markets and they are

popular  with  the residents, I hope that HDB  will  consider

building  wet  markets  in the new towns  like  Sengkang  and

Punggol,  and  provide better services to the  residents.   I

hope that HDB could conduct a survey among the residents, and

find  out  whether  they would welcome the provision  of  wet

markets in the estate, before they formulate their policy.  I

think that would better reflect the wishes of the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr Yatiman's constituency, HDB has built a new wet

market  to replace the dry market.  I would like to find  out

what  is  the  residents' response to  this  wet  market.   I

understand from Mr Yatiman that the residents like  this  wet

market  very  much.  If that is the case, would the  Minister

consider  building more wet markets in the other estates,  to

fulfill the wishes of the residents?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, first of all, let me take the

points raised by Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed on the question  of

helping  residents  cope  with  financial  difficulties.   He

suggested specifically allowing the residents to downgrade or

to  buy  another  flat  in  order to  help  them  with  their

difficulties.  There are certain rules about this but, by and

large,  there  is  no  difficulty for residents  to  actually

downgrade in order to get some money from their existing flat

to cope with their difficulties.  However, there are requests

from time to time concerning the interest rates that will  be

charged, and these are considered based on the appeals by the

MPs.   I  would like to assure him that HDB will continue  to

take a sympathetic attitude to such requests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it need not necessarily be so. They do not have to

sell their flats if they do not want to.  In fact, there  are

many  schemes put in place by HDB to actually help  residents

to  cope with their difficulties without having to give up or

lose  their flats.  These have been quite successful.   There

are  quite  a  number of residents who do take  advantage  of

these  schemes.   For example, the reduced  repayment  scheme

whereby   residents  pay  a  certain  percentage   of   their

instalments.   Instead of 100%, they pay 75%.   Or  they  can

defer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>



their  instalment for six months, or they can actually extend

the loan repayment period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all these measures do help the residents cope with

their   financial  difficulties.   They  are  actually   very

generous measures that have been put in place.  In fact,  HDB

will  refine one of these measures even further, to  make  it

more  helpful to the residents, namely the reduced  repayment

scheme.  Currently, they can pay 75% of the instalments,  but

HDB  will, effective 1st July 2002, allow mortgagers  to  pay

between 50-75% of their monthly instalment.  In this way, the

residents will be able to pay something and not have to defer

their loan repayments totally.  This will be for a period  of

two  years.  There will be a 6-monthly review by HDB, because

HDB would like to ensure that residents, once they can afford

to  pay,  will  actually restart their  instalment  payments.

This will be of help to the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, over and above all these financial assistance

measures,  the greatest comfort to HDB lessees is really  the

fact that they are protected from third-party creditors, even

if  they are made bankrupt.  So whatever happens, eg, if they

lose  money,  they are sued by other creditors and  are  made

bankrupt,  they will not lose their flat.  This  is  probably

the  greatest  comfort to our residents.   Why?   Because  we

have,  since  we  started the public housing programme,  made

sure  that home ownership is one of the cornerstones  of  our

policy.   It is a very important social objective.  I  wanted

to  make  this point because there have been recent calls  to

allow HDB flats to be used as collateral, in order to provide

funds  for  business.  It is an interesting proposal,  but  I

just  want to add a word of caution here because, as I  said,

home  ownership  is  a  fundamental  principle  of  our  home

ownership policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many questions that we need to answer and many

issues  that  we  need to look into before we  consider  this

issue.   One of the first questions that we ask ourselves  is

how  do  we  ensure  that  the funds that  are  derived  from

mortgaging the flat is actually used for business and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>



not  used  for  consumption,  eg,  buying  a  car,  going  on

holidays, etc.  And what if the business fails and they  lose

their  flat?   Are they prepared to bear the consequences  if

things do not work out, or do they look to the Government  to

provide them housing as a last resort?  These are some of the

questions that we need to ask ourselves, and we will have  to

study this proposal carefully before a decision is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just take this opportunity to respond to a

question  that Ms Irene Ng asked just now.  She is not  here.

This is concerning the issue of singles or other people,  who

as  a  result of the demise of a family member suddenly  find

themselves without a family nucleus and are worried that  HDB

would  turf them out.  I wish to assure Members of the  House

that  HDB will adopt a compassionate attitude to such  cases,

especially  where  one  member  of  the  family  passes  away

because,  obviously, this is not by choice.  So,  in  such  a

case,  the  family  nucleus requirement is  waived,  and  the

remaining occupant can retain his or her flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the issues raised by various Members

on  parking.  Let me take Dr Michael Lim's first about  heavy

vehicle  parking.   This is a perennial problem  in  our  HDB

estates,  and there are two contending forces here.   On  one

hand,  residents  are extremely upset when  they  have  heavy

vehicle  parks  next  to their homes.   They  create  traffic

hazards and noise and smoke nuisance to the residents.   Sir,

all  Members  who have heavy vehicle parks in  their  housing

estates  can bear me out.  Trucks and buses start up  at  six

o'clock in the morning, and residents get woken up from their

sleep.  As a result of that, we get constant complaints about

siting  of heavy vehicle parks in their housing estates.   On

the  other  hand,  of course, there is a  demand  from  heavy

vehicle  owners  or  drivers who want  to  park  their  heavy

vehicles right next to or near their homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, heavy vehicle parks are popular in HDB estates

precisely  for this reason - because they want to park  their

heavy vehicles near their homes.  But let me stress that  the

heavy vehicles that are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>



being  used  are  not  meant  to be  used  as  their  private

transport.  They are meant to be used for business.  As such,

HDB  cannot  provide enough parking lots for heavy  vehicles,

because  there  is a real shortage of suitable  land  in  the

housing  estates.  Even if they did find a suitable piece  of

land,  inevitably there will be competing uses or there  will

be  housing blocks nearby and, therefore, MPs will  complain,

if  these  empty  plots  were used for heavy  vehicle  parks.

There are actually enough heavy vehicle parks island-wide for

heavy   vehicles.   In  the  past,  URA  and  HDB  tried   to

accommodate the demand for such parking lots on an interim ad-hoc  basis  on  vacant lands which are close to HDB  estates.

But,  as  I  have  said, this is no longer sustainable.   The

existing  interim parking lots will be phased  out  when  the

land  is  needed for development, and more parking  lots,  if

these are needed, will be made available near workplaces like

Jurong, Kranji, Senoko and so on.  In fact, the LTA tells  us

that there are actually adequate parking lots island-wide for

such  heavy  vehicles.  So I would urge Members to understand

the  constraints that are faced by HDB, and also to help  HDB

to  balance the interest of heavy vehicle drivers on the  one

hand and residents on the other.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the questions raised by Mr Tan Soo

Khoon  and  Mr Low Thia Khiang on our car park charges.   The

first  question raised is:  why are we raising our  car  park

charges?  Is it justified?  The point is that HDB residential

car  parks  are heavily subsidised.  The current charges  are

way  below the cost of providing these car parks.  The extent

of  the  subsidy  for  last year, FY2001,  for  example,  was

something like $115 million from the car park operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked where this deficit comes from. Basically,

the  cost incurred in running the car park includes the  land

cost,  because HDB has to buy the land to build a  car  park.

It is not given away free of charge.  It is charged based on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>



residential rates, because if we do not use the land for  car

parks,  we can use it for housing.  The land is sold  in  one

piece.   The other cost involved includes construction  cost,

obviously.   Then, there is the cost of maintaining  the  car

park.  Finally, there is interest cost, which is the cost  of

funds  used  for  building and buying the  land.   All  these

elements  make up the cost.  There is a certain  depreciation

period, and the cost is depreciated over this period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the income from car parks includes

the  parking  charges, which is the bulk of the  income.   It

also  includes  some  fines, but that is a  relatively  minor

amount.   If you take the cost and the revenues into account,

you  will note that there is a heavy deficit, something  like

$100  million.   Even  after  we have  raised  the  car  park

charges, the deficit will still be quite considerable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental principle is this. Government will

subsidise  the  housing  needs of Singaporeans  in  order  to

enable  them to have a roof over their heads, but  Government

will not and should not subsidise car owners who live in  HDB

flats.  This is simply not fair to all the non-car owners  in

HDB  estates.   I  would  like to  inform  Members  that  the

majority of HDB lessees do not own cars.  If we do not  price

the car parks properly, what is happening is that HDB will be

carrying  a  deficit in its books as a result of  subsidising

car owners.  Eventually, one way or another, this subsidy  is

going  to  be borne by all HDB flat owners.  As a  matter  of

principle, it is best for us to make sure that car owners pay

what  is fair and what is adequate for the provision  of  car

parks  for  them to use, and not to have this cost lumped  to

the non-car owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we doing this now? The reason is because with

the new car policy, with the reduction in car taxes, with the

increase  in the number of COEs which has been announced,  we

can  expect our vehicle population to go up.  If  we  do  not

reduce the deficit on car parks, and if we continue to have a

deficit on car parks, and if we have to build more car parks,

the  deficit is going to increase in the future.  It  is  not

going to get smaller.  It is actually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>



going to go up.  This is the reason why we have to raise  the

car  park  charges in order to recover the cost of  providing

the  car parks.  And the reason why we are going to raise  it

in  September this year, is to coincide with the reduction in

car  taxes, with the implementation of lower road taxes.   We

are  mindful  of  the impact of these increases  on  HDB  car

owners  and  this  is the reason we are  timing  it  for  1st

September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give Members some idea. If a person is an owner

of a 1,500 cc car, his road tax rebate will be something like

$225 a year, which works out to $18.75 a month.  The increase

in  the  monthly season parking charges for a  sheltered  car

park lot is $15, which is less than the $18 rebate that he is

getting  for car taxes.  If we are talking about surface  car

park  lots, the increase would be $10, again lower  than  the

reduction in car taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this revision in HDB/URA car park charges is

part  of  the  larger  package of measures  that  affect  car

owners,  where the intention is to match the cost of  driving

with  usage,  rather  than ownership  of  cars.   So,  it  is

inevitable that motorists, who use their vehicles a lot, will

have to bear the higher cost of usage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also asked whether we will eventually go for

breakeven in the charges for car parks.  We do not have plans

at  the  moment to reach breakeven level.  Let us explain  to

the  public  and get the public to accept that the  increases

that  we  are  going  to  implement  on  1st  September   are

reasonable  and  acceptable, and also get the message  across

why we have to raise car park charges come 1st September.  We

are not looking for breakeven at this point in time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as maintenance of car parks is concerned, in

Hougang  constituency, if Mr Low has any specific  complaints

about  the car parks in his constituency, he may let the  HDB

know.   As for certain parts of the car parks, I do not  know

which  part he is referring to.  Some parts may be under  the

Town Council, and some under HDB.  But if he can let the  HDB

know,  I  am sure they will look into it.  The point is  that

there is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>



need  for car parks to be maintained. We do not just build  a

car  park and then after that, we let it be.  There is a cost

incurred  in  maintaining  car  parks,  and  this   cost   of

maintaining car parks is also part of the cost which  I  have

just  cited  earlier, which is the reason for the deficit  in

car parks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask my Minister of State to deal with the other

questions on wet markets, as well as on the use of HDB  flats

for food business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification from

the  Minister?   We  have now heard another  reason  for  the

increase  in  car park charges because there is  a  road  tax

rebate.   So the Government is giving money in one  hand  and

taking back from the other hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, I do not see any Government subsidy

reflected in the accounts.  The amount of deficit, I believe,

is  a  total  reflection of the cost.  I wonder  whether  the

Minister  will  agree  that  if  the  depreciation   of   the

construction cost is taken over a longer period of  time,  it

will not incur so much deficit and thereby, we can afford  to

charge lower car park fees.  My other question is whether are

there  cyclical plans for car parks, just like HDB flats  and

not so much on the maintenance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, the Minister did not answer my

question  about the cost to HDB of an open surface  car  park

and a covered carpark.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> First of all, Mr Low is quite

disingenuous to say that the reason for us to raise  our  car

park charges is because the road taxes have come down.  I did

not  say  that.   What  I said was that  the  timing  of  the

increase  is such that the increase of car park charges  will

be  defrayed somewhat by the reduction in the road taxes.  We

could  have  raised it earlier, but we did not  do  so.   The

timing of 1st September is precisely for that reason, to make

sure that the impact on motorists is minimised.  It is not  a

reason  for doing so.  I hope Mr Low will not get  the  wrong

impression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the issue of depreciation, yes, we do

depreciate over the life of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>



car parks.  I am not sure exactly what the life span is.  But

the  cost,  under  normal accounting  practices,  has  to  be

depreciated  over the life of the car parks,  and  I  believe

this  is being done.  On cyclical works, yes, of course,  the

car  parks will also have to undergo cyclical works.   If  we

are  talking  about a multi-storey car park,  some  of  these

works  would not come under the Town Council, but come  under

the  HDB.   As  for  surface car parks,  the  cyclical  works

involved  will  be minimal, but it still needs  to  be  done.

Resurfacing,  for  example,  needs  to  be  done.   The  more

critical  work  that needs to be done is the  replacement  of

these  surface  car parks with multi-storey  car  parks.  The

demand for car park space is very high in HDB estates, and we

have to constantly look for ways of increasing the number  of

car  park  lots.  One of the ways of doing so is  to  replace

surface car parks with multi-storey car parks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me answer Mr Tan Soo Khoon's question about cost.

The  estimated cost of providing a surface car  park  lot  is

something like $11,000, and this includes land cost  as  well

as  construction cost.  But the construction cost, obviously,

is  much lower than the land cost.  Then, for the covered car

park,  it  is  about $20,000.  In this case, the construction

cost  is much higher. The land cost, of course, can be  split

up  over  more  car  parks.  These are roughly  the  ballpark

figures at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the HDB do cyclical works such

as resurfacing the access roads to open surface car parks?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, I believe they do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What is the timeframe, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I am afraid that I do not have the

answer.  I  would imagine that it is done as and when  it  is

necessary.   I  do  not have the answer, but  if  the  Member

wishes to file a Question, I will give him the answer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, in 1989, the then Minister for

National Development told the House that the cost of an  open

surface  car park lot to HDB was $14,443, and $32,581  for  a

covered  car park lot.  Based on what the Minister  has  just

told us, it would appear that the cost of providing car parks

to  HDB has dropped by quite a lot in the last 10 years.  Can

he  still  justify the increase in charges if it is based  on

cost?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if it is $11,000 for building an open air car

park  lot,  and if the size of the car park lot is  about  60

square  feet, that works out to almost $200 per square  foot,

and  this is providing something without four walls, no roof,

no  water,  no  power supply.  Is this not a  very  expensive

piece of real estate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, first of all, I cannot comment on

the  figures  that were cited earlier.  I will  go  back  and

check.  But these are the figures that have been given to  me

now  and they are, I presume, the current figures. Even  with

these  figures,  there  is still a deficit.   To  answer  his

question  whether we are justified, the point  is,  based  on

this  cost,  we  still run a deficit of over $100  million  a

year.  And even with the increase, we are still going to  run

a  deficit close to that amount.  The answer to his  question

is yes, we are justified in raising the charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On cost of the real estate, yes, land cost is very high.

As I have said earlier, the cost of the land for car parks is

treated  the  same  as  the cost of land  for  housing.   The

justification for this is very simple.  If we do not use  the

land  for car park, we have to use the land for housing.   So

we better make sure that we make good use of the land.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Sir, let me answer the points raised

by  Mdm Ho Geok Choo on promoting the informal sector in  HDB

flats.   In  her  speech, she mentioned  the  possibility  of

coming  up  with  more rules and registration  procedures  to

facilitate  this.  I am glad to inform her that there  is  no

need for registration and additional rules in this area.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>



HDB  already permits various small-scale business  activities

to  be  conducted  from HDB flats, and these activities  will

include making satay, tarts, baking cakes, music, tuition and

so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, HDB's foremost priority is to preserve the

residential  nature  of  these  flats.   As  long  as   these

activities  do  not  contravene and  change  the  fundamental

nature of these residences, HDB does not require them to even

register with us.



<br>2.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the public health standpoint, I think

she  can  take  it up with the Minister for the  Environment,

whether they will permit food prepared within these flats  to

be  sold to the general public.  With all the concerns now on

public health, especially after Question time today, I  think

all Ministers will be a lot more cautious on that note.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to move on to Dr Michael Lim's points about new

towns.   In  particular,  he talked  about  having  beautiful

designs, which are not necessarily the most functional.   All

of  us  in  this  House are realistic enough, and  practical-minded people, who do want beautiful designs to be, first and

foremost,  practical.  We are mindful of this.  We  are  also

mindful  of  the  fact  that it is not enough  to  just  have

something  beautiful, but we want it to be easily maintained,

because in the long run this affects our cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take his point that the people who have a greater

stake in this are the professionals and the residents on  the

ground.   That  is  why before HDB embarks on  any  upgrading

programme,  it  will always consult advisors  and  grassroots

organisations, as to the form and the structures  which  need

to  be put up.  However, I just want to add a cautionary note

that  it  is  impossible  to please all-comers  and  to  make

everybody happy with all the different perspectives.  At  the

end  of  the day, we have to come out with a design which  is

workable, and which addresses as many needs as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also brought up his perspective about pre-designating religious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>



sites.  Let me assure the House again that planning is a most

difficult  process.  We have to trade off  sometimes  between

flexibility and being overly specific at a premature point in

time, in which case, we actually constrain flexibility.   But

having said that, wherever possible, if we are certain on the

specific  use  of a site, the HDB will seek to transmit  that

information   to   the  advisors  and   to   the   grassroots

organisations as soon as possible.  But I think Members  will

have  to  appreciate that sometimes we do not  have  all  the

answers at that point in time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to move on to Mr Ang Mong Seng's point on wet

markets.   Prior  to 1982, the HDB built wet markets  in  HDB

towns.   However, sometimes these things became a  bit  messy

and  unhygienic,  and I take his point  that  this,  to  some

extent,  would  have been caused by the fact that  there  was

relative  overcrowding, or too many  people  using  it.   But

after  1982, a policy decision was made to stop building  wet

markets, and instead to build dry markets.  These dry markets

really  consist of a cluster of market produce  shops  and  a

supermarket.   But, in reality, what happened  was  that  the

shopkeepers and the residents started treating these like wet

markets.  This became neither fish nor fowl, and it ended  up

becoming a hybrid, which was just as messy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 1992, the HDB stopped building these dry markets

and  moved  on  to  a new concept, which we called  the  "new

market".  These were similar in character to the wet markets,

but  there  was a key difference.  They were designed  to  be

more  hygienic,  easily  maintained, better  drainage,  wider

aisles,  and  there  were larger market  stalls.   These  new

markets  are usually co-located with other retail and  eating

facilities   in  stand-alone  neighbourhood  centres.    Such

integrated facilities provide a better marketing and shopping

environment  for  the  residents.  Examples  of  these  would

include  Rivervale Plaza in Sengkang Town  and  the  Yew  Tee

Shopping Centre in Chua Chu Kang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since October 2000, the HDB has also started tendering

out  designated sites in new towns to the private sector  for

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>



provision of retail marketing and eating facilities  to  meet

the  needs  of  the  residents.  The successful  tenderer  is

allowed  to  decide whether he is going to  construct  a  new

market  or a supermarket.  But, obviously, this will have  to

take  into  account the residents' needs on the  ground.   We

think  that,  in  this way, we will evolve forms  of  markets

which will address the needs of the residents, whilst at  the

same time being practical and hygienic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo Ho Pin, we are running behind

time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, despite contributing about 5-8% to

our  GDP  yearly, the construction industry is not a  sunrise

industry.    It  faces  problems  of  sustainable   workload,

shortage of labour, lack of innovation, low productivity  and

a poor public image.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, not much attention has been paid to the

development  of  the  construction  industry.    The   recent

failures  of  some large construction firms,  which  affected

various  public  projects and many industries,  clearly  show

signs of possible collapse of the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Construction 21 plan does not provide key strategies

to develop our industry.  There is a lack of focus to nurture

local  consultants and contractors to be world-class players.

I  would  suggest  that the Ministry set up an  International

Advisory Panel to develop our construction industry.  Sir,  I

wish to ask the Minister the following questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the key strategies in developing the

construction industry?



(2)  What are the plans to nurture local consultants and

contractors to be world-class players?



(3)  What are the strategies adopted by BCA to export

construction services?



<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, when

construction companies, which are undertaking the MUPs or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>



the  IUPs  in our housing estates, are not able to  meet  the

project  schedules, the residents staying in the MUP and  IUP

precincts are greatly inconvenienced.  This will be  more  so

where  residents  want  to renovate their  flats  and  cannot

proceed  because the internal upgrading works to be  done  by

the  MUP contractors are delayed.  Further, the delay in  the

completion of the external works can also create problems  of

safety and security in the precincts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore would like to ask the Minister whether

his Ministry or the HDB can assist where the contractors have

some problems.  Their problem may be of a temporary nature  - sometimes it is just a cash-flow problem.  Could the HDB come

in  to  assist  so that the work can be carried  out  without

undue delay?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other feedback we got is that the cause of

failure  of companies to complete the projects is because  of

the  way we have selected these contractors, which is on  the

basis  of  the lowest tender.  Sir, I agree that cost  is  an

important  consideration, but there are also  other  critical

considerations if we want to ensure that the project  can  be

completed  in  time.  Sir, sometimes the companies  that  are

selected are overstretched and, therefore, they cannot  carry

out   the  project  in  the  way  that  it  should  be  done.

Sometimes, the way they manage the projects is also not  what

we had hoped for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister and the Ministry can look

into  these  problems, so that our HDB MUP and IUP  projects,

which  are actually good projects, can be done with the least

inconvenience to the residents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I propose to take the break now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head T (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo Ho Pin, you have three cuts which

you can take together.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, first on sustainable construction.

Sustainable  construction is hardly practised  in  Singapore.

To  achieve  the vision of our Green Plan 2012,  we  need  to

promote  sustainable  construction  practices  in  Singapore.

This  will  ensure a balance between sustainable  development

and maintaining a quality living environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is not much incentive for sustainable

construction practices in Singapore.   As such, the impact of

construction operations on the environment can be undesirable

in  the  long run.  I wish to ask the Minister the  following

questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the initiatives taken to encourage sustainable

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;construction?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How many construction firms are ISO 14000 registered?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on construction technology. The incentive schemes

by  BCA  have  not been successful in encouraging  technology

innovations  among  contractors.  As  a  result,  many  local

construction  firms  have  not developed  any  capability  or

niches  to be globally competitive.  Sir, I wish to seek  the

following clarifications from the Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the state of technological advances in our

construction industry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How does BCA facilitate the introduction of new

construction technologies in the industry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the R&D efforts by BCA to encourage

technological innovations in the industry?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on contractors' registry. The existing and

proposed  new contractor registration system by BCA has  some

fundamental  flaws.  It provides protectionist mechanism  for

consultants and contractors.  This contradicts the Ministry's

plan to promote self-regulation in the industry.  At the same

time,  it restricts open competition among contractors  based

upon  performance  and track records.  At  present,  the  BCA

registration  scheme forces contractors to procure  contracts

at  unrealistic  tender  prices and  adopt  substantial  sub-contracting   of   their  work  to  meet   the   registration

requirements.  This has resulted in the liquidation of  firms

causing  delays  of  projects  and  loss  of  jobs  to   many

Singaporeans.   All  these  hamper  efforts  to  develop  the

capability of our contractors and consultants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek the following clarifications from

the Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Why do we need a contractor registration system while

other industries do not?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In the proposed contractor registration system, why is

there a requirement to have one-third architects or engineers

running a construction firm?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) How will it help in nurturing world-class construction

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firms?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, precast concrete is now widely

used  for  the  construction of HDB  flats.   It  has  become

important  components  of flats.  I understand  that  in  the

past,  HDB  required  the presence of inspectors  before  the

casting  was done.  However, presently, the system  has  been

changed  to that of merely conducting  random spot checks  on

the plant, and testing of the precast concrete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the above, I would like the Minister to

address  two  concerns.  One, how does HDB  ensure  that  the

precast slabs are of acceptable quality and do not inherently

contain  potential problems, such as spalling in the  future.

Two,  will  the  Minister explain and  evaluate  the  current

system  of inspection and supervision of precast plants,  and

how the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>



quality  of  precast  concrete components  in  HDB  flats  is

determined and assured?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Sir, on

behalf of the Minister for National Development, I would like

to  thank  all  the Members for the questions.   They  raised

important  questions on an important sector of  the  economy.

Sir,  I  would like to reassure Members that the Ministry  is

fully  focused  on  the rehabilitation  of  the  construction

industry.   Contractors  in Singapore have  made  significant

contributions  to our economy without which  our  first-class

economy could not have been built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MND is determined to help contractors ride out this

very  severe  recession, at least as far  as  contracting  is

concerned.  But  like  other sectors  of  the  economy,  Sir,

contractors also have to restructure their business.  The BCA

is  there  to help them along.  The BCA in Singapore  is  not

just  a regulator, but is also a promoter of the construction

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your indulgence, I would like to answer Mr

Low's  question first, just in case I am guillotined by  your

samurai  sword!   Mr Low raised a point about the  structural

safety of precast components, ie, the strength of precast and

prefabricated  components  used  in  constructing  buildings.

Essentially, he has asked how assured are we that there is no

cutting  of corners, there is no collusion and corruption  in

the precast yards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all precast components used in buildings have to be

certified by a professional engineer.  In the trade, we  call

him  or  her  PE.   This  PE  is personally  liable  for  the

structural  safety of buildings he or she designs,  and  this

professional  liability  is  a  life-time  liability.    This

liability  cannot be extinguished until he or she  dies.   So

long  as  the building stays, his or her liability is  there.

So,  it is unlikely that a PE will treat the matter of safety

lightly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, we require a PE to certify that the

structural component precast in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>



the yard is safe; in other words, it is precast according  to

the   working  drawing.   The  working  drawing  is  designed

according  to  the loading of the building.   If  he  or  she

cannot  perform the supervision  personally, then he  or  she

can reassign the task to a clerk-of-works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come now to HDB, because HDB is the biggest

developer  in  Singapore, and is a concern of  the  Ministry.

Out of the 32 precast yards in Singapore, 28 of them are HDB-approved yards.  In other words, we only buy from these  HDB-approved  yards.  These yards provide precast  components  to

HDB  buildings.  Because HDB is the biggest developer, it has

even  more  stringent  layers of  checks.   First,  HDB  will

require  a  professional engineer or  his  clerk-of-works  to

certify the components before the parts are delivered to  the

building  site.  In other words, the checks must be  done  in

the  precast  yard.  This is on top of the  requirement  that

these  HDB-approved  yards must have a resident  engineer  to

supervise  the  overall casting procedures.   So  we  have  a

resident engineer to oversee the yard; then we have a  PE  to

certify each and every beam that comes to the site.  If he or

she cannot do it, he or she assigns that responsibility to  a

clerk-of-works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on special production lines, HDB requires that

the  casting and checking procedures be recorded 24 hours for

validation  purposes.  In other words, the precast  procedure

is recorded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, on site, HDB engineers will also do checks to

make  sure that the precast components delivered to the  site

before installation are of certified quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are three layers of checks. Members can be

assured that all buildings in Singapore are safe.  If Mr  Low

knows  of  any  collusion or corruption in any precast  yard,

please alert the Ministry, or he can report the matter to the

CPIB.  This is a very serious matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go on to the questions raised by PAP

MPs.   I  humbly  disagree with Dr Teo that  C  21  does  not

provide any strategic objective to uplift the ailing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>



construction  industry.  In 1999, a comprehensive  review  of

the industry was carried out.  This review was jointly led by

the  Ministry  of  National  Development,  the  Ministry   of

Manpower  and  all the related consultants, associations  and

contracting  bodies in Singapore.  Together, we  agreed  that

the  C  21 is the solution, not a problem to the construction

industry.  Sir, I will be happy to ask the BCA to update  the

GPC on the progress made by C 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the key strategies of C 21 is to raise the

overall  performance of the industry in terms of productivity

and  capabilities  of  our firms.   After  several  years  of

negative  productivity, the industry registered a humble  but

very  encouraging positive productivity of  0.2%  last  year.

Measures   to   raise   productivity,   including   promoting

buildability, raising minimum skill levels and cut in foreign

man-year entitlements  -  what we call the MYE  -  are making

good  progress.  However, it will take quite a while for  the

true benefits of these measures to be harvested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to upgrade local capabilities, BCA works with EDB

and SPRING to offer a broad range of schemes to encourage the

industry  to adopt new technologies.  Since 2000,  about  $12

million  worth  of funds have been disbursed  to  almost  200

firms   under  the  Industry  Productivity  Fund,  Innovation

Development Scheme and the Construction Jump Start Programme.

The  perception  that  there is  a  lack  of  innovation  and

technological  applications in  our  industry  is  not  quite

correct.  In fact, Dr Teo may be pleased to know that, in the

last  two years,  BCA has invested something like $9  million

for  20  R&D  projects in four strategic areas,  namely,  IT,

buildability,  technology,  building  performance  and  high-performance materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, both foreign and local construction

companies  can  compete for our projects.   The  presence  of

these  foreign  companies  -  many of them  with  world-class

capabilities  -  have, over the years, set new standards  and

challenged   our  local  industries  to  upgrade   themselves

technologically  and  to remain competitive.   HDB's  precast

technology, for example, has attained quite a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>



reputation world wide.  Some local specialist companies  have

also  developed  niche skills such as reclamation  technology

and marine engineering which can also be exported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be unwise to pick winners and offer them

contracts over and above contractors who offer good bids  for

us.    Instead,  the  Government  will  provide  a  conducive

environment  to  enable local firms to grow  and  upgrade  to

global standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key strategy to raise standards and benchmarks

for  contractors is to revamp the Contractors Registry System

(CRS).   From  1st July this year, companies registering  for

CRS  will have to meet higher firm requirements for financial

capacity,  personnel  and  track record  to  reflect  current

market   conditions.   The  requirement   of   one-third   of

professional personnel be registered engineers or  architects

with  the  Professional  Engineers  Board  or  the  Board  of

Architects  has been introduced to strengthen  the  technical

expertise   of  construction  companies.   Given  that   most

projects are getting larger and more complex over the  years,

the  more  stringent criterion in the CRS will move firms  to

upgrade and pool their resources with others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides CRS changes, the Government will also be making

legislative amendments to facilitate the formation  of  firms

with multi-disciplinary capabilities to allow them to provide

the full suite of services from design to build.  At the same

time,  more projects of an integrated nature like design-and-build will be pushed out to allow our local industry to  gain

experience in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while companies have strengthened their

capabilities  at  home,  BCA  and  IES  will  also   actively

encourage  them  to  grow  their businesses  as  a  long-term

strategy.  There is a long-term export plan within  C  21  to

grow  our  industries and export them to the region.  BCA  is

concentrating  its efforts in cities like Beijing,  Shanghai,

Sichuan  in China, and Bangalore and Hyderabad in India.   In

March last year, Chairman of BCA led a promotion mission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>



to  India.   Later  this  month, the  Minister  for  National

Development, Mr Mah, will personally lead a business  mission

to China to promote the capabilities of our companies.



<br>3.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Teo for his idea of an

international  advisory  panel to  develop  our  construction

industry.   Indeed, the Economic Review Committee is  looking

into  such ideas.  They are looking at reputable construction

companies  in countries like South Korea, Japan  and  France,

and  try to learn from them as to how to remake our industry.

The  Working  Group is still deliberating.  I  am  sure  some

interesting ideas will come out of this report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo raised a point about sustainable construction

industry.  I am happy to note that this is something the  BCA

has  been looking into in the last few years.  In two  years'

time,  all  companies on the top two grades of  the  new  CRS

would  have  to  be ISO 14000 certified.  To-date,  something

like  32 companies are already ISO 14000 certified, and  one-third of the companies on the top two grades, ie, the A1  and

A2, are already ISO 14000 certified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public sector tender - this is an important subject

raised by Mr Othman Eusofe and various MPs.  The concern that

HDB  awards  tenders to the lowest price, regardless  of  the

performance of the contractors, is not quite correct.  It  is

precisely  for  this  reason that  we  have  the  Contractors

Registry System.  It is to sieve out unscrupulous contractors

who  have  a  bad  track record with any  of  the  Government

agencies.  Price is an important consideration, but there are

other  considerations, like track record, performance record,

and  also recommendations from other Ministries.  It  is  not

necessary for any Ministry to award a contract based  on  the

lowest price.  But since we already have a CRS, companies  on

that  list  are already pre-qualified.  In other words,  they

are  not  so bad companies; very often, quite good companies.

So there is no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>



reason for us to strike them out, unless there is a very firm

body of evidence to suggest that in the last few months, this

company has gone bad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the state of the construction industry, the industry

has  suffered from the downturn in the economy.   The  demand

for  private  and  public housing  has  gone  down.   So  the

construction industry is at its crossroads.  But we are  sure

that  as the economy picks up, the construction industry will

rise  from the ashes.  The revamped CRS is one approach taken

by  the BCA to make sure that when good times come again,  we

have good contractors ready to catch the wind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I will be brief but

flowery.   We all are very proud of our Garden City.   Having

done  a successful job in greening our country, we have added

more colours and we have also gone fruitful.  I think one  of

the  best drives of any airport in the world is the ECP,  and

we  are  proud  of  that.  Recently, I  was  invited  to  the

launching  of  "Adopt-A-Park"  by  the  Telok  Kurau  Primary

School.  I gladly accepted the invitation and went there, but

only  to  find out that the park actually belonged to another

GRC.   Although I have the beautiful Bedok Reservoir Park  at

neighbouring ward, belonging to BG George Yeo, and I am still

proud  of it, I miss the Punggol Park from Punggol East where

I  came from, from the last term.  I really miss Punggol Park

as a landmark area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question here is, coming from Eunos, which is a very

old  estate,  there we have more of a concrete jungle  rather

than  green.  So I would like to see the National Parks Board

and Ministry of National Development spend some effort to see

how  they  can  help old estates, where they have  a  lot  of

concrete but less green, add some element of green lungs.  If

they  can look at even small corners here and there, and  get

the  National  Parks  Board to inject  some  freshness,  some

green,  some colour and some fruits, I think life will  be  a

lot more meaningful.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, URA is one of the most

important   land  utilisation  agencies  in  Singapore.    In

addition, there are other agencies such as JTC, HDB  and  SLA

which  have land utilisation programmes as well.  Very often,

more  than  one  agency  is  involved  with  regard  to   the

utilisation for the very same piece of land.  This has caused

problems  for those who have purchased land from Government's

land  sales  programmes or tenders.  As land is an  expensive

resource  which will tie down the capital of many  investors,

there  is a need for Government agencies to coordinate  their

requirements and not be a hindrance to investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, a single Government agency should be formed for

the  purposes of land utilisation so that there can be better

coordination between URA, JTC, HDB and SLA.  This will  allow

smoother processing of administrative requirements and better

management of the supply of land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Government should also consider reviewing

development  charges.  The glut in commercial and  industrial

space has resulted in much space that has been left idle.  To

improve  productivity  and efficient  utilisation  of  space,

companies  may have to reconsider change of use of  space  to

improve space usage and increase the chances of viability  of

the  business.  Whenever there is a change of use, they  have

to  apply  to the relevant bodies like URA or SLA, which  may

then  charge  them  hefty  development  charges.   This  will

discourage  the commercial space from being put  into  better

use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodies like URA and SLA should not be overly concerned

about trying to squeeze the maximum out of every business  as

this  will only accelerate the demise of these companies  and

thereafter,  result in a loss of jobs.  They should  exercise

appropriate professional judgement, taking into account  that

they  are  not  there to make as much money as possible  from

commercial  companies, but rather they are  there  to  ensure

that  planning norms are adhered to and act according to  the

prevailing  market  situation without  unduly  burdening  the

companies.    To  incentivise  companies  to   utilise   idle

economically



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>



inactive  space, URA or other land agencies should, in  fact,

consider  giving  them a discount on the development  charges

and allow these charges to be paid over a period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there is a need to increase transparency and

accountability.  Land utilisation bodies must  also  be  more

transparent  and accountable and must not change  development

charges unilaterally.  They must tell the companies that  the

development charges are for proposed building plans and  they

should  continue to revise development charges after approval

has  been  given.   Additional  charges  must  never  be   an

afterthought.  A professional body, whether it  be  the  URA,

SLA  or any other land utilisation agency, must refrain  from

piling  charges.  We need a body beyond the land  utilisation

agencies which can react quickly to resolve disputes whenever

they arise.  This dispute resolution body which hears appeals

should  be  empowered  to act quickly so  that  it  will  not

increase the cost of business of a Singapore company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a globalised environment, where the economic

challenges  to  Singapore are significant, our land  agencies

must be able to act professionally, be transparent, have high

service  standards and not be obstacles to  business  growth.

It is time for the agencies to adopt a new mindset.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I would like to seek the following

clarifications from the Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What measures have been taken to increase the

production of fish, eggs and vegetables in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the status and production output of our

deep sea fish farm?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can the Ministry support high-rise farming in

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low, we have less than six minutes

for your speech and the reply.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Thank you,

Mr Chairman, for the long time given.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, food supply in Singapore depends almost fully on

external sources, except only a small percentage on the high-tech   farms  in  Singapore.   Vegetables  come  mostly  from

Malaysia;  fresh pork only from a small island  called  Pulau

Bulan  in  Indonesia; fresh chickens only from Malaysia;  and

rice from Thailand.  Due to the dependence on limited sources

of  supply, our food supply, in terms of quantity and  price,

fluctuates.   The  famous  case was  the  ban  of  pork  from

Malaysia due to the Nipah virus.  The price then increased by

almost double.  The increase in vegetable prices quite  often

could be due to the shortage of supply from Cameron Highlands

because  of  bad weather, or it could be due to  the  ban  of

imports because of the high level of pesticides being used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the ways to ensure less fluctuation of food

supply  and  also their prices is to depend  heavily  on  the

diversification of the sources of supply that we can develop.

I notice that there were businessmen following the Minister's

visit  to Pekan Baru sometime ago, and the objective  of  the

visit was to develop a vegetable growing industry.  Singapore

also  signs a pact with Thailand to ensure priority of supply

of  rice  to Singapore.  The Minister also visits Sichuan  in

order to secure pork supply from China.  Recently, during the

visit  of  our Prime Minister to Thailand, it has  also  been

announced that there is a certain degree of agricultural food

supply collaboration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard so much and are excited about all this

publicity,  but  we see very little from the results  of  all

these initiatives in diversifying our food supply.  Could the

Minister enlighten us on the progress of all these projects?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue I would like to raise is regarding local

farming.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low, I presume you do not want a

reply.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Let me talk about one

important point.  In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>



recent case of a murder in a Lim Chu Kang farm, the authority

then  realised that the farm hired a large number of  illegal

foreign  workers.  The question is: why did it  hire  illegal

foreign  workers?  In fact, MND, or the former  PPD  and  the

current  AVA, knew about the problem of shortage  of  labour.

MND has either failed to convince MOM that such a project  is

important or it is, as what other people have commented, that

the existence of all these high-tech farms is just to keep  a

pool  of  veterinary and agricultural experts to be hired  by

AVA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry is

serious  about the development of all these local  farms  and

what  assistance  the Ministry will render  to  expedite  and

develop all these projects announced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Balakrishnan, you have 21/2 minutes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> As the sickle is about to be

wielded,  I am only going to talk about farming.   Given  our

land constraints, it is impossible for us to be self-reliant.

Our  key is diversification.  I just want to remind the House

that  we  import vegetables from 32 countries, meat  from  25

countries  and  fish from 89 countries.  So we have  multiple

sources  of  food.  The AVA seeks out and is continuously  on

the  lookout  for  new sources of food.  As we  identify  new

sources, we try to transfer technology into these places.  As

we  try  to  transfer technology, we also look to  match-make

them  with our private sector so that funds from the  private

sector  can  invest  in these agricultural  expeditions,  for

instance, shrimp and fish processing in Myanmar, Malaysia and

Vietnam,  shrimp  farming in Malaysia, vegetable  farming  in

Indonesia  and  China, sea food processing  and,  of  course,

fresh  pork supply in Australia.  You can see the nice photos

of that in yesterday's newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to local farms, our objective is to provide

technical advice to our farms because our farms cannot be the

low-tech  wide  expanses of farms which you see  in  overseas

countries.  They have to be high-tech and high-productivity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>



farms.   There are no current commercial deep net  cage  fish

farms  in  Singapore.  However, the AVA has just completed  a

four-year pilot project to show that it is feasible  to  have

good  quality  tropical fish in deep net cages  in  Singapore

waters.   The main constraint, however, is the absence  of  a

reliable supply of fries.  In this respect, I am glad to  say

that AVA has demonstrated that unlike human fertility, we are

pretty  good  at  fish fertility and we  have  been  able  to

produce  commercial quantities of fish fries  which  will  be

essential ingredients for our deep net cage fish farming. So,

Dr Teo, take heart from that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards high-rise farming, there is obviously a limit

as  to how much we can do.  We cannot put the farms on top of

our   HDB  blocks.   They  cannot  take  the  weight  of  the

irrigation  systems which will be needed.  However,  if  such

high-rise  farms  indeed  are economically  viable,  and  the

private  sector is willing to bet and put money into it,  MND

will certainly facilitate this.



<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head F of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My topic is on the global image of the Singapore

Parliament.  We have a very new Parliament House and  also  a

new  Speaker.   I  was fortunate enough to  be  sent  by  the

Singapore  Parliamentary Society (SPS) to the IPU Conference.

There,  I remember, at  one session, the head of a delegation

from  Croatia  stood  up and started off by  apologising  and

said,  "I  apologise to the gentlemen who  are  present  here

today.   Next  time,  we  will bring  some  male  members  to

represent  Croatia."   It  so happened  that  all  the  three

members  of  the delegation were female.  Sir, I expect  that

more  and more of such conferences will be attended by female

parliamentarians.   I would like to see  that  Parliament  be

given  more  resources to prepare itself for this  role.   We

suffer  from  bad breath from time to time.  I  think  it  is

important that we are adequately represented in many  of  the

international  conferences.  We have the IPU,  AIPO  and  the

Commonwealth   Parliamentary  Association.    I   hope   that

necessary resources should be given due attention, so that we

can  get  more  of  our Members to attend such  meetings  and

conferences, and our image be enhanced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also use this opportunity to show that we have

democracy.   Many of the conferences are also represented  by

Members  of the Opposition.  Mr Chiam was with me in Morocco,

and  Mr  Low Thia Khiang too had been with the former Speaker

to  many  other conferences.  I hope Parliament will consider

the necessary resources in order to play an effective role at

overseas conferences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Deputy Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir,

the point that Mr Zainul Abidin made is a very important one,

ie, we should take every opportunity to enhance the image  of

our  Parliament in international fora.  But let me assure him

that  this is indeed being done and Parliament is well  aware

of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last 12 months, for example, 48 MPs actually

participated  in 16 overseas conferences, seminars,  official

visits  and  committees.  I have a list here which  indicates

that  the  conferences included those in Cuba, Burkina  Faso,

New



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>



Zealand,  Barbados,  KL, Beijing, Marrakech  in  Morocco  and

many, many others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the expenditure that is incurred in respect of

participating in these conferences and seminars  is  budgeted

for  in the Parliament vote.  And if there is a need to  have

more funds for such a purpose, I am sure that Parliament will

allocate  more  funds for this purpose.  True to  Singapore's

style,  we have not been extravagant in such expenditure,  as

we are not prone to giving MPs junket trips, but neither have

we  skimped on participation.  When we are invited, we assess

whether  we  can make a contribution and if  we  can  make  a

contribution, we have a role to play, we will go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our contribution has not been insignificant, if we judge

by  the  role  that  we  are playing  in  these  conferences,

considering the fact that we are a small state.  At  many  of

these  conferences,  we  are  represented  in  many  of   the

committees.   We sit on the committees, for example,  in  the

Association of Asian Parliaments for Peace (AAPP) meeting  in

Beijing.    At  the  Annual  Meeting  of  the  Asia   Pacific

Parliamentary  Forum (APPF) in Honolulu, we were  represented

on  the  committee.   In  fact, we are  also  represented  on

several   Standing   Committees,  and   this   includes   the

Commonwealth    Parliamentary    Association    (CPA),    the

Commonwealth  Speakers' Standing Committee and the  Southeast

Asian Regional Branch of the CPA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will do our best, even though we are a small

Parliament,  to  be  represented  in  as  many  parliamentary

conferences and committees as we can.  Our MPs are very  busy

people.   They have their own jobs to do, they have  to  look

after  their constituencies, and they have to carry out their

parliamentary  duties.   Having said all that,  I  think  our

Parliamentarians acquit themselves creditably  in  all  these

overseas  conferences, including our MPs from the  Opposition

parties, Mr Chiam and Mr Low.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul made special mention of the role of women MPs.

Here,  I  am  pleased to inform him that the calibre  of  our

women



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>



MPs  has indeed been recognised by parliamentarians in  other

countries.  If I may cite several examples, recently, Mdm  Ho

Geok  Choo served on one of the committees at the AAPP.   And

likewise, Ms Irene Ng had served on a committee at the  APPF.

At    the   AIPO   Conference   in   Thailand,   two    women

parliamentarians, namely, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Dr  Lily  Neo,

served  on  several committees and panels,  including  WAIPO,

which is the Women Parliamentarians of AIPO.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are talking about the global image of the

Singapore  Parliament, there is the website that we  maintain

on  the  Internet.  There are also the Parliamentary  Reports

that we put up on the Internet and LawNet, and all these  are

accessible  world wide.  We also hosted many attachments  and

study   tours   for  Members  and  officials   from   foreign

Parliaments.   We have Parliamentary Friendship  Groups  with

many  other  countries like Australia, China,  Japan,  Korea,

Peru,  etc,  and many of our Members here are  involved  with

such groups.  We also have Regional Groups - West Asia group,

Africa  group,  Asia  Pacific group,  Southeast  Asia  group,

Europe group, Americas group - which also involve many  other

MPs.   And, finally, of course, what Mr Zainul mentioned just

now,  the Singapore Parliamentary Society (SPS), which  is  a

society  which fosters relations with members of the CPA  and

IPU.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me just say that we appreciate the Member's

concern  about  upholding the global image of  the  Singapore

Parliament.  I would like to assure him that we will bear  in

mind  his  suggestion  for more women MPs  to  be  adequately

represented at the relevant conferences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head O of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current quota of 33% on the admission of female

students into the Faculty of Medicine, NUS, was introduced in

1979.  No other faculty in NUS has such a quota.  There is no

other highly ranked university in the world that denies entry

to  qualified people on the basis of gender.  The reason  for

introducing  the quota for female medical students  was  that

the  attrition rate for female doctors prior to 1979 was  12-15%, and women doctors could not be assigned duties as freely

as  their male counterparts.  However, these reasons are  not

valid  any  more.   Currently, the attrition  rate  for  male

doctors  is  2.8%  and for female doctors is  4.2%.   As  for

duties  for doctors, women doctors have been assigned  duties

as  men  have, without distinction.  They share  night  calls

equally,  attend to the same number of patients  and  perform

the same medical and surgical procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time to review the female quota for medical

students now for the following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The latest statistics reveal that the attrition

rate  is  not  significantly different for  male  and  female

doctors.   The figures show that 95.8% of female doctors  are

still working compared to 97.2% of male doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The percentage for women part-time doctors is 13.5%

and   for   male   doctors  is  4.1%.    However,   part-time

practitioners   are   still   contributing   to   Singapore's

healthcare  system and the use of part-time  is  an  entirely

arbitrary and self-declared status.  Women who work four full

days each



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>



week  may well declare themselves as part-timers whereas  men

who  take  two  or  three afternoons off a  week  will  still

consider themselves working full-time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Women live longer than men. Therefore, the higher

number of non-working female doctors may be accounted for  in

part,  by  the higher number of retired women doctors.   This

may  also  mean  that the working life of  women  doctors  is

longer  and hence total productivity over their lifetime  may

equal or exceed that of their male colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Both male and female doctors serve their compulsory

five-year  bond  for  newly qualified doctors.   This  should

count  as  partial  fulfilment of their responsibilities  for

their  educational subsidy.  Even allowing  for  the  greater

social   responsibilities  of  doctors  whose   training   is

subsidised, it seems illogical that doctors should be singled

out  and  expected to be "serving" in the medical  profession

for  life.   No  other  professional faculty,  or  Government

scholarship  programme, has a similar quota on women.   Thus,

the   quota  appears  to  rest  on  an  unreasonable  "moral"

obligation on all doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Studies in other countries have shown that due to

better communication skills of female doctors, mothers prefer

to  take their young children to see women doctors whom  they

feel  may interact and empathise better with children as well

as  with  themselves,  as  women and  mothers.   Since  women

comprise  more than 50% of the population in Singapore,  they

should  not  be denied access to sufficient women doctors  to

cater to their needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Many of the qualified female students who were

rejected by NUS have gone abroad to study medicine.  Many  of

them get married and stay on to work there.  As a result,  we

lose highly skilled talent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) With the strong push for the life sciences

industry,  Singapore needs better trained personnel  who  can

bridge the gap between the pure scientist in the industry and

the medical practitioner.  Women doctors would be well placed

to take up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>



these jobs, as such jobs have more regular working hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore prides itself on being a meritocratic

society.  On this issue, our women are only asking for  equal

treatment in the competition to enter medical school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on ElderShield. It was announced

last  year that ElderShield, the national insurance  plan  to

help  older  people  who  become  disabled,  will  start   in

September  this  year.  While I welcome help  for  the  older

disabled,  I would like to raise some of the inadequacies  of

this proposed national insurance plan.



<br>3.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opt-out scheme will entitle a subscriber to draw

$300 a month for up to five years if the subscriber is unable

to  carry  out  unaided  at  least  three  of  the  following

activities:  eating, bathing, walking, dressing,  getting  up

and  going  to  the toilet.  I would say that application  of

such  criteria means that the subscriber is, in fact, totally

dependent on another person daily.  Sir, may I ask  then  how

such a person can survive with $300 per month?  The situation

will  be even worse for those who are less well-off and  have

no  other savings.  Those who do not look into the details of

the  plan  may,  in fact, get a false sense of  security  and

think  that their old age woes will be taken care of by  this

national insurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of cases of severe disability are the

result  of diseases, such as stroke and so on.  Sir,  usually

this  means  that the dependent elderly will also need  long-term  medications  on an outpatient basis.   At  the  moment,

patients  can  only  claim from Medisave  or  MediShield  for

medical care if they are warded in hospitals.  A tendency for

patients  to opt for institutional care, costing as  much  as

$120  per day, therefore arises.  It is really a pity if  any

national insurance scheme does not address this issue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always the argument that higher disbursements

and  coverage  will mean higher premium  at  the  outset.   I

accept  this  argument, but I also feel that it is  not  much

good  having  an insurance plan that cannot adequately  serve

the  purpose  it is intended for.  I am sure the Ministry  of

Health  has the statistics and resources to better  plan  and

package  a  really  sound  scheme.  The  probability  of  our

Government subsidising the premium, especially for  the  poor

and/or  non-working, must be on the cards.  Sir, in  view  of

our  fast-aging population, it is better to help with a small

outlay  in terms of insurance premium at the outset  than  to

carry  the  heavy burdens later.  A Government  subsidy  will

also  reduce  the  percentage  of  those  opting  out.   More

attention should be paid to the less well-off in our society.

In  relation  to  family income, some sort of cut-off  point,

below  which a subsidy for higher disbursements may be given,

would also be a reasonable consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Health can reconsider the

implementation   of  ElderShield  with  the   above-mentioned

points.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I agree that the ElderShield

scheme  is a good scheme, and it will help older Singaporeans

who  truly deserve something in return.  But I have a  couple

of  issues  to raise with regard to the application  of  this

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I find that the scheme has too many conditions

and  appear to have restricted application.  To benefit  from

it,  an  elderly Singaporean will actually have to be  almost

bed-ridden.  This is because it applies to those  who  cannot

do  at  least three of the following: they cannot move, feed,

transfer, dress, wash or go to the toilet unassisted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the elderly person's claims can be disputed by

a  joint panel of assessors and, if there is a dispute,  then

the elderly person will have to engage his own doctor, at his

own  expense, to dispute the assessment made by the insurance

company's  panel  of doctors.  Most of the  elderly  disabled

will not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>



able  to  afford  paying for this extra cost.   In  order  to

ensure greater objectivity, I would like to suggest that  MOH

appoint  the  assessors  instead  of  leaving  this  to   the

insurance companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, those with pre-existing disabilities and those

above  69 years of age will not be covered.  True, they  will

be covered under the IDAPE, but this scheme covers only those

with  household  income not exceeding $700-1,000  per  month,

which is very low.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, the scheme provides payment for only up

to  five  years.  Beyond that, the disabled elderly  will  be

unprotected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister to be more flexible and to review

all  these  restrictive qualifying conditions,  so  that  the

ElderShield scheme can be more effective and can  cover  more

elderly Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister what more can be

done  to  facilitate  the development of  step-down  care  in

Singapore,  so  that disabled elderly Singaporeans  can  have

more  proper home care and community-based services; in other

words,  providing this ElderShield scheme should be  but  one

facet of a holistic scheme of caring for the needs of elderly

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as the ElderShield is an opt-out scheme, I

would  like to know what measures the Ministry would take  to

educate the public not to opt out of the scheme, as they  may

not need it now but will do so as they grow older.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, our healthcare

system  is based on Medisave, MediShield and Medifund.   They

reflect  the principles of individual responsibility  through

Medisave  savings,  shared risk-pooling  through  MediShield,

with the Government providing a universal layer of safety net

through   Medifund.    These  three   schemes   ensure   that

Singaporeans will have access to quality medical care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a way, the MediShield scheme is a portable

scheme that has a wide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>



coverage.   Although it has been continuously fine-tuned  and

improved after it was implemented in July 1990, I would  like

to  find  out  if  the Ministry plans to enhance  the  scheme

further.  I have four specific suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, bring more Singaporeans under MediShield

coverage.  The scheme is voluntary and Singaporeans  can  opt

out  of  it.  I understand that quite a big number of  people

have actually opted out.  Should we make it compulsory?  What

is  the  number  of  Singaporeans  who  are  not  covered  by

MediShield  or  any  of  the approved CPF  medical  insurance

schemes?   What  more can be done to bring more  Singaporeans

under such coverage?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, include enhanced coverage of non-working spouse

and  children.  This will allow a CPF account holder to cover

his wife and the whole family under the insurance scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, under the present system, the older members have

to  pay  a higher premium.  Would the Ministry consider  pre-funding features for the MediShield scheme?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, enlarging the pool of approved medical insurance

schemes,  so  that more insurers can build portable  features

into   the   basic   schemes.   This  will   facilitate   the

implementation  of  portable medical  benefits.   Apart  from

MediShield,  would  the  Ministry  consider  more   Medisave-approved   medical  insurance  schemes  offered  by   private

insurers  to  make  the  proposed portable  medical  benefits

scheme more responsive to their needs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, the

MediShield  scheme was introduced in 1990 to  complement  the

Medisave  scheme in helping Singaporeans meet  their  medical

expenses  from  major  and  prolonged  illnesses,  which  the

Medisave alone may not have sufficient balances to cover.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MediShield is an important safety net to ensure

that Singaporeans will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>



be  denied critical medical treatment when they are  suddenly

struck by chronic illnesses which may require protracted  and

costly  treatment.  It is a risk-pooling mechanism to  reduce

the overall cost of obtaining medical treatment for those who

are unfortunate enough to need it.  It is, therefore, crucial

that  all  Singaporeans are covered  under  the  scheme.   I,

therefore, share the same sentiment as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that

we  should  encourage all Singaporeans  to  come  under  this

scheme.   Otherwise,  when  they cannot  afford  the  medical

treatment  they  need,  they  will  invariably  turn  to  the

Government  for help.  I would, therefore, like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether his Ministry has plans to  encourage  those

who  are not yet covered under the scheme to sign up for  the

scheme as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main setbacks of the MediShield scheme really

is  that  it is an insurance scheme and, as such, the premium

that  is  paid is not recoverable.  For a person who  remains

healthy,  he  actually gets nothing in return.   Perhaps  one

could  argue  that his greatest return is his  health.   This

perspective  is not wrong. But we should still  ask:  is  the

scheme  cost-effective?  Therefore, I would like to  ask  the

Minister  whether he could let us know how much  premium  has

been collected over the last five years and how much has  the

total pay-out been.  If there is a significant surplus,  then

would  it  be  possible  to  either  reduce  the  premium  to

encourage  more  Singaporeans to sign on, or to  enhance  the

scheme without increasing the premium?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we continue to enhance the MediShield scheme, I

am not sure we can afford to always do so without raising the

premium.  I believe that there is no free lunch and  we  will

need to raise the premium at some point in time.  However, it

is  important that the premium remains affordable, especially

for  the  lower income group, as they need it most.  I  would

like to urge the Minister to ensure that future increases  in

the premium, if any, should take into account affordability.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, in 1993, the Government

published  the  White  Paper  on  affordable  healthcare   in

Singapore.  Despite this, Singaporeans today remain concerned

about  the affordability of healthcare.  There is some  basis

for  this concern as, on average, healthcare costs have  been

increasing  at  the  rate of 6% per year.   Singaporeans  are

asking  what  are  the main causes for the increase,  and  is

there  no control on such increase in costs?  Is the increase

in  costs  due to the increased salaries and fees of  doctors

and  specialists  due  to  the need for  the  Government  and

restructured hospitals to catch up with the private  sector's

pay  scales  and  fees?  If so, then, surely, some  long-term

solutions  will  have  to be found, such  as  increasing  the

supply of such specialists or providing more competition  for

specialist care in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is the rising cost of healthcare in Singapore due to

improvements in medical technology?  If new technology is the

culprit,  then I am a little bit puzzled as to why the  logic

that prevailed in the case of new technology in other sectors

did  not  apply  in  the medical services.   If  we  look  at

technology in other sectors, such as computers, for instance,

we  will  see  that, over time, the price of such  technology

invariably goes down.  So, should not one expect the same for

medical technology?  The new products will be expensive  but,

over  time,  the  same product should be  cheaper,  and  this

should  translate into cheaper medical costs.   At  the  very

least,  it  should not be cited as a reason  to  justify  the

increasing  medical costs.  Also, on the point of technology,

is  there any control over new technology that is being  used

to  determine whether they are really necessary, or just good

to have?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans are also asking, and they want to

know,  whether all these big hospital buildings that  we  now

see  are adding to the increasing costs.  For instance,  will

it  not  cost more to maintain these buildings and keep  them

clean,  compared to the minimalist and spartan  hospitals  of

old?   After all, what anyone who goes to the hospital  wants

is  good and affordable medical care, and he/she will be  too

sick to appreciate the wonderful ambience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister could throw some light on

this  very fundamental issue of why our healthcare costs  are

increasing,  and what productivity and control measures  have

been  put  in  place to prevent the spiralling of  healthcare

costs  in Singapore.  Would the Minister consider setting  up

an  audit committee, a body, for instance, comprising  health

economists  and members of the public, to audit increases  in

healthcare costs in Singapore similar to the role  played  by

the Public Transport Council?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister whether with the

average  6% yearly increase in healthcare costs, the  current

Medisave  contribution rate will be sufficient  to  meet  the

medical  needs of Singaporeans.  The Ministry of  Health  has

explained  before that the Medisave amount is sufficient  for

Singaporeans   to  pay  for  about  10   or   11   bouts   of

hospitalisation.  Could the Minister enlighten the  House  as

to  whether in making this estimation, the Ministry has taken

into  account the fact that many Singaporeans today  are  not

taking care of only their own hospitalisation needs, but they

also  have  to provide for elderly parents who  do  not  have

Medisave savings of their own?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth of the matter is also that, today, those

who feel the most pressurised are those in the middle income,

as  the poor and the lower income have a lot of assistance in

the  form  of  grants and subsidies from the  Government.   I

would  appreciate  a response to these issues  which  I  have

raised for the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I share the concern of

rising  healthcare cost, as highlighted by the  hon.  Member,

Mdm Halimah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, healthcare cost is rising because of several

factors,  such  as  aging  population,  introduction  of  new

medical technology, use of newer drugs which are still  under

patents  and,  therefore, the cheaper generic drugs  are  not

available,  increasing  demand of better-informed  customers,

ie,  the  patients  themselves or their  family,  and  rising

labour costs.  May I urge the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>



Minister  to  look  at the ways to contain  the  rising  cost

before passing them on to the patients and their family?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to paying bills, our healthcare financing

policy  has  always  been to rely on co-payment  to  minimise

abuse and wastage of our healthcare resources.  This is  well

and  good.   However, I am concerned that  in  our  haste  to

recover costs and to balance the budget, perhaps we have been

pricing our healthcare costs too high to the patients, beyond

the  affordability  of some of them.  I feel  that  a  bigger

burden  has been passed on to the patients and their  family,

sometimes more than they can afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point to note is that MOH has actually introduced

means  testing for step-down care services, such  as  nursing

homes and chronic sick hospitals.  It will apply to community

hospital  patients in July this year and I  understand  that,

eventually, all acute hospital patients will also  be  means-tested.   Here,  I  must first declare  my  interest  as  the

Medical  Director of Ren Ci Hospital, which will  be  opening

its  200-bedded community hospital this year.  I  agree  with

the  principle of means testing, so that the poorer  patients

actually get more subsidies while the better-off should  bear

a bigger burden of their medical bills.  However, I find that

our   policy  to  subvent  only  the  poorer  half   of   the

population's healthcare will make it unaffordable to many who

are  caught  in  between.   Under  the  means-testing  for  a

community  hospital, for example, only the poorer  half  will

get  the Government's subvention between 25% and 75%  of  the

cost.   The cut-off is per capita household income  of  about

$1,000.



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate my point using a very simple example.

The  norm cost of a "C" class in a community hospital's  stay

is  about  $200 per day, and the average length  of  stay  is

about  four weeks.  The average cost per hospital  stay  will

therefore  be  about $5,600.  Using our national  statistics,

the median household income is about $3,600.   So if one is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>



unlucky and probably has about $5,000 household income,  most

likely,  he would not pass this means test and he would  have

to  bear  the  whole amount, which is more than  one  month's

income of the whole household.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for those who just pass the means test and are

eligible for 25% subvention, 75% of $5,600 would mean a hefty

bill  of  $4,200.  Compare this to the existing system  which

allows the patients to choose the class they wish to stay, if

they  stay  in "C" class, they will get 80% of the subsidies.

I  feel that more people will be left out with this new means

test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to urge the Minister to

reconsider the policy of subventing only the poorer  half  of

the  population.   Precisely because the healthcare  cost  is

rising, more people are in need of subsidised healthcare.   I

would urge the Ministry to grant more subventions to patients

and to make our healthcare more affordable.  Otherwise, I  am

afraid the coffeeshop talk of "can die, cannot sick" may  one

day come true, which I certainly do not hope to see.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

the  points  I  wish to raise on this amendment are  somewhat

similar  to what my parliamentary colleagues before  me  have

just mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been said to come a long way in improving

the  standard  of  health  and  providing  good  medical  and

healthcare services to its people. Today, the state of health

of   the  people  in  Singapore  has  attained  international

standard.   In  1993,  a  White  Paper  entitled  "Affordable

Healthcare"  was  published, spelling  out  the  Government's

commitment  to  provide good affordable basic  healthcare  to

Singaporeans.  This is done through the provision of  heavily

subsidised  medical  services  in  Government  hospitals  and

polyclinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1990s, the Government hospitals were

restructured with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>



objective of providing quality medical services comparable to

the  private  hospitals.   In  1999,  the  public  healthcare

delivery  system was reorganised into two vertical  groups  - National Healthcare Group and the Singapore Health Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the suggestions of the Remaking Committee is to

develop Singapore into a medical hub.  This kind of foresight

and  spontaneity is a driving force in sustaining  our  long-term  survival.  As our colleagues have said,  we  have  been

constantly introducing more advanced medical technologies  to

Singapore   to  further  enhance  our  healthcare  standards.

However,  my  concern is whether this will cause our  medical

cost to go up even further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, rising expectations of our people for better

medical  and  healthcare services may also be a  contributing

factor to our escalating medical cost.   But a  lot of people

are saying that the Government is trying to recover its cost,

even  the   cost of building hospitals, and that is the  main

reason for raising the medical fees!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am raising this issue because our healthcare

delivery system is based on individual's responsibility  plus

Government  subsidy  to  make the  basic  healthcare  service

affordable. The medical expenses keep going up, very soon the

lower-income group and the elderly in our population will not

be able to afford them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One resident in my Constituency, who is a hypertension

patient, told me that when he was taking the medication  from

the polyclinics in Singapore, it would cost him $1-2 per day.

But when he bought the same medicine from Johor Baru, he paid

only 60 cents for it.  He told me that he had been taking the

cheaper medicine he bought from Johor for the last two years.

He is happy and he is still alive and kicking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether there is some

form  of control on the prices of medicine sold in Singapore.

Since  we are controlling the type of medicines that  can  be

sold  in  Singapore, can we not also check on the  prices  at

which they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>



being sold to the end consumers?   If these medicines can  be

sold at Johor Baru at much lower prices, why cannot something

be  done to ensure that our retailers sell these medicines at

comparable prices?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich people, of course, can go to expensive, air-conditioned hospitals and enjoy the comfort there. For the

poorer  patients, they can only go to a third-class hospital.

The rich people take expensive ginseng and bird's nest, but a

poor  man  can  settle for an inexpensive  glass  of  soybean

drink.  Can we not allow some form of generic medicines  with

the  same therapeutic effect to be sold in Singapore, so that

the  people  in the lower income group could find  them  more

affordable?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Ong has just mentioned that Singaporeans like

to say, "you can die, but you cannot afford to be sick here".

We  should  give the people the impression that in Singapore,

even when you are sick, you will not die.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, affordable healthcare

has  been  a  key  policy  of the PAP Government.   Medisave,

MediShield  and Medifund (3M framework) have been  the  three

main  pillars of our health payment schemes.  I am glad  that

the  Ministry will be improving on the 3M framework, a review

that is long overdue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary healthcare services continue to be affordable

for  most  Singaporeans  due to the significant  presence  of

general practitioners in the HDB heartlands together with the

polyclinics.  This has resulted in a very affordable  primary

healthcare  system.  It is when Singaporeans go to  hospitals

that their cost start to escalate.  This is not unexpected in

hospitals  where  highly-trained staff, expensive  up-to-date

equipment,  well-trained specialists and  branded  drugs  are

commonly  used.  What the Ministry needs to do is  to  review

the  3M  framework  to help Singaporeans  meet  the  cost  of

hospitalisation and outpatient specialist care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicine has come a long way, where in the past, heart

disease, kidney failure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>



or  cancer  spelt  a dismal outcome or even  death  for  many

Singaporeans.   Modern  medicine  has  enabled  many  to   be

treated,  with  a good quality of life. The only  problem  is

cost.    As  such, the Ministry should consider allowing  the

use  of Medisave for diagnosis or management of major chronic

illnesses,  on  an  outpatient basis.   This  should  include

conditions  like  heart disease, kidney failure,  cancer  and

diabetes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medisave withdrawal limit, for many of the

procedures done in the hospitals, has not been revised for  a

very,  very long time.  As a result, many of these procedures

that have become routine, have not been adequately covered by

the  Medisave  withdrawal limit.  It is time  for  it  to  be

reviewed.   For most patients, the last six months  of  their

lives  is  the  period when their medical bill  will  be  the

highest.   MediShield should be revised to  provide  adequate

coverage  for major catastrophic illnesses and to  take  into

account this fact as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is important that our public health

institutions must realise that their aim is not to make money

from Singaporeans.  I wish to quote a case which has troubled

my heart greatly.  A resident had come to see me at the meet-the-people  session because his child was born  premature  in

Mount  Alvernia  Hospital  and required  intensive  care  and

surgical  treatment.   He sought my assistance  to  have  the

child  transferred to KK Hospital.  KK Hospital's  specialist

told  him  that the child needed surgery that  could  not  be

performed  in Mount Alvernia but only in KK Hospital.   After

their   appeal,  KK  Hospital  agreed  to  have  the  patient

transferred to them provided that the family put up a $20,000

deposit to the hospital.  The young couple was at their wits'

end and had to borrow the $20,000 from friends and relatives.

Just  when they thought they had solved the problem and  they

went  to  the  hospital,  they were told  by  the  hospital's

administrators, "No, no, not enough.  Now we need $60,000  as

a  deposit  before we are willing to take your  child".  They

came to see me, utterly devastated.  Finally, the patient was

taken   only  when  Mount  Alvernia  Hospital  had  given   a

guarantee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder how this event would have turned out if Mount

Alvernia  Hospital did not provide a guarantee.   Our  public

hospitals have rallied to the cause of foreign patients  with

poor  prognosis, such as in the widely publicised surgery  of

the   Siamese   twins   and   the   Indonesian   child   with

hydrocephalus.    Would   our  public   hospitals   let   the

Singaporean baby suffer and perhaps, even perish, as long  as

the  parents were not able to raise the money or no  one  was

able  to provide a guarantee?  Are Singaporeans to be  denied

access  to  our public activities because they are unable  to

meet the high fees demanded of them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final letter I got from the hospital was that if I

wished  to  pursue the case further, I should know  that  the

hospital was a cost centre, and economic consideration was an

important  factor.   I am extremely saddened  by  the  entire

incident and I hope it does not signal a policy shift in  our

public hospitals.  Can the Minister reassure all Singaporeans

that  they have a right of access to taxpayers' funded public

hospitals  and  affordability will never be  the  reason  for

denying them admission to a public hospital?



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, the Medifund was an endowment

fund  set  up  by  the Government in 1993.  With  an  initial

capital  of  $200  million, the fund has now  grown  to  $800

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of $27 million has been disbursed in 2001, out

of  $30 million available.  This represents a 90% utilisation

rate.  This implies that the fund has been well utilised  and

has  served its purpose of helping the lower-income  families

cope with their healthcare cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am rather concerned, like other MPs before

me, with the consistent increase in healthcare costs.  If  we

look  at the Economic Survey which was distributed last week,

at  page  98,  there  is a table showing the  consumer  price

index, broken down by categories.  First quarter 2002 saw the

overall CPI decline



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>



by  0.9%  over  the  same quarter in the previous  year.   In

contrast,  healthcare cost increased by 2.4%  over  the  same

period.   The  healthcare category has the  highest  rate  of

increase.  If we take the whole of 2001 compared to the  year

2000, the overall CPI increased by 1%, while healthcare costs

increased by 3.3%, more than three times.  Again, it  is  the

highest  category.   If  we take a longer  time  horizon  and

compare  2001 with 1997, the overall CPI increased  by  2.1%,

while  healthcare  costs went up by 10%, almost  five  times,

over the last four years.  Again, it is the highest category.

Perhaps,  the  quality of healthcare services  has  improved.

But  we  need to keep in mind the affordability of healthcare

cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even when the economy recovers, the job situation

will  remain weak for some time, as the same Economic  Survey

has already pointed out.  Unemployment will worsen before  it

improves. Wages are likely to be further reduced.  Given this

likely scenario, Sir, our people would be very concerned with

the  rising  healthcare costs.  I am glad that the Government

has  promised  that it will absorb the proposed GST  increase

for healthcare services.  But if healthcare cost continues to

rise,  it will negate the goodwill gesture of the Government.

I  would,  therefore, like to urge the Government to  monitor

the  situation  and  take  steps  to  contain  the  rise   in

healthcare costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in healthcare costs over the last few

years, coupled with the unemployment and wage reduction,  may

also  result  in  more people needing help  for  their  basic

healthcare services.  It is, therefore, important for  us  to

ensure  that  our basic safety net, such as the Medifund,  is

adequate in responding to the needs of the people.  The  fact

that  the  utilisation  rate of  Medifund  is  high  is  also

evidence that perhaps more people would need help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister to consider

expanding  the  Medifund  scheme to meet  the  greater  needs

arising from higher healthcare costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in March this

year,  the  Ministry  expanded its Primary  Care  Partnership

Scheme  (PCPS) to provide subsidised dental and primary  care

to  low-income elderly Singaporeans, and extended the  scheme

nationwide.  It  was a significant step to  bring  affordable

healthcare  closer  to low-income elderly Singaporeans.   The

implementation was unfortunately not given enough  publicity.

Not many people know about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As other MPs have mentioned, the general impression

among the people, particularly the old folks, is that primary

healthcare  is  very  expensive and not  easily   accessible.

Some are even afraid to seek treatment when they are sick. It

is  therefore  necessary to allay their fears so that they do

not  have  to  worry so much about having to  pay  exorbitant

medical  fees that deters them from going to the doctor  when

they are sick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite two examples. The ElderShield scheme will be

launched  later  this  year. It is an  affordable  disability

insurance   scheme  that  provides  insurance   coverage   to

Singaporeans  aged  40 years and above who require  long-term

care. It is a significant step in looking after the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>



medical  needs  of elderly Singaporeans. However,  after  the

initial   coverage  over  the  media  when  the  scheme   was

announced,  we  have not heard anything about it  thereafter.

The  vast majority of our elderly people in Singapore do  not

know about the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry of Health and the Health

Promotion  Board's websites have a wealth of  useful  health-related  information.  For example, I found useful  materials

such  as  "Ten  Tips to Stretch Your Health  Dollar",  and  a

section   dedicated   to  elderly   health    issues.    This

information must not just sit in the websites. There must  be

some ways to bring them to the elderly Singaporeans and, more

importantly,  to their families.  No doubt,  there  are  many

people,  particularly the elderly ones, who are not  computer

savvy.  They cannot make full use of this service. I urge the

Ministry  of Health to do more to reach out to these  elderly

people  and  their families and educate them on such  health-related issues.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, I must first declare

that I am a doctor in private practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare in Singapore is at the crossroads. The White

Paper on Affordable Healthcare set the policy directions  for

the 1990s.  Notably, there was no emphasis on Singapore as  a

centre  of  medical excellence.  The present decade  shows  a

marked  shift  in  the  direction of our  healthcare  policy.

While  still  holding  on  to  the  principle  of  affordable

healthcare, the public healthcare system has now set  on  two

very   divergent  courses,  which  are  set  to  strain   its

resources, and create an identity crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public healthcare system was funded on the basis

that  basic  healthcare  service was  to  be  affordable  and

accessible  to all Singaporeans.  There is little doubt  that

healthcare service has improved over the years in tandem with

the  improvement in the quality and standards  of  living  in

Singapore.   This policy is the cornerstone of our healthcare

system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been a marked shift in public

healthcare policy.  In the 1990s, the Ministry of Health  was

content  with letting its specialists earn private fees  from

patients  who  were seen within the hospitals.  Recently,  it

has  allowed some of its specialists to do part-time  private

practice  in the private sector, through its Faculty Practice

Plan.   It has also set up night clinics to compete with  the

over-crowded  and highly-competitive family practice  clinics

in the heartlands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the public hospitals have set up private clinics

in  private  hospitals, such as Mount Elizabeth Hospital  and

Gleneagles Hospital.  The public hospitals are now looking to

provide  services for new private hospitals, who lack certain

specialist  services.   These policy shifts  have  tremendous

implications  for the future of the public healthcare  system

in  Singapore.   The  use of public sector  resources  to  do

private  practice  beyond its traditional confines  has  far-reaching consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it will strain the existing resources. With the

consultants  spending more and more time in  serving  private

patients,  how  much time will subsidised patients  get  from

consultants?  How much time will there be for consultants  to

train  and  teach  the  Registrars and  the  junior  doctors?

Already,  some of the consultants tell me that they  have  no

time  to  see  new  subsidised  patients  in  their  clinics.

Registrars in the public hospitals have told me that they did

not  have any structured training programmes, and these  will

be the consultants of the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is also non-optimal utilisation of

existing  resources.  In the specialist private  sector,  the

public  sector is competing where there is an over- provision

of  hospital  beds.  With the public sector being  unable  to

fill  its own private beds, and occupancy of the private beds

in  the public sector ranging from about 50-70%, it does  not

make  sense  that  the  public sector consultants  should  be

encouraged to use services in private hospitals, resulting in

further under-utilisation of public sector resources.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>



the general practice sector, where there is an over-provision

of  services,  the  operation of  night  polyclinics  further

exacerbates  the  over-provision  of  services.   The   night

clinics  will  also  require  more  doctors,  and  this  will

exacerbate  the shortage of medical officers  in  the  public

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, this is a contradiction of Government policy.

The  move  to  allow  public sector doctors  to  practise  in

private  hospitals  in public sector funded  private  clinics

creates  an anomaly which has gone against the grain of  what

Government  has  preached.  On the one hand,  the  Government

encourages  Singaporeans  to become  entrepreneurs  and  take

risk,  and  yet  in the healthcare sector, it is  willing  to

provide  an umbrella for the public sector doctors,  so  that

they will not have to brave the rain and the sunshine, or  to

be  subjected  to  the  financial risk of  a  private  sector

practice.   If  we  want  to extend this  even  further,  the

Government  might as well run private hospitals  for  private

patients  and justify this by saying that it will  help  them

retain their consultants in the public sector.  If Government

is serious about growing healthcare as an economic driver, it

does  not  make sense to use public sector resources  to  eat

into the same private sector pie in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing healthcare, as an economic driver, goes beyond

attracting foreign patients to come to Singapore.  Healthcare

services  in  Singapore have to expand beyond its  shores  to

where  the  patients are, by expanding services  to  overseas

facilities.   It will expand our patient pool  and  give  our

doctors increased experience through a greater caseload.   If

the  Ministry's aim is to retain specialists  in  the  public

sector,  I  fear that the moves it has taken will cause  more

harm  than good for the public healthcare sector in the years

to  come.  An unintended effect of this is the demoralisation

of  other specialists who are unable to participate in  these

schemes.   In  the  end, the Ministry may have  retained  the

specialists it wants, but the policies adopted will result in

the  loss of innocence, a diminution of their passion for the

subsidised patients and skew their value systems.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, we have heard the

expression "It is cheaper to die than to fall ill."  That, of

course,  is  an exaggeration.  But we do hear that  more  and

more people, especially those in the lower income who believe

that  this is so.  Sir, I think the Ministry should take this

seriously and find ways on how to assure our people that,  in

fact, there are enough healthcare schemes to cover them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a case of a person who came to see me at the

MPS,  and told me a sad story.  Her father fell ill, and  she

thought  that  she  would  just  send  him  to  hospital  for

observation,  maybe for 2-3 days.  Thinking that  the  father

had done so much for the family and made a lot of sacrifices,

she  admitted the father to a First Class Ward.   And  before

she  knew  it, the father's condition got worse, and  he  was

sent to the ICU.  The case got protracted, and the family was

shocked  to receive a bill of $70,000.  In fact, she came  to

see  me  and tried to get some help.  She said that they  may

have to sell their flat to settle the bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is a serious problem of people who

actually  do  not know the full picture, or the ramifications

of  the  cost  of  medical care.  I think hospitals  and  the

Ministry   must  try  to  make  sure  that  they   know   the

consequences of such a decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case I know of is quite a well-to-do couple.

Their  home had been paid for but, unfortunately, they had  a

child  with a heart problem and had to go for surgery.   They

appealed  for  use  of their CPF, because  Medisave  was  not

sufficient to meet the bills.  We applied to the CPF, and  as

expected, CPF said no because of the policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one calls for more information, and the

other calls for flexibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point I would like to raise, is about

healthcare for the elderly - the senior citizens.  I know  we

have  a  primary healthcare programme, which  is  growing  in

terms  of its reach.  But I would like the Minister to  share

with us on the progress of this scheme, how pervasive it  is,

and whether there are ways we could improve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>



the  scheme  to  reach  out to more people.   I  gather  from

feedback that some doctors are not willing to come on to this

scheme, because they find there is a lot of bureaucracy and a

lot  of  paperwork.  Could the scheme be extended  to  people

from  age  60  onwards, instead of 65?   Could  this  primary

healthcare   scheme  be  also  extended  to   cover   chronic

illnesses, and not just simple illnesses like cough and flu?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, it is a known fact that there has

been  a  shortage of junior doctors in the public sector  for

many  years.   The  Ministry of Health's projected  need  for

doctors  had  been  skewed.  There should  be  more  accurate

projections, and the projections must be reviewed at  regular

intervals  to take into consideration any changing needs  and

trends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an urgent problem that we need to solve, but we

should  not  take  any  short cut.  To me,  the  Ministry  of

Health's  reflex response to recruit junior doctors from  our

immediate  neighbours is not acceptable.  Sir, these  doctors

are  graduates  from universities which we  never  recognised

before.  Singapore has been known, or at least we want it  to

be  known,  as a medical centre of excellence, and  this  has

been  built upon the years of excellent training of  our  own

doctors from the best centres.  This prestigious status is in

danger of being tainted by recruiting junior doctors from our

immediate neighbours to work here.  I worry.  If there should

be  any  mishap  caused by these doctors, the confidence  our

patients  from  the region have when they seek  treatment  in

Singapore,  would slowly but surely erode.  I  feel  that  we

will  lose  headway in our effort to be the regional  medical

hub.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this matter is made worse when the Ministry is

continuing  to  implement the 1993 policy of not  recognising

the  graduates  from  over 150 previously recognised  foreign

universities, and is sticking to accepting only graduates  of

20  foreign universities.  The Ministry should now revise the

list  of recognised overseas universities.   Not only can  we

get    foreign   doctors   from   more   reputable   overseas

universities, we can also get back more of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>



our  own  Singaporean doctors who have graduated  from  them.

This  is  especially significant when the  cost  to  train  a

doctor  in  Singapore  is  so much higher  in  comparison  to

medical schools overseas.  Yes, it apparently costs at  least

$500,000  here  as  compared  to  $170,000-$250,000  at   the

universities of Sydney, Oxford and Cambridge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, Singapore has become a de

facto  regional medical centre.  It is common knowledge  that

many  patients  from  our  neighbouring  countries  come   to

Singapore  for  medical treatment and, despite  the  economic

downturn,  business is still good.  However, there  are  some

concerns which I would like to ask the Minister for Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Would the Minister evaluate whether we do have

sufficient  doctors  and  specialists  in  Government  sector

healthcare?



(2)  Are we doing enough to attract, and to encourage

doctors' training and research, to spearhead Singapore's

drive towards the attainment of a bio-medical centre?



(3)  Whether the shortage of specialists is a factor in the

long waiting time for patients in SGH specialist clinics and

National Cancer Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a truly world-class medical hub should be a

responsible one that cares not just its mega-bio projects and

medical  technology, but also one that cares for the patients

and  doctors  who  are the backdrop of the entire  healthcare

system.   This brings me to my fourth question,  ie,  whether

our  medical officers in the Government hospitals  are  being

overworked and maybe potentially unsafe, as reported  by  the

Review Panel led by Lord Ronald Oxburgh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether there is an element of

truth  that  the  morale of junior medical  officers  in  the

Government  sector healthcare hospitals is low and  they  are

overworked.  And has the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



Ministry of Health any plan to improve the service conditions

of the medical officers in the hospitals?



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, nurses are important and an integral

part  of  any  healthcare system, and I want to  beseech  the

Ministry of Health to look further at making nursing  a  more

attractive career option.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is better to increase our own pool of local

Singaporeans  in nursing, as they tend to remain  in  nursing

for  good.   Many  foreign nurses do not have  the  sense  of

permanence in Singapore and, in fact, may just use  Singapore

as   a   stepping   stone  to  go  elsewhere.    Furthermore,

recruitment  of  many  foreign  nurses  can  pose   attendant

problems because of language barrier, differences in  nursing

attitudes as well as other social problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, we have only the Diploma Course from

Nanyang  Polytechnic and the Certificate  in  Nursing  Course

from  ITE.  We do not have an undergraduate nursing programme

for  nurses.   Sir, it is about time this latter  option  was

made available for the following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There is a fast-changing technological advancement

in  science  and  healthcare that requires nurses  to  master

complex  information.   We  need to train  more  professional

nurses not merely as nursing care deliverers but also as care

managers,  coordinators and innovators to keep  up  with  the

changing needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The provision of an undergraduate programme for

nursing  will  also address the shortage of nurses,  as  this

will  provide  another channel for the students  with  better

examination  results, who would not do nursing, by  going  to

ITE or Nanyang Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The undergraduate programme will enhance the image

of  nursing and address the presently "no glamour" perception

of many.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) An undergraduate course will allow the discipline

to  grow, as nurses can then upgrade themselves after  having

graduated in the Diploma and Certificate Courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Having "higher trained" nurses will fulfill the

public's  expectations of getting better and quality  nursing

care,  much  in line with their demands for better healthcare

on the whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) As we need to expand the delivery of home care and

step-down care, we do not just need more nurses but  we  also

need  better  qualified  nurses that can  independently  look

after  patients  in  their own homes  without  the  hospital-setting supports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Degree-holding nurses may reduce healthcare costs

because they will have the extra training that allows them to

perform some of the duties that can otherwise be done only by

doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) We definitely need higher trained nurses to perform

more  diverse duties, as required in scientific and  clinical

projects, to be part of a team with doctors and scientists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, there is a nursing

shortage  in  our  hospitals, and  this  is  acknowledged  by

everybody.   Everyone  knows that nurses  play  an  extremely

important  role  in  our medical healthcare  services,  being

partners  with  the doctors and carrying out doctors'  orders

and  working  with  the  doctors to  perform  procedures  and

surgeries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the two main sources of nurses are through

the  educational  institutions, like Nanyang Polytechnic  and

ITE,   or  direct  recruitment  by  the  hospitals.    Having

recruitment  directly  from  many countries,  like  Malaysia,

China,  Myanmar, Philippines, and having a sizable intake  of

about 600 students through Nanyang Polytechnic, it puzzles me

why there is still a significant shortage of nurses.  If that

is  the  case,  perhaps we should look at what  is  the  rate

limiting factor.  If it is because our institutions  are  not

able to provide adequate places for people to study



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>



nursing,  then  perhaps we should look  at  either  expanding

Nanyang  Polytechnic or allowing other institutions, or  even

hospital  groups, to start nursing colleges  to  provide  for

this absence of educational opportunities to train nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way to manage this problem is to allow the

private  and  public  hospitals  to  increase  their   direct

recruitment  of nurses from elsewhere to join the  hospitals.

I   understand   from  them  now  that   the   Ministry   has

significantly restricted the number of nurses that  they  can

recruit  directly.  I cannot see the reason for this  though.

Will the Minister advise us as to what measures are currently

being  considered or undertaken to resolve  this  problem  of

nursing shortage?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Sir, first,

I  would  like to thank the Members for raising  the  various

issues on healthcare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, address Members' concerns on healthcare

cost,  the affordability of healthcare, because that receives

the most number of cuts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give Members the background. To make sure

that  healthcare is affordable in Singapore, the first  thing

we  must try to do is to keep the overall National Healthcare

Expenditure  (NHE)  down.   Today,  our  National  Healthcare

Expenditure  is  about 3% of our GDP.   It  is  low  when  we

compare  it  with other OECD countries.  They spend,  on  the

average,  between 8-10% of their GDP.  In the US,  healthcare

expenditure is creeping up to 14% of GDP.  For us, 3% of  GDP

is very low, compared to the 8% or 10% of the OECD countries.

Therefore, as a country, it is very affordable.   So  we  are

already ahead in the game.  As long as we keep our NHE  down,

we are ahead of the game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is, having kept the NHE down, who

should pay for it, especially with healthcare cost increasing

every year?  Should it be the individuals?  Should it be  the

Government?  Should it be the employers?  Or should it be the

insurance companies?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In very round numbers, about one-third of our NHE is

borne  by the Government, one-third by the employers  through

the  employer-provided medical benefit schemes, and one-third

by the individual through his Medisave and through his out-of-pocket cash payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question many Members have asked is: is the

individual's share at one-third of the healthcare affordable?

Our  response is that if every Singaporean saves  diligently,

through his Medisave and if he is covered by MediShield, then

he  is  able  to  afford B2 charges.  That  is  how  we  have

calculated  the  level  of savings for  Medisave.   The  cash

component is also affordable to the majority of Singaporeans.

If   we  look  at  the  Household  Expenditure  Survey,  each

household  spends,  on  the average, 3.3%  of  its  household

expenditure, or about $120 per month, on healthcare.  I  know

that  the  last time I compared healthcare cost with  hairdo,

some  segment of the population took offence.  I promised  my

wife that I will not compare healthcare with hairdo anymore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just compare healthcare cost to other forms of

household  expenditure.  $120 per month, which  is  the  same

expenditure  as  a  household spends on telephone  or  mobile

phone,  SMS,  fax and Internet.  So, is that affordable?   In

fact,  the  average  household  spends  more  on  his  annual

vacation.   The average household spends $162  per  month  on

vacations,  which is 26% more than healthcare.  I  would  say

that, on the average, we have kept healthcare cost down,  and

it  is  affordable.   The  cash component  is  affordable  by

Singaporeans, by and large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the low income household Singaporeans, I have

told  Members  before that if they have any MPS  cases  about

Singaporeans  having  difficulty  in  paying  their  hospital

bills,  send  the case to the Medical Social  Worker  of  the

hospital  concerned.   We  have a  team  of  very  competent,

effective Medical Social Workers in the hospitals,  and  they

will  deal with the case.  I have made this offer to  Members

before,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



ie,  if they have any cases that have been rejected and  they

still  feel  that  the cases have merits,  send  the  appeals

either  to MOS or myself.  I am happy to report that  in  the

last three years, both MOS and I have received very few cases

of  such appeals.  So it shows that our system works and that

low  income families, who face financial difficulties in  the

hospitals,  are adequately dealt with.  In fact, 97%  of  the

applications  for  Medifund  assistance  are  approved.   Our

safety nets do work.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.40 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But going forward, when our population gets more aged - today, it is 7% of our population above 65, in 20-30 years,

this  will more than double to 16-17% of the population -  we

have  to  strengthen our healthcare financing system to  deal

with  the  aging population.  When the population  gets  more

aged,  we will find that the component borne by the employers

will  come  down, because the working population  will  be  a

smaller  proportion.   And, therefore, the  employer's  share

will  reduce.  The Government's share will have to  increase,

because  we  have to look after a greater proportion  of  the

aged  population.  The MediShield and the Medisave will  have

to take on a heavier burden because the individual has to pay

for his healthcare expenses as he grows older.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, there are three main things we have to

do.   First,  for  the employers, I support the  Ministry  of

Manpower  and NTUC's move to make employers' medical benefits

more portable, so that even when an employee changes jobs, he

is  covered.  Better still, make employers' medical  benefits

portable beyond retirement, so that it covers post-retirement

period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, for the Government, we would bear our fair share

of  the healthcare cost.  But if we want to keep to our share

at between a third to half, then Members must realise that we

cannot subsidise the entire spectrum of the population.  We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>



must  target  our subsidies to the most deserving,  and  that

means,  at  some  point in time, we would have  to  introduce

means  testing, so that whatever subsidies the Government  is

prepared to fork out, those subsidies are targeted at the low

income, at the most deserving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third prong is, as many Members have raised, how to

reinforce the financing system through allowing better use of

the  Medisave, through expanding the scope of MediShield  and

when  we introduce ElderShield, to make sure that ElderShield

works.  Sir, I will cover these points in turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on means testing. Both Mdm Halimah and Dr Ong

Seh  Hong raised this.  The idea of means testing is not new.

This  was mooted way back in the 1993 White Paper.  It  is  a

mechanism that will allow us to target subsidies at the lower

income group.  As Dr Ong himself has said, philosophically, I

think most of us would not disagree that Government subsidies

should be targeted and given to Singaporeans who are the most

deserving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have some form of self-selection.

Singaporeans who are better off would opt for B1 or  A  class

and  therefore  do  not avail themselves  of  the  subsidies.

Singaporeans  who  are  better  off  would  not  go  to   the

polyclinics and therefore do not compete for the subsidies in

our polyclinics.  As long as this self-selection takes place,

then  I think we can postpone the date of means testing.   As

long  as  the demand is within what our subsidised healthcare

system  can  supply  and  there are no serious  accessibility

problems,  such as long queues and waiting times, then  there

is  no  need to implement means testing in our hospitals  and

our polyclinics.  But if the subsidies keep expanding and  we

need  to  target, then I am afraid, at some  point  in  time,

means  testing  would  have  to  be  introduced.   So  it  is

inevitable that, at some point in the future, we may have  to

introduce  means testing.  So how do we gradually  ease  this

in?    One  approach  is  that  whenever  we  introduce   new

programmes in our polyclinics and in our hospitals, and if it

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>



appropriate,  then  we  introduce means testing  selectively.

For  example, when we introduce the Primary Care  Partnership

Scheme  where  we  allow  our senior citizens  to  see  their

private  GP  clinics  and  still  claim  subsidies  from  the

Government,  then  I  think  that  should  be  means  tested.

Whenever  we  introduce new programmes and it is appropriate,

then we will incorporate means testing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong raised a point about means testing in the step-down sector, particularly in the community hospitals. Let me

reassure  him that we will phase in the target subsidy  rates

gradually  and  we will work with the community  hospital  to

moderate  the  impact on the patients' bills.  We  will  also

give  the community hospitals additional funding so that they

would   not   need  to  increase  their  fees   and   charges

substantially.   We  will  work  with  the  other   community

hospitals  and other step-down care operators to  ease  means

testing  in.  But this is a transition.  In the end, we  have

to decide on the fundamentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked whether we should just subsidise the

lower half, or should we also subsidise the upper half of the

population,  in terms of income.  If today, we  are  spending

one-third of the overall national health expenditure, then it

is inevitable that our subsidy is targeted at the lower half.

Once  we  start subsidising beyond the median into the  upper

half,  then  Government's share of expenditure must  increase

substantially,  beyond one-third to more than  half  to  two-thirds.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the budget for health is $1.6 billion, 1% of the

GDP,  and  that constitutes one-third of the national  health

expenditure.  If we expand it to half, or two-thirds  of  the

national  health  expenditure,  then  we  are  talking  about

increasing the budget to 2% of the GDP.  Every percent of the

GDP,  as Members now realise, is equivalent to nearly  2%  of

GST.   So  we  cannot say do not raise GST, but increase  the

healthcare   expenditure.   Some  where,   the  budget   must

balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the budget that we have, there are still quite a

number of things that we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>



do  to improve the healthcare financing system.  Let me  just

name  some  of these.  First, is universal coverage.   A  few

Members  raised this, especially Mr Gan Kim Yong and  Mr  Yeo

Guat  Kwang.  We have decided that our healthcare system lays

emphasis  on personal responsibility.  It is not the national

health  system in the UK and it is not the private  insurance

system  of  the  US.  But our system puts a  great  store  on

personal  responsibility, and that  is  the  reason  why  our

schemes insist on opt-out.  By and large, a person is in, but

we  give  him  a  choice to opt-out.   So  he  is  personally

responsible  for  that  decision.   It  is  not  a  mandatory

national   social  insurance  scheme.   We  try  to   achieve

universal coverage through an opt-out scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But an opt-out scheme means that some segments of our

population  may  not  be  covered, for  example,  MediShield.

MediShield today applies only primarily to Singaporeans  with

CPF  accounts.   As  a  result, about  74%  of  our  resident

population is covered by MediShield and 26% are not  covered.

This is largely the non-working spouses and children, who are

not  covered.   If  we  look at the working  population,  our

coverage rate is not too bad, at 90%.  But there is  still  a

small segment who are not covered - some of the self-employed

and low income people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how do we increase the coverage? Mr Yeo Guat Kwang

pointed  out that we need to watch out for this group  -  the

self-employed, the low income, the non-working  population  - as  they  are  outside the CPF network.   I  agree  with  him

because  if they are not covered by MediShield and  they  are

struck  by  catastrophic  illnesses,  then  they  will   have

problems paying for their share of the healthcare costs.  So,

in  this regard, my Ministry will extend the opt-out, or  the

auto-coverage mechanism, to non-working spouses, so that they

will  have the opportunity to join the MediShield.   We  will

introduce  a  new  MediShield opt-out point  for  non-working

spouses when couples register for their marriage.  This  will

take  effect  in 2003.  The thinking is that  when  a  couple

registers for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>



marriage and if one of the couple is a non-working spouse and

is not covered, then we will send a little polite note to the

couple  and say, "Congratulations!  One of the spouse is  not

covered, you are now automatically in, unless you sign an opt-out  form."  And we hope that the spouse who is covered  will

not  sign the opt-out form for the non-working spouse.  I  do

not think it will happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my more enthusiastic staff say, "What about

children?  Why do we not send similar letters every  time  we

get  the  registration in the birth certificate?"  I told  my

staff,  "Let us take this one step at a time.  If we do  this

too  much,  then we will be accused of being too  intrusive."

In  any  case, when the children grow up, when they work  and

get  their  CPF account, they will be covered by  MediShield.

So  I think we have some time.  Meanwhile, we will mount more

public  education programmes to get people to sign  on  their

entire family under MediShield.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing we can do is, of course, to extend the

use of Medisave and MediShield.  We will gradually do so, but

I  would  urge that we do so cautiously.  The first thing  we

can do is to allow Medisave for ambulatory care.  Because  of

the rapid advances in medical technology, some of the medical

treatments,  which  are traditionally done  in  an  inpatient

setting,  can  now  be  done in an outpatient  setting.   But

because   Medisave  and  MediShield  currently   only   cover

primarily    hospitalisation   expenses,   we   inadvertently

discourage the right setting of care.  In other words,  there

is  little  incentive for the patients and the  providers  to

seek  or provide treatments at the outpatient settings  since

they are unable to access Medisave and MediShield.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided to extend the use of Medisave

and MediShield to several outpatient treatments, which are in

lieu of inpatient treatments.  This will reduce the need  for

inpatient  hospitalisation and will save costs.  The  changes

for Medisave extension will take effect in October 2002.   My

Ministry will put out a press release on this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, to facilitate patients who need to use step-down care facilities, MOH will also revise the Medisave

withdrawal  limits for step-down care on 1st July  2002.   We

will raise the Medisave annual withdrawal limit for community

hospitals  from  $3,000 to $3,500, and the  daily  withdrawal

limit for hospices from $125 to $160.  Singaporeans who  need

community hospital, or hospice care, would therefore be  able

to use more Medisave and, in turn, less out-of-pocket cash.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, I would like to caution Members that these

changes should not and do not signal that we are liberalising

Medisave and MediShield for general outpatient care.  We must

proceed  cautiously because an overly liberal use of Medisave

would  necessitate  higher Medisave contribution  rates.   We

therefore need to strike a balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is to reset the Medisave withdrawal

limits  and  the  MediShield claimable limits  based  on  the

Diagnosis  Related Group (DRG).  Today, the limits are  based

on  the  number  of days a patient is hospitalised,  the  so-called  "per-diem" basis, and the complexity of the  surgical

procedures, a set of tables.  They may not truly reflect  the

level  of  resources  needed to treat the  different  medical

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are therefore revising the Medisave withdrawal limits

and  the  MediShield claimable limits for inpatient care  and

day  surgery  based on the Diagnosis Related Group,  so  that

they  will be better commensurate with the medical conditions

of  the  patients.  The intention is to enable patients  with

more severe medical conditions to withdraw more Medisave  and

claim more from MediShield to pay for their medical bills  as

compared to today.  These changes are scheduled for the first

quarter of 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth area is really to expand MediShield so that

it  can better cater to the needs for old age.  This is  what

several  Members  have advocated, for example,  Mr  Yeo  Guat

Kwang.   We are looking into this.  And there are two  stages

that  we  will proceed.  The first is to enhance the features

of MediShield in the first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>



quarter  of 2003.  In that first phase, we will increase  the

claimable limits, we will lower the deductibles and  the  co-payment,  and  expand  the coverage to additional  outpatient

treatments and neo-natal care, so that MediShield can play  a

bigger role in our personal healthcare financing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second phase is to expand MediShield to provide

lifetime  coverage, instead of just stopping its coverage  at

the age of 80.  To do so, we will have to introduce some form

of  pre-funding of MediShield.  We will do so in 2004.  Under

this scheme, currently what happens is that Singaporeans  pay

a  higher  premium as they grow older.  So  it  becomes  less

affordable as one grows older.  With pre-funding, what we can

do  is  to get Singaporeans to pre-fund, or collect a  higher

premium,  when they are younger and then when they reach  65,

they  will be covered for the rest of their life.  This is  a

major change and it means quite a major restructuring of  the

MediShield, and we target to do this in 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong said that we need to raise the premiums

if  we  want to do such a major change.  Indeed, we have  to.

Today, MediShield plays a fairly limited role because it is a

catastrophic insurance scheme.  We collect about $90  million

in  premiums  every year.  If we look at the national  health

expenditure  (NHE)  of  about $4.2 billion,  $90  million  is

between   1-2%  of  the  national  health  expenditure.    So

MediShield  is  only playing a piffling role in  our  overall

structure.  If we want MediShield to undertake, say,  10%  of

our  NHE,  something like $400-over million, then we  need  a

four-time  increase  in  the  premiums  to  make  it   really

effective.   So  I am giving Members early warning.   When  I

come  next  to  the House with a major restructuring  of  the

MediShield,  and if we want MediShield to play a  major  role

and  be  the  foundation  for the portable  medical  benefits

scheme, then we need a fairly quantum leap in the coverage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also suggested that we accredit more

insurance  schemes  as Medisave-approved  schemes.   To-date,

besides MediShield, we have four other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>



Medisave-approved  catastrophic illnesses insurance  schemes,

namely,  IncomeShield, HealthShield Plus,  SupremeHealth  and

MaxHealth,  of  which the last two were just introduced  last

year.  Let me just sound this word of caution.  If we have  a

number  of such private schemes and they each take  5-10%  of

the  market share, the danger is that the private sector will

then  cherry-pick the good risks and leave the bad  risks  to

MediShield, and that will make MediShield untenable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to review the guidelines governing the use of

Medisave for approved insurance scheme.  We will consult  the

industry   players.  Our intent is to give  private  insurers

greater  flexibility to offer more products as  long  as  key

safeguards,  such  as deductibles and co-payments  remain  to

deter the "buffet syndrome".  But we must also make sure that

each  player carries a fair share of the good risks  and  the

bad risks.  Sir, as I said, we are targeting to do this study

and  for the major reform of the MediShield, it will take  us

about  a  year and we will be in a position to come  to  this

House with the new scheme before 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area is ElderShield. We introduced the concept

of ElderShield and we got the private sector to tender for it

and  we  are in the position now to implement it in September

this  year.   Dr  Lily  Neo  and Mdm Halimah  raised  several

questions about ElderShield.  Let me just go through some  of

the  key  principles in the ElderShield.  First,  we  decided

that  it  should  be an actuarial insurance,  rather  than  a

social  insurance.  If it is an actuarial insurance, then  it

means  that the pre-existing disabilities cannot be  covered.

That is the industry practice.  Second, we have to decide  on

the  payout ratio.  The current industry norm is 3 Activities

of  Daily Living (ADLs).  If we lower it to 1 or 2 ADLs, then

the  payout  ratio will be higher.  Today,  at  3  ADLs,  the

payout  ratio  is  1:12.   So  that  is  the  whole  idea  of

insurance.  We collect from 12 persons and we pay out to  one

person.  So the premium is low.  If we lower the ADLs to 1 or

<br><br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADLs, then the payout ratio will be much higher.  Then we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>



have  to collect from fewer people to pay out to more people,

in  which case, the premiums will be higher.  As a start,  we

have  decided to stick at 3 ADLs, which is the industry norm,

and that means a payout ratio of about 1:12.



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next feature is the level of payout. We have

decided  on  $300.   Why?  Because if you  are  a  low-income

person  and you are disabled and you have to go to a  nursing

home,  through  our means testing, you will qualify  for  75%

subsidy.  The Government will pay 75% subsidy if you are  the

bottom  10%.  If you are the bottom 30%, the Government  will

pay  50%  subsidy.   The nursing homes  today  charge  around

$1,000-$1,200.  So, your share will be about  $250  or  $500.

Therefore, a $300 payout will go quite a long way to help you

pay for your share of a nursing home.  That is why we decided

on  $300.  We decided on cash rather than claims for service,

so  that  it gives you flexibility.  As Dr Lily Neo said,  if

the patient also has chronic illnesses but stays at home,  he

could  use the $300 for outpatient services, for home medical

or  home nursing.  But in the more severe case when you  have

to  end  up in a nursing home, then the $300 is a significant

percentage  of  the co-sharing of your component  of  nursing

home fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other feature is the payout period. We decided on

five  years or 60-month payout because our survey shows  that

the  average  length  of stay for nursing  home  patients  is

normally between two and five years.  So a 60-month payout is

sufficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me just say that we are launching ElderShield

and  we  want  to  make it as simple as possible  to  get  it

started.   We  have got two private insurers to  provide  the

service.   The  intention is that after they  have  run  this

scheme  for  one or two years, we will encourage the  private

sector  to  have top-up to this scheme.  So this is  a  basic

scheme.   In  one  or  two years, when the  private  insurers

running the scheme have more experience, I see no reason  why

they  cannot  offer enhancements, eg, higher payouts,  longer

payout periods



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>



and  different types of coverage.  So this is just the  basic

coverage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make this scheme work, we need to ease it in. For

somebody who is 40 years old today, it is not a problem.  You

pay  the  premiums, at the age of 65 you are covered for  the

rest  of  your life.  For somebody who is 65 now, to pay  the

premium to be covered for the rest of your life, the premiums

will  be very high.  So we need to find a way to ease it  in.

And  the  way  we  have  done so is to allow  people  to  pay

premiums over a 10-year period, from 59 years old to 69 years

old.   So  we  have a cut-off at 70.  Anybody who is  younger

than  that  will  have a 10-year payout, and  the  Government

will,  in fact, contribute almost a third of the premiums  to

help  make the premiums affordable.  This subsidy will amount

to $360 million.  So we have persuaded the Government to give

us  $360 million to help pay almost one-third of the premiums

of the senior citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, there are two groups - those above 70 and those

with  pre-existing disabilities.  They are not covered.   For

these,  we  have  the  IDAPE scheme in which  the  Government

really  becomes  the insurer.  If they are above  70  or  are

already disabled, the Government will, in fact, pay them $100

or $150 for up to 60 months.  So the Government undertakes to

be  the insurer, because it is not fair to load them onto the

actuarial system.  If we load them onto ElderShield, then the

rest  of Singaporeans will pay.  For this group, in fact  the

Government becomes the insurer, but they will receive half of

what  they will get from ElderShield.  To run this transition

scheme  will  cost  the  Government $300  million.   Just  to

introduce  ElderShield, we have to go to the  Government  and

seek  a  total of $660 million to ease the scheme in.   After

this  transition, when the scheme is on a sure footing,  then

it will be on its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked why we have not promoted the

scheme  more rigorously.  For pragmatic reasons, if  I  do  a

major  promotion  last  year, most  Singaporeans  would  have

forgotten  by  now.  So we target to go out and promote  this

scheme more aggressively between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



June and September when the scheme will be launched.  We  are

enlisting  the  help of all the Mayors to help  us  work  the

ground and launch the scheme from June to September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, for the low-income group, Medifund is a very

important  safety net.  As Mr Gan Kim Yong said, it  is  very

effective.   97%  of  Medifund applicants are  successful  in

their  applications.   We  continue to  review  the  Medifund

eligibility criteria regularly.  Each hospital has a Medifund

Committee  and  it  has the flexibility to deviate  from  the

Medifund   criteria   and  approve  deserving   cases   under

exceptional  circumstances.  That is the reason why  we  have

such  a  high  approval rate.  But it  is  still  within  the

interest income that we are earning from the capital  sum  of

$800 million in the Medifund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On public education, I agree with both Mr Yeo Guat Kwang

and  Mr  Zainul  Abidin  that we have  to  do  more  and  get

Singaporeans,  particularly  our  elderly  Singaporeans,   to

understand  the  system and to navigate the  system.   A  key

component of this is counselling at the point of service,  in

the hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr Zainul Abidin raised the example of one of his

MPS  cases, where one of his constituents decided to send the

parent  to an A-class ward despite our financial counselling,

then  there is very little we can do to help.  If I may  just

reinforce  this point.  As I have said here before,  we  have

universal accessibility to our healthcare system.  As long as

a  patient chooses B2 and C-class wards - I used to give  the

example, unlike lawyers, when Mr Chiam raised this question - we  do not collect deposits when a patient chooses a B2 or C-class ward.  So when Dr Michael Lim raised the example of  KK

Hospital wanting a deposit of $20,000 or $60,000, this refers

to  private patients.  Our rules are straightforward.  If you

are  a  subsidised B2 or C-class patient, you are  guaranteed

access  to  our healthcare system.  There is no deposit.   We

treat  you first and settle the bill later on.  We have  done

so  in  all cases.  We use Medifund for the deserving  cases.

However, if you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>



choose  to  come in for B1 and A-class, that means  you  have

self-selected,  you have decided for yourself  that  you  are

above  the  median and you can pay for the healthcare  costs.

Therefore, we will treat you just like in a private hospital.

We will evaluate what kind of condition you are coming in for

and we will ask you for the relevant and appropriate deposit.

I think that is fair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you go to a private hospital, you have also decided

for  yourself that you do not need subsidies and you can  pay

for  your medical bills.  We are very happy that you are able

to  go and can afford private healthcare.  But, when you want

to  switch  from a private hospital to a public hospital,  we

will deem you as a private patient and, therefore, we require

you to put up a deposit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example that Dr Michael Lim raised is a neo-natal

case.   We  face  several  of such cases  every  year.   They

deliver  the babies, the babies are premature, complications,

so  the bills mount.  One way is to tell the private hospital

that  since they have accepted the patient, it is their moral

responsibility  to  look after the  patient.   If  they  have

accepted the patient, if there are complications, they  carry

on  looking after the patient and, if there is a bad debt, it

is  part  of  their operating costs.  We should  not  have  a

situation  where the private hospitals encounter  such  cases

and   then  encourage  the  patients  to  go  to  the  public

hospitals.  Then the public hospitals become the hospital  of

last  resort.   The  other approach is to  cover  this  under

MediShield,  and this is what we intend to do.   So  when  we

make the changes next year, we will allow MediShield to cover

such neo-natal cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also asked about the role of public

healthcare  institutions.  Let me assure Dr Michael  Lim  and

all  Members here that, today, more than 90% of the  beds  in

the public-sector hospitals are subsidised beds.  That is our

primary  role and remains our primary role.  However,  we  do

run a small percentage of beds for A-class patients where  we

treat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>



them  as  private  patients, whether  it  is  Singaporean  or

foreign  patients.   In  NUH, for example,  foreign  patients

account for less than 5% of the patient-load.  When we  allow

the hospitals to run the Faculty Practice Plan, less than  1%

of  the specialist manpower in the public sector is involved.

When  we  allow them to do so, the hospitals have  to  do  so

strictly  at arm's length, and all their services are  priced

at  market rates.  So it is proper accounting.  There  is  no

cross-subsidy.   Hence,  it is not true  that  we  are  using

public resources to compete with the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also queried why the polyclinics have

gone  into night clinics.  The reason why I have allowed  the

polyclinics  to go into night clinics is because  I  consider

that   as   providing   better  services  for   Singaporeans.

Unfortunately,  it also means a little bit  more  competition

for the private clinics in the area.  But all of us should be

able to take competition in our stride.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have restructured our public-sector hospitals and

polyclinics  so that they are more efficient, productive  and

responsive.  I think this is one of the areas contributing to

our  lower  NHE.  If we had continued running our polyclinics

and  hospitals  like  the old Government departments  without

subjecting them to competition and without subjecting them to

productivity  pressures and efficiency pressures,  the  costs

would   have  been  higher.   The  idea  is  not  for   these

institutions to maximise profits but, really, to bring  costs

down  and offer a better service to Singaporeans.  Last year,

we  went one step forward to position the public sector, both

the Singapore Healthcare Services and the National Healthcare

Group,   the  two  clusters,  as  "Not-for-Profit"   entities

explicitly.     We    designate   them   as    not-for-profit

organisations  so that our two clusters will  preserve  their

sense  of  public  service and have a different  organisation

culture  from the private hospitals.  But that does not  mean

that they do not make surpluses.  They must be efficient and,

with  the private patients, they must charge what the  market

can bear, and they should make surpluses.  They should not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



be  embarrassed by it.  But, having made the surpluses, these

are  not-for-profit  organisations, and they  will  then  use

these surpluses for research, better services and training of

their staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the doctor situation. Compared to

December  2000, in December 2001, we had a nett  increase  of

345  doctors,  or 6.2%.  Our doctor to population  ratio  has

improved from 1:720 to 1:700 now.  If you ask me, the overall

doctor situation is all right.  If we look around, do we have

a  shortage of private-sector GPs?  I think the answer is no.

Many  of  our  private-sector GPs have  to  compete  and  are

struggling.   So there is really no shortage of doctors.   We

do  have  a shortage of specialists.  Not enough doctors  are

becoming   specialists,  and  we  do  have  a  shortfall   of

specialists  in  a few areas, eg, cardiac surgery,  radiology

and  geriatrics.   But, by and large,  the  total  number  of

doctors  is sufficient.  We do have a shortage of doctors  in

the  public  sector.  By our norms, we have  a  shortfall  of

about  12%.  This means that our doctors in the public sector

are  heavily worked.  Instead of working eight or nine  hours

per  day,  they  have to work 10, 11 or 12  hours.   This  is

obviously not sustainable and we have taken action to try and

recruit more and improve the manpower situation.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a national basis, NUS has increased its intake for

medicine  starting in 1996 and, therefore,  we  should  start

seeing more doctors graduating from this year.  The Singapore

Medical  Council  has also exercised greater  flexibility  in

approving temporary registration of foreign-trained  doctors.

That  allows  us  to  bring  in a  few  more  foreign-trained

doctors.  Dr  Lily Neo is not very happy with  this  and  she

feels  that  we are bringing in doctors from neighbouring  or

immediate  countries and that would diminish  our  reputation

and lower the standards of care here.  Let me assure her that

when  SMC  allows these doctors in on temporary registration,

it  means  that these doctors are strictly supervised.   They

are  not  allowed  to  practise on their own.  They  practise

within an institutional framework under close



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>



supervision.   It  is  not  our  intention  to  diminish  the

reputation of Singapore as a healthcare centre.   But  we  do

need them as a way of building up our supply.  Singapore  has

a  very  small  population  and  it  cannot  just  depend  on

Singaporeans to be doctors.  At the steady stage, if  we  can

train  between 230-250 Singaporeans in our university and  we

supplement  it  by  an annual recruitment  of  between  50-80

doctors  trained overseas, both Singaporeans and  Malaysians,

as well as other nationalities, I think it will provide for a

fairly  robust  system.   So we are not  having  a  group  of

doctors that are overly represented by foreign doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the medical intake quotas, there are three sound

reasons  why there is a quota.  First, we still believe  that

we need to have a finger on the supply of doctors. Second, we

have a limited talent pool.  We cannot have all our brightest

students  going  to  be  doctors.  And  third,  the  cost  of

training doctors is very expensive.  There are still  reasons

for us to have a quota.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the one-third quota on female students,

unfortunately, the data still shows that more female  doctors

work part-time than male doctors.  You can either look at  it

as  a container being half-full or half-empty, but that is  a

fact of life.  I have said earlier that we are reviewing this

quota.  In fact, the Economic Review Committee's Services Sub-committee,  chaired  by Mr Khaw Boon  Wan,  is  studying  the

medical manpower requirements, including the quota on  female

medical  students,  in  the  light  of  the  overall  medical

services  review to promote the healthcare services industry.

I would urge Members to be a little bit more patient and give

Mr Khaw Boon Wan a bit more time to complete his study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On nurses, the situation has also improved a little. We

have  a 3.3% increase in nurses compared to 2000.  Our nurses

to  population ratio is now 1:300.  In the public sector,  we

have  vacancies of about 6.6%.  This is a slight  improvement

from  last year's shortfall of 7.5%.  We have taken steps  to

address  this shortfall.  First, we have increased the  total

nursing student intake in Nanyang Polytechnic and the ITE



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>



by  more  than 100 places.  We have looked at salary reviews,

increased the salaries of nurses by an average of 13% in  the

year  2000, and 6% last year.  We have worked out a  clinical

career  path  for  nurses.  Our intention  is  that  we  will

facilitate  around  25% of our nurses  in  taking  up  degree

courses.   Whether  the  degree course  is  done  locally  or

overseas  is  something we have to work with the Ministry  of

Education.   But  we have worked out a career  path  and  our

intention  is  that  25%  of  our  nurses  should  have   the

opportunity to progress to degree courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim suggests that maybe we can set up

overseas  training facilities.  We have the  resources  here.

Our  problem  is  not  training facilities.  Our  problem  is

attracting  Singaporeans  to take up  nursing  as  a  career.

There  is  an article in the Today paper.  It is a three-part

series on nursing.  The most striking feature of that article

is  that some of the students, who take up the courses,  drop

out when they realise quite early in the course that it is  a

very,  very  demanding  career.   If  you  do  not  have  the

commitment, then many of them do not make it.  It is  a  very

challenging and a very demanding career.  Our job is to  make

it  attractive  and  make sure that enough  Singaporeans  are

attracted  to  nursing to serve Singaporeans.   But  for  the

immediate  future, we still need to depend on between  20-25%

foreigners to fill up the nursing positions in our hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I believe I have covered most of the items.

Let  me  just say that for the point on PCPS, I have answered

this  previously in Parliament, so there is  no  need  to  go

through  it again.  Mr Low Thia Khiang also raised about  the

MOs being overworked.  We are reviewing the situation. Today,

there  is  some disparity in the hospitals and  also  between

departments in the hospitals, where some MOs, who are  posted

to  some  departments, because of the shortage of junior  MOs

there,  they  end up having more than a fair share  of  their

night duties.  We have asked the hospitals to review this and

rationalise the situation.  We are keeping a close  watch  on

this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just end by saying that healthcare cost will

continue to go up.  I cannot stand here and tell you that  we

can control healthcare cost to the extent that it will not go

up.  As Dr Ong Seh Hong summarised, there are so many reasons

why  healthcare  cost goes up, many of these are  beyond  our

control.  The more sensible approach is to recognise that  if

you  want  a  level  of  healthcare  equivalent  to  what  is

available in the developed countries, then we must accept the

fact  that  healthcare cost will go up.  It  will  go  up  by

between  4%, 6% or even 8% every year.  So far, we have  been

very  fortunate because our economy also grows by 6%, 8%  and

even 10% in the first seven years in the 1990s.  Our national

healthcare expenditure is able to maintain at 3% of GDP.   If

we  undertake all the changes put up by DPM Lee  in  his  tax

review and we generate the 4-6% growth, that will be the best

bet  for  us to keep up with healthcare costs.  If healthcare

cost goes up 6-8%, our economy grows by 4-6%, we maintain our

national  health expenditure at around 3-4% of GDP, and  that

is the best solution for affordability of healthcare.  If you

do  not generate the growth, healthcare cost will still go up

because  Singaporeans will still want good healthcare.  Then,

we  will  be  in a fix, trying to find the money to  pay  for

healthcare cost.  Having maintained the growth and we contain

healthcare cost to between 6-8%, then we are still  ahead  in

the game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to do, recognising that healthcare cost

will  go  up, is to prepare for the situation in 10-20  years

from  now when a higher percentage of our population is  aged

and  we  have to spend more on healthcare.  This is what  the

tax  changes  are  all about.  What we do  in  Health  is  to

prepare  for  that day.  This means we introduce ElderShield,

we  expand MediShield, we build up ElderCare Fund.   In  case

Members need to be reminded, we launched ElderCare Fund  less

than  two years ago, and because of the budget surpluses that

we were able to generate, we are able to set aside $1 billion

already  in ElderCare Fund.  We build up all these  endowment

funds  during this period where we are enjoying  good  growth

and these endowment funds will serve us well when we are in a

period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



of lower growth because of a maturing economy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Mr Chairman, I would like to

seek  some  clarifications with the Minister.   The  Minister

said  that night polyclinics are a good thing but in the next

breath,  he  himself  said  that the  GP  market  is  a  very

competitive  market,  there is an over-supply  and  they  are

struggling.   At the same time, he said that  there  are  not

enough  medical officers in the service.  He  appears  to  be

contradicting   himself  because  this  is   an   over-supply

situation, and you are not allocating resources properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to seek clarification with the

Minister   whether  the  $20,000-$60,000  deposit   that   is

required, in the example I quoted, is the norm that they  ask

of  foreign patients who get admitted to KK Hospital as well.

Because  in the private sector, none of the private hospitals

do  that.  They accept patients from other countries and they

never ask for $20,000 or $60,000.  If they do that, they will

all shut down!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the example I quoted, where the surgery can

only  be done at a public hospital, does it mean that if  the

family  cannot  fork out the expenses and  no  guarantor  was

available,   the  public  hospital  will  not   accept   this

particular patient and would rather let the patient perish in

the private hospital?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, another clarification is that, as the Minister

pointed  out  very  correctly, most of the  patients  in  our

hospitals  are subsidised, yet our consultants  are  spending

more  and more time looking after private patients.  I cannot

see how the consultants have so much time as I have told him,

from  the ground, already the consultants are telling me that

they do not have time for subsidised patients.  I am not sure

how he can balance the limited resources, encouraging private

sector  practice for the consultants and, at the  same  time,

most of his patients are subsidised patients.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> First, on the primary care sector. In

the White Paper, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



Government  is committed to serving 25% of the market.   This

means  the  Government undertakes that in the  primary  care,

through  our polyclinics, we will service the bottom  25%  of

the  population.  Today, we are around there.  We think  that

with the investment that we have put into our polyclinics, we

should   provide  night  services.  This  means,  of  course,

stretching the doctors further and the CEOs in charge of  the

polyclinics  have  to go out there and recruit  doctors.   My

Ministry has given them the mission that they should  service

the  bottom 25% of Singaporeans and if that service  includes

night clinics, then they must provide the night clinics,  and

if  they do not have enough doctors, they jolly well  go  out

there and recruit the doctors and they have the budget to  do

so.  So that is not a problem of resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on the deposit. This is a special

case  of a neo-natal admission.  So when KK Hospital receives

or  evaluates a premature baby, KK Hospital has  to  make  an

assessment to take over the baby and to look after  the  baby

for  the  next  few months, and in fact, in  one  case,  they

looked after the baby for the next one year.  It is going  to

cost  a lot of money, and therefore, the family should pay  a

deposit commensurate with the severity of the case. It is not

to  say  that  all  private patients coming  to  restructured

hospitals  have to pay a deposit of $20,000 or  $60,000.   It

depends on what case he is coming in for.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know neo-natal cases are very emotional examples. We

had one appeal, probably the same case.  KK Hospital admitted

the  baby,  even though they were very reluctant  to  do  so.

Because the appeal came to me, we asked KK Hospital to admit.

I  regret making that decision because, in the end, the  baby

continued to be in intensive care and KK Hospital now runs up

a total bill of more than $300,000.  These are very expensive

cases.  When a baby is born prematurely, it requires a lot of

resources  to  keep the baby alive.  I had a long  discussion

with  my Minister of State, Dr Balaji, and I said, "Is  there

any way you can tell whether there is brain damage?"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



Being a neurosurgeon, he said, "There is no way you can tell.

It  is only after one or two years that you will know whether

the  whole  period of premature birth has resulted  in  brain

damage."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is a very sad situation, but unfortunately we do

have  these  types  of cases of neo-natal  babies,  premature

babies.  If the family is unfortunate to have such a case,  I

sympathise  with them.  If they want to keep the baby  alive,

the hospitals want to help, but they must find the resources.

And  that  is  the reason why I have decided to include  neo-natal  coverage within MediShield.  It may not  be  the  best

decision  because, in the end, somebody has to  pay  for  the

cost.   What we are doing is then sharing the cost among  all

of  us,  Singaporeans, and not just on the families that  are

unfortunate enough to have such a baby.  So anyway, from next

year  onwards,  we  hope  to incorporate  neo-natal  coverage

within MediShield.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the extension of the specialists in the faculty

practice, let me again assure Dr Michael Lim that it  is  not

the  MOH's  policy to ask our specialists in our restructured

hospitals  to  set  up clinics in a private  hospital  or  to

undertake  faculty practice.  We leave that decision  to  the

CEO   and  to  the  departmental  heads.   The  CEO  and  the

departmental heads, in managing the specialists  under  them,

must  make sure that allowing these specialists to look after

private  patients through the faculty practice, that they  do

not  compromise  the  level  of  service  to  the  subsidised

patients.   The  Ministry of Health signs a  3-year  contract

with  our  restructured hospitals.  We set down  very  strict

conditions  of  service standards, etc, etc.   They  have  to

undertake  to meet these service standards.  If the  CEO  and

the  departmental heads allow their specialists to  undertake

faculty  practice  and  fail  to  deliver  on  these  service

standards to the subsidised patients, then under the  service

contract  that we have with them they will pay a  very  heavy

price.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek two clarifications

from the Minister?  How



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



long does the Minister expect to ease the problem of shortage

of  doctors  in  public hospitals?  Secondly,  Sir,  has  the

current  shortage  and overwork of doctors in  the  hospitals

affected the medical standard of public sector hospitals?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I mentioned in my response,

we  are  currently facing a shortage because  our  population

expanded  since  1993, and our medical intake  only  expanded

since  1996.   So, for these 6-9 years, we have  a  mismatch.

But,  starting  from this year, we will be getting  a  higher

intake of graduates from our medical school, and we are  also

bringing in more foreign doctors.  So that would relieve  the

situation.  I expect the doctor situation to improve over the

next five years.  But that is not a guarantee.  We still have

to  continuously  adjust our working conditions,  adjust  our

remuneration  structure,  to  make  sure  that   our   public

hospitals  are competitive, and that we are able  to  attract

our fair share of doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service levels are not so adversely affected. As I

mentioned  last  year,  we engaged  a  group  of  operational

research  consultants to look at the queuing system  and  the

waiting  times.   We are now finalising  the  study.   If  we

introduce some of the proposals that the consultants put  up,

I  am  confident that we can improve the level of service  in

our public hospitals.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I seek clarification, Sir? The

Minister  did  not  reply  to my earlier  question  regarding

recognising the graduates from over 150 previously recognised

foreign universities.  May I also ask the Minister whether it

would  not  be  better  to  review this  policy  rather  than

recruiting junior doctors from neighbouring countries,  whose

universities we had never recognised before?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, even though we do not recognise

or we stop recognising some of these institutions since 1993,

they   are   still   allowed  to  come  in  under   temporary

registration.  So we are not forgoing these sources.  Even if

I  make  a decision, or we get a decision to recognise  these

institutions,  it  would be another 5-6 years  before  people

decide that, now that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>



it  is  recognised, they send their children there  and  then

they  come back after graduation.  So what I am talking about

is  a  temporary  shortage.  We have  increased  the  medical

intake.   When we start taking the 230-250 doctors  from  our

local  NUS  and we continue to recruit between 50-80  doctors

overseas, we will have a complement of about 320-350 doctors,

and  that  is enough for our needs.  So there is no  need  to

change  the  rules  of  the game.  The  current  shortage  is

temporary,  transitional shortage, and within  2-3  years  we

should get over the worse of this shortage.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Chairman, may I just disagree with the

Minister on what he just said?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you please proceed to your next cut?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> The importance of preventive healthcare is

a  foregone  conclusion, and I am glad  about  MOH's  visible

increased effort in this area presently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to specially mention the success of the

Check-Your-Health   (CHS)  programme  in  identifying   those

elderly  with  undiagnosed diabetes,  hypertension  and  high

blood  cholesterol.  From the launch of CHS in July  2000  to

February  2002,  40,230 persons have been screened,  and  the

overall  participation rate is 24%.  But,  more  importantly,

among  those  screened,  about  60%  had  not  attended   any

screening  before, and 60% of the participants,  who  had  no

previous history, were detected with abnormal result  at  the

screening.   70%  of  those  who were  referred  for  further

management  consulted a doctor within three months  of  their

screening.   Therefore, this programme  has  been  useful  in

helping residents diagnose the three common diseases, and  in

enabling  them to seek early treatment, and in ensuring  them

to  lead a healthier and happier life.  I do believe that CHS

is  a  worthwhile  programme and should continue  to  receive

funding  for screening even more of our elderly.  I hope  the

Minister will consider this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Mammogram Screening/Breast Screening

in  Singapore,  a  population-based breast  cancer  screening

programme launched since January 2002, has been so successful

that  it  was  overwhelmed by the demand for such  screening.

Two  months  after its launch, the Breast Screen Call  Centre

received  about  12,500 calls.  About 9,000 women  have  been

given  screening mammography appointments, but of these  only

5,380  have  been screened as there are only four polyclinics

offering  screening mammography services.  I  know  that  MOH

plans  to  open more screening centres to cope with the  huge

demand, and I hope MOH will do this expeditiously to cut  the

waiting  time for women who have registered for screening  so

that more women can be screened more quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health, Sir, must ensure continuity and

lasting   follow  through  of  all  efforts   on   preventive

healthcare.    For   example,  in  those  cancers   affecting

Singaporeans,     especially    those     with     hereditary

predisposition,  there  should be a programme  in  place  for

immediate  family  members  of  affected  individuals  to  be

screened  for  specific  cancers.   There  should  be  public

education targeted at these families to improve understanding

that they are more prone to certain cancers.  By being target-specific,  it  will  be more cost effective,  especially  for

those  cancers  that  are too expensive for  screening  as  a

national programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example concerns mental health, which has not

received  its due attention.  There must be new  emphasis  on

mental  health as the present rate of depression in Singapore

is 8.6% now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since morbidity and mortality from any disease can

be  dramatically reduced when the disease is treated  in  the

early stages, more emphasis should now be given to our people

in  the younger age group.  Heart diseases are a major  cause

of  death  presently, and are likely to increase in incidence

under  present trends.  Heart diseases would take  root  when

people  are  still  young,  in view  of  the  kind  of  diet,

lifestyle  and  predisposing medical  conditions  which  they

have.  We need to target them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>



for   increased  public  education  in  this   respect,   and

facilitate  them  in  early  disease  detection   and   early

prevention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, targeting this adult group population needs much

creativity, funding and enthusiasm.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, as reported in the Business

Week,  27th  May issue, the American National  Mental  Health

Association  estimates that 19 million or one  in  every  ten

adults suffers some form of depression in a given year.   The

total  retail sales of the anti-depressant medicine  in  year

2001  alone  was  US$12.5 billion.  Why I mentioned  this  is

because,  Sir, we are not much better.  Our Annual  State  of

Health  Year  2000  Report, for example,  cited  a  study  on

depression, that found a prevailing rate of 8.6%.  The number

of  new cases of young people under 18 visiting psychiatrists

in  our Government clinics also doubled from 1,126 in 1990 to

2,491 cases in the year 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have done quite a bit for the promotion of

physical  health.   I  think  now  we  need  to  do  more  in

preventive  mental  healthcare.  I  would  like  to  ask  the

Ministry,  whether it has plans to do more in  mental  health

promotion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan Cheng Bock you may take both cuts

together.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> I remember in the last

Parliament we were talking about case-mix, and I often wonder

whether  Members  of this House really understand  what  this

term  means.   But,  I  think  Members  in  this  House  must

understand  case-mix because the subject that I am  going  to

talk about actually is related to case-mix.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would try to be very brief and just be as simple as

possible so that you all can really appreciate what I want to

say.   Very  briefly, case-mix to me is actually  a  patient-management programme, ie, to improve the care of the patients

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



hospitals with minimal wastage.  So guidelines were then  set

to  make  sure that doctors manage patients effectively,  and

discharge them at the earliest opportune time.  To make  sure

this happens, funding to the hospital is related to this,  so

that you will have to make sure that the patients you see are

within that funding limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a very easy example so that you can

follow  me.  Let us take the example of a patient with  acute

appendicitis,  and assuming that they have gone  through  all

the  records,  and  they think maybe a 4-day  stay  would  be

sufficient,  to manage and treat patients with  appendicitis.

And,  that should be the length of period that he is  allowed

to  stay. Let us say, if he exceeds that period, then funding

would be reduced or even stopped.  So it makes administrators

of  such  hospitals  to think very carefully  and  to  advise

doctors  that  they should try to treat the  patients  within

that 4-day period.  However, I am sure sometimes the patients

have  no  choice.   Cases  do get complicated  at  times  and

therefore it exceeds the 4-day stay, and when you do that,  I

think  administrators  of hospitals  will  be  a  little  bit

uncomfortable  because they see that their  funding  will  be

curtailed.  You cannot blame them because they have  to  look

at the bottom line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what actually happens is that you might really get

some  patients  being discharged earlier  than  they  should,

because as I said, they need to look at the bottom line.   In

fact,  I was so sad when I heard Dr Michael Lim mention about

a  young couple with a child going to KK Hospital and finding

difficulty  to  seek  admission.  And what  is  more  is  the

content of the letter, the reply to Dr Michael Lim, attaching

the  importance of cost to this.  We all understand cost, but

sometimes  the  way the letter was written, I  think,  really

hurt  him.   That is why he probably brought up this  matter.

Now,  you also can understand how case-mix, because the  fear

of  less subvention, I suspect that some of the cases may  be

discharged earlier.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am coming to this House to ask the

Minister to be more generous in the funding to all these step-down care facilities that are provided by volunteers and also

by   some   of  our  own  Government  agencies.     Step-down

facilities  are  of  various kinds.  You  have  the  day-care

centres.  You have your occupational centres.  You have  your

rehabilitation centres, and so on.  But I think  these  high-end  step-down cases are quite special because  the  patients

really  need post-hospital care - hospital setting to  manage

that  difficult period.  I think our outpatient  clinics  are

not  able  to  do  that because they do not  have  in-staying

patients.   Community hospitals can do the  job  but  when  I

heard  Dr Ong mention about the new funding, there is a means

test  that is being bandied around, and they want to  have  a

different  way of funding.  When I heard Dr Ong  talking  and

being  worried  that subvention grants may  be  curtailed,  I

worry  that  some of these facilities, ie, the high-end  ones

and  even  the lower end ones, they might trim facilities  or

they might even close down some of the facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the Minister will give assurance to all

these  people who put so much effort in setting up all  these

facilities, not only grants but also a lot more support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The means test has been mentioned. So to cut short, I

shall not speak so much on means test.  It has been very well

articulated by Dr Ong.  I think he can do it better  than  I.

I  shall  now  move  on  to ask just a  few  questions  about

outpatient clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outpatient clinics have done a remarkably good job.

They  are  the first line of defence, the primary healthcare.

Since  we  are  talking about remaking of  Singapore,  I  was

wondering  whether the outpatient clinics would  also  remake

their  role.   Perhaps  we  should  make  some  collaboration

studies  with  the  private  practitioners  to  open  up  the

facilities for better use.  We spend so much money  providing

all  the  facilities to outpatients.  Maybe  we  could  share

these facilities with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



the  private  practitioners to ensure better service  to  our

Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, like my colleagues before me, I

am concerned with the way in which the prices of prescriptive

drugs are being regulated in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From anecdotal evidence, and as well as illustrated by

Comrade  Ong  Ah Heng earlier on, we know that  the  cost  of

prescriptive drugs in this country can be just as  expensive,

if  not  more expensive than similar drugs found in countries

such  as Australia and New Zealand.  As a matter of fact,  it

is  not  just  patients  but even doctors  in  Singapore  are

driving  up  to  Johor to buy prescriptive  drugs  for  their

clinics  because  they  are  cheaper  than  those  found   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister enlighten us as to whether there is a

regulatory  body in Singapore that monitors prices  by  which

drugs  are  sold  in Singapore to ensure  that  there  is  no

overcharging?  If there is indeed such a body, may I ask  the

Minister to share the measures that his Ministry has taken to

keep  drug prices affordable?  If there is not such  a  body,

would the Ministry consider setting up one?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question stems from the concern that there is an

absence   of  transparency  in  the  pricing  of  proprietary

medicines and vitamins in Singapore and from the concern that

our  costs may be too prohibitive relative to that prevailing

in  developed  countries.   Just  to  give  two  examples  on

vitamins.  For vitamins like Nature's Farm vitamin E 500 soft

gel pack of 50 tablets, I know that they can be purchased  in

Johor  at half the price of what we have to pay in Singapore.

I  was  also  told  by  a resident during my  meet-the-people

session  that for calcium tablets that come in a pack  of  30

tablets that he purchases from SGH pharmacy at something like

30% discount, he has to pay $21 per pack.  For a similar type

of calcium tablets, he was told by his son that he needs only

to pay A$7.00.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related matter, I would also like to ask the

Minister to clarify whether there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



are  measures  taken  by  the hospitals  to  make  sure  that

patients  are not being prescribed drugs which are marginally

more  effective than other drugs, but for which the price  is

far higher than the other equally effective drugs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> I thank Dr Lily Neo for having good things to say about our

preventive   healthcare  programme.   The  community   health

screening programme has indeed been very successful since its

implementation two years ago.  My Ministry will  continue  to

promote  and provide for this community screening  programme.

Forty  districts  have already been covered.   We  intend  to

cover another 48 by next year, and after that this will be an

on-going  programme.  And those who have  gone  through  once

will   go  through  again.   So  this  will  be  an  on-going

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national breast cancer screening programme has also

been  extremely successful and large numbers of  people  have

called  to have appointments for the screening.  But I think,

with  time, the demand for the screening will level  out  and

then  the  waiting  time  for  screening  would  become  much

shorter.   The  Ministry  is also increasing  the  number  of

polyclinics that will have this facility from eight to 11  by

the end of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Lily Neo and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang have brought up

their  concerns about mental health.  We need a healthy  mind

to  deal  with the current problems that Singapore is facing.

My  Ministry  recognises the importance of  promoting  mental

health  among  Singaporeans.  To place  greater  emphasis  on

mental  health,  a mental health education programme,  called

"Mind  your  Mind",  was implemented in 2001  by  the  Health

Promotion  Board  and the Institute of  Mental  Health.   The

programme aims to promote mental wellness and raise awareness

of the importance of early screening, detection and treatment

of  the  common mental conditions such as stress, depression,

anxiety disorders and schizophrenia.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



programme  is  targeted  at  all Singaporeans,  children  and

adolescents, adults and the elderly.  We are using a  variety

of strategies to reach out to the target groups.  Mass media,

talks  and  forums are carried out to create public awareness

of  the  importance of mental health.  To  impart  skills  to

healthcare  professionals for the early  detection  of  these

mental  conditions and mental stress problems  that  patients

may  have,  workshops and training courses are being  carried

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Dr Tan Cheng Bock's concerns about case-mix and step-down facilities. First of all, I want to

clarify what case-mix is.  Case-mix is a statistical  way  of

reimbursing  hospitals.  What happens is that an  average  is

taken  for  a  condition,  based on the  cumulative  cost  of

treating  the  condition  in the population  divided  by  the

number  of  people who have that condition.  So the hospitals

will  make  some  profit in some cases and  losses  in  other

cases.  But, overall, the hospitals will not be worse off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found in the United States that the

introduction  of case-mix or case-mix like systems  leads  to

efficiency  in  the  hospitals.  For  case-mix  to  work,  it

requires  doctors to be professional and that  doctors  would

treat patients not using case-mix criteria but treat patients

according to what patients need.  If administrators do  their

job   and  look  at  the  bottomline,  and  if  doctors   act

professionally and treat patients as they should be  treated,

what  we  will  end  up  having is an efficient  system  that

provides healthcare for Singaporeans as well as providing the

correct treatment for patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to step-down facilities, over the last 10

years MOH has been putting in place facilities and programmes

to  meet  the requirements of an aging population.   We  have

five  community hospitals, 16 VWOs' nursing homes and 21  day

rehabilitation centres.  These have been set up  at  a  total

Government subsidy of $225 million for capital cost and  $200

million for recurrent funding.  Another $82 million has  been

provided for the financial year.  So my Ministry has a  great

concern  that  there are sufficient step-down facilities  for

patients.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to means testing, the Minister has already

explained the rationale for means testing, and I will not  go

into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan also asked about the polyclinics and their

cooperation with general practitioners.  Our polyclinics  try

to  work  with  general practitioners  in  the  community  to

provide  effective and efficient service for  the  community.

Among   the  areas  of  cooperation  between  GPs   and   the

polyclinics  are that polyclinics allow patients referred  by

GPs  to  use  their services such as X-rays, mammography  and

laboratory   services.   These  patients  are  charged   non-subsidised  rates.   X-rays  and  mammography  services   are

relatively  well utilised by the GPs.  Patients  referred  by

GPs  constitute half of X-ray workload and a quarter  of  the

mammography  workload in some polyclinics.  These  are  clear

indications of the level of cooperation between the  GPs  and

polyclinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, patients referred by GPs can undergo

diabetic  eye screening at polyclinics.  They can also  refer

patients  to  purchase  drugs from the retail  pharmacies  in

polyclinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho brought up the question of cost of medication.

In Singapore, as a whole, we spend approximately $450 million

on  prescription  drugs annually.  Generic products  make  up

just  over  10%  ($54 million) of the local market.   Various

branded  proprietary  drugs  account  for  about  90%   ($396

million).  Branded drugs are produced by the major R&D  based

pharmaceutical companies.  They are generally higher  priced.

These  companies  control the prices of the medication  while

they  are under patent protection, in order to recover  their

R&D  costs.   They might price their products differently  in

different  countries, and we do not have direct control  over

these companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a great difference in price between a

generic and a branded drug.  So, it is possible, for example,

in calcium supplements, if you buy branded medication, it may

cost many, many times more than a generic calcium supplement.

So this may explain why there is such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>



a  difference  in  price with regard to the  person  who  has

bought it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we do not have a regulatory body to

control drug prices, and the market is allowed to set its own

price.  The Ministry of Health does not intend to set up such

a  regulatory agency.  However, the Ministry of  Health  does

monitor the price trends of pharmaceuticals through the  data

available   from  the  group  purchasing  office  that   buys

medicines  for  the  two  hospital  clusters.   However,   in

response  to  concerns expressed by the public  on  the  high

prices of medicines in Singapore, the Ministry did commission

a  study  by  a task force.  The task force has made  several

recommendations.   We  are studying the  recommendations  and

would decide on some measures maybe later in the year.



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Just a small point of clarification

on  GP and OPD cooperation.  I just want to find out that, in

the  past,  when  a GP referred a patient to  the  outpatient

clinic  and  he was referred to the hospital,  he  paid  very

little,  ie,  only the C class rate if he could  not  afford.

But  now I learn that, by way of the same procedure,  let  us

say, if a patient is referred from the GP to the OPD and then

to  the hospital, he is now charged more when he goes to  the

hospital.   I  am  not  sure whether this  is  true  or  not.

Without  the  GP's  letter, he is charged less,  that  means,

there  is  no point for the patient to go and get a  referral

letter from the GP any more.  If he gets a direct referral by

the  OPD to the hospital, it is cheaper.  But through a  GP's

letter, it is more.  In the past, it was not, because some of

the   patients   have  told  me.   So  I  am   just   seeking

clarification.  You may not be able to answer it,  but  never

mind, you can give me an answer later.



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> I think where a GP refers a

patient to a Specialist Clinic ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> No, it is not a Specialist Clinic.

It is just to the hospital.



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> In this area, the two clusters

have  been  working with the GPs to try to come out  with  an

efficient system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>



of  admitting  patients to the hospital.  And  in  fact,  the

clusters  are  working  by allowing  GPs  to  admit  patients

directly to the hospital.  With regard to the specific  case,

if  he can send the information to my Ministry, we will  look

into it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> I think I agree with you. But I

would not want to prolong this.  I will bring it up with  the

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim Hng Kiang, you have got something

to add?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I just want to supplement what MOS

Balaji has said about case-mix because it is a very important

point that Dr Tan Cheng Bock raised.  As MOS Balaji said,  if

the  doctors  do  their  job professionally  and,  say,  your

appendicitis case, the patient needs to stay in the  hospital

for  10  days, what happens is that the Ministry will subvent

the  average  of four days under case-mix and the  additional

six  days will be subvented on a per diem basis.  So as  long

as  doctors do their job correctly and, say, this patient, in

fact,  needs  to stay 10 days, we will give the  patient  the

subsidy for the average of four days, the statistical  method

under  case-mix, and the additional six days on  a  per  diem

basis.   So  we  are  not pushing people  to  be  prematurely

discharged.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Neo, can you withdraw your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I seek further clarifications from the

Minister  as  I am not satisfied with the Minister's  earlier

reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we are behind schedule, Dr Neo.

Okay, I will allow for one more clarification.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> The Minister said earlier that he did not

want  to  review the policy of recognising the 150 previously

recognised  universities  because  the  doctor  shortage   is

temporary.   May I ask him whether his Ministry's  projection

of doctor shortage is again skewed, especially in view of our

long-term emphasis on life



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>



sciences?  Was it not recommended by a foreign university don

that,  in  fact,  Singapore needs another medical  school  to

train more doctors?  The Minister earlier also said that  the

junior  doctors from our neighbouring countries  are  working

here  under strict supervision.  May I then ask the  Minister

what  is the point of having junior doctors working here when

they need supervision?  Surely, this defeats the purpose  and

therefore taxing our senior doctors further by having to look

after  these junior doctors from our neighbouring  countries.

The Minister also said earlier that competition ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Neo, I said I will allow only one

clarification.   You  have raised more than  one.   Will  the

Minister reply first?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I shall reply to one clarification.

All  junior doctors work under supervision.  So when we bring

junior  doctors from neighbouring country, the senior doctors

also continue to supervise them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Neo, can you withdraw your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Can I not have further clarifications,

Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are running behind schedule. Why not

raise your question to the Minister on a separate occasion?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I beg leave to withdraw my amendment

reluctantly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Dr Chong Weng Chiew.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code OA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since we are short of time, I would like to forgo

my first cut and go to the second cut on home medicare.  Sir,

there is a quiet revolution going on in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>



healthcare  system.  In the 80s, we have rejected  the  means

testing  in  deciding  who  is  eligible  for  what  kind  of

subvention  and, presently, we are seeing the  implementation

of  means  testing from outpatient to step-down care services

and,  eventually,  also  to  acute  hospitals.   This  is   a

significant change in our healthcare policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also more subtle changes in our healthcare

delivery  system.  For instance, in our attempt to take  away

some of the pressure on the demand for hospital beds, we have

introduced  step-down care services.  In  other  words,  when

someone suffers from an acute illness, for example, a  stroke

or  heart attack, he will be admitted to a hospital, such  as

SGH  or  NUH.   After that, the patient is on a  recuperative

stage  and,  hence, does not need the services  of  an  acute

hospital.   Step-down  care services henceforth  will  be  in

greater  demand and will increase in importance, in the  near

future, in our fast ageing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge MOH to place emphasis on one

of  the newer approaches to healthcare delivery systems  and,

that  is, domiciliary medical care, a form of step-down  care

services.   When  a  patient  is  discharged  from  an  acute

community  hospital,  most of these  patients  still  require

follow-up  treatment.  In many of these cases, they  are  not

fully  ambulant,  such as post-stroke patients  and  patients

after amputation.  It would be a chore for these patients  to

go  for follow-up treatment at the institutions.  Thus, there

is a need for the concept of domiciliary care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this consists of would be a team of professionals,

such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists.  They will  get

referrals  from  hospitals and conduct  home  visits,  giving

treatment  and follow-up in the comfort of the homes  of  the

patients,  who probably are home-bound.  The physiotherapists

in  the  team could provide much needed treatment, especially

for  post-stroke  patients.  Currently,  these  services  are

provided by a handful of voluntary welfare organisations  and

the demand far exceeds supply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another advantage of such a system will go towards

bringing  down national healthcare expenditure  (NHE).   When

this type of service is in place, it will release demand  for

hospital  beds, as there are certain groups of  patients  who

could  be discharged earlier to recuperate in the comfort  of

their  homes.  And this group of patients would include those

on intravenous drugs, those who are recuperating from stroke,

as  well  as  those  post-operation cases.   And  this  would

benefit  very  much from home physiotherapy, or home  medical

treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would urge the Ministry to (1) encourage more

organisations    to   provide   domiciliary    medical    and

physiotherapy services; and (2) to provide funding  for  such

organisations who are willing to take up this difficult task.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You may speak on the next cut, Dr Chong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> I would now go on to the cut on

AIDS  patients.   HIV or AIDS patient is a feared  and,  yet,

misunderstood  disease.  As a medical doctor,  I  am  of  the

opinion that we should not be judgemental.  Presently,  under

the  ElderCare Endowment Scheme, the Ministry of  Health  has

recently   sent  out  a  circular  requiring   all   approved

healthcare providers, meaning nursing homes and hospices,  to

admit   all  Singaporeans  and  PRs,  regardless  of  disease

condition, including HIV positive or AIDS patients.   Failing

to  do  so  might  result  in  revocation  or  suspension  of

subvention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, AIDS patients, like all patients, desire to be

treated  fairly.   They  should not be discriminated  against

because  of  their  disease.  Since the  disease  is  such  a

dreaded  one,  I would urge the Ministry of Health  to  be  a

little   bit  more  sympathetic  to  approved  providers   in

requiring them to accept AIDS patients.  Many of the approved

providers  are  prepared  to accept patients,  regardless  of

their  diseases,  and  are  preparing  their  staff  for  the

eventuality.  However, they appeal to the Ministry of  Health

for  a little more flexibility and time as they find it tough

convincing their staff.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some service providers are already experiencing a loss

of  staff  over  this  issue.  Others are  prepared  to  lose

Government's subvention if they have no other choices.  There

are   also   some  approved  providers  who  have   volunteer

caregivers  in their set-up.  And it is difficult  to  retain

voluntary  help over the issue of accepting and working  with

AIDS patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while some of us are comfortable in dealing with

HIV  positive or AIDS patients, I am afraid the community  at

large is just not ready.  Thus, I would urge the Ministry  to

give  the  approved providers more flexibility  and  time  in

preparing  the staff in accepting AIDS patients  under  their

care.



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, Dr Chong Weng Chiew brought

up  the  issue  of domiciliary home care.  This is  something

that  my  Ministry supports. There are now six VWOs providing

home medical services.  Home medical care is the provision of

a  doctor's  care in the person's own home as the person  has

difficulty leaving his home because of severe disability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home nursing services usually involve dressing of

wounds,   injections,  changing  of  catheters,   etc.    The

availability  of home medical and home nursing  can  help  to

reduce the need for nursing home beds.  MOH is in the process

of  finalising the norm cost for home medical care  and  home

nursing  care  after which subsidised home medical  and  home

nursing  care will be available to those who pass  the  means

test and will seek such care from the various VWO providers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of Government subvention for home

medical  and  home nursing will also encourage  more  service

providers.   This is an expansion of current  services  which

have  been limited to the seven approved providers under  the

Ministry's  framework  for  integrated  healthcare  for   the

elderly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to physiotherapy, home medical and home

nursing  providers  will  instruct  the  patients  and  their

relatives on basic physiotherapy exercises.  For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>



patients  who require more specialised physiotherapy  inputs,

home   physiotherapy   is  provided  by   four   restructured

hospitals.   There are eight private physiotherapy  providers

and  they  do  not  have  a waiting list.   The  Ministry  is

currently reviewing the continuum of rehabilitation  services

and  whether  there  is a need to expand home  physiotherapy,

particularly   as   the   previous   severe    shortage    of

physiotherapists  is being addressed with the  local  diploma

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Dr Chong's concern about HIV/AIDS

patients,  MOH has announced in December 2000 that  hospices,

nursing  homes and community hospitals should accept HIV/AIDS

patients,  and they will receive subsidies for  them  as  for

other  patients.   A  comprehensive  training  programme   on

infection  control and HIV/AIDS has been organised for  step-down care staff and is on-going.   This programme teaches the

staff how to manage patients with infectious diseases so that

the  handler  knows  how  to take  precautions.   Caring  for

HIV/AIDS  patient  is no different from caring  for  patients

with  other infectious disease.  Universal precaution  should

be  practised  by all service providers for all  patients  to

prevent  infection.   It  is not medical  knowledge  that  is

lacking, but the fear of nursing these patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training programme will further address such psycho-social issues to reduce discrimination against HIV/AIDS

patients.    Currently,  the  number  of  HIV/AIDS   patients

requiring  nursing home care is small.  We feel that  nursing

homes  should not discriminate against HIV/AIDS  patients  or

patients  with  other  conditions who  meet  MOH's  admission

criteria  for nursing homes.  We believe, with education  and

training,  nursing home care providers and nursing staff  and

other  caregivers can be taught to look after these  patients

without fear of catching the disease.



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Dr

Balaji  for  the answers he has given.  I am more than  happy

with them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>



Thus, I would like to beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code OD 3600.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a perception that all herbal products are

safe because they are natural.  As a result, many members  of

the  public take herbal medicines freely for various ailments

and  as health supplements.  Even our regulation shows a lack

of  knowledge  of the pharmacology and toxicology  of  herbal

products.   This is evidenced by the fact that our regulation

is  only  concerned  with the contents of  heavy  metals  and

adulteration  of western prescribed medicine  in  the  herbal

products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Minister commented that these herbs have been

used  for  hundreds of years and, therefore, they  should  be

safe.  The fact is that a number of herbs themselves actually

contain chemicals that may interact with other drugs or cause

various  bodily  damage  directly,  if  taken  in  sufficient

quantities.   Many such cases have actually been reported  in

various  medical literature.  They resulted in kidney,  liver

and  other  organ failures.  Sometimes, some of  these  cases

were even fatal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge that while the Ministry tightens up the control

on  adulteration of western medicine in herbal  products,  it

should  also  build  up  a pharmacopedia  of  all  the  herbs

commonly  used  locally,  and use this  knowledge  to  better

regulate  the  importation and production of herbal  products

since  so  many  Singaporeans actually  use  them  regularly.

Then,  with  this  knowledge, I also  urge  the  Ministry  to

educate the public on the safety aspect of herbal medicine.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, alternative medicine is

also  widely practised in western countries like the USA,  so

it is not surprising that alternative medicine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>



is also a choice of therapy for many Singaporeans.  While the

Ministry  finds it difficult to regulate efficacy  as  it  is

just primarily regulating safety, the Ministry can perform  a

role  in  letting the public know what forms  of  alternative

medicine are allowed to be practised here, because the public

does  not  know  what  is  an accepted  form  of  alternative

medicine and what is not.  For example: is chelation  therapy

or  other forms of aromatherapy accepted as regular types  of

alternative medicine?  So the Ministry can perform a role  by

helping us understand what types of alternative medicine  can

be practised here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, while it may not be able to regulate efficacy,

it  can  perform a role in preventing unsubstantiated  claims

from  being  made.   For example, some of these  preparations

claim  that they can cure cancer or diabetes.  The danger  in

doing  so  is that this will mislead persons into taking  the

medication, leading to further complications.  What  I  would

like  to know is whether there are any agencies to look  into

these  advertising claims.  While I can understand that  some

of  these  alternative treatments can claim to improve  well-being,  I  think  that is fine.  But once they  start  making

claims about curing diseases, the Ministry has to draw a fine

line.   Otherwise, it can easily result in harm to our people

who know no better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Chong is not here. Dr Balaji, would

you like to respond?



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> On the topic of alternative

medicine  and Chinese traditional medicine, much  of  it  has

been extensively covered by the Minister earlier today, so  I

will just be very brief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH has started to regulate TCM, including Chinese

proprietary  medicine,  to safeguard patients'  interest  and

safety.   The TCM Practitioners Act 2000 came into effect  on

7th  February  2001 with the commencement of registration  of

acupuncturists.  This was successfully carried out  in  2001.

The  registration of TCM physicians started on 28th  February

2002,  and  all TCM physicians are required to be registered,

as a condition to practise, by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>



1st  January  2004.  The control of TCM was  carried  out  in

three phases and completed on 1st September 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be very difficult for us to impose

standards   of   western  medicine  on  Chinese   traditional

medicine.  But many of these herbs and medications have  been

taken for thousands of years and patients have felt better as

a result of taking these medications, and very few reports of

actually serious illness have been reported from taking these

medications.   Where  there have been complications,  it  has

been because of adulteration of these Chinese medicines.   If

we  were  to  impose  western standards of  trials  on  these

traditional  Chinese medications, what will  happen  is  that

Singaporeans  will be deprived of the ability to  have  these

medications.  So a certain balance is required in the way  we

deal with traditional Chinese medicines.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> I just want to clarify that I am not

saying  that Chinese medicine is not safe or to that  extent.

What I am saying is that there is a lack of knowledge on  the

part  of  our regulator about the pharmacology and toxicology

of the various herbs in their original form.  What I actually

want  to  urge  is  to  build up this  knowledge  base,  this

pharmacopedia  of all the herbs commonly used  in  Singapore.

To  my knowledge, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong have done a lot

of  research on this area, and we can actually tap  on  these

resources  and  to  build up our knowledge  so  that  we  can

prevent any mishaps in future.  This is my suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, I would like to seek

clarification because the Minister of State has not  answered

my questions as to whether the Ministry will let us know what

forms  of  alternative medicine can be  practised  here,  and

whether  the  Ministry  will clamp  down  on  unsubstantiated

claims like curing diseases or being able to treat particular

diseases.



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I will answer Dr Michael

Lim's question first.  With regard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>



to advertising claims about curing cancer and other diseases,

there  is  an  advertising code that  regulates  claims  with

regard to curing diseases like cancer.  If importers of these

medications  contravene this code, then action can  be  taken

against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Dr Ong's suggestion that research be done

on  traditional Chinese medicine, I personally  do  not  have

much  knowledge about traditional Chinese medicine, but there

is a board for traditional Chinese medicine in Singapore that

has  been  formed  and  we will pass on  his  suggestion  and

encourage  them  to  do research and collect  information  on

traditional Chinese medicine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also asked about forms of alternative

medicine  that can be practised in Singapore.  Sir,  we  have

very  strict regulations on how western medicine is practised

in  Singapore,  including  most of the  medications  used  in

western  medicine  being  placed  on  the  Schedule  List  of

Poisons.   Nobody  can prescribe these medications  except  a

person   registered  with  the  Singapore  Medical   Council.

However,  there have been many forms of treatment  that  have

traditionally  been  done.   These  include  treatments  like

binding of the abdomen after pregnancy, which is quite common

among  the Malay population.  It is not the intention of  the

Ministry to regulate all these practices.  Our goal mainly is

to  ensure that there is no practice that would pose a danger

to the public.  I believe our current system gives the public

access  to the greatest number of choices that they can  make

and, at the same time, safeguards them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, just a quick clarification. I

just  want  to say that when I raised the question of  herbal

products,  I  do  not confine it only to traditional  Chinese

medicine because there are now a lot of herbal products  from

the  western part of the world.  For example, St John's  Wort

is  touted as one of the herbs to treat depression and I have

been  asked this question many times, whether it works.   The

Malays have certain herbal preparations like jamu, and so  on

and  so  forth.  So we really need to build up this knowledge

in order to safeguard our public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the constraints of time, I will take this

issue  up with the Minister on another occasion.  I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code OE 3100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, medical experts believe that cases of Hepatitis C

have  reached  epidemic  proportions  and  predict  that  the

lingering liver disease will kill more people than AIDS  over

the next two decades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatitis C has emerged from obscurity as a disease

familiar  to  only a few experts to become  recognised  as  a

major  public-health problem worldwide.  Some medical experts

believe  deaths from Hepatitis C will triple in the  next  20

years.   Many  infected  with  the  blood-borne  virus  would

require liver transplants, and between 1% and 4% of sufferers

would  develop  liver cancer.  Hepatitis C is now  the  major

cause  of liver disease requiring liver transplantation among

adults in most countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development of reliable diagnostic tests has

shown  how widespread the disease is but, because few victims

show   symptoms,   it  is  often  detected   during   routine

examinations or at blood donations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister for Health whether any study has

been  done  to  ascertain the prevalence of  Hepatitis  C  in

Singapore.   Will the Ministry of Health embark on preventive

measures in tackling Hepatitis C?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no vaccine against the Hepatitis C virus,

unlike  Hepatitis B and Hepatitis A.  Will  the  Ministry  of

Health prioritise research to find a vaccine for Hepatitis C,

much  in  step with our present emphasis on medical and  bio-scientific  research?   Also, will  the  Ministry  of  Health

consider screening of Hepatitis C in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>



routine ante-natal check-ups so that gynaecologists can  take

precautions in minimising the transmission of Hepatitis  from

mother to child?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, in the February issue of

Readers'  Digest, there was a report that cigarette companies

are  targetting  young Asian women and  teenage  girls  in  a

campaign to persuade them to take up smoking.  I was troubled

by  the  report.  Nowadays, when we look around, we see  more

smokers  among  our  Singapore  youths,  particularly   young

females.   Most  female smokers smoke with friends  and  they

perceive smoking as socially desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, tobacco taxation has been used to

discourage  smoking.  The tax has been adjusted  to  increase

from  $180  to $210 per kg of cigarettes.  The tax  increase,

perhaps,  of  course, will further deter  smokers,  but  more

needs to be done.



<br>6.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry to step up its efforts to tackle the

problem of youth smoking.  In the United States, 90%  of  all

adult  smokers report that they began smoking before the  age

of  18.  Most researchers agree that prevention should  begin

early and continued intervention should be provided for young

people.   If  tobacco  companies focus their  advertising  to

encourage  young  women  to take  up  smoking,  we  too,  the

Ministry of Health, must also step up our drive.



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, my Ministry shares Dr Lily

Neo's concern about Hepatitis C because both Hepatitis B  and

Hepatitis C infections can cause liver cancer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of Hepatitis B on the incidence of liver

cancer is a greater concern as about 4% of the population are

Hepatitis B carriers.  The Hepatitis B Control Programme,  of

which immunisation is a main strategy, is in place to address

this concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatitis C virus, like Hepatitis B virus, is

transmitted through blood and body



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>



fluids  containing the virus. Acute viral  Hepatitis  due  to

Hepatitis  C  virus  is uncommon in Singapore.   Acute  viral

Hepatitis,  including  Hepatitis C  viral  infections,  is  a

notifiable  disease  but  no  case  of  Hepatitis   C   virus

infections  has been reported since 1993.  The prevalence  of

antibody  against  Hepatitis C indicating active  chronic  or

resolved  infection in the general population  is  low,  less

than  0.5%.   As  no vaccine is available to protect  against

Hepatitis C infection, the only way to control the disease is

to prevent transmission of Hepatitis C through infected blood

and blood products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has taken several measures to limit

the  spread of Hepatitis C.  Since 1992, all blood donors are

routinely  screened  for  anti-Hepatitis  C  virus  antibody.

Those  found to be positive are excluded from blood donation.

Since  1994, all haemodialysis centres are required to screen

dialysis  patients  every six months.   A  separate  dialysis

machine  is  to be designated for use of any patient  who  is

found  positive  with Hepatitis C.  All  potential  life  and

cadaveric organ donors are screened for Hepatitis C and those

found  to  be positive will be excluded.  Healthcare  workers

are  continually  educated  on the importance  of  practising

standard  precautions  to  minimise  the  potential  risk  of

transmission  of blood-borne infections, including  Hepatitis

C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an on-going public education on the risks of

transmission  of  blood-borne infections through  unprotected

sexual  activities and sharing of contaminated  needles.   We

think the current measures taken are adequate to prevent  the

transmission of Hepatitis C virus in Singapore.  However, the

Ministry  would continue to monitor the situation.  We  would

welcome  research  on  this virus  by  any  of  the  big  R&D

companies.   With regard to the specific question of  whether

gynaecologists  should screen patients for  Hepatitis  C,  we

will leave that to the professionals involved to decide.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also shares the concern Mr Yeo Guat Kwang

has   on  the  increasing  number  of  smokers  among   young

Singaporeans,  particularly those  aged  between  18  and  24

years.    We   recognise  the  importance   of   implementing

programmes to prevent young people from taking up smoking.  A

study  shows that it is more difficult for a person  to  quit

smoking  if  he starts smoking at a young age.  The  National

Smoking  Control  Campaign  this year  will  be  targeted  at

youths. Strategies adopted will include mass media and  face-to-face education programmes.  The Health Promotion Board  is

also working with the Ministry of Education and the community

organisations  to  implement programmes in  schools  and  the

community  to  encourage  youths to stay  smoke-free  and  to

assist those who smoke to quit smoking.  Among the programmes

that  are being implemented are programmes like youth student

peer  leaders, programme to train teachers to conduct smoking

cessation  sessions, the promotion of soccer and rugby  as  a

healthy alternative to smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the increasing number of young female

smokers,  the  Health  Promotion Board will  be  implementing

specific  programmes  targeted at young females.  A  renowned

female  international model will be our spokesperson in  this

year's  media  publicity  programme.   Participants  in  this

year's  Teens Model Contest must also be smoke-free  and  the

winner will be our ambassador to speak on smoking issues.  We

hope these measures will reduce smoking in the young.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head K of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I can say with full confidence that

our  school education system is among the best in the  world.

It has served us well since the founding of Singapore. Today,

it  has  two  important objectives, namely,  to  prepare  our

children  for the knowledge-based economy, and to  provide  a

common development experience for all our children as part of

nation-building.   However, it is also  the  source  of  much

headaches  and heartaches for our parents.  Its pull  on  the

heartstrings of the nation is reflected in the number of cuts

against  this  Ministry,  66 in total,  the  highest  in  the

Committee of Supply this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentiment was also reflected in the five dialogue

sessions   on  education  organised  by  the  Feedback   Unit

recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, stress in our schools remains a major concern for

Singaporeans.  Many parents believe that the adverse  effects

of  the  school  ranking  system on principals  and  teachers

contribute  to  this  problem.  Ranking,  for  instance,  has

resulted in schools selecting subjects that would enable them

to  score  well in their ranking and neglected subjects  that

would  cause  them  to rank lower.  English  Literature,  for

instance,  is  no longer being offered in some  of  our  best

secondary   schools.   In  one  dialogue  session   involving

primarily  teachers, most of them were negative about  school

ranking.   This is interesting - the teachers themselves  are

very  negative about school ranking.  The teachers felt  that

ranking  tilts the balance of education in favour of academic

excellence versus the development of the young.  Many do  not

feel this singular pursuit that fulfilling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, streaming of primary school pupils is another

perennial issue.  There is broad consensus that labelling  of

pupils  as  EM1, EM2 and EM3 brought about stigmatisation  of

slow  pupils at a very young age.  Our angst about  labelling

has been captured very well by the movie "I Not Stupid".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, school ranking and student streaming are

both  conceptually sound.  However, given the culture of  our

people,  its  implementation has  produced  undesirable  side

effects.   We  should adapt the implementation to  real  life

situations where possible.  If appropriate, we should  modify

the  current policies on streaming and ranking after so  many

years  of  experience.  For instance, we could  offer,  as  a

benchmark  experiment for certain schools to abolish  ranking

or  to curtail streaming to see whether the outcome would  be

better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our mother tongue policy is a cornerstone of our

education  system.  There are altogether five  cuts  on  this

topic and two more on Chinese language.  I shall leave it  to

my  colleagues to elaborate on these topics.  Suffice to  say

that  mother  tongue  policy  has  so  far  been  sacrosanct.

Nevertheless, I think we should review our implementation  of

the mother tongue policy in view of the irreversible trend of

increasing  number  of  families speaking  English  as  their

mother tongue regardless of their ethnic background.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards secondary school curriculum, I believe there

is   too   much   emphasis  on  academic   performance,   but

insufficient attention on character development  of  students

and  cultivation  of values in them.  I  would  like  to  see

greater emphasis to be placed on developing soft skills, such

as  critical thinking, research, presentation, communication,

leadership  and  inter-personal skills.  These  skills  would

enable  a  person  to  deal  with uncertainty  in  a  rapidly

changing world.  Currently, we have the "A" level examination

which has a specialised and narrow focus.  On the other hand,

the local universities are reforming to provide a broad-based

education  along the line of the US universities.   Thus,  we

have this peculiar 'coca-cola' bottle shape when it comes  to

the  focus of our school curriculum, narrowing after the  "O"

level and broadening again after the "A" level.  I believe we

need to address this anomaly as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a bold step for the Ministry to approve the

setting up of a sports school.  Regrettably, it is being off-loaded to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  of  Community Development and Sports.  Furthermore,

the  Minister  has disclosed recently that  his  Ministry  is

prepared to consider the establishment of speciality  schools

in   arts  and  music  if  there  is   a  demand  for   them.

Presumably, he would like to off-load it to MITA as well.   I

personally  would  like  the  Ministry  to  continue  to   be

responsible for these speciality schools, taking inputs  from

the other Ministries to buttress it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the "A" level examination, I am happy to

note   that   the  Senior  Minister  of  State,  Mr   Tharman

Shanmugaratnam, has disclosed in this House that project work

will  be  introduced  to "A" level examination  to  inculcate

process skills and independent thinking amongst our students.

I  think  all  these  could  be but  the  first  steps  of  a

continuous process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has been floating the idea of the

through-train programme for a few years now.  I believe  this

is  timely,  as  close  to  20% of  our  cohorts  proceed  to

university anyway.  Conceptually, if these students could  be

identified early, they could skip the "O" level examinations.

Then,  the  students  will avoid having to  prepare  for  two

examinations  in the last three years of their pre-university

education.  This  through-train concept finds  broad  support

among  school  principals and teachers, as well as  students.

Many  students feel that this system will allow them to  skip

the  "O"  level  examination  and  give  them  more  in-depth

education  and a greater choice of subjects.  Some felt  that

the  integrated  programme  would  reduce  time  wastage  and

provide better linkage between the upper secondary and the JC

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry has not indicated when the

selection of these students would take place.  The PSLE seems

to  be  a  convenient choice.  However, this might be  a  bit

early  in a child's development and that would leave out  the

late  bloomers.  Given our culture, every parent  would  want

their  children to get onto the through-train as  they  would

likely review it as a gravy train.  There is every likelihood

that the through-train programme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>



would end up being another streaming programme, with all  its

attendant negative side effects.  We need to be very  careful

in implementation to avoid these pitfalls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we come to education, we must talk about

teachers as they are the anchors of any education system.   I

have participated in several rounds of the best teacher award

selection.  I am touched by the commitments of our  teachers.

Also  from talking to my own school-going children, I  gather

that teachers play an important role in their motivation.   I

am glad that we have improved on the remuneration of teachers

and  the recognition of teachers' contributions. The NIE  has

no shortage of applicants this year because of the recession.

Hopefully,  when the economic recession is over, we  will  be

able  to  continue  to  retain them.  This  is  an  area  the

Ministry should continue to monitor closely.



<br>6.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the Government has pledged that it

would   leave  no  stone  unturned  in  remaking   Singapore.

Whatever  we  do to remake Singapore would be an exercise  in

futility,  if  we do not, at the very least, throw  away  our

historical  baggage, and look at the issue of  the  education

system  with  a  fresh  perspective.  Although  we  have  not

mentioned what is the size of the stone we are turning  over,

presumably  these stones could be turned by a  single  person

with his hands.  The question is whether we have been turning

the  same  stones, over and over again, such  that  there  is

really  nothing  crawly and creepy underneath  them  anymore.

Instead, I believe we should be bold enough to turn over some

of the bigger boulders.  In the area of education, streaming,

ranking, mother tongue, could be some of these boulders.   We

should  be  true to our words, and not hold any  concept,  so

sacrosanct,  that  we are prevented from  making  fundamental

changes  that  will mould Singapore for the future.   In  the

case of education, we truly have the future in our hands.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Chairman, all along, we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>



of  the firm belief that only through education can we  raise

the  quality  of  our  people, extend  their  capability  and

enhance  Singapore's competitiveness in the rapidly  changing

world of today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integrity and excellence of our educational system

is  beyond doubt. The knowledge and technical education which

we  have  been  emphasising since independence  has  received

international recognition.  Even developed countries  in  the

west  are  using  our educational system as a  reference  and

model  for emulation. This is something we ought to be  proud

of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a parent, an MP and a grassroots leader, I have the

privilege to work very closely with the Ministry of Education

and  the  schools.  I agree with my parliamentary  colleagues

who  have spoken before me that the Ministry of Education and

the  schools have done a lot of good things, and we  can  see

that  the contents of our education and the students that  we

have produced have attained international standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have attended a number of dialogue sessions with the

women's  organisations  with Dr  Aline  Wong.   At  first,  I

thought  that they would be most concerned with the  role  of

women  in politics.  But, to my surprise, this ranks  5th  in

priority whereas education topped the list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we face internationalisation, globalisation and more

competition,  our  education  must  be  more  flexible,  more

diversified and with more options available.  Our targets are

parents  and  students.  Experts have said  that  because  of

advancement in telecommunications, Internet and so on, people

are  becoming more self-centred and their interests are  also

more  focused.  I believe Prof Pukumayar has  said  that  the

social  clubs in the future will all be centred  around  very

limited  scope  of interest.  There will be a lot  of  focus-groups.  In the case of education, if our educational  system

is  to be thoroughly reformed, it will eventually evolve into

one  in which students will be selecting only subjects  which

they are strong in and according to their personal interest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise a few points. Apart from

knowledge  and technical education, we should also  emphasise

on  emotional,  practical, adaptive and  creative  education.

Because of time constraint I will only speak on two of  them:

emotional education and creative education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister of State, Mr Tharman, has already given

an  answer to this aspect of education, and we can  expect  a

lot  of improvement in this area.  In a report in the Straits

Times yesterday, columnist Richard Lim mentioned that in  the

future, a country's wealth will depend not on its size or the

size of its population, not on its natural resources, but  on

how  you leverage on your advantages, that is, how you  build

up the intelligence, the knowledge and the potential of every

individual  in  the country.  If you have  a  Bill  Gates  in

Singapore, then at least half of our economic problems  would

have been solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the emotional education.

Nowadays, Shanghai is talking about "one change a day", not a

change   in  10  years  or  a  change  in  20  years.    When

Singaporeans go to do business in China, we were said  to  be

"able to work but unable to behave appropriately".  There  is

a saying that when Taiwanese go to China to do business, they

practise  karate or kongshoudao, implying empty-handed.   But

when  Singaporeans  go  to China, we practise  tae-kwando  or

taiquandao, implying carry your money there. The  talk  among

women  in  China  is  that the Taiwanese  men  are  wu  qing,

(heartless), the Hong Kong men are wu yi (ungrateful),  while

the  Singapore men are wu zhi (ignorant):  This is of  course

just  a  joke.  But my personal feeling is that  the  talents

that  we produce must not only know how to work but also know

how  to  behave appropriately.  We must make some adjustments

in  this  area so that our educational system will  not  only

concentrate  on  training students to  score  high  marks  in

examinations, but to build up their character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is emotional education? Emotional education

involves  the appreciation of arts, culture and how  to  deal

with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>



people,  human  relations, caring and love;  own  strife  for

betterment.   We  must  train  our  students  to  learn   and

appreciate  more  about  the  various  religions,  languages,

history, politics, sociology and philosophy.  To achieve  all

these,  we cannot just depend on the teachers alone.   It  is

not   fair   to   expect   the  teachers   to   carry   these

responsibilities  all  by  themselves.    The   Ministry   of

Education  should  be  more open-minded  and  draw  from  the

collective  wisdom  of people from all  walks  of  life,  the

politicians, the businessmen, the parents, etc.  The Ministry

of  Education can also involve other ministries such  as  the

MCDS,  MOH, MHA to form an inter-Ministry task force to  look

into this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, heartware is more important than hardware. When

we  are  building  a school, do not go for fanciful  designs,

such  as those fantastically looking roofs, which cost a  lot

of  money  but not really practical.  Why not save the  money

and  use  it  to  send the students on overseas  study  tours

instead?   The students could learn more by interacting  with

their counterparts in the neighbouring countries and see  for

themselves the customs and culture of our neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I met a number of scholarship holders who have

recently  returned to Singapore.  I asked them  whether  they

had  been to Shanghai.  To my surprise, none of them had been

to  Shanghai and had shown no interest in going there.   But,

every  one of them said that he or she had been to the United

States  or  Europe,  and expressed the wish  to  visit  these

places  again.   With the opening up of China  and  the  huge

potential  in  the  China market, these bright  young  people

should  make an attempt to visit China and see for themselves

how China has prospered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me go to my main points. There are two aspects

that  I  would like to take some time to talk about.  In  the

meeting  of  the women's organisation, the participants  were

very   concerned  with  our  system  of  streaming  and   the

philosophy of teaching according to the children's  potential

and ability.  When we talk about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>



teaching  according  to  the  different  abilities   of   the

students,  we  can  implement  modular  system  in   schools.

Besides  the core subjects such as English, Mathematics,  and

mother  tongue, the students can opt for subjects at a higher

level.  Outstanding primary students can opt for subjects  at

the  Secondary level; outstanding Secondary students can  opt

for subjects at the Junior College level or university level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students should be taught according to their

interest and ability on these selected subjects.  In addition

to the core subjects, they can opt for subjects they are good

at.  But they should not be stigmatised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very proud of our ITE students. But,

something must be done to improve on the image of  ITE.   ITE

should be integrated into the mainstream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Education to

extend  their scope of review to cover pre-school  education,

along  with  the  primary,  secondary,  junior  college   and

university  education.  This is because pre-school  education

is very important in the building up of a good foundation for

the students to advance to the primary school later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to raise is on the SAP

schools.  I fully support the SAP schools and it is  my  firm

belief  that the SAP schools do not affect racial harmony  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, it has been a long

time  since the Ministry announced and identified initiatives

to  promote  creativity  and  thinking  in  schools,  and   I

understand  that  it was supposed to cut curriculum  down  by

about   30%   to  make  way  for  creativity  and  innovation

development.    The  key  issue  now  is  that  Singaporeans,

particularly,  parents, have not felt  the  impact  of  these

changes  yet,  because  they  continue  to  be  stressed  and

pressured  by  the children's need to achieve higher  grades,

and the children, no doubt, continue to be stressed too.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with higher grades, but the

system is creating an obsession with grades at this point  of

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support the national objective of promoting

entrepreneurship, I believe the real long-term impact has  to

come  from  our education system.  We have many  examples  to

follow  from.  The US is a very good example.  In my opinion,

we   can  nurture  the  entrepreneurial  spirit  through  our

education system in three ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we need to train our students to be not

just  academically smart, but also street  smart.   In  other

words,  developing both the IQ and the EQ  measures  for  our

children, and we should value each child and value the talent

of  each  child, and to find ways to groom them so that  they

can  excel  in their talent and in their area of interest  so

that they can achieve something significant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that we really need to create channels and

expose  our  children  to  the concept  of  entrepreneurship,

particularly  at the secondary school and at ITE,  or  higher

levels,  and  I  suggest  that  the  Minister  thinks   about

implementing  programmes that teach entrepreneurship  at  the

CCA  or ECA programmes and just like we do with the uniformed

groups  and with societies like the Debating Society, Rotract

Club, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we need to develop a culture to promote

tolerance  to failure and giving people more second  chances.

We  can  achieve this by fine-tuning some of our policies  as

two  Members before me have spoken.  And, of course,  I  feel

very strongly about fine-tuning the streaming system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two specific issues I would like to ask.

The  first  one  is  about  the small  cross-section  of  our

society,  and I am talking about the students who are  taking

the   minority   Indian  languages,  the   non-Tamil   Indian

languages.   Currently,  students who study  Hindi,  Punjabi,

Gujarati,  Urdu  and Bengali, are not given full  recognition

for  their  subject, despite their meeting many requirements.

I  know  that  the  self-help organisations  responsible  for

teaching and assessing each of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>



these  languages have put in tremendous effort over the  last

10  years  to ensure international standards are  met.   They

have  gone  through  the  extent of  forming  a  coordinating

council  among themselves, although they started  separately,

to   standardise  curriculum,  as  well  as  setting   common

examinations  and setting marking standards.  It  is  a  pity

that  despite their effort, they have not been given the full

recognition of the languages.  I recall a few years  ago  the

Minister in his reply to a similar question raised the  issue

of  standards of curriculum, and of results.  I  believe  the

situation  has  changed drastically now.   Can  the  Minister

please  look  into the issue and advise on  what  else  these

people  need to do so that the above languages can have  full

recognition?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question I would like to ask the Minister on

the  system  is on the progress of implementing  Tamil  as  a

second language at a higher level.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Singh, you can move on to your next

cut.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the streaming system, in my

opinion,  is  a  very destructive system, simply  because  it

affects   the   self-esteem  of  our  children.    We   start

segregating  and  labelling them at such  an  early  age.   I

mentioned   about  how  the  education  system  can   support

developing the entrepreneur society.  I fully understand  the

intention  of streaming, and that is to allow each  child  to

develop at his or her own pace, to avoid early drop outs from

the education system, by giving an easy curriculum for weaker

students to follow.  Should not our system also focus on  how

we  can  try  to make the slower children catch up  with  the

rest?   Even  if  it  means just a small percentage  of  slow

learners who catch up, it will be a huge gain for our  nation

of such a small population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What special things has the Ministry done to help the

weaker  children  catch  up?   Has  it  channelled  the  best

teachers to EM3 classes?  Has it made EM3 classes smaller, so

that  there is more attention for the children?  Has it spent

more money per child for an EM3 than an EM1 or EM2



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>



class?   The real answer, in my opinion, is that the Ministry

and  schools have done the exact opposite.  And,  along  with

it,  we are labelling our children, first risking creating  a

class society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 7.00 pm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the
