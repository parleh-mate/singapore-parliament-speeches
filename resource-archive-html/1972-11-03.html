<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have to inform Honourable

Members  that I communicated to the President  the

Address agreed to by resolution of this Parliament

on the 26th October, 1972.

<div align="center"><b>			BENDEMEER ROAD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Pedestrian lights and action against inconsiderate motorists)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Law  and National Development (a) if he will cause

pedestrian  lights  to be installed  at  Bendemeer

Road in front of Block 25 so as to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



allow  crossing  to be made at  this  popular  and

convenient point of the road with some  degree  of

safety; and (b) if he will ask the Police to  take

the    severest   action   against   inconsiderate

motorists   who  exceed  the  speed  limit   along

Bendemeer Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the light

controlled  pedestrian crossing was  recently  put

into operation at Bendemeer Road in front of Block

43.  The  automatic stopping of  traffic  at  this

crossing  for  25  seconds  in  every  90  seconds

provides  sufficient gaps in the traffic  flow  to

enable pedestrians to cross Bendemeer Road between

Blocks 43 and 25. There is also a light controlled

pedestrian  crossing at the junction of  Bendemeer

Road  and Boon Keng Road, a distance of about  500

feet from Block 25. The installation of pedestrian

lights  in  front of Block 25 is,  therefore,  not

considered necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police have taken action against vehicles

exceeding   the  30  m.p.h. speed   limit   along

Bendemeer Road. For example, for the week  9th  to

15th  September, 1972, 27 drivers were booked  for

speeding  along  the road and offered  composition

ranging from $30 to $50 depending on their  speed.

The  Police will continue their operations against

inconsiderate motorists. Those racing at excessive

speeds will be arrested on the spot and charged in

court  under  the Road Traffic Act  for  dangerous

driving,  or  under the Penal Code for endangering

the lives of other road users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang will be interested to know

that  in  the first nine months of this year,  the

Police  took action against some 14,000  motorists

for exceeding speed limits along our roads.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, can

traffic be stopped at this crossing for more  than

25  seconds  at  a  time to enable  the  aged  and

children to cross the road?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Twenty-five seconds out of every 90

seconds,  Sir,  is  in  my view  already  quite  a

considerable gap for pedestrians to cross. To stop

traffic longer might lead to traffic hold-ups.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Vending stalls for the aged and handicapped)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Law  and  National Development if he will  request

the  Housing  and Development Board  to  construct

vending  stalls  to  be  let  out  to  the   aged,

handicapped  and  other  categories   of   persons

suffering  from one form of disability or  another

to  carry  out petty hawking within their  housing

estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Housing and Development

Board  has tried out a scheme in one Housing Board

estate  to  provide sweet-vending  stalls  on  the

ground  floors of a few blocks of flats  for  aged

persons  to do petty hawking. However, there  have

been   many  complaints  of  noise  nuisance   and

littering  and problems of pedestrian  obstruction

and  quarrels  between  the stallholders  and  the

residents of ground floor flats. As the scheme was

not  successful, it was therefore decided  not  to

extend the scheme to other Housing Board estates.

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX RELIEFS FOR CHILDREN</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> On 24th October, 1972, my

colleague,  the  Minister  for  Health,  announced

that,  among  measures being  taken  to  encourage

small families, would be one reducing from five to

three the number of children for which income  tax

reliefs  will  in future be allowed. The  existing

allowances  for children, i.e, the  amounts  which

may  be  deducted from income to be taxed, are  as

follows: -



<pre>

    For the 1st child, $750

    For the 2nd child, $500

    For the 3rd child, $500

    For the 4th child, $300

    For the 5th child, $300

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in reliefs which will take effect

from the year of assessment 1974 will be as

follows: -



<pre>

    For the 1st child, $750,

          as at present.



    For the 2nd child, $750,

          increased by $250

          from the  present

          $500.



    For the 3rd child, $500,

          as at present.

</pre>



There   will   be  no  allowances  for  subsequent

children.  The  deductions are in  line  with  the

Government   policy   of   encouraging   two   but

discouraging  more  than  three  children  in  the

family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new reliefs will apply to parents who have

three  children or less on 1st August,  1973.  Any

fourth  or  subsequent child born to such  parents

after 1st August, 1973, will therefore not get any

relief.  However,  parents who already  have  more

than  three  children on 1st  August,  1973,  will

continue   to   be  eligible  for  their   present

allowances  for  these children.  It  is  not  the

intention  to cause hardship to those who  already

have  more  than three children in the family  and

cannot do anything about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be an additional variation. The Act

provides that, at present, a married woman who has

earned  income  may opt to be assessed  separately

from  her husband. This provision has given a more

advantageous  tax treatment to married  women  who

are  working. The option will remain so  that  all

married  women who are economically inactive  will

be  encouraged  to  work  and  ease  the  manpower

shortage in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further induce the more highly qualified and

professionally trained married women  to  work,  I

have  decided  also to make the  tax  reliefs  for

children more attractive for them. In the case  of

such highly qualified married women who have three

children  or  less on 1st August,  1973,  and  who

elect  to claim the tax reliefs for their children

in   their  assessment,  there  will  be  enhanced

reliefs as follows: -



<pre>

      For the 1 child $750 or 5 per

          cent of the earned annual

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

          income  subject to a maximum

          of $2,000.



      For the 2nd  child $750 or 5 per

          cent  of the  earned  annual

          income subject to a  maximum

          of $2,000.



      For the 3rd child $500 or 3  per

          cent  of  the earned  annual

          income subject to a  maximum

          of $2,000.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped the enhanced reliefs will serve to

reverse  any  tendency  for highly  qualified  and

professional  married  women  to  give  up   their

careers to look after their children. Since  these

women  have undergone expensive training, it would

be a waste of such training if they stop working.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> I have two

questions  to  ask the Minister, Sir.  First,  how

does  the  Minister propose to  defind  a  married

woman who is highly qualified and one who is  not?

Secondly,  on  the question of tax  reliefs,  will

those  people, who now have four children but  are

not eligible for income tax at the moment, get tax

reliefs  for these four children later  when  they

become eligible for payment of income tax?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  has given increases in tax  reliefs  for

children.  May  I ask him what about  reliefs  for

dependants? There are many dependants in a family,

such  as the father and mother. Therefore, can  he

give any relief for these dependants, so that  the

wage earners might get some allowance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may take

the   first  speaker.  He  has  asked  about   the

definition  of "specially qualified persons".  The

definition will be given in the amendment  to  the

Act, which will have to be drafted. It is intended

to define it as a married woman who has obtained a

degree  from  an  institution  providing  tertiary

education,  or  who is a member of a  professional

body  oz group regulated by statute, or any  other

profession as may be approved by the Minister  and

notified in the Gazette.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, as regards children who

at  present are not yet given tax reliefs  because

there  is  no  claim yet for income tax  from  the

parent, the intention is that the present position

will remain for those who, as I have said, already

have more than three children and are not able  to

do anything about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other question, which has been posed by

the  Member for Anson, I am afraid that my present

amendment  of the Act does not cover the  question

of relatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would a

teacher be considered as a person with specialised

professional training as such, and be entitled  to

reliefs just now propounded by the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to ask the Minister for Finance what is

the  logic  of  discriminating the  professionally

qualified  from  those who are not  professionally

qualified, when the question of encouragement  for

greater  participation  in  the  economy  of   the

country  does  not  lie only in getting  more  pro

fessionally qualified women involved. The shortage

of  manpower  today falls within all categories  -

from   the  highly-trained  workers  to  the  less

skilled workers. Recently, there was an attempt to

encourage  married women to work in the  factories

and  so  on, where there is a serious shortage  of

such  manpower. Therefore, I would  like  to  know

what  is  the logic behind the rationalisation  of

granting  these  reliefs only  to  women  who  are

classified as professionally qualified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question

whether   teachers   are  to  be   considered   as

professionally trained persons, it does  not  come

within the definition which is being proposed. But

there  is  no reason why consideration  cannot  be

given if it is intended that this definition would

apply  to  them. However, I think that within  the

reliefs granted, it is unlikely that most  of  the

teachers would qualify for more than the $750.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the logic of differentiating the

professionally  qualified  from   those   not   so

qualified,  again  I  think  the  same  arithmetic

applies  in both cases. And the further  logic  is

that,  as I have mentioned in my statement,  these

professionally qualified married women  have  been

trained at very great expense, and it would be  an

economic waste if we do not make use of this  kind

of training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully

agree   with   the  Minister  that  professionally

qualified  women who have undergone a considerable

amount  of training should be encouraged  to  come

forward,  as it would be a waste not to use  their

talent  and  ability. Such measures are  desirable

and  I  accept and support them. However, my point

is  this: why should the same encouragement not be

given also to the others? There is also a shortage

of  manpower  in the other categories of  workers.

The move should be to encourage our women-folk  to

come out of their households to participate in our

economic development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree very

much with that sentiment. But I think the logic of

arithmetic  applies here. The fact is that  unless

they  are  in the $15,000 per annum bracket,  they

would not qualify for additional reliefs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, arithmetic

is  something that is worked out, and  it  can  be

changed if the Government so decides. But  what  I

am asking is this: has not some thought been given

to  this point that arithmetic can be changed?  An

attempt  is  made  to  give  tax  reliefs  to  the

professionally   qualified   women.   It   is   an

indication  that  the Government is  conscious  of

wanting  to  draw out this particular category  of

workers.  What  I am saying is, why  is  the  same

consideration not given to the other categories of

women workers? There could be some other method by

which  the same purpose of drawing more  women  to

participate in our economic development  could  be

achieved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think I

have  very much to add to what has been said.  The

fact  that any married woman who is earning income

can  apply for a separate assessment of her income

is  already an inducement to her to go to work. So

there  is already an incentive. If there  are  any

other ideas of further incentives which the Member

may  have,  I would be very grateful if  he  would

pass them on to the Treasury for consideration.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the methodology of the destruction of a

nation  by its foes, war by force of arms  is  not

necessarily   the   only   means   employed.   The

independence  of  a  nation may,  by  more  subtle

means, be subverted. Although more time-consuming,

propaganda,  especially from  within,  could  work

just as well. The gradual erosion of the mind of a

nation   may   well  be  achieved  by   persuasive

arguments  stemming from vested  interests,  often

foreign.  Again, an even more subtle method,  that

of   manipulating  political  parties   within   a

country,  may  be  employed.  This  is  especially

attractive  in a country like Singapore.  In  such

circumstances,  we can never be  over-cautious  in

safeguarding  our  integrity  as  an   independent

sovereign  nation. It is possible  with  unlimited

funds   at  one's  command  to  gain  control   of

political  parties,  succeed  at  the  polls   and

thereafter  bring about the surrender or  transfer

of  the  sovereignty  of  our  Island-Republic  by

fusion with another country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, with its industrious and skilled

population,  its  vast  financial  resources   and

expertise, its high standard of living and  social

amenities, its superb port facilities and economic

infrastructure  and its know-how and  the  skilled

services in almost every field that it can provide

from banking to the ship-repairing business, would

indeed  be  a worth-while plum. Foreign  interests

with vast resources might find it advantageous  to

advocate,   with  smooth  blandishments   and   in

euphemistic  terms, a "merger"  when  such  merger

would  in  reality be a take-over.  These  foreign

interests  could attempt to persuade  Singaporeans

that  a  surrender  of  its sovereignty  might  be

advantageous to Singapore. This could be  done  by

infiltrating into political and other  bodies,  by

pumping  in funds into these bodies for  nefarious

purposes  and by the use of modern mass media,  so

that in time the climate of public opinion may  be

moulded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seductive blandishments of foreign agents

must  not be allowed to succeed. It must  be  made

impossible  for  outside  inimical  interests   to

jostle  Singapore  into  incorporation  with   any

country when it is not to Singapore's benefit.  We

must   accordingly  seek  to   ensure   that   any

Government of the future seeking to merge  with  a

foreign country, .may only do so with the sanction

of a clear and undoubted majority of the people of

Singapore. As the President said in his address at

the  opening of Parliament, "No foreign  interests

can  be  allowed  to  take over Singapore  through

financing   and  manipulating  political   parties

through   their  naive  or  vain,  self-proclaimed

leaders".  Hence, there is, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

need  for  legislation to combat  machinations  by

foreign   interests  to  the  detriment   of   the

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Constitution (Amendment)

(Protection of the Sovereignty of the Republic  of

Singapore) Bill provides at Article 52J that there

is  to  be no surrender or transfer, either wholly

or  in part, of the sovereignty of the Republic of

Singapore  as  an  independent nation  whether  by

merger  or  incorporation with any other sovereign

state,  Federation  or country  or  in  any  other

manner  whatsoever  without  the  support   at   a

national referendum of at least two-thirds of  the

total   number  of  votes  cast  by  the  electors

registered under the Parliamentary Elections  Act.

Nor  indeed without such support of the electorate

is  there to be any relinquishment of control over

the  Singapore Police Force or the Singapore Armed

Forces. The expression "Singapore Police Force" in

this  context  means  not only  the  Police  Force

itself  but  also  the Special  Constabulary,  all

Auxiliary   Police   Forces  in   Singapore,   the

Vigilante  Corps and any other force  declared  by

the  President by notification in the Gazette,  to

be  a  police  force;  the term  "Singapore  Armed

Forces"  means  the armed forces of  the  Republic

raised  and  maintained under the Singapore  Armed

Forces  Act,  1972, as well as any  civil  defence

force   and  any  other  force  declared  by   the

President, by notification



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



in the Gazette, to be an armed force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will observe that this Bill does not

totally prohibit merger or incorporation with  any

other  country.  There  may  be  situations  where

merger may be desirable but, if so, each and every

elector must give thought to it and vote on it  at

a  national  referendum and only if at least  two-thirds  of  the  total number of electors  casting

their  votes  say  "Yes"  can  such  a  merger  or

relinquishment of our police and armed forces take

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest Article 521 gives the impression to some

that  Singapore  is  to live  in  an  isolationist

citadel,  Article  52K makes it  abundantly  clear

that  without derogating from the force and effect

of  Article 52J nothing in that Article  shall  be

construed as precluding Singapore or any  body  or

organisation in Singapore from participating or co-operating in, or contributing towards, any scheme,

venture,  project,  enterprise or  undertaking  of

whatsoever  nature, in conjunction or  in  concert

with  any other sovereign state or country or  any

body  or  organisation in that sovereign state  or

country so long as such scheme, venture or project

confers,  has  the  effect  of  conferring  or  is

intended  to  confer on Singapore or any  body  or

organisation    in   Singapore,   any    economic,

financial,    industrial,    social,     cultural,

educational or other benefit or is, or appears  to

be  advantageous  in any way to Singapore  or  any

body   or  organisation  in  Singapore.   Nor   is

Singapore prevented from entering into any treaty,

agreement,  contract,  pact or  other  arrangement

with  any  other sovereign state or country  where

such  treaty, agreement, contract or pact provides

for  mutual  or collective security or  any  other

object or purpose beneficial to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Article 52L, I must point out

that  provisions  of the nature contained  in  the

Bill  are  of  no  avail if  they  can  be  simply

repealed  by  another Act of  Parliament.  It  is,

therefore, necessary to entrench this new Part JIB

as  set  out  in the Bill and give the  provisions

therein  a  degree of permanency  in  the  Statute

Books  beyond  that of ordinary  legislation.  The

manner of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



entrenchment  is by prohibiting any alteration  to

Part  IIB  of  the  Constitution unless  the  Bill

making   any  amendment  (including  addition   or

repeal)   has  been  supported,  at   a   national

referendum,  by  not less than two-thirds  of  the

total  number of votes cast by the electors.  Only

then may the Bill be passed by Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the need for a Bill such as this

cannot  be  denied. Unless we take  steps  now  to

preserve  all  that we have won by our  sweat  and

toil, we may wake up one day to see it all gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction of the Constitution

(Amendment) (Protection of the Sovereignty of  the

Republic of Singapore) Bill is in keeping with the

policy speech made by the President in this House.

It   is  an  important  step  forward.  That   the

Government is able to introduce this Bill speedily

in  this  House  proves  that  the  Government  is

attaching  great importance to it as  it  involves

the protection of our rights and the rights of our

future generations to survive. It is also meant to

preserve our sovereignty and independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our country is a small island with limited

space  and  a very short history. Our geographical

position is at the centre of Southeast Asia and is

most   strategically  situated.   Therefore,   our

position  has very often roused the attention  and

interest  of  world powers. Because of  our  great

achievements  and  all round development  together

with  the raising of the living standards  of  our

people   in  recent  years,  many  elements   with

ulterior  motives  and insidious  intentions  have

been  trying to resort to various means to destroy

our  existence  and sovereignty.  Therefore,  this

amendment Bill is very necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Bill is mainly for the

purpose of providing that if there is any proposal

to amend our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



Constitution affecting our sovereignty, then  such

proposal  should  be supported by  at  least  two-thirds  of our electorate at a national referendum

before  it can be passed or effected in this  way,

the  intrigues  and  ulterior motives  of  foreign

elements and ambitious people may be thwarted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the express provisions in the

Constitution,  I  feel  that  there   is   another

important measure that we should adopt. We  should

actively and effectively inculcate in the minds of

our  people a sense of national consciousness  and

patriotism.  Provided our people  have  this  high

sense of national consciousness and patriotism,  I

believe  all  the nefarious designs  of  ambitious

elements  and  people with ulterior  motives  will

fail disastrously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this amendment Bill.



<br><br>3.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is most appropriate

to  introduce this amendment Bill at present  when

we  have just begun the First Session of the Third

Parliament.  The  First Parliament  had  the  main

tasks  and  responsibility  of  consolidating  and

strengthening  our  political stability,  economic

expansion  and a defence capability, because  from

these  efforts the independence of our country  is

ensured  and our sovereignty preserved. Basically,

it   was  a  struggle  for  survival.  The  Second

Parliament had the main responsibility of  solving

the   various  problems  of  defence  and  economy

brought  about  by the withdrawal of  the  British

Armed Forces. In the last few years, not only have

we  solved  all these problems, but we  have  also

managed to achieve a great deal in all fields. Our

economic growth rate has been maintained at  above

10  per  cent. The value of industrial  production

has been increasing continuously. Urban renewal is

progressing very well and the environment  of  our

city  is becoming prettier and cleaner day by day.

All  in all, our efforts in industrialisation  and

modernisation have been extremely successful.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all these prosperous signs have

inevitably  created  jealousy  and  a  feeling  of

insecurity  on the part of some outside  ambitious

people. They are jealous of and perturbed  by  our

achievements because our rapid rate of development

brings  out their deficiency and at the same  time

it  reflects their slow rate of growth, which will

make their own people disenchanted with them. As a

result of this jealousy and feeling of insecurity,

some  people  attempt  through  various  means  to

manipulate some of our political parties,  perhaps

with  the intention of taking over the sovereignty

of  our  country. They think that with their  vast

financial resources they can achieve this  through

their local agents and so manipulate our political

power,  and  then  perhaps  eventually  completely

usurp our sovereignty through some changes in  the

Constitution.  This  is very  dangerous.  We  must

expose and check these attempts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the introduction of this amendment

Bill is to put a stop to all these wild dreams. At

the same time, opportunity is taken to remedy some

of  the  existing  loopholes in our  Constitution.

According  to  Article 90 (1) of the Constitution,

constitutional  amendments may  be  legislated  by

Parliament. In Article 41 (1) a simple majority of

those  present  in  the  House  is  all  that   is

necessary  to  pass  any legislation.  This  is  a

loophole in our present Constitution, because  any

political  party may make use of its  majority  in

Parliament to amend the Constitution according  to

its  wishes. If every political party  adopts  the

way  PAP  is working, i.e, to examine any proposed

legislation  in detail and with great care  before

introducing  it, then there will be no  danger  of

the  Constitution being desecrated. But all  these

preventive  measures are still necessary.  As  the

President has pointed out in his speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`it would be criminal negligence to allow foreign

interests   with  large  financial  resources   to

manipulate  our  internal politics,  by  financing

Singapore    political   parties,    professional,

academic  and  other  groups  to  try  to  beguile

domestic opinion . . . No foreign interests can be

allowed  to take over Singapore through  financing

and manipulating political parties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



through   their  naive  or  vain,  self-proclaimed

leaders.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill provides that unless a two-thirds majority is obtained at a referendum, no

part  of  our  sovereignty may be  surrendered  or

transferred through merger or otherwise  with  any

other country. It also provides that unless a two-thirds  majority in a referendum is obtained,  any

proposed amendment to this Part of the Bill cannot

be effected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many examples in history to show

that  these provisions are essential. The  British

constitution  is  the result  of  several  hundred

years  of  constitutional struggle. Parliament  is

the  highest authority in the country. There,  the

traditions,  customs  and practices  are  held  in

great  respect and are not amended very frequently

in Parliament. In the United States of America, it

is  a, different case. It is a comparatively  new

country.  From  the very beginning,  the  American

people even provided for the basic human rights in

their  constitution. In order  to  preserve  these

basic  rights, the procedure for the amendment  of

the  American Constitution is very complicated and

difficult. Any amendment must be approved by a two-thirds  majority in both Congress and the  Senate.

In  addition,  three-quarters of the  states  must

approve   the   amendment.   Alternatively,    the

amendment must be introduced by two-thirds of  the

states' legislatures and must be approved by  two-thirds  of  both  the Upper and  Lower  Houses  in

America.  In  the  rest of  the  world  there  are

similar  examples. For instance, in the merger  of

Egypt  and Syria, a referendum was held before  it

was  carried  out.  Recently in  the  Scandinavian

countries,   both  Norway  and  Denmark   held   a

referendum to decide whether to join the  European

Common Market. In the case of Denmark, because the

majority  of the people supported the  idea,  they

joined the Common Market. But Norway did not  join

the Common Market, because most of the people were

against  the idea. Although participation  in  the

European  Common  Market is  in  appearance,  only

related to economic issues, however, once a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



country   is   in   the  Common  Market,   certain

prerogatives of the country such as those relating

to  customs, trade, finance, and immigration  will

be  affected  by  decisions of the Common  Market.

Therefore, because this question is too important,

the  countries decided to hold a referendum before

going ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1958, when General De Gaulle took over power

in   France,   he  wanted  to  abolish   the   old

Constitution, and held a referendum to  decide  on

the  issue.  In  our own case in 1963,  before  we

decided  to join Malaysia, although there  was  no

provision in our State Constitution at that  time,

we  nevertheless proceeded to hold a referendum to

decide on the form and the conditions of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provision in this Constitutional

amendment Bill is also very important. It provides

that unless a two-thirds majority is obtained in a

referendum,  the control of the Armed  Forces  and

the Police Force cannot be relinquished. All of us

know  that the Armed Forces are the protectors  of

the  sovereignty  of  our  country.  We  therefore

cannot  allow  any foreign forces,  through  their

local agents to take over control; otherwise,  the

sovereignty of our country will be undermined  and

the  designs of the foreigners will be successful.

I  believe that the majority of our people possess

the  correct decision-making capabilities and will

be  in  favour  of  resorting to a  referendum  on

important  issues  such as  this.  These  measures

providing  for  a referendum are also  in  keeping

with  the  principles of democracy. It is  also  a

sign of democracy at work, because it involves the

direct   participation  of  the  people   in   the

important  affairs  of state. Through  these  very

strict provisions in our Constitution, the foreign

ambitious  plotters will have  their  efforts  cut

short.  It  is  also a blow to  our  own  internal

servile   politicians  who  try  to   please   the

foreigners.  This  amendment Bill  will  make  our

Constitution  more  perfect,  thus  ensuring   the

integrity of our independence and sovereignty.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the amendment

Bill.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  speaking on this Bill, I wish  to  stress  a

point which may allude to serious appreciation  by

our  people. Simply put, Sir, our country's growth

is attributable to the measure of an international

confidence  in  the  country which  attracted  and

induced investment. This, in turn, stimulated  the

economy  which  generated greater  confidence  and

which  attracted more investments and  development

skills,  and  so on. This confidence was  achieved

within  the  first three years of our independence

in  1965. It is a confidence which has been vested

in  an  independent  and  sovereign  Singapore  by

bankers,  industrialists and  traders.  These  are

shrewd men of the world who after much thought and

calculation make the decision that ours will be  a

politically   stable  and  viable  country.   This

calculation surely included the appraisal that  we

are  a  hard working people, determined to  remain

independent and sovereign. On that score. Sir,  we

have managed to secure an international commitment

of extensive investments in our country, which has

accounted  for  a rapid all-round development  and

the general affluence of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our independence and sovereignty, our right and

power   to  determine  our  own  national  destiny

through  realistic  policies  of  Government  have

convinced  sources in various parts of  the  world

that  we  are  a  people who  should  survive  and

prosper.  However, there are also  sources  within

and  without our country which seriously entertain

designs  to incorporate our country in  a  foreign

sovereign state, to resolve political or  economic

irksome   problems  or  to  achieve  a   political

scenario  in  the region which fits  in  with  the

grand designs of super major and foreign powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as long as the incorporation of Singapore in

a  foreign  sovereign  state remains  conveniently

achievable  through  a  simple  legislative   act,

interested  sources  will  pursue  their   designs

through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



black  operations against the state.  Hence,  this

Constitutional amendment which seeks  to  preserve

our independence and sovereignty is welcome, since

it  makes  the act of losing our independence  and

sovereignty a less simple one and truly, and  much

more, a decision of the people.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to express my wholehearted support  for

this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to ask the Minister a point of

clarification,  it is quite well  laid  here  that

there  shall  be  no  surrender  or  transfer   of

sovereignty unless two-thirds of the people are in

favour of that move. But Article 52K provides  for

participation  or  co-operation  in  any   scheme,

venture,  project,  etc., and  entering  into  any

treaty, agreement, or any other arrangement  which

is  beneficial  or advantageous  to  Singapore.  I

understand that the government can enter into  any

of  these  arrangements. The problem  then  surely

must  be this: that if you have a government  that

intends  to sell out the interests of the  people,

they  can  cloak the sell-out of our  sovereignty,

surrender or transfer, by any name - call it  "co-operation",  "treaty", "agreement" or  "contract".

To  my  mind,  the interpretation of that  action,

whether  or  not  it amounts to a surrender  or  a

transfer of sovereignty, is most important. If one

could interpret whether that action is a surrender

or  a  transfer of sovereignty, then  Article  52J

applies. Otherwise, the government in selling  out

the  interests of the people could well  interpret

that their action is beneficial or advantageous to

Singapore and could proceed to do so under Article

52K.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister: who

does  the  interpretation of  that  action  as  to

whether  or  not  that act of entering  into  some

treaty or contract with another power could amount

to a sell-out of Singapore's interests and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



a  surrender  of  sovereignty?  And  whether  that

action  and its interpretation lie with Parliament

at  that  time, or with the people,  or  with  the

Judiciary?



<br><br>3.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, unless we have Article it

would mean that we could not any joint venture, or

enter  into  any  treaty, extradition  treaty,  or

other  s  with any other country. Surely  not  the

purpose of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to guarantee that at

our  sovereignty and independence remain with  us,

and  should  we  want to join up with  some  other

country, as we did with Malaysia before, we should

go  to  the  people - hold a referendum  and  two-thirds  of those casting votes must be in  favour.

Unless  we hive this exception in Article 52K,  we

would  be  precluded from even joining  any  other

venture. It might be a trade venture. It might  be

a  question of economics, or labour, or  something

else.  Should there be any doubts, of  course,  it

would  be  for  the  Courts or  the  Judiciary  to

interpret  whether the move is a  lawful  move  or

ultra  vires the Constitution. We have given  very

careful thought to this particular provision,  and

therefore have phrased it in the way that  it  has

been finally drafted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factories Bill was introduced in Parliament

early  this  year. It was committed to the  Select

Committee after its Second Reading on 28th  March,

1972.   The   Bill  now  before  the   House   is

essentially the same as the earlier version except

for a few additional amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are very concerned with the trend of

industrial  accidents which have  been  increasing

annually  since 1967. Despite the efforts  of  the

Government to inculcate safety consciousness among

the  workers and management and in spite  of  more

stringent enforcement of the Factories Act  by  an

expanded  Factory  Inspectorate,  the  number   of

industrial  accidents is still  increasing.  There

were  2,220 industrial accidents in the first nine

months  of this year compared with 1,374  for  the

same period last year, an increase of 62 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are well aware of the social and economic

cost   of  every  industrial  accident.  The  most

painful  aspect, however, is the human  suffering,

anguish and misery caused by the loss of life  and

health.  The  loss of a father, a  husband,  or  a

loved  one can never be fully compensated whatever

the  quantum of monetary compensation may be.  For

this reason alone, our conscience dictates that we

must   do  everything  possible  to  prevent   the

occurrence of any industrial accident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware of the fact that we cannot hope

to eliminate or reduce the incidence of industrial

accidents  through legislation alone.  However,  a

piece  of  legislation as archaic as the Factories

Act  enacted in vastly different circumstances  14

years ago will not make our task any easier. There

have  been  times when we felt utterly  frustrated

simply because our powers were inadequate to  deal

more  effectively with certain heartless employers

who  had  no  regard whatsoever for  the  welfare,

health  and safety of their employees.  It  is  no

consolation to us that there are not many of  such

employers. The greatest asset of Singapore is  its

human resources. We, therefore, value the life and

health of each



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



and  every one of our workers. We cannot and  will

not  tolerate such callousness especially when our

human  resources are being fully stretched by  the

burgeoning  industries. The Bill  now  before  the

House  seeks  to  remove the inadequacies  of  the

present Factories Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to repeal and reenact with

amendments the Factories Act (Chapter 123 of the 1970 Revised

Edition) with a view to improving the

health   and  safety  measures  and  the   welfare

facilities  of persons employed in factories;  and

ensuring a more stringent observance of the safety

provisions  so as to reduce the rate of industrial

accidents.  The  more significant changes  to  the

existing   legislation  are   described   in   the

Explanatory Statement to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, however, to comment on some of the

more  important  changes. Clause 94  of  the  Bill

empowers  the  Minister  to  appoint  an  Advisory

Council   for   Industrial  Health   and   Safety.

Hitherto,  there was no institutional  arrangement

through  which advice could be sought  on  matters

pertaining  to industrial health and  safety.  The

proposed     Advisory    Council     will     have

representatives from, management, trade unions and

professional bodies and will, therefore,  be  able

to  collectively  advise the Minister  on  matters

affecting safety, health and welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important innovation introduced by the

Bill is the appointment of safety officers. Clause

64  of  the  Bill  requires certain  factories  to

appoint safety officers solely for the purpose  of

exercising  general  safety  supervision  and  for

promoting the safe conduct of work. With the rapid

growth of the number of factories in Singapore, it

would  be  physically impossible for  the  Factory

Inspectorate   to   make  regular   and   periodic

inspections  on  all  these  factories.  It  would

therefore  be necessary to require that management

police  their own factories and ensure  that  they

are  safe. In addition, factories employing 50  or

more  persons  will be required to set  up  safety

committees  to promote health, safety and  welfare

in their establishments. The rationale behind this

requirement,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



which is set out in clause 65 of the Bill, is that

both   management  and  labour,  which   will   be

represented  on the safety committee, can  jointly

contribute  and  participate in the  promotion  of

industrial safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the Government's antipollution

programme,  the  occupier of  a  factory  will  be

required   to  take  special  preventive  measures

against the emission of harmful substances in  the

atmosphere.  He  will  also be  asked  to  provide

appropriate  protection for employees  engaged  in

hazardous  processes. Clause 59 of the  Bill  will

require   the  occupier  to  substitute,  wherever

possible,  less harmful substances,  processes  or

techniques for their more harmful counterparts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also pays greater attention to workers

engaged in occupations involving special risks  to

health. Under clause 62 of the Bill, the Minister

can    make   regulations   to   require   medical

supervision and examination of persons employed in

occupations  specified in the Seventh Schedule  of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Act, certain provisions

relating  to  the safety of an employee  are  made

applicable to work carried out in a harbour or wet

dock  in constructing, re-constructing, repairing,

refitting, painting, finishing, or breaking  up  a

ship,  or in scaling, surfing or cleaning  boilers

in  a ship, or in cleaning any tank or holds in  a

ship.  In  view of the growing importance  of  our

shipbuilding and repairing industry and the  rapid

expansion  of our port and harbour facilities,  it

is  necessary to make further provisions  for  the

health and safety of those workers who are engaged

in  the shipyards, the port and the harbour. These

will be provided for in clause 68 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that about 65 per cent of the

accidents  have been caused by the  negligence  or

refusal  on  the part of the worker to use  safety

appliances  provided  and  observe  the   measures

stipulated.  Clause  73  of  the  Bill  makes   it

mandatory  for employed persons to use the  safety

appliances  provided.  In order,  therefore,  that

this   provision  is  strictly  observed,  it   is

necessary that the culprits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



are   brought  to  book  quickly  and  dealt  with

effectively.  Clause  81 of the  Bill,  therefore,

provides  that  any authorised police  officer  or

Inspector  of  Factories may  arrest  without  any

warrant  any  employed person who has  contravened

clause  73  of the Bill and produce him  before  a

Magistrate's  Court.  Alternatively,  the   police

officer  or  Inspector  can straightaway  serve  a

"ticket"  on  the  offender  to  attend   at   the

Magistrate's  Court  to  answer  the  charge.   In

addition,  clause  78  empowers  an  Inspector  of

Factories  to  require any person acquainted  with

the  facts and circumstances of an accident  or  a

dangerous occurrence taking place in a factory  to

attend  before him and state truly the  facts  and

circumstances with which such person is acquainted

concerning the accident or dangerous occurrence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill provides for an increase in the

quantum  of fines or term of imprisonment  imposed

for infringements of the Bill. For instance, under

the  did  Factories Act, the penalty for operating

an  unregistered factory was a fine not  exceeding

$1,000  or  a  term of imprisonment not  exceeding

three  months. Under this Bill, both the fine  and

term of imprisonment have been increased to $5,000

and  six months respectively. Similarly, under the

Factories Act, the penalty for an employed  person

found  infringing the provisions of the  Act  s  a

fine  not exceeding $500 or a term of imprisonment

not  exceeding  three months. This  Bill  has  now

increased  the fine payable to a sum not exceeding

$2,000.  Such  stiffening  of  the  penalties  for

infringements  of  the law is  clearly  needed  to

bring   home  the  urgency  of  the  problem,   if

employers  and  workers are to  be  deterred  from

contravening the provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the importance of this Bill and

the extensive amendments being made to the present

Act,  I  propose to commit the Bill  to  a  Select

Committee again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will  recall that  the  Employment

(Amendment)  Bill  was  introduced  in  the   last

session  of  Parliament. It was committed  to  the

Select  Committee after its Second Reading on  2nd

June,  1972. In my Second Reading speech  then,  I

have  explained the events leading to the Bill.  I

have  also  drawn attention to the more  important

provisions  of the Bill which, together  with  the

Industrial   Relations   (Amendment)   Bill,   are

designed to give effect to the recommendations  of

the   National  Wages  Council  which  have   been

accepted  by  the  Government.  However,  for  the

benefit  of  new  Members of the  House,  I  shall

recapitulate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in April this year, the National

Wages   Council,  a  tripartite  body   comprising

representatives  from labour, management  and  the

Government  made certain recommendations  on  wage

increases   and   bonuses.   In   announcing   the

Government's acceptance at the NTUC May Day  Rally

this  year,  I emphasised that the recommendations

should   remain  as  guidelines  for  negotiations

between  employers and their employees,  or  trade

unions representing the employees. We cannot  make

the  recommendations mandatory because  there  are

some  employers who are genuinely unable to  grant

the  increases  recommended  by  the  Council.  To

compel  them to do so would tantamount to forcing

them out of business. However, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



necessary  to  amend  those  provisions   of   the

Employment  Act and the Industrial  Relations  Act

which    would   otherwise   prevent   the    full

implementation  of  the National  Wages  Council's

recommendations  particularly in regard  to  bonus

which, under the present Act, is negotiable up  to

a maximum of one month's wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 23rd May, the National Wages Council and

representatives  of  the  Chambers  of   Commerce,

Singapore Employers Federation, National Employers

Council,  Singapore Manufacturers Association  and

the  National Trades Union Congress, met the Prime

Minister and myself, to discuss ways in which  the

recommendations  of  the  National  Wages  Council

could  be  given  effect.  The  parties  concerned

unanimously agreed that the recommendations of the

National Wages Council should not be approached in

a  legalistic  way. However,  in  so  far  as  the

recommendations  were  contrary  to  any  existing

legislation, such legislation should be amended to

remove  any legal impediment to the implementation

of  the  recommendations. Further  where  enabling

provisions were necessary, for example, to make it

possible  for  an employer to opt for  either  the

13th  month  payment and a bonus,  or  13th  month

payment and an annual wage revision, such enabling

legislation should be passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties also agreed that where in any

particular  case  no agreement  could  be  reached

between  employer  and union  and  a  dispute  was

referred to the Industrial Arbitration Court,  the

Industrial  Arbitration  Court  should  take  into

account the recommendations of the National  Wages

Council  and  the  special circumstances  of  that

particular employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment (Amendment) Bill now before the

House   was   drafted  in  the  light   of   the3e

agreements. It also incorporates those suggestions

and  proposals made to the Select Committee before

the   dissolution  of  the  last  Parliament   and

accepted by the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact section 46 of the Employment Act to enable

an  employee  or  a trade union  of  employees  to

negotiate  for the payment of any of the following

or a combination thereof: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an annual wage supplement of an amount not

exceeding the equivalent of three months' wages of

an employee;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) an annual bonus of an amount not exceeding

the  equivalent  of  three  months'  wages  of  an

employee;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) annual wage increases.



<br><br>A   trade  union  of  employees  is  entitled   to

negotiate for the payment of either both an annual

wage  supplement and an annual bonus  or  both  an

annual  wage supplement and annual wage increases.

An  employer has a right to make an option between

negotiating for the payment of both an annual wage

supplement  and  a bonus or both  an  annual  wage

supplement and annual wage increases. However,  he

shall  be  bound by his choice of option  for  the

duration  of  any  award or  collective  agreement

which  may  be  made regarding these payments.  An

employer  who  cannot afford to  pay  any  of  the

aforesaid  combinations may offer to negotiate  to

pay  an  annual wage supplement or bonus or annual

wage  increases. The provisions of the  Industrial

Relations Act shall apply to these negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms "wages", "annual wage supplement" and

"annual  wage increases" are defined in the  Bill.

The annual wage supplement is intended to have the

same meaning as the 13th month payment recommended

by the National Wages Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual wage supplement that shall be payable

by  employer  who has paid annual bonuses  to  his

employees  prior to the commencement of  this  Act

shall  be equivalent to the average of the bonuses

paid  in respect of the last three years preceding

the commencement of this Act or to the last annual

bonus paid, whichever is the greater, subject to a

maximum  of an amount equivalent to three  months'

wages  of  his employees, except that  where  such

bonuses  were based on exceptional trading results

or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



increased  productivity, which the employer  finds

have  diminished  to  a  significant  degree,  the

employer may negotiate for a lower quantum of  the

annual  wage supplement to be paid. If an employer

has  not  paid any bonus to his employees  or  has

paid a bonus of less than one month's wages before

the  commencement  of this Act,  the  annual  wage

supplement  payable by him shall  not  exceed  one

month's wages of the employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For computation of annual wage supplement payable

by  an  employer,  all ex-gratia payments,  salary

supplements and other such payments paid by him in

the last three years preceding the commencement of

this  Act to an employee as an incentive to  enter

into  a  collective agreement or to  increase  his

productivity  or  as a reward  for  his  services,

shall  be deemed to be bonuses paid in respect  of

the last three years preceding the commencement of

this Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an offence for any person or a trade union

of   employees  to  invite  negotiations  for  the

payment  of  an annual wage supplement  or  annual

bonus of an amount which exceeds the equivalent of

three months' wages of an employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a notice is served under section 17 of the

Industrial Relations Act by an employer or a trade

union  of employees in respect of the annual  wage

supplement, annual bonus or annual wage  increases

referred to in subsection (1) of section 46, or  a

combination   thereof  as  is   referred   to   in

subsections  (2) and (3) of that section,  and  no

agreement is reached between the parties on any of

these   matters,   either  of  the   parties   may

notwithstanding the provisions of  the  Industrial

Relations  Act, refer the matter to the Industrial

Arbitration  Court  which  may  make  a   decision

thereon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions are made in the Act which enable an

employer to invite a trade union of employees, and

for the latter to invite an employer, to negotiate

for  the  variation of a collective  agreement  or

award  made before or after the enactment  of  the

Bill by including a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



provision for the payment of either an annual wage

supplement  or  an  annual bonus  or  annual  wage

increases, or a combination thereof as is referred

to  previously.  Where  no  agreement  is  reached

between  an  employer or trade  union  to  vary  a

collective  agreement or award in accordance  with

subsection  (1)  of  section 46A,  either  of  the

parties may, notwithstanding the provisions of the

Industrial  Relations Act, apply to the  Court  to

vary  the collective agreement or award,  and  the

Court  may vary the collective agreement or  award

as the Court thinks fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any variation of a collective agreement or award

shall   be   incorporated  into   the   collective

agreement  or award, and any of the parties  bound

thereby  may  apply  to  the  Court  to  vary  the

collective agreement or award so as to give effect

to  their agreement, and the Court may accordingly

vary  the  collective  agreement  or  award.   The

collective  agreement  or award  so  varied  shall

continue in force for the period of the collective

agreement   or  award,  or  until  the  collective

agreement or award is further varied by the Court,

whichever first occurs. A collective agreement  or

award that is so varied shall have effect from the

date of the variation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, opportunity is also taken to

amend  section 38 of the Employment Act  to  raise

the  limit  imposed on overtime work by  employees

from  48  hours per month to 72 hours  per  month.

This  amendment is necessary in view of  the  near

full  employment situation in Singapore, resulting

in  serious  shortage  of  certain  categories  of

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has accepted that the

recommendations  of  the  National  Wages  Council

shall  take  effect from 1st July,  1972.  It  is,

therefore,  necessary for the  Act  to  come  into

force from this date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sustain and accelerate our present pace

of  economic  development,  we  must  continue  to

pursue   the  policy  of  industrial  peace   with

justice. This calls for closer co-operation and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



greater  understanding between labour,  management

and  Government. It also calls for an orderly  and

equitable  distribution of the  additional  wealth

created  by  the  joint efforts of the  tripartite

partners.  So long as the employers are  fair  and

reasonable  and  the  trade  unions  do  not  make

irresponsible and excessive demands,  the  outlook

of our future will always be bright.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

three  important Bills tabled for Second and Third

Readings  today.  The Employment (Amendment)  Bill

and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill are,

in  my  opinion,  very important  legislations  on

employment,  which  should be implemented  in  the

spirit  in which they are passed. We are all  well

aware  of  the  need for the introduction  of  the

Employment Act in 1968. The trade unions have  co-operated  fully  to make the Bill workable.  Since

the  implementation of the Employment  Act,  there

has  been so much talk of tripartism in industries

and  we  have made all efforts to make  tripartism

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the Addendum to the President's speech, a

call  has been made to unions, employers  and  the

Government  to  work  together  for  the  national

interest. Greater emphasis is to be given  to  the

prevention  or  elimination of, and  I  quote  the

Addendum,  "nascent  points  of  friction  between

labour  and management before they assume  ominous

proportions".  Similarly, in  an  address  at  the

annual   dinner   of   the  Singapore   Employers'

Federation,  the Minister for Labour  has  soundly

rebuked  those  employers  whose  sluggishness  in

negotiations   is  not  conducive  to   harmonious

industrial relations with their workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these references which I have just

made  is  to  remind Members of  the  House  that,

despite   the   countless  exhortations   by   the

Government  to  both employers and unions  to  co-operate  with one another in the interest  of  the

Republic, there are still employers or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



their  managerial representatives who regard trade

unions  as  necessary nuisances  to  be  tolerated

rather  than  desirable partners to be co-operated

with.  I  wish  to bring to the attention  of  the

House   a   regrettable  but  nevertheless   true,

instance   of  the  medieval  attitude   of   some

employers  or  professional  managements   towards

trade  unions. One well-established and  otherwise

reputable employer in Singapore, whose workers are

represented by an affiliate of the NTUC,  recently

decided  in  a  mood  of paternal  benevolence  to

revise  slightly  upwards the  salaries  of  their

employees.  But without previously  consulting  or

even  notifying  the  trade union  concerned,  the

employer informed their employees on 20th  October

of  this  year  that  their salaries  were  to  be

revised   with  retrospective  effect   from   1st

October.  Members  of  this House  may  very  well

wonder what my grievance is, or rather what is the

grievance of the trade union concerned, since  the

workers have been given a slight increase  in  pay

by  their  employer. The matter, however,  is  not

simply  a question of pay increase. In the process

of  revising upwards the salaries of the  workers,

the  employers have also changed the salary scales

of  the employees concerned, resulting in the need

for  a  conversion  exercise in the  placement  of

employees  from the old salary scales to  the  new

salary  scales. It is natural that with  employees

previously receiving different salaries under  the

old  scales  being grouped together  on  the  same

incremental  point in the new salary scales,  some

employees   receive   disproportionately   greater

increases  than others. The trade union  concerned

has informed the employer that its members are not

happy  over  the basis of conversion in  that  the

increases  in  salaries  have  been  unnecessarily

disproportionate and inequitable from an objective

point  of  view, and that the conversion has  been

implemented  without prior consultation  with  the

union.   The  new  scheme  also  does  away   with

promotion grades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The managerial representative to whom the

dissatisfaction was conveyed,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



however,  replied that the revision of the  salary

scales was approved and sanctioned by the relevant

person in charge of finance, who had not given any

instruction or indication that the revised  salary

scales were to be implemented in consultation with

the  trade union representing the workers. In  the

circumstances,   the   managerial   representative

bluntly  informed  the union  that  there  was  no

question  of  any discussion as to an  alternative

and  fairer  basis  for conversion  from  the  old

salary   scales  to  the  revised  salary  scales.

Another  managerial representative, a very  senior

official  of  the establishment, also  added  that

none  of  the  workers  had  directly  voiced  any

dissatisfaction with the revised salary scales and

that  it  was  the  "damn trade union"  which  was

seeking  to  create a dispute between the  workers

and their employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident which I have just related may seem

to  be  the  kind to be expected of  an  unusually

recalcitrant  employer in the  private  sector  of

Singapore. I think Members of this House would  be

I   surprised  to  learn  that  the  trade   union

concerned  is  the  Amalgamated  Union  of  Public

Employees  (AUPE)  and that the employer  is  none

other  than  the Ministry of National  Development

and  the Ministry of Finance of the Government  of

Singapore.  Members  of the House  would  be  also

interested to learn that the trade union concerned

has  served a notice, in writing, as far  back  as

October  1962, to the Government to negotiate  for

better  terms  and  conditions  of  service.   The

official  side,  in  accepting the  invitation  to

negotiate,  had  stated that such  acceptance  was

"intended   to   promote   goodwill    and    good

relationship   between   your   union   and   this

Ministry". During the intervening 10 years between

1962 and 1972, the Ministry has never revoked  the

recognition accorded to the union to represent the

employees  of  the Ministry. It is,  therefore,  a

gross  violation of all accepted  norms  of  sound

industrial  relations practice  for  the  Ministry

unilaterally and arbitrarily to revise the  salary

scales and conditions of service and to proceed to

implement such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



revised  salary scales and conditions  of  service

without   prior   consultation   with,   or   even

notification to, the trade union concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retort of the Ministry, in response to the

complaint  by  the  union  of  such  improper  and

arbitrary  change in the terms and  conditions  of

service,  to  the  effect that no  employees  have

expressed  any dissatisfaction was irrelevant  and

mischievous. In the first place, no employee would

himself  wish  to be singled out for  the  dubious

attention of his supervisors or superior  officers

by  voicing his dissatisfaction with the  increase

of  pay  accorded to him, when the  same  superior

officer  obviously considers such an  increase  in

pay  as  a generous gesture on their own part.  In

the  second place, since the employees are members

of   a  registered  trade  union  which  has  been

accorded  recognition  by their  employer,  it  is

natural   for   the  employees  to   voice   their

dissatisfaction  to the union in  the  expectation

that  the union would take up their grievance with

their employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point that should be remembered by Members of

the  House is that the Government has accorded  to

civil  servants and other public employees, except

those  in  the Singapore Police Force and  in  the

Singapore Armed Forces, the right to organise  and

bargain  collectively.  Such  civil  servants  and

public employees may or may not have the right  to

bring   their   disputes  before  the   Industrial

Arbitration  Court,  but  there  is  no   law   in

Singapore to preclude or to prohibit trade  unions

representing  civil servants or  public  employees

from   entering   into   negotiations   with   the

respective ministries and departments on the terms

and  conditions of service of their members.  Once

recognition has been accorded to a trade union  in

respect  of  a  particular group of employees  the

employer, whether it be a Government department or

a private company, is expected to treat such union

with  some  courtesy and respect  as  befitting  a

collective bargaining agent on behalf of such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



group  of  employees. Where the employer seeks  to

vary or change the terms and conditions of service

of  the  employees,  it is only  proper  that  the

employer  secures the agreement of a  trade  union

representing   such   employees   to   avoid   any

misunderstanding and friction. In  the  particular

incident which I have related earlier, the revised

salary  scales may be beneficial to  some  of  the

employees concerned, but the conversion  from  the

old  salary scales to the new salary scales  is  a

highly  controversial  matter  and  the  immediate

promotional  prospects have  been  altered.  These

should  have  been  referred to  the  trade  union

concerned  for  their  views before  the  Ministry

proceeds to implement such a proposal on the basis

it arbitrarily decides upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not doubt or question the integrity of the

Ministry  officials concerned. But even  with  the

best  of intentions, any individual person  cannot

be  expected to be infallible in any matter or  in

every matter. Otherwise, there would have been  no

need  for the tripartite basis of consultation  so

fervently   advocated  by   the   Government   and

implemented  in  relation to  the  National  Wages

Council, and there would have been no need  for  a

trade union movement in Singapore at all.



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Employment (Amendment) Bill before this House is a

logical   consequence  to  the  setting   up   and

operation of the National Wages Council. It is  to

provide  enabling  provisions  in  the  employment

legislation  to  give effect to the implementation

of  the  recommendations  of  the  National  Wages

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a legal loophole in this

exercise  whereby some mischievous  employers  may

take  advantage of by denying their employees  the

benefit  of  the recommendations of  the  National

Wages   Council  on  the  ground  that  they   are

technically  not  covered by the  Employment  Act.

Recently,  three  NTUC affiliated unions  received

negative response from the employers to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



their invitation to negotiate wage increases along

the  national  guidelines of  the  National  Wages

Council  in  respect  of  their  members  who  are

drawing  monthly  salaries  exceeding  $750.   The

immediate  reply  from these  employers  was  that

those  drawing $750 and above do not  come  within

the  scope  of the Employment Act, and  therefore,

are  not entitled to receive any increments on the

basis  of  the 1972 national wage guidelines  laid

down by the National Wages Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general understanding, when the National

Wages   Council   was  set   up   and   when   its

recommendations were made this year, was that  the

National  Wages  Council's  recommendations  would

apply  to all workers, whether they are paid  more

or  less than $750 per month. It will not lead  to

harmonious  industrial relations if employers  are

to  deny  some of their employees the benefits  of

the recommendations of the National Wages Council,

simply  because their employees are  drawing  more

than  $750.  You will be surprised, Sir,  that  in

modern  Singapore, we still have a  few  employers

adopting   a   medieval  approach  to   industrial

relations. The Member for Telok Blangah  has  just

given an example of one such employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to seek the assurance of

the   hon.  Minister  for  Labour  that  he  would

exercise   his   good  offices  to   ensure   that

unenlightened  employers  do  not  frustrate   the

objectives  of  the Government in setting  up  the

National Wages Council, by refusing to honour  the

National   Wages   Council's  recommendations   on

technical grounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  just like to get some information from  the

Members for Telok Blangah and Moulmein. I want  to

know how many employees of the NTUC are members of

trade unions, and which unions do they belong  to.

Are they getting the 13th month payment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, if the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Labour wishes to get

an answer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



from the, I say that all employees of trade Unions

receive  whatever is recommended by  the  National

Wages Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my question

is  whether the employees of the NTUC are  members

of any union at all?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, this is a democratic

country,  and the right to join or not to  join  a

union  lies with the worker himself. There  is  no

restriction  laid  down by the trade  unions  that

their  employees  cannot join a  trade  union.  In

fact, some of them are members of unions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Sia, I think it is better to carry

on this private conversation in the tea room.



<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  pointed out by the Member for Moulmein,  there

is  some  confusion  in the interpretation  as  to

whether or not the general recommendations of  the

National  Wages Council should I only cover  those

whose  salaries  are below $750.  There  are  many

employers,  both  in  the  Singapore  Manufactures

Association    and    the   Singapore    Employers

Federation, who queried the interpretation of  the

recommendations of the National Wages Council, but

there  is  no clarification from anybody.  It  has

been  implied  initially that  since  this  is  an

amendment  to  the  Employment Act,  which  covers

employees  whose  salaries are up  to  $750,  some

employers  take the view that it is not applicable

to  employees whose salaries are above $750. Other

employers who are more generous perhaps feel  that

what  you  give  to  the lower  grades  should  be

extended  to those in the higher grades.  But  the

difficulty  from the employers' point of  view  is

that  if you stretch it above $750, where  do  you

draw  the line? Is it above $750 up to $2,000,  or

what?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to seek the good offices

of  the  Minister for Labour for some guidance  to

the  employers  on  this matter,  because  at  the

moment there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



definitely  -  I  would not say confusion-  but  a

misunderstanding  of  where  the  line  should  he

drawn,  as  has  been  queried  by  the  Singapore

Manufacturers Association itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  the  recommendations  of  the  National  Wages

Council,  there was no specific mention that  wage

increases  should not be given to employees  whose

salaries  are  above  $750. I  presume  that  some

employers will take the line that employees  whose

salaries are above $750 are not entitled to  enjoy

wage  increases  as recommended  by  the  National

Wages  Council.  I think this is their  deliberate

intention.  I would strongly suggest  that  either

the  Government  or  the  National  Wages  Council

should   clarify  as  to  whether   or   not   the

recommendations on wage increases  are  meant  for

all  workers  irrespective of what their  salaries

are.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in recounting

the  events  leading  to the introduction  of  the

Employment (Amendment) Bill, I have explained that

the  purpose of the Bill was to give effect to the

recommendations of the National Wages Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been listening patiently to the Member for

Telok  Blangah  for the last 10 minutes,  thinking

that  he  was  going  to comment  on  the  salient

features of the Bill. It would appear that I  have

been   mistaken.   He   has  instead   taken   the

opportunity to launch an attack on a matter  which

has nothing whatsoever to do with the substance of

the Bill under discussion. I am afraid I am in  no

position  to  comment  on the particular  instance

raised  by  him as I have neither been  acquainted

with  the facts by the union concerned nor have  I

the opportunity of listening to the other side  of

the  story. No doubt, my colleagues, the  Minister

for  National  Development and  the  Minister  for

Finance,  will take note of the Member  for  Telok

Blangah's  complaint  and  deal  with  it  in  due

course. In any case, the Member for Telok



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



Blangah is well aware of the established grievance

procedure governing civil servants, and I have  no

doubt   that  he  will  take  advantage  of   such

established means of settling grievances to mutual

satisfaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of tripartism is the correct

approach  to industrial relations in our situation

today.  I have again reiterated this view  at  the

annual   dinner   of   the   Singapore   Employers

Federation  referred to by the  Member  for  Telok

Blangah,   and  the  Ministry  will  continue   to

advocate such a policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have reiterated earlier that the

recommendations  of  the  National  Wages  Council

should not be approached in a legalistic way. Even

though  the Employment Act does not cover  workers

drawing more than $750 salary per month, there  is

nothing  in the Act or in any other law to prevent

employers from granting salary increases  to  such

workers, in accordance with the recommendations of

the  National  Wages Council. The main  constraint

will be the maintenance of good employer/ employee

relations, as it affects the productivity  of  the

firm and the ability of such employers to med  the

increased  cost, without seriously  affecting  the

firm's  competitive position. The good offices  of

the  Labour Ministry is always at the disposal  of

both   unions  and  employers.  The  Members   for

Moulmein  and  Bukit  Ho  Swee  can  always  avail

themselves of the service when the need arises.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I thought the Minister was

going   to   give  way,  Sir,  in  a   matter   of

explanation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you want to clarify, Mr

Govindasamy?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes, Sir. The Minister just

mentioned that he would allow his good offices  to

he  used in the matter of tripartite difficulties.

Perhaps he would use his good offices in a problem

between the union and the Government itself,  that

is, the Ministry of Finance.

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as in the case of the Employment (Amendment)

Bill,  the  Industrial Relations (Amendment)  Bill

was  committed to the Select Committee in the last

Parliament after its Second Reading on  2nd  June,

1972.  In  presenting  the Employment  (Amendment)

Bill  earlier, I have explained that  it  will  be

necessary  to also amend the Industrial  Relations

Act  to  enable the implementation of the National

Wages  Council's  recommendations.  The  Bill  now

before the House seeks to achieve this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Industrial Relations Act, the

tenure  of  collective  agreements  or  awards  is

between  three and five years. Both employers  and

trade  unions  represented on the  National  Wages

Council  have expressed the view that this  period

is unduly long and restrictive. The Government has

accepted   this   representation,  and   therefore

proposes to reduce the number of years for which a

collective  agreement  or award  is  binding  from

three to five years to two to three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 31 of the Industrial Relations Act

currently provides that the Industrial Arbitration

Court  shall  have cognizance of a  trade  dispute

where -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) all the trade unions and employers who are

parties  to a trade dispute jointly make a request

in writing to the Registrar that the trade dispute

be submitted to arbitration;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Minister by notice in the Gazette

directs  that  the trade dispute be  submitted  to

arbitration; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the President of Singapore by proclamation

declares  that by reason of special1 circumstances

it  is  essential  in the public interest  that  a

trade dispute be submitted to arbitration.



<br><br>In  accordance  with  the recommendations  of  the

National  Wages  Council, this  section  is  being

amended   so  that  the  Court  shall  also   have

cognizance of a trade dispute where a trade  union

or  an  employer who is a party to a trade dispute

makes  a request in writing to the Registrar  that

pursuant  to  subsection  (6)  of  section  46  or

subsection  (3)  of section 46A of the  Employment

Act,   the   trade   dispute   be   submitted   to

arbitration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 34 of the Industrial Relations Act

ci4rrently  provides that in determining  a  trade

dispute the Industrial Arbitration Court may  have

regard  not  only td the interests of the  persons

immediately concerned but also to the interests of

the  community as a whole and, in particular,  the

condition of the economy of Singapore. It  is  now

proposed that, in addition to the above, the Court

also  pays due regard to the recommendations  made

by  the  Minister  in relation to wage  increases.

Such  recommendations would be  published  in  the

Government Gazette from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to provide that on or after

the  1st day of May, 1974, the parties bound by  a

collective agreement or award, made prior  to  the

enactment of this Bill, may make an application to

the  Industrial Arbitration Court to vary the said

agreement or award.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill

was  committed to the Select Committee before  the

dissolution  of  the  last  Parliament.  All   the

representors  have  been  heard  by   the   Select

Committee  and  some  of  their  suggestions   and

proposals have been incorporated in the  pill.  As

such,  I  do not propose to commit the Bill  to  a

Select Committee again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, talking about the fundamental effect

that  economic  development has  on  our  national

construction,  I  would like to stress  the  point

that  as Singapore is a very small country we have

no  other  alternative  hut  to  rely  on  foreign

investments in industries to promote our  economy,

so as to enable us to carry out the task of nation

building. In the past the Government has spared no

effort  in promoting economic development, and  we

have  achieved some brilliant success. An eloquent

testimony  to  this  can be  found  in  the  acute

shortage  of labour in Jurong. The achievement  is

all  the  more remarkable when we compare it  with

what  we  had a few years ago before independence.

The  present  situation  augurs  well  for  nation

building.  The people of Singapore are well  aware

that  as  we  have  laid  a sound  foundation  for

industrial development in recent years we have  to

adjust our pace of progress in order to adapt to a

new  environment  and to create  a  new  model  of

society  so as to establish harmonious  and  happy

relationship among our people. As to when we  will

be  able to succeed in our task, this will  depend

on  the  amount of effort put in by the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to cite a very well-known

example.  With the rapid progress in our  economic

development, there have been great changes in  the

method  of  production  and business  organisation

which  hitherto  have been based  on  the  family-kinship  system. Under such a system the employer-employee

relationship was poor. The workers  were

poorly paid for their loyal service. In the  light

of    present   day   situation,   this   abnormal

exploitation  of man by man has become  ever  more

evident.  Such a family business organisation  and

discriminatory  industrial relationship  have,  in

fact, become out-dated as well as a stumbling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



block  to  our economic development. On the  other

hand,  the  great influx of foreign investors  not

only  brings  with it a great deal of  investments

which are beneficial and very much needed, hut  it

also  brings  in  new and even unique  styles  of management techniques. In this new industrial era,

if  we  are to maintain the pace of our industrial

development and the rate of economic growth and if

we  are  to improve the living conditions  of  the

great masses of workers, it is of vital importance

that the National Wages Council should play a very

decisive role.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from hoping that the National Wages Council

will  implement its policy effectively and firmly,

I  would  also  like to request the Government  to

embark  on  a  comprehensive  research  into   our

industrial management techniques to find out  what

is suitable for local conditions, and to formulate

new  management techniques in order  to  encourage

and popularise them as models for our society. For

example,  the management techniques  used  by  the

American  entrepreneurs  in  Singapore  are   very

successful. So are the management techniques  used

by  the  Japanese  business concerns.  Both  these

techniques  are equally effective,  although  they

may  not  be  identical. There are both advantages

and  disadvantages in these management techniques.

With the support of the Government, the people  in

Singapore  can  learn from these techniques  in  a

very  short time and adapt it to local conditions.

It  will  then  become  a  driving  force  in  our

economic   development.  At  present,  among   the

multitude of industrial workers, apart from a  few

who  are satisfied with their lot, there is  great

mobility among the majority of the workers where a

lack of discipline and responsibility exists. Such

workers are opportunists. In other words,  such  a

worker  works  in  a factory only  because  he  is

better  paid there. If another factory offers  him

higher wages, he will not hesitate to leave for  a

more  lucrative  employment. It is  obvious  that,

before  we  can formulate an ideal set of  working

conditions,  the  people would  consider  monetary

income as the sole criterion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



for employment. However, with the establishment of

better working conditions, their concept will  not

change so easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

stress that although economy plays a decisive role

in our nation building, it is not the only factor.

Coupled  with the general guidelines laid down  by

the  National  Wages Council, if we can  evolve  a

certain  work  ethic  or  certain  principles   of

employment, such as to imbue oneself with  a  love

for  work, a love for their workplace, and a  love

for  their country, then we Singaporeans  will  be

able to carve our destiny.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought that

the  debate on the President's Speech is over  and

done with last week, and that there should not  be

any further debates on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of

modernisation of management techniques is not  the

subject of debate. Nevertheless I hope the  people

most  concerned with management will take note  of

the points raised by the Member for Henderson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from time to time the Commissioner of Public

Health  has  to close cemeteries and/or crematoria

in  certain  locations in the public interest  and

burials or cremation in these locations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



will  have  to  be discontinued. The  Commissioner

will  then arrange for burials thereafter to  take

place in other locations provided by the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing section 109 of the Environmental

Public  Health Act provides that the  Commissioner

of  Public  Health may close a cemetery  place  of

burial,  crematorium or any  place  used  for  the

burning of corpses if it appears to him that  such

places are:-



<pre>

`(a). . . in such a state as to be dangerous to

          health; or



 (b). . . (i) . . . inoxious or offensive or unfit

          for use as a cemetery or crematorium;



         (ii) . . . cannot be further used for the

          burial  or  burning of the dead  without

          danger to public health;



        (iii) . . . being used in contravention of

          any condition of the licence; or



         (iv) . . . no longer required.'

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill which is now before the House provides

for  the repeal of the existing section 109 of the

Environmental   Public   Health   Act,   and   the

substitution  of  a  new section  109  which  will

empower the Commissioner of Public Health to close

a  cemetery,  burial  ground, crematorium  or  any

place used for the burning of corpses if he is  of

the opinion that burials or the burning of corpses

should  be  wholly discontinued in such  cemetery,

crematorium   or   place;   or   such    cemetery,

crematorium,  place or any part thereof  is  being

used  in  contravention of any  condition  of  the

licence issued in respect of the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noted from what I have just said that

the new section empowers the Commissioner to close

cemeteries or crematoria without having to  assign

reasons  for  doing  so,  as  required  under  the

existing law. Land in Singapore is scarce. It must

be  used to serve the needs of the living. It  is,

therefore, esser4tial that the Commissioner should

have   adequate  powers  to  reduce  the   present

wasteful profusion of cemeteries. The commissioner

should  also have the power to confine burials  to

the  State-owned cemeteries, thereby reducing  the

acreage earmarked for burials and putting the land

to use for the living.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing subsection (2) of section 109

provides   that  no  closing  of  a  cemetery   or

crematorium,  or  revocation  or  amendment  of  a

licence,  shall have effect "unless and  until  it

has  been confirmed by the Minister and until  the

expiration  of  one month from such confirmation."

in  the new subsection (2) 01 section 109 set  out

in  the  Bill,  the requirement  of  awaiting  the

expiration   of  one  month  from  the  Minister's

confirmation  is  removed. The  closing  order  is

effective immediately on confirmation, Sir, if the

confirmation  is  not effected immediately,  fresh

burials  could  take place during  the  one  month

period  between confirmation by the Minister  arid

the effective date of the confirmation. This would

aggravate  the  problem of  exhumation  and  would

delay re-use of the land.

<br><br>4.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide the Public

Utilities Board with a more efficient and flexible

administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity contains both an energy component and

a non-energy or wattless component. In clause 2 of

the Bill, it is now proposed to substitute for the

word    "energy"   a   more   appropriate    word,

"electricity". Consequential amendments  are  also

made  in  the  Bill to substitute  for  the  words

"light", "electrical energy" and "energy" wherever

they appear in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



the   Act,   the   word  "electricity"   to   give

uniformity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, under clause 3 thereof, also amends the

constitution  of the Board from the present  fixed

number of ten non-public officers to not less than

five but not more than ten members to be appointed

by  the  Minister. Consequently,  the  quorum  for

meetings of the Board is also amended under clause

4  of  the Bill, from seven to a majority  of  the

members  of the Board. These amendments, Sir,  are

necessary as, since the enactment of the provision

of  section 5 of the Act, it has not been possible

to  appoint the whole of the ten members resulting

in  the Board sometimes being without a quorum  to

conduct its business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill enables the Board to perform

any  functions assigned to it by the Minister, and

clause   6   empowers  the  Board  to  incorporate

companies to carry out any of its functions.  With

these amendments, Sir, the Board will now be  able

to  provide  consultancy services and  to  form  a

company to provide such consultancy services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 7 and 8, the Board is conferred

with  additional power to cut off supplies of  gas

and electricity in case of emergency, fire and  in

certain other circumstances. It also empowers  the

Board to cut off supply of water in case of misuse

or waste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For administrative expediency, provision is made

under  clause  9  of the Bill  for  the  Board  to

delegate  to  the Chairman certain of its  powers,

functions and duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill makes it necessary for the

Board  to  obtain the approval of the Minister  in

prescribing tariffs, and it also enables the Board

to  fix  different tariffs for consumers similarly

situated for a temporary period to he approved  by

the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board (Provident Fund) Rules

have  been  amended  to enable  the  employees  to

appoint  nominees to whom the amount  standing  to

the  credit  of  a deceased member may  be  given.

Although paragraph (e) of section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



31  (2)  of the Public Utilities Act provides  for

the appointment of a nominee, paragraph (h) of the

same  section does not include that a  receipt  by

the  nominee  or nominees is a valid discharge  to

the Board for any moneys payable. Clause 11 of the

Bill will remedy the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the offence for obstructing or hindering the

Board's  employees  in  the performance  of  their

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two new appointments were created recently

in  the  Corrupt  Practices Investigation  Bureau,

namely,  a  Deputy Director and  a  Chief  Special

Investigator, to cope with the increasing work  in

the  Bureau. But the Prevention of Corruption  Act

as it now stands does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



confer  on  the incumbents of these two posts  the

powers  that are now being exercised by the  other

officers  of  the  Bureau, namely,  the  Assistant

Directors,   Senior   Special  Investigators   and

Special investigators. This Bill, therefore, seeks

to  amend the said Act in order to confer  on  the

Deputy Director and the Chief Special investigator

the   powers   now  exercised  by  the   Assistant

Directors and Investigators of the Bureau.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At an International Conference held in Brussels

in  1968,  participating governments  were  called

upon to adopt an amended set of rules relating  to

Bills  of Lading in place of the Hague Rules.  The

Hague  Rules  have formed part of our  laws  since

1927,  being  set  out  in  the  Schedule  to  the

Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (Chapter 184  of  the

Revised  Edition).  These Rules  provide  for  the

responsibilities,   liabilities,    rights,    and

immunities  of  carriers  vis-a-vis  shippers   in

contracts  (usually Bills of Lading) for  carriage

of  goods  by  sea  in relation  to  the  loading,

handling,  storage, carriage,  custody,  care  and

discharge of such goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hague Rules have been amended by a Protocol

agreed at Brussels in February, 1968. The Protocol

incorporates changes, which international maritime

nations  considered  necessary,  since  the  Hague

Rules  were  first adopted in 1924.  The  Protocol

does not constitute any change in substance in the

balance  of  liabilities and  responsibilities  of

carriers vis-a-vis shippers, and it merely unifies

certain rules of law relating to Bills of Lading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most maritime nations of the world have acceded

to this Protocol and have incorporated it in their

legislation.  Singapore,  in  keeping  with  other

world  maritime nations, has also acceded  to  the

Protocol and is now, therefore, required  to  pass

legislation to incorporate the Protocol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House seeks to give

effect  to amendments to the Hague Rules  relating

to  the Carriage of Goods by Sea contained in  the

Protocol  agreed internationally  at  Brussels  in

1968. It repeals the Carriage of Goods



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



by  Sea Act which gave effect in Singapore to  the

Hague  Rules in their original form. The Rules  in

their amended form are set out in the schedule  to

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the financial year of the National

Statistical Commission of Singapore under the  law

is  the calendar year, whereas the financial  year

of  the Government is the period of 12 months from

the  1st day of April to the 31st day of March  in

each  year. However, as the Commission  is  wholly

dependent  on Government funds for its  operation,

having  the  same financial year would  facilitate

its  financial  estimating  and  control.  It   is

necessary, now, to make provision through  clauses

2,  3 and 4 of the National Statistical Commission

of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, 1972, to enable the

Commission to adopt as its financial year a period

of  12  months ending on the 31st day of March  in

each year and to prepare its accounts accordingly.

There   is  a  transitional  provision   for   the

Commission's  financial year in  1972  to  be  the

period between the 7th day of January 1972 and the

31st  day  of March 1973, the 7th day  of  January

1972 being the day of coming into operation of the

National Statistical Commission of Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>5.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore Act (Chapter

195   of  the  Revised  Edition)  was  passed   by

Parliament on 2nd September, 1970. Parts I, II and

V   of  this  Act  came  into  operation  on  26th

December,  1970,  while the remaining  parts  came

into operation on 1st January, 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed that, in order to facilitate

Singapore's development as a financial centre  and

in  the  light  of  experience gained  during  the

period of operation, certain amendments be made to

the  Monetary  Authority of Singapore  Act.  These

amendments  to  the  Act are incorporated  in  the

Amendment Bill now before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal amendments appear in clauses 5 and

6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 is designed to confer upon the Monetary

Authority    of   Singapore   certain   additional

functions such as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) purchasing, selling, discounting and re-discounting bills of exchange and promissory

notes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) granting advances to certain approved

financial institutions against Treasury Bills  and

securities  of  the  Government,  gold  coins   or

bullion,  bills of exchange, promissory notes  and

warehouse warrants.



<br><br>These   additional  functions  will   enable   the

Authority   to  provide  lender  of  last   resort

facilities to approved financial institutions, and

are necessary for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



establishment of an efficient money market,  which

will  in  turn  expand and improve  the  financial

infrastructure    of   Singapore    and    enhance

Singapore's development as a financial centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 introduces two new sections 24A and 24B.

In   section  24A,  provision  is  made  for   the

Authority  to  grant special loans  to  banks  and

approved   financial  institutions  in  times   of

monetary   instability  against  such   forms   of

security as the Authority may consider acceptable.

In  section  24B,  power  is  conferred  upon  the

Authority,  if it thinks fit, to issue  directives

and  guidelines to approved financial institutions

for their operations and orderly development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed also to make the following

amendments, which appear in clauses 2, 3 and 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Clause 2 increases the authorised paid-up

capital of the Authority from $30 million to  $100

million.  The  authorised paid-up capital  of  $30

million  us now fully paid-up, and it is necessary

to   provide  for  future  increases  in  capital,

whenever these are considered desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clause 3 would enable the Authority to have

greater   flexibility  in  the   appointment   and

promotion of certain categories of persons without

having  to  seek the advice of the Public  Service

Commission on all appointments. This clause, which

has  been drafted at the suggestion of the  Public

Service  Commission, will enable the Authority  by

Gazette  notification  to specify  the  posts  and

appointments regarding which it would have to  act

on the advice of the Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Clause 4 would enable the functions, duties

and  powers conferred upon a public officer  under

any   written  law  to  be  transferred   to   the

Authority.   This   amendment   contemplates   the

transfer  to  the Authority of powers  and  duties

such  as those conferred upon the Commissioner  of

Chit  Funds  under  the  Chit  Funds  Act.  It  is

envisaged  that such powers transferred from  time

to  time  to the Authority would be those  related

exclusively to money and finance.
