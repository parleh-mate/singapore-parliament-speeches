<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>TEACHER TRAINING IN 1968</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Number of applicants accepted and rejected)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a) how many persons applied  for  Teacher

Training in 1968, and how many were accepted and  how

many  rejected;  and (b) what were the qualifications

of those who were selected and those rejected.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  there  were   5,547

applicants  for  793 vacancies in  teacher  training.

Seven  hundred and fifty one appointments  were  made

and  4,796  applicants were rejected. The  number  of

appointments was slightly smaller than the number  of

vacancies  because some graduate vacancies were  left

unfilled  for lack of suitable applicants and  a  few

selected  candidates  with  School  Certificate   and

Higher  School  Certificate  qualifications  declined

appointment at the last minute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second part of the question, all the

selected candidates satisfied the age and citizenship

requirements   and   the  great  majority   possessed

educational  qualifications higher than  the  minimum

requirements  which are specified in the  recruitment

advertisement  and  vary according  to  the  type  of

training  and  the language medium. Some  of  the  un

successful candidates were rejected because they  did

not  satisfy  the  age and citizenship  requirements.

Others  were rejected owing to the limited number  of

vacancies  in  the particular type  of  training  for

which they were eligible.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, can the

Parliamentary Secretary inform the House how many  of

those  rejected  were in possession  of  the  minimal

required qualifications?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the majority of those

rejected  had the minimum qualifications,  but,  off-

hand, I cannot give the exact figure. If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



hon. Member so desires, he can give notice of another

question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>TEACHER EDUCATION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Adjustments or changes)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Education what adjustments or changes have been  made

in teacher education to meet the needs of the country

at this stage of its development.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

major adjustments and changes have

been  made in teacher education to meet the  relevant

needs of the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the emphasis on technical education, the

training  of  technical  teachers  has  been  greatly

stepped  up  at  the Teachers' Training  College.  At

present,  the  College  is conducting  three  special

technical courses in addition to the normal technical

ones.  The  special courses are the  industrial  arts

course, a crash craft teacher training programme  for

holders  of  the  School Certificate and  the  Higher

School  Certificate. The third course is for the  re-

training  of  non-technical  qualified  teachers   in

metalwork, woodwork and basic electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the shortage of technical teachers, student-

teachers who joined the first year part-time  general

course  were  encouraged to  opt  for  the  technical

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several in-service courses, both professional and

non-professional, are being conducted and planned  to

promote    professionalism   within   the    teaching

profession and also to inculcate greater awareness of

the  political,  economic and social changes  in  the

Republic. These courses have been designed as part of

the general further teacher education programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasis has also been laid on courses conducted in

the   teaching  of  English  and  Chinese  as  second

languages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>NANYANG UNIVERSITY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Honours degree courses)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <B>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</B> asked the Minister for

Education,  since the Nanyang University degrees  are

recognised by the Government and some Departments  of

the  University are adequately staffed and  equipped,

if  he will ask the Council of the University to look

into  the  possibility  of  the  University  offering

honours  degree  courses as from  the  next  academic

year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  it  is  learnt  from   the   Nanyang

University  authorities that the University  proposes

to  introduce,  as  from the next  academic  session,

honours  degree  courses in a number  of  departments

that are well staffed and equipped. It is also learnt

that  those  departments which are not yet  ready  to

offer  honours degree courses will do so as and  when

staff   and  facilities  have  reached  a  comparable

standard.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>NANYANG UNIVERSITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>GRADUATES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Admission to higher degree courses at University of Singapore)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <B>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</B> asked the Minister for

Education  if he will as-certain from the  University

of  Singapore  authorities whether consideration  has

been  given  to the admission of Nan-yang  University

graduates  to higher degree courses at the University

of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the University

of  Singapore now admits Nanyang University graduates

as  candidates  for Master's degrees. Generally,  for

admission  as  a candidate for a Master's  degree,  a

person  must  be  a  graduate of  the  University  of

Singapore  or a graduate of such other university  as

the  Senate  may  approve, and must have  obtained  a

degree  with  honours  and must  submit  evidence  of

adequate  training  and  ability  to  under-lake  the

proposed course.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, exceptions are made for graduates of

universities which do not award degrees with honours.

Graduates  of  such  universities, including  Nanyang

University, can therefore be considered for admission

as   Master's   candidates  provided  the   Faculties

concerned   are  of  the  view  that  they   are   of

exceptional  merit.  They  must  take  a   qualifying

examination of a standard equivalent to that  of  the

University's own honours examination. If  the  Senate

is  assured  by  the  Faculties  concerned  that  the

candidates  have  reached the honours  level  in  the

qualifying  examination, it will then consider  their

admission  as  Master's  candidates  in  the   normal

manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University of Singapore has admitted two Nanyang

University B.A, graduates to the Master's courses  in

Arts.  Five  Nanyang University B.Sc, graduates  who

have  obtained  the  Diploma in  Fisheries  from  the

University  of Singapore have also been  admitted  as

Master  of Science candidates doing research  in  the

field of fishing.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOLARSHIPS FOR TECHNICAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>EDUCATION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Number to be offered to teachers and University students in 1969)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Education,  in  view  of the Government's  policy  of

encouraging  technical education,  how  many  scholar

ships  in this field will be offered in 1969  to  (a)

University students, and (b) teachers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is not possible at this juncture  to

state  how  many  awards in the  field  of  technical

education  will  be  offered in  1969  to  university

students  and  teachers as the 1969 Budget  proposals

have yet to be passed by Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awards made this year are generally renewed next

year  subject  to satisfactory progress and  conduct,

while fresh awards would largely depend on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



availability of suitable applicants to meet the needs

of  industry and institutions in both the public  and

private sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greater allocation of the voted provisions will

most  assuredly be made to those who take courses  of

study  that will enable them to contribute  a  useful

role to society on graduation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following information will, however, indicate

the  encouragement  given in the field  of  technical

education.



<br><br><b>(a) University students</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of a total of 87 new awards which included

scholarships,  bursaries and study  loans  made  this

year  for  the  1968/69 session, 84 awards  were  for

students  in the Singapore Polytechnic and three  for

students  in  Ngee  Ann College. Of  the  awards  for

students  in  the Singapore Polytechnic, four  awards

were  for  professional courses, 29 awards  were  for

degree  courses  and 51 were for technician  courses.

The  three  awards for students in Ngee  Ann  College

were for Mechanical Engineering. In addition to these

awards,   there  were  60  new  awards  for  overseas

training  under various technical assistance  schemes

in   Australia,  Canada,  New  Zealand,  the   United

Kingdom, Japan, Germany and France.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total number of 131 scholarships and bursaries

were   renewed   for   students  in   the   Singapore

Polytechnic and Ngee Ann College this year.  Of  this

total  number of renewals, 128 were for  students  in

the  Singapore Polytechnic and three for students  in

Ngee Ann College.



<br><br><b>(b) Teachers</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for scholarships to teachers in technical

education,  the  Government has  already  approved  a

total  of  28  awards for training overseas  in  1969

under  various schemes such as the Colombo Plan,  the

Commonwealth Teacher Training Bursary and the  United

Nations Development Programme. Such training covers a

wide  range  of  technical subjects  in  fields  like

machine shop and fitting, motor vehicles, welding and

sheet metal,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



electrical installation and maintenance, shipbuilding

and  drafting,  building,  woodworking,  trade  skill

testing  and trade standard, wood carving,  modelling

and  sculpture,  in  Australia,  Canada,  India,  the

United Kingdom, France and Italy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty-six bursaries were awarded this year to

technical student teachers at the Teachers'  Training

College.  For next year provision has been  requested

for  150 fresh awards for full-time technical teacher

training.

<div align="center"><b>ON-THE-JOB TRAINING IN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Legislation for compulsory intake of students)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Low Guan Onn</b> asked the Minister for

Education,  in  view  of  the  reluctance  and  unco-

operative  attitude of employers to offer  on-the-job

training opportunities for short periods of  time  to

students  of  Vocational Institutes, the  Polytechnic

and the Universities, if the Government will consider

introducing  legislation to make  it  compulsory  for

industries  to take in a quota of students  for  such

training each year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is aware that active

participation of industry at various levels  in  some

form of in-plant training scheme is essential. We  do

get    the    co-operation   of    some    industrial

establishments  in  providing  short-term   training,

conducted  within the institutional  training  period

during vacation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As industry in Singapore is now undergoing

development  and  expansion, many  d~  not  have  the

necessary   supervisors   and   industrial   training

officers  to  organise effective on-the-job  training

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a greater output of vocational-technical

graduates from our institutions by 1970, the question

of  promoting  this facet of technical  education  by

suitable legislative measures or fiscal relief may be

considered,  if co-operation from industry  is  still

not adequately forthcoming by then.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

will the Parliamentary Secretary consider measures to

see that apprentices and trainees are not exploited

as cheap labour if legislation is introduced?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, I assure the hon. Member

for  Kallang  that we will consider this matter  very

carefully.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Sir, does the Parliamentary

Secretary  not  consider  the  reluctance  and  unco-

operative  attitude of certain employers selfish  and

shortsighted  and  not  conducive  to  the   national

interest in economic development?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will say

"reluctance" but not "unco-operative". The reluctance

of  employers is due more to the lack of personnel to

conduct  these  courses.  For  such  courses  to   be

effective,  there  must  be  suitable  and   adequate

supervisory  personnel. At this stage of  development

and  industrialisation, most of the industries, I  am

afraid,   are  not  adequately  equipped  with   such

personnel.

<div align="center"><b>RADIO AND TELEVISION COURSE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ON ENGINEERING SCIENCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Low Guan Onn</b> asked the Minister for

Education,   with  the  emphasis  now  on   technical

education, if the Government will consider conducting

a  weekend  radio and television course on the  basic

theory  of  engineering science for  the  benefit  of

those  workers  in industries who have the  practical

skills  but  lack  theoretical  knowledge,  as   such

knowledge  will upgrade the quality of  their  skills

and improve the standard of goods produced.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the possibility of using the

television  medium as an extension of the  vocational

and technical education programme is being considered

by  the  Ministry.  The basic theory  of  engineering

science for workers in industries is also included in

this  study.  A  preliminary survey shows  that  such

programmes could be mounted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



provided  adequate staff and finance  could  be  made

available.

these  children will be admitted to schools of  their

parents'  choice and only 4,284 or 7.7 per cent  need

be  posted  to  schools other than of their  parents'

choice,  because  such children  were  registered  in

excess  of  the  maximum intake of  the  schools  con

cerned.  All the 4,284 children registered in  excess

have  already  been  posted  to  schools  which  have

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars of schools and specialist teachers and principle on staffing)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Education (a) what are the various official  types  of

Government and Government-aided schools to  date;  (b)

what  are  the different official kinds of  specialist

teachers  on  the staffs in those schools today,  that

is,  the  specialist  teachers as  distinct  from  the

general   teachers   like  the  Normal   Trained   and

Certificate in Education teachers; and (c) what is the

principle  governing  the  current  staffing  of  such

schools.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, to date, there are  the  following

official types of schools:



<pre>

  <b>Government Schools</b>

       Primary schools

       Primary cum Vocational schools

       Secondary schools

       Secondary Technical schools

       Secondary Vocational schools.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from January 1969 there will be only

three official types:

<pre>

      Primary schools

      Secondary schools

      Secondary Technical schools



  <b>Government-aided schools</b>

       Primary schools

       Secondary schools

       Full schools (i.e. schools with both

            primary and secondary classes.)

       Trade school.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part of the question, Sir, there

are three official types of specialist teachers on the

staff of Government and Government-aided schools (full

and secondary schools), namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Grade I (drawing allowance of $240 p.m.)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Grade II (drawing allowance of $180 p.m.)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Grade III (drawing allowance of $120 p.m.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the third part of the question, Sir, the

principle  governing  the  current  staffing  of  such

schools  is  to  ensure  that schools  are  adequately

staffed  with  teachers to teach the subjects  on  the

curriculum  at  primary and secondary levels.  Special

care  is taken to see that adequate provision is given

for  teaching  second languages,  technical  and  voca

tional   subjects  including  domestic  science.   The

governing principle bears close relation to the number

of  classes in a school, the level of instruction, and

the   type   of  subjects,  whether  second  language,

technical or vocational.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it that these

specialist  teachers will be undertaking the  teaching

of  special subjects and that, apart from them,  there

will  be the category of general teachers who will  be

expected  to  undertake the teaching  of  any  subject

assigned to them by the principal of the school.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to

the  scheme  of educa-~ tional service,  a  specialist

teacher  is one who is employed to teach such subjects

as   English,  Mathematics,  Science,  Geography   and

History at Secondary 111 and higher levels. This, is a

dying category and no new appointments have been  made

in this grade since January 1968.

in  1968;  and (h) how many students in the University

of   Singapore,  Nanyang  University,   Singa-, pore

Polytechnic  and Ngee Ann College are  scholarship  or

bursary holders, and' if he will give details  of  the

various scholarships and bursaries awarded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  7,389  Secondary  IV  and  1,240  pre-

University  students  have been exempted  from  paying

school  fees in 1968. But I would like to stress  this

point.  Although the other students are  paying  their

school  fees,  the Government has to  subsidise  every

secondary  school student to the extent of about  $300

each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-three scholarships and 759 bursaries were

awarded  and 147 study loans were made to a  total  of

939  students in the University of Singapore,  Nanyang

University,  the Singapore Polytechnic  and  Ngee  Ann

College  in 1968. I would also like to point out  that

although these students are paying from $450  to  $540

on  fees, each student in these institutions of higher

learning is subsidised by Government by a sum  varying

from  $2,000 to $7,000. In fact the fees paid by these

students is negligible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of scholarship open to Singapore

citizens  pursuing  higher  studies.  They   are   the

President's  Scholarships valued at $3,000  per  annum

and the Merit Scholarships valued at $2,400 per annum.

Both  are awarded on the basis of academic 'excellence

in  the  Higher  School  Certificate  examination  and

outstanding   performance  in  extra-curricular   acti

vities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Merit bursaries valued at $1,500 per annum for

degree  courses  and $1,000 per annum  for  technician

courses are also awarded on the basis of merit  alone,

irrespective of financial circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special bursaries are set aside for Malays who gain

entry  to any institution of higher learning  and  who

qualify  for  assistance  on  financial  grounds.  The

amount of such bursaries varies according to the need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All scholarship and bursary holders are bonded to

serve the Government on completion of their studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are unable to get a scholarship or a

bursary, interest-free study loans of the same  amount

as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



bursary awards are available. Students who obtain such

loans  are not bonded to serve the Government but  are

required  to  repay their loans by instalments  within

three years of completing their studies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

this  kind  of policy should be praised and commended,

but  can  the Parliamentary Secretary assure  us  that

this same policy will be pursued next year?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we review our

policy every year but I do not

anticipate major changes.

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars of expenditure)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for Education

(a)  how much was spent by each school for the  recent

tree-planting and gardening competition; (b) from what

source   was  the  expenditure  met;  and   (c)   what

percentage per school of the expenditure came from the

school's miscellaneous fund.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the three questions can be conveniently

answered together. For the Tree-Planting Campaign  and

Competition,  the  Ministry  of  Education  authorised

principals  of  schools the use of  the  Sports  Fund,

Science Fund and Miscellaneous Fund. Restrictions, how

ever,   were   placed  on  the  use  of  such   funds.

Utilisation  of  the  Sports Fund  was  restricted  to

purchase of top soil, fertilisers and sludge  and  for

the  transportation  of  sludge;  utilisation  of  the

Science  Fund  was  restricted  to  purchase  of  tree

saplings  and rooted or unrooted cuttings  for  potted

plants which could not be obtained free of charge from

the Botanic Gardens and the Woodleigh Nursery; and the

utilisation of the Miscellaneous Fund was limited to a

maximum of $200 for the purchase of materials such  as

tree-guards,  pots  and  bricks  which  could  not  be

obtained from the Central Supplies Office.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount spent by schools ranged from

approximately  $50  to $200. This  variation  in  the

total   expenditure  and  also   the   variation   of

expenditure from the Miscellaneous Fund were  due  to

differences  between  schools in available  resources

and facilities and in the sizes 'of school grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the campaign and competition some schools were

fortunate enough to obtain voluntary contributions of

potted  plants,  saplings and bricks  from  teachers,

parents,  old  boys  and  well-wishers,  through  the

assistance  of School Advisory Committees,  Parent  /

Teacher Associations and Old Boys' Associations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  can the Parliamentary  Secretary  say

what action will be taken against a school which used

money in excess of the $200?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if there is

such  a  case,  we  shall investigate  it  first  and

ascertain the circumstances in which the excess money

came  to  be used. If it should transpire that  as  a

result  of  investigation further action is necessary

the case will be looked into further.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, liaison between

schools  and the National Museum with regard  to  the

better utilisation of museum facilities has not  been

adequately established, as the National Museum is not

as yet in a position to provide a proper museum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



school  service to cope with the increasing  interest

and requests from schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education is considering

arrangements with the appropriate authorities for the

provision,  of a museum school service. The  organisa

tion   of  such  a  service  will  depend  upon   the

secondment  of  suitable  teachers  to  the  National

Museum  as museum education officers. New posts  will

have   to   be  created  in  the  National   Museum's

establishment so that the secondment of teachers  can

be effected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will take some time for all these establishment

problems to be sorted out, although in principle  the

idea of organising a school museum service has been -

acceptable    as   a   very   desirable   educational

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question [3rd

December,   1968],  "That  Parliament  approves   the

financial  policy of the Government for the financial

year  1st January, 1969 to 31st March, 1970." -  [The

Minister for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>3.02p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise in admiration, but not wholly in support,

of  the business-like Budget that has been forcefully

and   persuasively  presented  by  the  Minister  for Finance. The Budget, as I see it, can be divided into two parts. One deals with the need for an increase in the  Government's revenue. The other spells  out  the precise manner in which the increase may be effected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no denying the validity of the Minister's

contention   that   with   Singapore   assuming   the

responsibility for its own security and  defence,  it

is  necessary to find funds to train our citizens and

equip  them  with the military hardware for  our  own

defence.  That is, as the Minister has  pointed  out,

defence in the event of limited warfare - not warfare

involving the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



super-powers. A convincing case has been made out for

such realistically qualified defence of our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows logically that new taxes have .to be

imposed to make possible such defence. A snag here is

that  taxation does not seem to be conducive  to  the

promotion  of industrial development. The  difficulty

has  been overcome, however, by adopting a policy  of

indirect  taxation  which is to  be  borne  by  those

sufficiently  affluent  to  bear  it.   The   general

impression seems to be that the Budget is as fair  as

can be in the circumstances. But I prefer to leave it

to  those  Members  in this House who  represent  the

interests of the employers to point out in detail how

the  Budget  is not expected to have any disincentive

effect on the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I prefer to touch on the disincentive

effect of the Budget on the workers of Singapore.  It

is  with  some temerity that I attempt to  point  out

such  disincentive effect, as the Minister has thrown

out  a  challenge  to  us to say that  the  proposals

contained in the Budget are not necessary or correct.

It  is  my  intention, however, to try to  avoid  the

challenge by restricting myself to pointing  out  the

omission  from  the  Budget of  proposals  that  seem

equally necessary and correct to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned with the effect of, for instance, the

imposition  of  15  per cent tax on made-up  garments

which  include  underwear.  Two  reasons  have,  been

advanced  for  such a tax. One is that  it  helps  to

promote our local industries. The other is that those

who  prefer imported foreign goods can very well  pay

for  their  preference. Granted that the reasons  are

valid,  I  do  not think the duty of  the  Government

should  end  with the imposition of  tax  alone.  The

reason  why  local consumers prefer to pay  more  for

foreign  goods  than  for  the  locally  manufactured

equivalent is simply that the former is far  superior

in quality. That being the reason, there seems hardly

any justification that the taxpayer should in-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



directly    continue   to   subsidise    our    local

manufacturers   who   have   been   accorded   enough

privileges or incentives to make' the other  citizens

appear  to be second-class, as it were. The need  for

some  sort of quality control of locally manufactured

goods  seems reasonable before the Government  starts

penalising  local consumers for alleged bias  against

local goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with quality control, it seems

equally reasonable that there' should be some sort of

retail  price  control or restriction The  Government

has  not been averse to enacting legislation to  curb

fringe  benefits obtainable by our workers. But  when

it  comes  to'  enacting legislation to restrain  the

greed  of  our  domestic breed of entrepreneurs,  the

Government seems to drag its feet. Yet time and  time

again, it has been observed that the increase in  the

retail  price of any goods on which a tax is  imposed

is  more than proportionate to-the amount of the tax.

To illustrate this point from my actual experience, I

inquired about the price of a certain imported  brand

of  briefs and singlets the day after the publication

of  the' Budget, and I was not surprised to find that

the  price had increased from $1.20 to $1.60 a piece,

representing a jump of 33 1/3 per cent. If I have  to

pay  this  33  1/3 per cent increase, I would  rather

that  it  goes  into  the Government  revenue  to  be

utilised for the general benefit of all than for  the

particular enrichment of a few. The insult to  injury

is  compounded  when  it  is  realised  that  if  the

Government were to' rescind the 15 per cent tax  next

year, the price of the brand of underwear to which  I

have referred would be decreased by not more than ten

per  cent,  if at all. This is borne out by  our  sad

experience  after the devaluation of the sterling  in

November  1967.  The  Prime  Minister  optimistically

affirmed  that  by  maintaining  the  parity  of  the

Singapore dollar the workers of Singapore were given,

in  effect, a 14 per cent increase in wages. It would

be  interesting  to  know how many  imported  British

goods had their prices reduced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



by  14  per cent, if at all. I would not be surprised

if  the  answer  is none, given the  avarice  of  the

entrepreneurs who hold Singapore to ransom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licence to plunder given to the local importers

and  their  business  associates  would  not  be   so

damaging if it were not for the fact that a resultant

near-monopolistic situation is created for the  local

manufacturers of a range of protected  goods.  It  is

ironical  that the local taxpayers who subsidise  the

so-called  "pioneer" industrialists  by  way  of  tax

exemption are abused and slandered if they try to get

their  money's 'worth by buying imported goods rather

than contributing to the bulging pockets of the local

industrialists.  It  is  not  surprising   that   the

Singapore  Manufacturers'  Association  is  full   of

praise  for the Budget which enshrines the  principle

that  money  begets money. The ordinary citizens  who

form   the  vast  majority  of  the  population  have

repeatedly been admonished by the Government  not  to

rock  the boat and to place national interests before

their  own  selfish  interests. Yet  the  local  manu

facturers, who continue to churn out inferior quality

goods, such as "Malcoa", which are no substitute  for

imported brands, such as "Milo", and which have to be

forced  down the throats of the local consumers,  are

frequently  complimented  on their  profit-orientated

attitude and their non-competitive incompetency.  The

ridiculousness of the whole situation may  be  summed

up by reference to commonplace goods in daily use,  I

refer  to  "Lux"  soap,  for  instance,  which   when

imported  costs  25 cents a piece  but  when  locally

produced  costs 60 cents a piece and looks less  like

soap.  I should think the credibility talk about  the

benefits    of    industrialisation   becomes    more

increasingly  apparent  and  painful  to  the   local

consumers  who  must foot the bill both  ways  -  tax

exemptions as well as higher prices. It may  also  be

mentioned that the Minister has wide powers to impose

quotas and other restrictions at any time whenever he

deems necessary. Such quotas and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



restrictions only lead to a spiralling cost of living

in the absence of any legislative restraint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrialists, however, would be fools if they

do  not  take  advantage  of  the  artificial,  near-

monopolistic situations handed to them  on  a  silver

platter in the sacred name of development. The remedy

is for the Government to enact legislation on quality

control and retail price control or restrictions. The

need  for legislative restraint on our industrialists

and  developers is imperative, particularly from  the

long-term  point  of  view.  The  Minister  has,  for

instance,  proudly referred to the number  of  hotels

mushrooming   in  Singapore.  Yet,  in  knowledgeable

quarters, it is widely held that Singapore hotels are

on  the  way to pricing themselves out of the tourist

trade  in this region. The damage done to Singapore's

reputation as an inexpensive tourist centre, when the

present shortage of hotel accommodation in the region

is  over, would be disastrous and irreparable. I have

been  given  to  understand that  the  organisers  of

packaged  tours  catering for major segments  of  the

tourist   trade  are  already  beginning   to   leave

Singapore out of their itineraries, as the high hotel

prices  in  Singapore  eat into their  profits.  Such

being  the  situation,  it  is  high  time  that  the

Government  took some measures to balance the  short-

term interests of the entrepreneurs, who invest their

capital  here  for  profits,  against  the  long-term

interests of the ordinary citizens who make Singapore

their home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Substitute "monopoly" for "power" and we will not  be

too  far wrong. The Budget contains, for instance,  a

proposal  to  levy a 15 per cent tax on the  sale  of

liquid  petroleum  fuel  for  cooking  purposes.  The

justification is that such fuel is being sold at  too

competitive  a price in relation to the rate  charged

for the Public Utilities Board gas. But the point  is

that  vast areas of Singapore are not piped  for  the

supply  of  P.U.B, gas. If the residents  of  a  huge

private housing estate, such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



as  Serangoon  Gardens, for instance,  were  to  make

applications  for gas connection, it would  be  years

before their applications can be considered. I  would

imagine that the Ministerial reply would be that  the

residents  in  private  housing  estates   are   more

affluent  and,  therefore, in a  better  position  to

withstand the economic squeeze than the residents  in

Housing  and  Development Board housing estates.  The

only way to disprove such assumption is apparently to

conduct  a  survey on the per capita  income  of  the

residents in the respective estates. If such a survey

is  not feasible or practical, then a rough count  of

the  per capita distribution of cars, excluding those

for commercial usage, may be of some help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my last point, which concerns the

state  of  the  economy.  The  Minister  has  proudly

pointed  out that the economy of the Republic, while

not  exactly booming, has developed at a satisfactory

rate  and  shows every indication of maintaining  its

momentum. A reference has been made, however, to  the

per capita gross domestic expenditure of Singapore as

standing  at $1,940 which represents a six  per  cent

increase over that of last year and which conceivably

gives  Singapore a standard of living second to  that

of Japan in Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures cited, however, relate to the average

pattern    of   distribution   of   gross    domestic

expenditure.  It may be interesting if  the  Minister

can  arrange for the publication of data relating  to

the    median   distribution   of   gross    domestic

expenditure.  Judging  from  the  percentage  of  the

population  who have no other sources of income  than

the meagre allowances doled out by the Social Welfare

Department,  I would estimate that one-fifth  of  our

population   has   a   per  capita   gross   domestic

expenditure  of  not  more than $400.  We  must  also

remember  that non-citizens are not entitled  to  any

Social Welfare relief.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that every year the Government

progressively  and  in-directly  reduces   the   vote

allocated for Social Welfare relief, with the  result

that those dependent on the dole find it increasingly

difficult  to  survive. The' vast majority  of  these

unfortunate  people are in their present  predicament

not  because  they are malingerers but  because  they

cannot obtain employment. Some cases are particularly

tragic  because they represent the casualties in  the

transition of Singapore's economy from entrepot trade

to  manufacturing  industry. There is  no  retraining

scheme  for the retrenched employees of import-export

houses which closed down as a result of import quotas

and  tariffs. As these employees have meagre  savings

or  are  too  old  or  possess  unwanted  skills  for

alternative employment, they have no choice but to go

on the dole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these circumstances, it would be

extremely  cynical of the Government  to  pursue  its

policy  of  promoting a rugged and robust society  to

the  logical  conclusion of starving the unemployable

citizens  to death. With the present rates of  Social

Welfare  allowances, the recipients are condemned  to

an  equally miserable fate of living death.  Thus,  I

hope  the Government will find some way and the neces

sary  funds  to  take care of our  citizens  who  are

hapless  through no fault of their own. But,  at  the

same  time, I wish to congratulate the Government  on

presenting  a  reasonable Budget. The  only  trouble,

from  my viewpoint,, is that it leaves too many loose

ends to strangle the ordinary citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no doubt among us of the need for

suddenly and unexpectedly as the present estrangement

of relations between Malaysia and the Philippines. So

is  the  sudden and 'dramatic turn of events  in  the

Vietnam  war.  So  it may be for  Singapore  and  our

perdition  if  we  allow ourselves to  be  caught  un

awares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the United Nations and the balance of terror

among the nuclear power nations, mankind is far  from

having  achieved the elimination of war among peoples

and  nations. The super-powers can restrain, or  even

connive  at conflicts on a limited scale among  small

nations,   but  they  cannot,  even  in   their   own

interests,  prevent a localised conflict  if  one  of

two, or both, small nations are determined to have it

out  on  the  battlefield.  So  let  us  not  deceive

ourselves.  The world may not be able  to  survive  a

full-scale  war among the super-powers,  but  it  can

afford  a  hundred wars among the small  nations.  We

must  be  realistic. We must be equipped for our  own

defence  in  the eventuality of a small nations'  war

and,  if  possible,  in partnership  with  our  other

immediate counterparts in the Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under

the  circumstances,  the Government   is  certainly  right

in  having   given priority  to  defence expenditure in the

new  Budget, and I am in complete agreement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



with   the  Government's  decision  and  the  Finance

Minister's    explanation   regarding   the    annual

expenditure on defence, which is $314 million or near

ly a quarter of the total Budget expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I draw the attention of this House

to the Minister's comment on the state of  the economy  of

Singapore? As in the previous  year,  the Minister's  statement

on the gross  national  product and  economic  growth  sounds

most  encouraging  and optimistic  - Gross Capital formation up  by  17  per

cent  and  gross domestic expenditure up by  7.7  per

cent  over  the previous year. Trade has also  surged

upwards  by  14.5  per  cent,  although  there  is  a

considerable deficit balance of $960 million. This is

really very surprising to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be inclined to be as optimistic as the

Finance  Minister had it not been for the  fact  that

figures quoted without qualification can prove to  be

most puzzling, especially for the public. I refer  in

this  respect to the 7.7 per cent increase  in  gross

domestic expenditure quoted by the Minister, which he

said  was  associated with the rate of investment  in

fixed  assets undertaken by the economy. I  would  be

happy  if  the  Minister  for Finance  could  clarify

whether  this  figure represents the  value  of  real

growth in gross domestic expenditure, over and  above

the  increased  cost  of  living,  or  the  rate   of

inflation in the economy. In other words, the crucial

question  here is, has our standard of living  really

increased?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our new industries at their infant stage and

the protection accorded them, an increase in the cost

of living would appear quite inevitable. Many locally

produced  goods  are by no means cheaper  than  those

imported  formerly. In fact, many items have actually

become more costly. But this increased cost can  only

be   justified  provided  the  net  income  generated

locally and foreign exchange earned or saved  by  our

new  industries is greater than the increase in  cost

to local consumers if the establishment of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



new  industries has resulted in such increased  cost.

For in such a situation increased cost will be offset

by  greater  increase in income and net  addition  to

gross  national product, and our standard  of  living

will  have  actually improved. The  Budget  statement

presented  by  the Finance Minister  would  certainly have

been more meaningful had it provided a breakdown of figures

of the position of industries to show that such a positive

effect has actually taken place.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, there

is another grey area in the

Finance  Minister's  statement  which  needs  to   be

clarified.  I refer to the ominous substantial  trade

deficit of $960 million which our economy suffered in

the  first nine months of this year, which the  Minis

ter  has only seen fit to mention but not explain.  A

deficit of this size is certainly not a feature of  a

buoyant economy. In the absence of facts and figures,

one   could  only  speculate  and  arrive   at   many

implications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what is the implication of this deficit in

respect  of  our  manufacturing  industries?  As  our

manufacturing sector has to depend almost entirely on

imports  for its raw materials, plant and  machinery,

is this a sign that we are unable to export enough to

pay  for  the  purchase of these  imports,  which  if

allowed  to continue in the long run, will mean  that

our  industries are not actually self-generating  and

will  run  into a dead end and be doomed to  failure?

What   is  the  position  of  our  exports   in   the

competitive  export market? Much publicity  has  been

given  by our Government to the numerous trade  pacts

and  trade missions which we have carried out in  our

export  drive.  But,  sadly, hardly  any  substantial

information has been given in regard to the extent of

the success of these efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, are there any other avenues for us to boost

further our export sales to secure improvement in our

trade  balance  in the short and; long  run?  Sir,  I

refer in this context to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



home  markets  of  the  foreign  industrialists   now

operating  in Singapore. Our Government has  provided

very  generous concessions and innumerable incentives

to  foreign  investors. But, are these  same  foreign

investors and their governments willing to open their

home  markets  for our products? It is  a  well-known

fact that parent companies and governments of foreign

subsidiaries, in their own interests, are often quite

unwilling to open their home markets to the  products

of their foreign subsidiaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to give an example. For instance,

the  Yamaha motor cycle manufacturing company have  a

factory  in Singapore. They manufacture motor  cycles

but  their parent company in Japan will not allow  us

to export these locally-made motor cycles for sale in

Japan or even to any other country for sale there  so

long  as the parent company of Yamaha has established

a  market  there.  In other words, the  motor  cycles

manufactured  in Singapore can only be  sold  to  the

local  people. Or we have to find new markets in  the

international  field. Therefore, instead  of  earning

foreign  exchange,  we  are losing  foreign  exchange

because  we have to use our foreign exchange  to  buy

machinery and raw materials, if the Government is not

careful  in  selecting investors and allow  any  Tom,

Dick  and Harry to come in, I think it is not helpful

to our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we can make successful inroads into the home

markets of foreign investors, which the Puerto Ricans

and  the Japanese have achieved in the United States,

then  perhaps the future of our industries  could  be

more secure and certain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what is the implication of this deficit in

respect  of  our  overall  balance  of  payments  and

foreign  exchange position? What is  most  perturbing

about  this deficit is that it has cropped up in  the

midst of the British withdrawal, which in itself will

have  considerable adverse effects on the balance  of

payments position.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to draw the attention of this House

to  the  proposed  tax measures  introduced  to  meet

increased  expenditure  on  our  defence  commitment.

Generally, the Government is treading very  skilfully

in  this  matter.  The proposed tax measures  on  the

seven  items  mentioned are expected to  raise  $35.8

million  in  a 15-month period. The burden  of  these

taxes, in aggregate, will not be really heavy on  the

economy  as  a  whole. This, however, has  been  made

possible  partly by the defence fund  campaign  which

has  raised nearly $10 million, a measure  which  the

Government was indeed farsighted enough to have taken

to forestall painful tax measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one item in these new tax

proposals which is not beyond criticism. The Minister

for  Finance's arithmetic on public utilities consump

tion  does  not  appear  to be  very  convincing.  It

appears  that  the Minister has conveniently  divided

the  different economic classes of Housing  and  Deve

lopment  Board flat dwellers according to the  amount

they pay in their monthly PUB, bills. If a couple  is

working  as teachers and their total salary is,  say.

$1,000. They stay in a Housing and Development  Board

fiat,  their P U.B, bill for two persons surely  will

not  be  more  than  the  bill  of  a  poorer  family

consisting  of  a  husband,  wife  and  eight   small

children.  The  imposition  of  a  tax  on  essential

services  really deserves a more realistic and  equit

able  criterion  to  back  it  up.  Surely  a  family

consisting  of  ten persons will use more  water  and

electricity than a couple.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Have

small families then!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> With the new PUB, rates, I can

foresee great hardships for large families with small

incomes. Likewise, I can see increased hardships  for

rural  folks engaged in subsistence farming, as  well

as   for  hawkers  and  small  business  proprietors.

Contrary to what the Minister has claimed, I am quite

convinced   that  the  new  P.U.B, rates   will   be

regressive and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



the lower income earners will be hit most.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, this is the second time in two years that

the  Government has decided to increase P.U.B, rates.

The  poorer  class of the economy is  definitely  not

going to react favourably to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of increasing public utility rates, I would

propose increased indirect taxes on the higher income

earners, such as the property-owning class. There is,

for  example, no reason why people living in mansions

and  bungalows should not be asked to  pay  a  little

more  on  the  assessment rates for  their  property.

Likewise,  increased  road tax  could  be  levied  on

bigger vehicles owned by the higher income group.  In

other  words,  it will be more fair and equitable  if

the  $11 million could be raised from taxes on luxury

items enjoyed by the higher income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not asking too

much from a socialist Government.



<br><br>3.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I rise in appreciation of the financial policy of the

Government for the financial year 1st January,  1969,

to  31st  March,  1970. The Budget presented  by  the Minister

for   Finance  seeks  to  find   practical solutions

to  seemingly insoluble problems  and  has done  so

with considerable success. The main problem of  finding

the  necessary funds for many  competing wants appears

to have been solved by the proposal  to

impose new forms of taxation in such a manner  as  to

be   reasonable  and  acceptable  to  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the increase in Government expenditure

is  shown to be caused by the need to provide for our

own national security and defence. As a result of the

proposed British withdrawal from Singapore by the end

of  1971, the Government has wisely made provision to

increase  the strength of our armed forces, that  is,

the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, to a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



level  which  is consistent with the  safety  of  our

Republic.  While no one who has the interest  of  the

Republic   at  heart  will  deny  the  necessity   of

incurring  the  heavy cost of our  own  security  and

defence, it is a source of constant anxiety and worry

that  new  taxes or increases in existing  taxes  may

have  to be imposed over the next few years in  order

to  shoulder the burden of military defence. It would

be  most helpful if the Minister for Finance can give

an   assurance  that  any  future  increase  in   the

expenditure  on the defence forces and  installations

during the coming years will be phased out in such  a

way  that it will be painless and fair to all. It  is

true that no one can foresee the future and that  one

cannot  give any assurance of the actual size of  our

defence  force  and installations in  the  future  by

reason  of the fact that new circumstances and events

may arise which cannot be foreseen now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main concern is that while defence is necessary

for  Singapore, the burden of paying for any increase

in   defence  expenditure  ultimately  falls  on  the

working men. The Government has decided to raise  the

necessary funds for our defence expenditure by  means

of  indirect taxation in such a manner as  to  ensure

that  the  taxes are paid by those who can afford  to

pay.  On the surface, its explanation appears  to  be

valid,  such as the graduated scale of tax on  P.U.B.

rates and the tax, for instance, on made-up garments.

The  Minister  is correct in saying  that  if  people

persist in buying goods of foreign origin when  their

equivalents are beng manufactured locally, it is only

fair  and reasonable that they should be made to  pay

for their choice.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appreciated that we require foreign investment

in  order  to be able to create sufficient employment

opportunities for our continuously increasing  labour

force. And to induce foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



investors to come here, we have to provide a  minimum

domestic  market  for  the  products  made   by   the

factories  in Singapore even if they are supposed  to

be   export-orientated.  In  this  respect,  I   must

acknowledge  that the Government has been  singularly

successful in wooing foreign industrialists to invest

their capital and know-how in our Republic. The  list

of  foreign operations which have or are intending to

set  up  factories in Singapore read like an  excerpt

from Who's Who of the industrial corporations of  the

world.  It  appears that the new Employment  Act  and

similar  legislation  have helped  to  conjure  up  a

congenial  climate for the industrial development  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the workers of Singapore have generally

reconciled themselves to the fact that the Employment

Act  and  other legislation seeking to  restrain  the

workers  from  demanding  higher  wages  and   better

working  conditions  are necessary  sacrifices  which

have to be tolerated in the interest of the Republic,

the  Government  should also make  it  clear  to  all

foreign investors not to take undue advantage of  the

situation.  Workers in Singapore are pragmatists  who

believe  in hard work. All that they ask of employers

is  fair  treatment and an equitable return  for  the

hard  work  they  render to their  employees.  It  is

surely  reasonable and equitable for workers  to  ask

for  decent  wages and an adequate bonus  when  their

employers make sizable profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we, the leaders of the N.T.U.C.,

however, shall always extend our fullest co-operation

and assistance to the Government and to the employers in

our  common effort to ensure our survival and  to maintain

our present prosperity during the next  few crucial  years.

We  appreciate  that  in  the  final

analysis  we have only ourselves to depend  upon  for

the  continuing political and economic  viability  of

the  Republic.  We  know  for  a  fact,  and  this  I

emphasise,  that the world does not owe us  a  living

and  that  if  we  want  to  continue  to  enjoy  the

privilege  of  living in a separate  and  independent

Republic, we have to pay dearly for that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



privilege by our own sweat and labour. But in the far-

sighted  and  logical  proposals  enunciated  by  the

Government  in the Budget, the Government  has  shown

that  it  can  provide the competent  and  determined

leadership to see us through all our difficulties  in

the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to place on record my sincere

appreciation  of how the Government has  taken  great

pains  to  ensure that the necessary  new  taxes  are

borne  by  those  who can afford  to  pay  them.  The

Minister  for  Finance has done an excellent  job  of

finding the necessary funds in an unobtrusive fashion

for  equally  necessary expenditure to  be  spent  on

defence.  But  while such new taxes are  intended  to

fall on those who can afford to pay them, I must  add

that in the end it is the common working men who have

to bear the new taxes. It is simply common sense that

faced  with the extra expenses that have to  be  met,

for  instance, because of the levy on P.U.B, charges,

the  employer  will simply raise the  prices  of  his

products to meet the extra cost, Thus, my only regret

is  that the Minister for Finance has not seen fit to

incorporate   into   his  Budget   complementary   or

supplementary legislation comparable to that  of  the

Employment  Act to restrain profiteers  from  passing

the burden of indirect taxation to the consumers, the

majority of whom must be the workers.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Sir,

I should like, first of all, to draw the attention of

the  House  to certain salient features in  the  1969

estimates of educational expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have noticed that for the first time in

the  history of the Republic's Budget, Education  has

dropped to second place behind Defence as the State's

biggest  spender.  This does not  mean  that  we  are

spending less on Education in order to spend more  on

Defence. It does show, however, that there are  other

and more urgent demands on the public purse than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



Education and the order of priorities has,  at  least

for the time being, changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1969 estimates of educational expenditure are

presented,  also for the first time, under  two  main

departments:   General   Education   Department   and

Technical  Education Department, each  with  its  own

P.E.,  O.C.A.R., O.C.S.E., and development estimates.

This reflects the importance which my Ministry places

on    technical    education,   and   the    separate

administrative  machinery which has been  created  to

implement the new policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary estimates for the Education Ministry

totals  $198.8 million for the next 15 months.  On  a

proportionate basis, this works out to  $159  million

for  12  months or a 4.8 per cent increase  over  the

1968  estimates.  Compared with previous  years,  the

1969  provision  represents  a  very  small  increase

indeed   -  for  example,  in  1965,  the  percentage

increase  was  13.8  per cent,  1966-19.7  per  cent,

1967-11  per  cent, and 1968 the percentage  increase

was 5.8 per cent. Much of the increase in 1969 is due

to  normal  increments in the personal emoluments  of

existing  posts.  Of the 362 new  posts  created  for

1969,  336 are for the Technical Education Department

and  only  26  for the General Education  Department.

This  again underscores the new emphasis on technical

and vocational education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, out of the total provision of $30.9

million   in  the  development  estimates   for   the

Education  Ministry  for  the  next  15  months,  $21

million,  or  slightly more than  two-thirds  of  the

total,  is  earmarked  for  the  Technical  Education

Department, leaving only $9.9 million for the General

Education   Department.   The   Technical   Education

Department  will have sufficient funds to  carry  out

major  development projects to provide the  necessary

facilities for the massive expansion of technical and

vocational education. On the General Education  side,

only  minor  provision is made for  replacements  and

extensions of existing schools. On an overall  basis,

there will still be enough places in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



primary  schools  for  a number  of  years  to  come,

although the population shift to new satellite  towns

and  major  housing estates has created shortages  in

certain  areas,  and  consequently  it  will  not  be

possible  for all Primary 1 pupils to be admitted  to

schools near their homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the estimates reflect the changes in educational

policy,  I  should like to take this  opportunity  to

outline  what  these  changes  are,  and  to  explain

briefly the rationale behind the changes:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The present vocational schools will be

abolished.  As from next year, those  who  are

not  successful in the Primary School  Leaving

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examination and who are 14 years of age and

above,   will  not  be  posted  to  vocational

schools.  However,  they  will  be  given  the

opportunity to apply for admission to  special

classes  which will be organised by the  Adult

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Board. These classes will provide

intensive   instruction   in   languages   and

training  in  certain basic skills  to  enable

them  to seek employment or further vocational

training  in the various new types of training

establishments   set  up  by   the   Technical

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Department. Pupils who are in

Vocational I this year will, however, continue

with Vocational II next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The secondary school system will be re-

structured so as to direct a much larger number of

pupils than at present to technical education. Begin

ning with Secondary I classes next year, a new common

curriculum will be introduced for all Secondary I and

II pupils in all types of schools and in all four

language streams. This new curriculum provides for

all boys and 50 per cent of the girls to take  a

combination of academic and technical  subjects,

including workshop practice. Domestic Science-will be

a compulsory sub



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



ject  for  all girls. However, for girls  who  are

also  taking technical subjects, Domestic  Science

will  not be an examination subject and a modified

syllabus will be followed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this, new curriculum

for  Secondary  I and II will  mean  that  the

streaming    of   students   into    academic,

technical, or commercial education will not be

undertaken until Secondary III. The objections

which   have  been  raised  hitherto   against

streaming  from Secondary I have thereby  been

removed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) After completion of Secondary II, students

will either proceed to Secondary III

and IV and then on to Pre-University as  at

present, or branch off to a variety

of new educational establishments to train as

craftsmen and technicians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) For students who branch off to technical

training after completing Secondary II,

four  industrial training centres  will  be

established to provide courses in

electrical,  building  and  metal  trades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These courses, varying in duration

between  six  months and  two  years,  will

concentrate on the acquisition of a

specialised  skill through practical  work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each course will lead to the award

of a Trade Certificate, and the acquisition

of a number of Trade Certificates

will  qualify  the  holder  for  the  craft

certificate awarded by the vocational

institutes.  Students  who  have  completed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary II can also compete for

direct entry into vocational institutes  of

which two more will be established

by 1970.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A National Technical Institute will also be

established  by 1970 to train industrial technicians.

It  will provide advanced craft courses for those who

have completed courses in vocational institutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes which I have just listed call for a

heavy  outlay in new plant and conversion of existing

facilities.  Four new vocational institutes  will  he

established,  two of them to function  in  their  new

premises  in  1969  and the other two  in  1970.  Six

vocational  schools will be paired with six  academic

schools   within  the  same  compound  with  improved

workshop   facilities  to  provide  for  a  technical

stream.  Three  other  vocational  schools  will   be

converted into industrial training centres to provide

a  variety  of short-term trade courses  and  another

industrial  training centre will  be  established  at

Telok  Blangah,  making four centres in  all.  Twenty

units  of  centralised workshops will be  created  to

provide  practical training for all the boys  and  50

per  cent  of  the girls in Secondary I and  II,  and

additional  machinery will be installed in  three  of

the  nine existing technical schools to convert  them

into  technical  high schools offering  courses  from

Secondary   III   to  Pre-U  classes.   Pending   the

construction of its own building, the nucleus of  the

proposed National Technical Institute will be  housed

temporarily in the Singapore Vocational Institute  in

1969 to provide courses in advanced mechanical engine

ering   practice  and  shipbuilding.  The   Singapore

Vocational Institute itself will be expanded with the

addition of a three-storey building to provide for an

enrolment  of  2,500  as compared  with  the  present

capacity of 2,000.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.59 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide the necessary teachers for the swing

towards  technical education, a massive training  and

retraining  scheme is already under  way.  In  August

this year, 371 general education teachers began their

36-week   part-time  re-training  to   become   craft

teachers   in  one  of  three  subjects:   Metalwork,

Woodwork and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



Basic   Electricity.  Another  batch  of  85  general

education teachers have been selected to undergo full-

time re-training conducted by the Economic Industrial

Development  Agency. At this point, I must  add  that

teachers  have responded admirably to the re-training

scheme.  The  training programme will move  into  top

gear  next  year with the expansion of the  technical

wing of the Teachers' Training College. This will  be

carried out with the assistance of the United Nations

Development Programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are no doubt aware that the Government has

emphasised  technical and vocational education  since

1960. These changes in technical education have  been

proposed   so  that  the  education  can  meet   more

effectively    the    manpower    needs    of     our

industrialisation programme. It is widely  recognised

that  the  present  predominantly  academic  type  of

education  has  produced  an  inadequate  number   of

skilled  workers  and technicians. The  shift  to  an

education  with  a  larger  technician  content   and

practical  training  will  cut  down  the  number  of

unemployable  secondary school-leavers  and  increase

the  inflow of skilled manpower to our rapidly expand

ing industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in other aspects of educational policy will

also be made. The emphasis on the improvement of  the

quality  of  education at all levels  will  continue.

Steps  have  been taken and will be taken to  improve

school   curricula,  textbooks,  teaching  aids   and

techniques,  teacher training and  further  training,

educational  testing,  health  education  and  extra-

curricular activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater stress will be laid on bilingualism in

schools.  Increasing use will be made of  the  second

language as the medium of instruction in certain  sub

jects. In 1966, Mathematics was taught in English  in

Government  Primary I Chinese-medium  classes  on  an

experimental   basis.   As  the   experiment   proved

successful,  it was extended to Primary  II  classes.

This  year,  English is used for teaching Mathematics

in  Government Chinese Primary I, II and III classes,

and in Malay and Tamil Primary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



I  classes. The same language is used this  year  for

teaching  Science  in Government  Chinese  Primary  I

classes  and  in  all Malay and  most  of  the  Tamil

Primary  I  classes.  The use  of  English  to  teach

Science and Mathematics in non-English medium schools

will thus be extended gradually to Primary VI and  it

is  expected  that the same gradual process  will  be

introduced  in  Government-aided  non-English  medium

schools beginning in 1970. On the other hand, a start

has  been made this year to use Chinese as the medium

of  instruction for civics in English-medium  primary

classes  for pupils whose second language is Chinese.

It  is  intended that the same arrangement will apply

to  History by 1970. As an added measure to  increase

language  proficiency,  oral  tests  in  the   second

language will be introduced next year in the  Primary

School Leaving Examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingualism must be emphasised in schools if we are

to  build  a  multi-racial society  with  a  national

identity. It should be obvious that a small community

of  two  million people cannot survive in four water-

tight  language compartments, with no common language

of communication. In the past, our efforts to promote

bilingualism   were   confined  to   increasing   the

allocation  of  time to the second  language  and  im

proving  teaching methods. It has become  clear  that

these  measures  by  themselves  are  not  enough  to

produce the desired results. This is because children

have  little  opportunity to use the second  language

outside  the periods allotted to it on the timetable.

By  using the second language as a medium of  instruc

tion, children would be exposed to that language  for

a   much  longer  period  and,  moreover,  would   be

compelled to speak it, write it and use it as a  tool

of  communication.  For those children  whose  second

language  is  English,  it is  logical  to  use  that

language   for  teaching  Mathematics,  Science   and

eventually technical subjects, since English has long

been  accepted as an international language in  these

fields. For the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



children whose second language is Chinese or Malay or

Tamil,  it  is  equally logical  to  use  the  second

language  for teaching subjects which have affinities

with their own language and culture, subjects such as

History and Civics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some doubts have been expressed in the press on the

wisdom  of  using the second language as a medium  of

instruction.  The critics fear that the teachers  who

are  called upon to teach Mathematics and Science  in

English   in  non-English  medium  schools  may   not

themselves  have  a  sufficiently  good  command   of

English.  I  should like to give the  assurance  that

everything  possible will be done  to  avoid  such  a

situation.  The  changes in the  language  medium  of

instruction  in certain subjects will be carried  out

in  gradual  stages.  As many English-medium  trained

teachers  as we can spare will be sent to non-English

medium  schools to teach Mathematics and Science.  In

addition,  intensive three-year  courses  in  English

with a scientific language bias will be organised for

those teachers who are currently teaching Mathematics

and  Science in the Chinese, Malay or Tamil  language

medium  to enable them to attain proficiency  in  the

English language for teaching these subjects. Another

nagging  fear is that the use of the second  language

as  a  medium of instruction might lead to a lowering

of  standards  in  the  first  language  and  in  the

subjects  taught  in  the second  language.  On  this

point,  surveys conducted by my Ministry  have  shown

that  there is no basis for such fears. For  example,

English  was  first used in 1966 to teach Mathematics

in   certain  Government  Chinese-medium  Primary   I

classes.  A  survey conducted at the end  of  a  year

revealed  that these children had gained  fluency  in

English  without  any  loss  in  their  standard   of

attainment in Mathematics and Chinese. Moreover,  the

use of the second language as a medium of instruction

is  introduced gradually, beginning with  Primary  I,

and  every  effort is made to ensure that  syllabuses

and textbooks are carefully graded and chosen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion has been made that a Regional Chinese

Language  Centre  should be set  up  similar  to  the

Regional  English  Language  Centre  established   in

Singapore  under the auspices of the Southeast  Asian

Ministers of Education Council. I welcome this sugges

tion as a means of further improving the teaching  of

Chinese  both  as  a first and as a second  language.

However,  I must point out that the Regional  English

Language  Centre  was  established  with  substantial

foreign  aid, amounting to 50 per cent of  the  total

capital  cost and recurrent cost for five  years.  If

similar  financial  assistance  is  available  for  a

Regional   Chinese  Language  Centre   from   private

sources, particularly from the large Chinese  dailies

and  publishers who have a vested interest in  seeing

more  readers of Chinese publications, I am sure that

the  Government will be only too willing to  consider

such a project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes pose a challenge to both teachers

and  pupils,  but it is a challenge that  has  to  be

taken up. Bilingualism in our schools must succeed if

we  are to build a cohesive yet tolerant society, and

technical  education must also succeed if we  are  to

keep  pace  with  the new status of Singapore  as  an

independent and forward-looking state moving  towards

rapid industrialisation and urbanisation. With the co-

operation of teachers, pupils and parents, succeed we

shall.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  although  defence  expenditure   has

increased  to  $337  million, our wise  Minister  for

Finance  has  been able to surmount this  problem  of

increased  expenditure  by  good  budgeting.  I  must

congratulate him on this. If I am not wrong, he  must

have  deliberated hard and long over the  preparation

of  the  Budget.  I  believe  those  people  who  are

rational  will undoubtedly welcome it in its  present

form.  In  my opinion, there are two aspects  to  the

Budget.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the increase in defence expenditure does not

seriously  affect social services and development  in

other  fields. We all know that in order to safeguard

our   independence  in  the  present  age,  we   must

modernise our defence system. Of course, we  have  to

spend large sums of money to achieve this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Budget Statement of the Minister for

Finance,  we learn that the defence build-up  of  our

country will proceed step by step so that we will not

have  to bear an unduly heavy burden. We are not like

many other countries which build up their defence  at

the  expense of social services and in the end  their

societies deteriorate and they cannot but come  under

military  rule. Our defence expenditure will  be  met

out   of   the   economic  growth  in  our   revenue.

Expenditure  in other fields, such as  education  and

social services, will have to be at a standstill.  At

the  same  time,  necessary funds  are  allocated  to

sectors  needing additional expenditure. This  course

is  very  judicious, so that we  can  make  at  least

normal  progress. Our per capita domestic expenditure

has  also increased from $1,682 in 1967 to $1,940  in

1968.  Our  gross  national  product  has  also  been

increasing every year as a result of the diligence of

our people and the stability and economic progress of

our  country. Our economic growth will be slowed down

if  our people do not work hard. We will then have to

choose between doing away with additional expenditure

on  defence  or  social  services  and  resorting  to

increased taxes. All this is not to our liking. If in

the  few years ahead when the British are withdrawing

we  can  face  the trials and overcome  the  economic

problems, our future will be bright.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is a general feeling that increased

taxation  is  not  something  which  all  the  people

welcome.   Nevertheless,  the  seven  new  items   of

taxation  to be imposed next year are mild. They  are

taxes  which  the people can afford.  I  believe  the

decision to impose these seven types of taxation  has

been  arrived at after very exhaustive deliberations.

The   taxation  is  based  on  democratic   socialist

principles. The aim is to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



those  who are most able to bear the burden pay  more

towards  the national expenditure. This new  taxation

will  bring in about $35 million, which is only about

one-tenth  of  our  total defence  expenditure.  This

additional  amount  of  revenue  is  not  merely   to

maintain our military requirements. After taking away

$40.7  million, there is a deficit of  $11.7  million

which  will  be  met from the reserve fund.  The  new

taxation  will  not affect incentives for  investment

which  are  now being given to industry.  This  is  a

judicious policy; otherwise investors will fight  shy

of  coming  here  and,  as a result,  there  will  be

difficulties in our industrialisation efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the revenue and expenditure for

next  year, there will be a deficit of $11.7 million.

If  I  am not mistaken, this is the first time, since

the Government came to power, that the deficit is  of

such  a size. If there has not been too wide a  range

of  new taxation, it is because the Government do not

want  the  people  to bear too much  of  the  burden.

According to the Finance Minister, in the first  nine

months  of this year, trade figures show that imports

reached a figure of $3,840 million and exports $2,880

million. There is therefore a trade deficit  of  $960

million. There are many items of international income

derived  from  shipping,  insurance,  tourism,   etc.

Although no exact calculations have been made,  these

items  are  estimated  to reach about  $600  million.

Subtract  this sum from the trade deficit,  there  is

still  a  deficit of $360 million. If this  condition

were to continue year after year, I would like to ask

the  Finance Minister whether this would  affect  our

foreign exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to talk about the problems of

industrialisation.    It    is    undeniable     that

industrialisation has been going on at  a  tremendous

pace.  At the moment, we have 174 factories employing

18,000  workers. In addition, the Government has  set

up  three institutions, namely, the Development Bank.

the  Jurong  Town  Corporation and INTRACO,  to  help

develop  our  commerce and industry.  I  believe  our

indus-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



trialisation  has  a  bright future.  The  centre  of

industrialisation is now at Jurong. Seven  years  ago

Jurong was a barren land. But now 3,600 acres of land

have  been  developed.  About 137  factories  are  in

production, employing 14,000 workers. However, as the

Minister  for Finance has pointed out in  his  Budget

Statement,  there is an urgent need  to  improve  the

social amenities of Jurong Town. This is true. At the

moment,  there are no social amenities and facilities

for  recreation which one would expect  in  a  normal

town.  There  are  not  enough  housing  and  medical

facilities  for  the workers there.  They  should  be

provided   with   sufficient  social   and   cultural

facilities.  Their needs in these  fields  should  be

satisfied. House occupancy is said to be 99 per cent.

Some  of  the  houses there are occupied by  military

personnel  at  Taman Jurong and other personnel  from

abroad together with their families. There is a  lack

of  good transport. Although most of the -'workers in

Jurong Town are now staying there, their families are

still  staying in urban areas because of the lack  of

social  amenities  and  transport  in  Jurong   Town.

Workers have no intention to settle down there. I  do

not  know  whether  the industrialisation  policy  is

being properly implemented. Otherwise how could these

considerations have been overlooked? Or  could  there

have  been  some  other reasons why the  workers  and

their  families  have not been provided  with  social

amenities?   It   is   only   recently   that   these

shortcomings have been discovered by the authorities.

It  is  only now that the Jurong Town Corporation  is

thinking of providing these social amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that the Corporation is trying its best

to  develop  Jurong  into a tourist  centre.  In  the

vicinity   of  the  Jurong  River,  there   will   be

"artificial  islands". There will be a floating  rest

aurant,  an  aviary  for birds and  an  18-hole  golf

course,  etc. Of course, it would be a good thing  if

Jurong could be developed into a tourist centre.  But

I  do  not think the ordinary workers there have  the

time  and  leisure to play golf, to see the birds  in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



aviary, or to go to the floating restaurants and bars

to  enjoy themselves. I hope the Minister for Finance

will  seriously  consider the question  of  providing

practical    social   amenities   and    recreational

facilities for the workers so that they can  actually

enjoy  themselves. At the moment,  what  the  workers

need  is a place where they can rest or take part  in

recreational activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a community centre in Jurong Town,

it  was  not built according to plan. It  is  only  a

centre   made  by  merging  several  flats  together.

Moreover,  it is quite far away from the majority  of

residences of the workers. It does not meet the needs

of the population there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Minister for Finance

that a "Workers' Cultural Centre" should be set up in

the  most populous part of Jurong Town. Here they can

take  part in various activities which would  benefit

both  their  minds  and  their  bodies.  We  hope   a

gymnasium  with facilities for games and sports  will

be  provided.  We hope, too, that reading  rooms  and

rooms  for  recreational activities will be available

at this cultural centre. We can ask the trade unions,

the   employers'  association  and  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation to help in the management of this centre.

We  can  also ask the People's Association for  their

assistance in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about some of the other

problems   relating  to  Jurong  Town.   First,   the

increased  rent of factory sites in Jurong  Town.  In

the   beginning,  when  the  Government   wanted   to

encourage  the  setting up of  factories  there,  the

rental  was low. It was six to nine cents per  square

foot  per year. With the prospect of a common  market

with  'Malaysia,  many  industrialists  invested   in

Jurong.  There  are at the moment  137  factories  in

production.   This   achievement,   of   course,   is

attributable   to   the  efforts,  co-operation   and

contributions  of the Government, the  employers  and

the  workers. Sir, I have learnt that the authorities

concerned  have tried to increase the rental  of  the

land by as high as 50 per cent. I feel that we should

discuss these matters frankly and face



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



the  realities  of  the situation.  At  present,  the

factories in Jurong appear to be doing quite well and

they   may   be  getting  good  returns   for   their

investments.  But  there are many pioneer  industries

which  are unable to make any profit this year  owing

to  lack of markets. Therefore, to increase the  rent

of  factory sites is generally not a wise move.  This

is  an  additional burden on the factories which  are

not  making  money,  and may be a factor  leading  to

their  closure.  I  feel that  the  attitude  of  the

authorities in encouraging industries should be  more

realistic.   We   should  not  ask  the   established

factories  to give up their vacant land in  order  to

induce more investments and establishment of new  fac

tories. We should help the manufacturers in Jurong to

solve  their  problems and help them develop.  In  my

view,  the  Government should give  consideration  to

individual  cases in respect of rent  increases.  The

Government should not increase the rents of those who

are  just  able  to  make ends  meet.  If  Government

intends  to increase the rent, a decision  should  be

postponed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point which I wish to cover in my speech is

fire prevention. I do not know whether the Government

intends  to  set  up  a fire station  on  the  Jurong

industrial  site.  There is none in existence  there.

The  two nearest fire stations are in Queenstown  and

Bukit  Timah, at least seven miles away  from  Jurong

Town.  If  there  is a fire at the Jurong  industrial

estate,  by  the  time the fire engines  arrive,  the

factories  will  have been burnt  down.  I  hope  the

Minister for Finance will take note of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point concerns industrial waste. This

is   a  problem  confronting  our  industrialists  in

Jurong. No doubt there is a dumping ground at Lim Chu

Kang.  It  is  convenient for  large  factories  with

plenty  of industrial waste to hire lorries and  dump

the  industrial waste at Lim Chu Kang.  But  for  the

small  factories  with a small amount  of  industrial

waste,  it is uneconomical for them to hire  lorries.

If  they  are to combine their resources, it is  also

quite inconvenient because of the varying amounts  of

industrial waste produced by these small



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



factories,  and  also  because of  the  time  factor.

Therefore,  I hope the Ministry of Health  will  send

more  rubbish  trucks  to Jurong  to  take  away  the

industrial waste from the light industries section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the supply of water for industrial estates is

of great importance.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, Standing Orders require you to

confine   yourself  to  the  general  principles   of

'Government policy and administration as set forth by

the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement.  It

appears  you  are going into matters  of  detail.  As

there are many other Members who wish to speak on the

Finance  Minister's Budget Statement, please  confine

yourself to the general principles and omit reference

to the details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am coming to

the end of my speech. According to estimates, the con

sumption of water by the various industries is  5,000

million  gallons a year. I understand that  sometimes

the  supply of water is interrupted, as a  result  of

which there is great inconvenience and production  in

the  factories is interrupted. If the supply of water

is  to be interrupted because new pipelines are being

laid  or  for  any other reason, I ask that  adequate

notice be given to manufacturers in order to minimise

inconvenience to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sum up, Jurong Town at the present moment is

in  reasonably  good shape. It is  becoming  a  self-

sustaining ,town. But the Government should pay  more

attention  to it. Otherwise we will not  be  able  to

attain our objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement of the Minister

for Finance.



<br><br>4.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

a  few  months  ago the Minister for Finance  gave  a

warning that the Budget for next year would no longer

be a painless one. When the warning was given, people

from all walks of life were uneasy and anxious.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only were there fluctuations on the Stock

Exchange, but there were also many rumours that taxes

would  be increased. Some said that the licence  fees

for  radio  and  television would be increased  by  a

hundred  per  cent. Others said that driving  licence

fees  would be increased two-fold and that duties  on

petroleum, tobacco and liquor, and road tax would  be

increased. Even the duty on daily necessities such as

soap, toothpaste



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, I think it will assist in

the debate if you speak on the Finance Minister's tax

proposals  rather than on the rumours that circulated

before his Budget Statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, that will be

the  main  theme of my speech. But such rumours  were

very  widespread. However, on the 3rd of this  month,

the  mystery surrounding such rumours was lifted, for

on  that day the Minister for Finance announced seven

tax proposals. They include a tax on P.U.B, bills,  a

small  duty  on  liquid  petroleum  gas,  a  tax   on

telephone bills and a tax on made-up garments.  There

will  also  be changes in three old taxes, namely,  a

new  basis  to  value a motor vehicle  on  which  the

additional  registration fee is levied; the  revision

of  stamp  duties; and the levy of a fee of  two  per

cent  for  motor vehicles on transfer  of  ownership.

These  tax  proposals are mild in nature.  They  have

been  able to usher in a Merry Christmas and a  Happy

New  Year to our people. For these measures, we thank

the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Budget Statement was well received by people

from  all walks of life. Although defence expenditure

will  reach  the  enormous sum of $337  million,  the

revenue from new taxes will be $35 million, about  10

per  cent  of defence expenditure. That  is  why  the

people praise the Government for its intelligent  and

prudent tax proposals. These new taxes are quite fair

and   in   accord  with  the  tenets  of   democratic

socialism.  For  example, the 10  per  cent  levy  on

P.U.B, bills will not affect the lower income group.

Under this tax proposal, those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



whose  bills  fall between $10 and $20 a  month  will

have  to pay five per cent. Those whose bills  exceed

$20  will  have to pay the full rate of 10 per  cent.

Those  whose bills are under $10 are not affected  at

all. There are about 58,000 consumers whose bills  do

not  exceed  $10, which is 25 per cent of the  total.

The  number of consumers whose bills fall between $10

and $20 is 73,000, which is 32 per cent of the total.

They  will  pay about $1 a month in tax.  Forty-three

per  cent are consumers whose bills exceed $20;  they

are  well-to-do. They have radio and television sets,

refrigerators and other modern appliances. Therefore,

it  is  not  unreasonable to ask them  to  make  some

contribution to our defence expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the tax on telephone bills, the poor

people will not be affected. Only wealthy people  can

afford   to  install  telephones  in  their   houses.

Therefore, it is not unreasonable to ask them to  pay

$27  additional tax a year. As for users of  business

telephones,  it is within their means to  pay  $37.50

per line per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is questionable whether a tax should be levied on

imported  made-up  garments, because  most  of  these

imported  garments  are bought by  the  lower  income

group.  They  are not only cheaper than the  locally-

manufactured  garments, but they  are  also  of  good

quality. As they are cheap, they should not be taxed.

As  the  Government has levied a 15 per  cent  import

duty   on   made-up  garments,  their   prices   have

increased,  and this is an added burden on  the  poor

people.  Although the Minister has said that  we  are

manufacturing enough for local consumption, from  the

consumers' point of view, however, they prefer to buy

clothing  which is not only cheap but  also  of  good

quality.  There  are two reasons why  these  imported

goods  are  welcomed by the consumers. Firstly,  they

are cheap and, secondly, they are of good quality and

durable.  Therefore, if we want  our  people  to  use

locally-manufactured  goods, our  manufacturers  must

raise  the  standard of their goods and their  prices

should not be higher than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



those  of the imported goods. Only then can  we  make

locally-manufactured   goods   attractive   to    our

consumers.  To impose taxes on imported garments  is,

therefore,  not  wise since the Minister  can  obtain

revenue  from other sources, such as increased  taxes

on  expensive  liquor,  cosmetics  and  other  luxury

goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which I do not understand.

Why  does  the Minister not impose taxes on  garments

made of fur? In my opinion, these garments should  be

taxed  because it is only the wealthy people who  can

afford  to buy them, and it is right that they should

make some contribution to our defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is gratifying to note that

notwithstanding the substantial increase  in  defence

expenditure, no cut has been made in the  expenditure

on  rural development for which the sum of $2,215,000

has  been  allocated.  This  shows  the  Government's

concern for the welfare of the rural people. This  is

in keeping with our Party's objective of establishing

a  more  just  and equal society and it is  therefore

praiseworthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to deal with is our economic

growth.  I  will  quote  some figures  given  by  the

Minister  for  Finance.  He said  that  our  economic

growth is still in good shape. For example, in  terms

of  total investment, we have $606 million, which  is

an  increase of 17 per cent. In the first nine months

of  this  year  the  total trade  figure  was  $6,720

million,  representing an increase of 14.5 per  cent.

In  the first six months of this year there were  174

pioneer firms in production, an increase of 47  firms

over  last year. We have a total fixed investment  of

$436  million, an increase of 19 per  cent,  and  in

terms  of  total industrial production we  have  $472

million,  which is an increase of64 per  cent.  These

pioneer industries employ 18,780 workers, an increase

of  5,380  over last year. At the same time,  56  new

factories are being constructed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that Singapore is rapidly becoming an

important industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



country in this region. It is also noteworthy that we

have  an  even  more  rapid expansion  in  our  ship-

building industry. This new industry not only earns a

great  deal of foreign exchange for our country,  but

also  provides many employment opportunities for  our

people. We have already converted the Sembawang Naval

ease  into  a shipbuilding yard capable of  absorbing

over  3.000  ex-civilian employees from  the  British

establishment. This is a clear indication of the Will

and  capacity  of the Government. As the  Member  for

Sembawang,  I wish to congratulate the Government  on

its  success in converting the Naval Base to civilian

use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the defence expenditure for next

year  comes to $337.5 million, which is more than  33

per  cent of our total expenditure of about $1,024.89

million.  In  spite  of  this,  there  has  been   no

substantial increase in the taxes, and for  this,  we

must  pay  a tribute to our Minister for Finance.  In

fact, we need only have about $117.3 million in  cash

to  pay  for all this expenditure. The sum of  $156.3

million for the purchase of military equipment is  on

credit  terms and we can also obtain a sum  of  $63.9

million  from the United Kingdom Defence  Aid  funds.

But  I  would  like to ask the Minister  for  Finance

about  the �50 million of aid promised by the British

Government. I hope the Minister can give more details

on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is a newly independent country, it is

necessary  for  us  to establish a  suitable  defence

system, because without it there will be no security.

What  is the reaction of our people to this important

problem?  In  my view, the people have already  shown

that they understand the significance of defence  and

have   given  the  Government  positive  support   by

responding to the call for National Service  and  the

National  Defence Fund. Therefore, if anybody  should

say  that it is a wrong policy to establish  our  own

defence,  then  they  are, in my view,  either  short

sighted or have some axe to grind. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



should not endorse this pessimistic capitulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from next year, great emphasis will be placed

on technical and vocational education. This will mean

a great reform in our educational system. This reform

is undoubtedly necessary because only then will we be

able to meet the increasing demand for technical  per

sonnel   in   industrial  expansion.  Although   some

restrictions have been imposed on the expenditure for

health  and social services, we have enough resources

to look after the welfare of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in short, the Budget can be described as

rational  and fine. It is based on sound  principles,

and  also  at  a time when our country is  undergoing

changes,  it  does  not increase the  burden  of  the

people.  At  the  same time, it has  also  created  a

better  atmosphere  for  economic  expansion  and  to

attract  foreign  investment. Our people  have  every

reason to expect that 1969 will be a better year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Budget of the Government.



<br><br>4.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when independence

came   to   us   three  years  ago,   our   immediate

preoccupation at that time was to find ways and means

by  which  to promote economic growth, as if  out  of

nothing.  Today,  looking back, we can  take  comfort

from,  and have a sense of pride in, the achievements

of  these eventful years. What economic progress  has

been  attained is undoubtedly the result of effective

organisation, realistic planning and  a  disciplined

approach to our numerous problems. Compliment must of

course   be   paid   to  the  untiring   efforts   of

industrialisation and it is on industrialisation  and

also trade which the hon. Member for Sembawang has, I

think,  given  me justification to make this  general

comment  on  policy in relation to  foreign  affairs.

Because  without industrialisation and  trade,  there

will  not  be  marketing, and without marketing  with

foreign countries there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



will  be  no  trade representatives.  I  think  trade

representatives  have  to  go  along  with  political

representatives in the way of High Commissioners  and

Ambassadors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must not overlook the

fact  that  another element which has  made  all  the

achievements possible is our adherence to a realistic

policy  -  one  which  seeks the  maximum  number  of

friends  on the basis of equality and mutual respect,

non-alignment  in bloc rivalries and  the  desire  to

trade   with  all  countries  irrespective  of  their

political ideology or their systems of government, so

long  as such trade is to the mutual benefit of these

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This realistic approach to problems of international

relations  has  indeed  paid dividends.  For  looking

around  us, the results of these policies  should  be

evident to all of us. We have in Singapore diplomatic

missions,  consular offices and trade representations

from  different countries in the world, many of  whom

adhere   to   diverse  policies  and  take  different

postures  on international issues. I would  say  even

belonging  to different blocs. But what is  important

is  the  fact that we would not have counted so  many

diverse  friends to our credit, if not for  the  fact

that  the  permanent premises on  which  our  foreign

policy  is 'based is something on which others cannot

find  fault with us. Foreign policies may change  but

the premises on which these policies are founded must

always  remain unaltered. Our basic principles  of  a

non-communist,  democratic,  socialist   state   will

forever remain unchanged. That I am confident will be

the  case with us now and in the future. For who  can

blame  us  for  these  premises? Our  fundamental  ob

jective is to enhance the prosperity and the security

of  Singapore.  We are simply for Singapore.  We  are

anti nobody, just pro-Singapore. For this is the case

in  fact with every country in the world, and I would

say this is the right of every nation to pursue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other, which is the philosophy of our foreign

policy, is how we should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



see the world around us and interpret the changes and

instability outside our frontiers. For is it  not  in

the light of these changes that any country will have

to  make whatever adjustments that are called for  in

their  foreign  policy and enhance its  security  and

prosperity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore be flexible in our policies

towards  other  governments  and  states.  We  cannot

afford  to  be one-track minded. Indeed  we  have  to

adopt  a  policy of open-mindedness in our  relations

with  other governments and states. At the same time,

we  have to be firm, consistent and rational  in  our

postures.  As a government and people we  cannot  and

should never allow emotions to get the better of  us,

because  this can only lead to irrational, insensible

action.  Governments and states we  have  learnt  are

primarily  motivated by self-interest, and  there  is

nothing unusual or extraordinary about this.  At  the

same  time, we also know that this motivating  factor

of  self-interest is not inconsistent  with  friendly

external  relations with others. This is  the  reason

why   difficulties  between  governments  and  states

encountered one day are more often than not  resolved

and  overcome  the next. International  relations  or

intercourse  between  states is not  something  which

started with the League of Nations or with the United

Nations  or  with the present-day regional  groupings

and   alliances.  They  started  ever   since   human

communities made contact with one another  from  time

immemorial.  The only difference is that since  human

societies  became more complex, the social,  economic

and  political  problems  which  arose  with  greater

sophistication    needed    equally     sophisticated

solutions.  And international relations is  merely  a

manifestation  of  the external  complexities  within

states  and between them. So to be inflexible in  our

attitudes towards other states and governments is  to

be  like  the proverbial ostrich and reflects  immatu

rity. No problem is beyond solution; no difficulty is

too great. We must never be overawed by international

problems, however insoluble and great they may appear

to be at the start. Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



believes  in having a warm heart and a cool  head  in

its relations with other nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Southeast Asia, of which we are an

integral  part,  is  in a state of turbulence.  There

have been troubles and anxieties for the past 20  odd years,

since the end of the last World War.  A  look into  recent

history should confirm  that  wars  and revolutions,

racial   conflicts    and    economic

disintegration, communism and colonialism,  all  have

plagued us in Southeast Asia. Be that as it may,  the

question  that  arises is how we in Singapore  should

perceive  this  turbulent world around  us  and  take

intelligent  steps  in our own interest  to  overcome

these  problems.  In the history of nations,  such  a

crisis  is not new. The same could also be  said  for

Southeast  Asia.  But like all  others,  we  in  this

region must benefit from the lessons of history,  for

the  fact  that emerges from history is that  mankind

has  seen  such  turbulence and crises  in  different

ways.  Some  see  in them nothing  but  danger.  They

accept  them as inevitable and succumb to  the  gloom

and  hopelessness which such a mood generates. Others

have  seen  in  such turmoil challenges  as  well  as

opportunities and it has not been uncommon  for  some

to face these challenges and successfully tackle them

with resoluteness and self-confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has seen many crises in the past and,

going  by  past experience, I am confident  that  the

people  of Singapore will also rise to new challenges

if  and  when  they arise. During confrontation  many

people  thought that this thing called  confrontation

was  insoluble. Many threw up their hands in despair.

Many  secretly  and  privately  thought  Sukarno  was

right. Yet our patience and, of course, circumstances

proved that it could not and did not last. I am  sure

that   in  the  coming  years  they  will  see  these

challenges more as an opportunity to put things right

in the interest of Singapore, rather than give way to

gloom and despair. It is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



therefore, inevitable that we in Singapore  must  not

only   appreciate  the  challenges  ahead  but   must

understand the nature of the problems that  face  us,

if  we  are  to take measures which are necessary  to

insulate  ourselves  against  the  problems  well  in

advance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is precisely what the Budget, which has been

presented by the Minister for Finance for the  coming

15  months,  seeks to do. As a realistic  people  who

support  realistic policies, which  are  intended  to

serve  their best interest, I am confident  that  the

people  of Singapore will rally to the call, as  they

have  always done in the past. For they know that  we

are  a  tightly  packed society in an island  of  two

million  people,  with no natural resources  and  not

even  an  adequate  supply of water.  The  people  of

Singapore  know  that the Government has  always  pro

moted  realistic  solutions to their  problems.  They

know that since the P.A.P, came to power in 1959,  we

have  consistently followed our major goal of  giving

our  people  all the opportunities to  develop  their

human  potentialities and to give them a better life.

They   are   conscious  that  we  have   consistently

maintained  these  policies and I am  confident  that

they  will  perceive the objectives which  -  as  the

Minister for Finance has outlined in the presentation

of  this  Budget  - aim not only at  furthering  this

major  goal  but  also seek to ensure  that  what  we

achieve is always available to them and to succeeding

generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, people in all walks of life are

conscious  that  a new element has  loomed  over  our

horizon.  They realise that the British  decision  to

withdraw in 1971 and not in the mid-1970s has made it

imperative  that  we  seek  alternative  measures  to

secure our independence. What this means is that with

British  withdrawal, we also have to  make  ourselves

self-reliant in matters of defence and this has to be

done  not  within  eight to  ten  years,  as  we  had

originally  envisaged, but within  three  years  from

now.  Judging by the enthusiastic support  which  our

people have hitherto given us in respect of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



challenges posed by other problems, I feel confident

that  Singapore should be able to be reasonably self-

reliant  in  matters  of defence,  with  the  assured

support of its people for the measures that have been

proposed. Of course, the objectives have been clearly

outlined  by the Minister for Finance in  the  presen

tation  of  the  Budget and it should be  obvious  to

everyone  what we mean when we say that we intend  to

be self-reliant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact of international life that small

countries  have always had to live in the shadows  of

bigger  ones.  In recent years, there was  reason  to

hope that the shadows which big nations cast over the

smaller   nations   would  grow  shorter   and   less

threatening. There were indeed encouraging  signs  at

one  time  when  big  nations joined  others  in  the

establishment  and recognition of  ethical  norms  in

international relations. It is loudly proclaimed that

adherence to the principles of sovereign equality  of

all   states;   that  respect  for  the   territorial

integrity  of other states; that non-interference  in

the  internal affairs of other states; and  that  the

renunciation  of the use or threat of  force  in  the

settlement  of  disputes  between  states   are   the

foundations on which relations between countries  are

to  be conducted. It is even said often that the  old

doctrine  of  spheres  of interests,  or  spheres  of

influence, in which a dominant power could dictate to

the state living in its shadows, is clearly repugnant

to  universally accepted principles of  international

conduct.  But  the sad fact of international  conduct

today  suggests  that what may be an  ideal  may  not

necessarily be a fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not dispute the fact that the ultimate

security for small countries like us depends less  on

wasteful  expenditure  on  armaments  and   more   on

building  and strengthening the international  forces

of  peace.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we  in  Singapore  are

convinced that only the strengthening of the  climate

for   peaceful  relations  and  greater  co-operation

between  nations, both big and small, can  help  save

arms expenditure and enable us small countries to use

the  money to combat poverty, ignorance and  disease,

which are our real enemies and whose defeat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



is both rational and worth while. But if we are to go

by  what is going on around us, notwithstanding these

ideals,  I am afraid we cannot help but believe  that

every  dollar  spent on arms, though wasteful,  is  a

necessary  expenditure  under the  circumstances,  at

least until we have satisfied ourselves that we  have

attained  that  measure of self-reliance  in  defence

which  is  necessary for us small  countries,  or  at

least until the forces of internal peace can come  to

our aid. Until such time as nations can achieve these

goals  and  view  relations with  one  another  in  a

realistic   fashion,  I  am  afraid  we   cannot   be

complacent  about  such  questions  and  ignore   our

responsibility  to become self-reliant  for  our  own

security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world of interdependence, our objectives of

a  better life for our people can be achieved in many

ways. We recognise that not least among them is by co-

operating  with  other countries, particularly  those

around  us and closest to us as well as others  which

are more advanced than we are. This is the kind of co-

operation  which,  in  our  view,  will  be   further

enhanced  only  if  conflicts  between  nations,  and

particularly  the bigger nations, are brought  to  an

end. It is increasingly dawning on the minds of world

leaders  that  we  can no longer  seek  solutions  to

international problems in terms of past memories  but

should realistically look for these solutions in  the

present  circumstances and with future objectives  in

mind.  In  other words, we must not go  back  to  the

glories of the past, imaginary or otherwise. We  must

look  to the present and to the future with optimism.

We  must  bury  the dead past. That is why  Singapore

looks hopefully for an end to irrelevant conflicts in

this region and other regions, which for the last two

decades have distorted relations not only amongst  us

in Southeast Asia, but also amongst countries outside

Southeast  Asia.  Our salvation  lies  in  us  -  the

countries of Southeast Asia - cooperating and pooling

our resources in order to progress and advance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided to join and support the Association

of Southeast Asian Nations - ASEAN. We have not done



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



this  for nothing. We are in ASEAN because we believe

that  the  pursuit of regionalism is in the interests

of all of us in Southeast Asia. We have absolutely no

illusions about regionalism and even though ASEAN  is

presently  having some difficulty, we  are  convinced

that  this  is  but a temporary phase and  one  which

other   successful   regional   organisations    have

experienced in their early years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is even the case with the United Nations, and

although  one hears frequent criticism of the  United

Nations  and  its  role in world affairs,  its  short

comings  and  failures; though one hears  the  United

Nations  described  as  a big talk-shop;  though  one

knows that the United Nations has not been able to do

much  in  areas  of  conflict like the  Middle  East;

though one knows that the wasteful war in Vietnam has

been  what it has been for several years in the  past

because the United Nations has been helpless; yet the

fact remains that no member organisation, whether big

or  small,  in  the United Nations has been  able  to

convince its members that the best course is to scrap

it.  All  members of the United Nations believe  that

the organisation should continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So rather than concern ourselves with trivial and

transient  issues,  it is important  that  we  should

pursue  the  more formidable and long-term challenges

which  ASEAN has been established to face and  solve.

Whatever  others may say, Singapore is determined  to

see  that regardless of the minor difficulties  ASEAN

must   continue.  Whatever  the  differences,  recent

tensions  in the world have proved that it is  always

better   to  go  on  talking  on  problems,   however

insoluble  they may appear, rather than pretend  that

they  do  not exist. There is a saying in Malay,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that however annoyed one  is  by  the

nuisance  created by the mosquito buzzing near  one's

ears, one should never seek a solution by burning the

mosquito net.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other aspect of regionalism and

interdependence upon which I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



wish  to touch. We in Southeast Asia can be described

as  developing nations. We are at varying degrees  of

under-development. Co-operation between  economically

weak  and  politically unstable situations, with  all

the best of intentions and mutual goodwill, cannot, I

am  afraid,  ensure rapid growth and development.  To

achieve  this,  we  must also  co-operate  with  more

advanced  friends in other parts of the  world  in  a

joint enterprise or in several joint enterprises  for

our  common prosperity and advancement. But our  more

advanced  friends are not going to be  encouraged  to

help  us if we cannot co-operate and make regionalism

work   successfully.  They  are  not  going   to   be

encouraged  to help us if we quarrel among  ourselves

over small issues. They will naturally ask how we are

to work together on bigger and more important matters

if we cannot solve and settle minor problems. This is

the  problem  faced by members of regional  groupings

and  alliances  which, for some  reason  or  another,

cannot  get  along  with one  another.  This  is  the

question which they should pose themselves and try to

answer   honestly.  However,  this  alone   will   be

insufficient, for co-operation among ourselves  alone

will  not  make for speedy advances towards modernisa

tion.  On  the  other hand, they  will  be  slow  and

difficult, for the simple reason is that co-operation

among poorer countries is not always the best way  of

growing  rich materially and spiritually in  a  short

space  of  time.  We  believe  that  co-operation  in

Southeast Asia must, therefore, involve not only asso

ciation  among ourselves but that these  associations

must  be  complemented with association with friends,

rich  as  well  as the not so rich in  the  world.  I

think, if the big powers realise that they have  more

to gain by co-operating both with themselves and with

others to help less advanced countries, the less  the

occasion for big power conflict and rivalries and the

ever present danger of major conflict in our area. To

that extent, Singapore will support any move for  co-

operation among ourselves in Southeast Asia, and  any

approaches which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



show a sincere and practical desire by the big powers

to  assist in the genuine development in the  region,

instead  of  drawing small countries into  big  power

conflicts, will be welcomed and supported by  us  and

other small countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite often mentioned by us and by others

that small nations do not have the power to influence

events  in the world. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is  very

true.  This is so true that only a few months ago  we

have   seen  how  a  relatively  small  country  like

Czechoslovakia was subjected to intrusions by a  very

much  more  powerful country. But  the  question  is,

collectively  small countries can,  given  the  right

circumstances,  given the right leadership  and  with

good  intentions,  assert their  moral  influence  in

influencing  world events. To that extent,  Singapore

will  co-operate  in pursuit of its  policy  of  non-

alignment in influencing world events, not by  itself

alone but in conjunction with other countries in  the

world which pursue policies which are not detrimental

to the interests of others and which certainly do not

interfere  in the internal affairs of small countries

like Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister for Finance promised a not painless  Budget.

However,  as  it turned out, he has, with  his  usual

accomplished skill and financial wizardry,  framed  a

Budget that raises the necessary money in such a fair

and equitable way that there could be only praise for

him. When a taxpayer pays willingly and congratulates

the Finance Minister in the process,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



you  can be sure that the congratulations are genuine

and  that the tax is fair and equitable. In fact, the

showers of praise and the congratulations are causing

embarrassment  to my Minister. At close  quarters,  I

see  that  he  is suitably embarrassed. I  shall  not

embarrass him any further, but shall reply to some of

the  points raised by the Members who have spoken  so

far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Telok Blangah, Bras Basah and Bukit

Ho Swee raised the question of the 15 per cent tax on

imported  made-up  garments. The  Members  for  Telok

Blangah  and  Bras Basah complained of the  tax.  The

Member  for  Bukit Ho Swee, on the other  hand,  said

that  the tax was equitable. I think both the Members

for  Bras Basah and Telok Blangah want to have  their

cake and eat it too. On the one hand, they complained

that the tax will be a burden on the workers. On  the

other hand, they said that we must create more employ

ment  for our workers. I would have thought that  the

Members  for Telok Blangah and Bras Basah  should  be

the  last  persons to complain of the tax  which,  in

fact, helps the local garment industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Point of clarification, Mr

Speaker, Sir,I am sure I did not complain of the  15

per cent tax on imported made-up garments. In fact, I

agreed with the Government. What I complained  of  is

the 10 per cent levy on P.U.B, bills.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am glad the Member for Bras

Basah  is  not  complaining of the tax. Therefore,  I

need only confine myself to answering the Member  for

Telok  Blangah. As I was saying, this tax,  in  fact,

helps our local garment industry. As we all know, the

garment  industry is employment intensive. It employs

a  lot  of workers. The fact that this tax helps  the

garment  industry is borne out by the fact  that  the

President  of the Garment Manufacturers'  Association

welcomes the tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah, however, says that

foreign  garments are superior in quality.  I  wonder

how he gets this impression. Sir, as you know,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



our  garments  compete very effectively with  foreign

products, especially in the United States of  America

and  in  the United Kingdom markets, so much so  that

these  two  governments have to put a restriction  on

the entry of our products into their markets.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Point of clarification, Sir,I

just  want  to  find  out whether  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  is wearing imported underwear or  locally-

made underwear.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member must avoid personal

questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I am wearing locally-made

garments. My shirt, socks and under-garments are  all

locally made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also complained that,

as  a result of our protective policies for industry,

the  prices of goods have gone up. I do not know  how

the Member could have got that impression. He must be

quite  unscientific, for I have here the latest  copy

of  the  Monthly Digest of Statistics which  keeps  a

consumer  price index. The volume I am quoting  from,

Sir,  is the November issue, Volume VII, No.  11.  At

page 117, it gives the consumer price index. The base

is 100 as at April/May, 1960. For January 1968, it is

113.5  points.  For  September, lo  and  behold,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is 111.1 points. According  to  this

price  index,  which is collected by  the  Statistics

Department  -and it is the authoritative price  index

for  Singapore - the cost of living has in fact  gone

down. The Member for Telok Blangah should have a look

at  this consumer price index. If he can convince  me

that  the  prices have gone up and give  evidence  to

support it, I shall definitely look into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the construction of the consumer price index is

based on retail prices. Weights are given for various

goods.  I should ask the Member to be more scientific

than just say, "Prices have soared up." In fact,  the

expression he used was "spiralling of prices". He  is

using  a  very technical term but his statements  are

based not on facts but on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



feelings.  It is true that the prices of one  or  two

items  might  have gone up, but there are  comparable

substitutes in the market. For example, if the Member

is  taken in by an advertisement saying that by using

a  particular  brand of toilet soap he  could  get  a

complexion as smooth as that of nine out of ten  film

stars, he has got to pay for that belief. There is  a

comparable brand of soap in the market. Why  does  he

not  use it and help the local industry? In fact,  he

will be helping his own fellow men to get employment.

Why  must he buy an imported brand of soap?  I  think

his  fellow men should ask him that question, and  he

must be prepared to answer them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also raised the point

that hotel charges are too high and that package tour

agents are beginning to leave Singapore out of  their

itinerary.  Sir,  I  can only say  that  he  has  not

produced any evidence whatsoever to substantiate this

charge.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

point   of   clarification.  Will  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  say  whether the tax on  made-up  garments

will be levied on imported dhotis and sarees?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am sure sarees can be made in

Singapore. I do not see any reason why our women folk

cannot  look nice in locally-made sarees. I  am  sure

they will look equally charming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of tax on liquid petroleum gas, the

tax  is three cents per pound and not 15 per cent  as

stated  by  the  Member for Telok  Blangah.  This  is

necessary  in order to make not only the gas  of  the

Public  Utilities  Board  but  also  its  electricity

competitive with petroleum gas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of per capita income of workmen, I

understand that the Labour Department keeps a  record

of  the figures of the average yearly earnings of the

workers.   These  figures  show  that  the   workers'

earnings  have  been going up over the years,  though

not  very dramatically. I think I have replied to the

Member for Telok Blangah and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



now  come to the points raised by the Member for Bras

Basah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah quoted 'from the Budget

speech of the Minister for Finance and said that  the

difference between imports and exports, or the  trade

gap,  is  somewhere in the region of $1,000  million.

This  figure,  of course, covers only goods  imported

and exported, and does not take into account services

like  insurance,  port services and the  rest.  These

services  normally make up the deficit,  as  is  very

eloquently  shown in our reserves. Surely,  the  acid

test  is whether our reserves go up or 'down,  and  I

can  assure Members that our reserves have been going

up  year  by  year and are now in a very satisfactory

state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained that 'certain foreign

investors  come and invest here and yet do  not  open

their own home market to the products manufactured in

Singapore.  What does the Member expect? Surely,  the

idea of attracting foreign investment here is that we

should  create employment opportunities for  our  own

people.  The question of where they sell the products

does  not really matter. As long as the products  can

be  sold,  whether in the home market of the  foreign

investor  or elsewhere, that is what really  matters.

In fact, some of these foreign investors do come here

with  their  market. One such example is  Bridgestone

Tyre  Company Limited. In any case, even  if  foreign

investors  do not come here with their market  or  do

not  open their home market to our products, I  think

the  best  thing  to do is to help these  foreign  in

vestors find their market rather than complain  about

them. Does the Member really mean to say that if they

do  not  open their home market to us, we should  not

allow  them  to  come  in, thereby  resulting  in  no

factories being opened and unemployment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained that the 10 per cent tax

on the Public Utilities Board bills fall very heavily

on the working class and that it is a regressive tax.

I  am  afraid  he  has not read  the  speech  of  the

Minister for Finance very carefully, because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Finance did say that more than  32  per

cent  of the consumers need only pay half of the tax,

that is, 5 per cent, and more than a quarter need not

pay  any  tax  at  all.  I am  sure  this  is  not  a

regressive tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the points raised by the Member for

Jurong. I think he brought up the same point made  by

the Member for Bras Basah, and that is the trade gap.

I have already answered that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained of the lack of social

amenities in Jurong and asked for an improvement. The

Government  is  very  conscious  of  this  particular

aspect.  That  is one of the reasons why  the  Jurong

Town  Corporation  was established  with  a  view  to

bringing about an improvement in the social amenities

in  Jurong. The other reason for the establishment of

the  Corporation  is  the better management  and  the

rationalisation of development, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also proposed that a workers'

cultural  centre  be established in Jurong.  I  would

advise  him  to  look into the possibility  of  using

community  centres for this purpose. I  am  sure  the

facilities there can be utilised for this purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, 1

would  like to clarify that I did mention the problem

of a community centre in Jurong Town. I said that the

present  community centre was not properly built.  It

is  only an assorted collection of several flats  and

is  situated quite far away from the workers'  homes.

That   is   why  it  cannot  be  used  for   cultural

activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, there are many community

centres in Jurong and I would recommend the Member to

make  use  of  the facilities there, if the  existing

community centres are too far away from the  workers'

homes, perhaps  he  can make representation  to  the

People's   Association  for  the   establishment   of

additional  community centres in order to incorporate

cultural activities into the community centres.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point the Member touched on is about the

Fire  Brigade.  He complained that the  nearest  Fire

Brigade is at Bukit Timah. That is true, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  But,  as  far as I can see, it takes  about  10

minutes  to go from Bukit Timah to Jurong  Town.  The

roads are wide and the traffic is smooth flowing.  Of

course,  it  is  not possible to have  fire  brigades

everywhere. Singapore is such a small island and land

is  precious  and  priorities have  to  be  given  to

industries and factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also raised the point that

imported  made-up  garments  are  cheaper  and   more

lasting.  I have spoken on this point and  I  do  not

intend to say anything further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Member for Sembawang suggested a tax on

furs. As we all know, Singapore is in the tropics and

very  few people here wear furs, if at all. It is  an

item  only  for  sale to tourists  and  it  will  not

benefit  our  tourist trade if we put a  tax  on  any

articles  that are likely to be bought  by  them.  It

would  be  as  foolish as putting a tax  on  cameras,

because,  after  all, Singapore has a  reputation  of

being  a shopper's paradise and we must do everything

to maintain that reputation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the points

raised.  As  other Members are waiting  to  speak,  I

shall not hold up the proceedings any further.



<br><br>6.16p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> Thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i>: Mr Speaker. Sir, I am afraid that

what  I  am  going  to  say has been  said  by  other

Members.  However, I would like to  enlarge  on  what

they have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Finance warned that the next

Budget  would not be painless, people from all  walks

of  life  were mystified. They were worried that  in,

future  they would be asked to bear more taxes.  This

is  only  natural  because everyone  knows  that  the

British forces will be withdrawn from Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



between  1970  and 1971. As Singapore  lacks  natural

resources,  we  have to depend on our entrepot  trade

and  industrialisation for our livelihood.  How  then

are we to get the money for the necessary build-up of

our  defence as a result of the withdrawal of British

forces from Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that we adhere to a non-aligned

foreign policy. We will not stretch out our hands  to

beg  for aid from the big powers to help us with  our

defence  expenditure.  So the  only  thing  that  the

people can expect is increased taxation. It came as a

surprise  to  those people who had been  expecting  a

painful Budget when the Minister for Finance proposed

only  seven mild taxes on the 3rd of this month. This

was  contrary  to their expectations  and  they  were

naturally pleased. As a matter of fact, the  majority

of  the  people  realise that increased  taxation  is

unavoidable  in order to fill the gap in our  defence

expenditure. Everyone is prepared to make sacrifices.

This is an indication of the people's patriotism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main feature of the Budget is that it reflects

the  prosperity of our commerce and industry and  the

increasing  confidence of investors.  Therefore,  the

people are proud of this Budget. In the context of  a

turbulent Southeast Asia, ours is a clean and  honest

government for a newly emergent nation. What is  very

precious  is that we have shrewd economists like  the

Minister for Finance. We are relieved to know  before

Christmas that there is nothing worse in the  Budget.

We  have  been  fortunate in  not  following  in  the

footsteps of some of our neighbouring countries whose

economy  is on the verge of collapse. This is because

of  the  prudence of our Minister for Finance and  of

the   precautions  which  have  been  taken  by   our

Government. This is something of which we are  proud.

Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, you will agree  with  me

that  if  there is a Nobel Prize for a  Minister  for

Finance, our Minister for Finance deserves to win it!

The future development of our country still needs the

collective effort



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



of  persons like the Minister for Finance  and  other

Ministers. I am sure that Singapore will shine like a

beacon in turbulent Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the new tax proposals affect only a

minority  of  people.  'There  is  nothing  much   to

criticise about the new taxes. But from the financial

point  of  view,  I think there is some  defect.  The

basis  of taxation should be reviewed. The only  fair

way  of  going  about  it is to impose  taxes  propor

tionately  on the people who are able to  bear  them.

The  burden  of taxation must be fairly  distributed.

The  raising of revenue must not be the sole  factor.

Taxation  must also reflect the financial  policy  of

the  State. The trend of modern economics is just the

economics of finance and nothing else. This is a very

weak  foundation, in other words, the development  of

commerce   and  industry  cannot  be  divorced   from

financial  factors  imposed by  financiers.  Although

Marx  said that the use of currency will die out  one

day,  it  was  Lenin who did not oppose  the  use  of

currency  - "The Central Economic Planning  Committee

is in the sole control of the country's finances." it

means  that  it is not enough to depend on  political

influence alone to solve the financial problem  of  a

country. According to this analysis, it is clear that

the  Minister  for  Finance had  already  taken  into

account   both   the  financial  administration   and

practical  factors before he presented the Budget  to

this House. He was able to balance both these factors

to  a  certain degree. When elaborating on the  seven

new  taxes and adjustments to the old taxes, he  said

that   in  imposing  a  tax  on  P.U.B, bills,  some

consideration would be given to the industrial use of

public utilities. This is in order not to reduce  the

competitive  position  of the local  industries.  The

Minister has also proposed to exempt industries  from

the  new  levy on public utility services.  In  other

words,  the  new  tax  will not hamper  our  economic

growth  and industrial expansion. All this  is  being

done  to attract more foreign investments and to make

our goods competitive in price.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must turn our thoughts to these new

taxes.  In my view, there is one outstanding  feature

about them. The emphasis on the burden of the tax  is

on  the  poor  people. The Finance Minister  gave  an

explanation for increasing the rate of tax on  public

utility   services.  I  will  now   dwell   on   this

explanation. According to him, there will be about 25

per  cent  of the consumers who will fall within  the

category of those whose PUB, bills do not exceed  $10

per month.



<br><br>6.32p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This category is exempted from the new tax. Those

consumers  whose bills fall between  $10  and  $20  a

month  constitute  about 32 per  cent  of  the  total

consumers. On this category a rate of five  per  cent

is  levied.  In  the  view of the  Finance  Minister,

consumers whose monthly bills range from $10 to $20 a

month  are quite well off financially and they should

not be classified in the category of poor people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out, first of all, that

this tax, as explained by the Finance Minister, is

neither  clearly defined nor  evenly  spread.  In fact,

consumers in the range of $10 to $20 per month can

be included in the category of poor people.  The majority

of consumers in this range are poor and  the

additional tax will have an adverse effect  on  them.

At least they will be affected psychologically. Those

affected  by  this new tax are not rich people.  They

belong  to  the  hard-toiling type  of  people.  This

burden is particularly felt amongst those who are not

rich.  For  example, if a family uses  $20  worth  of

public  utility services a month, we can say that  it

belongs  to  the $300 income group. But we  must  not

forget  that human beings need water and lighting.  A

bigger  family will, therefore, need a greater supply

of  water  and electricity even though its income  is

only  about $300 per month. If you take a  family  in

the  $300  income group which has eight members,  the

consumption will be substantial. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



other words, the consumption rate of public utilities

is  no  indication of the financial position  of  the

family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware of the fact that tenants in Housing

Board  flats  use more public utility  services  than

those whose monthly P.U.B, bills come up to $10. This

is  because  of the size of their family.  But  their

income  may be within the range of $200 to  $300  per

month. They are now worried about the new tax because

of  the size of their family. They are worried  about

the  high cost of public utility services. We  cannot

assume  that, because a family's P.U.B, bill is  $20,

it  belongs  to  the well-to-do group and  should  be

taxed  accordingly.  That is a  wrong  assumption  to

make.  If we carry this assumption too far,  it  will

give  rise  to a great deal of ill consequences.  For

example, consumers whose bills amount to $20  may  be

classified  as  the  lower middle  income  group.  In

addition to the normal P.U.B, expenses, they will now

have  to  pay these additional taxes. As a result  of

this  increased  burden, they will  not  allow  their

children  to make use of electric lights for  reading

at  night. They may have to switch to kerosene lamps.

As  a  result, their eyes will suffer. We  will  then

have  more  and more shortsighted people in Singapore

in  the future. Many families now use electricity  or

gas  for  cooking.  The  additional  levy  on  public

utility  services  will force them  to  use  kerosene

cookers  or  even  bottled gas as a  substitute.  The

additional cost of water will also induce them not to

use  sufficient  water to wash their  clothes  clean.

These  are  the  adverse  consequences  we  have   to

consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merchants and traders use neon lights for

advertising  purposes. However, we  do  not  have  to

worry  about the big businessmen. But what about  the

small businessmen? As a result of the increased  cost

of  public  utility services, they may  pass  on  the

increased cost to the consumers by raising the retail

prices  of  goods  and  services.  Consequently,  the

people will again suffer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider the rural areas. We are now

encouraging  the  rural people to make  more  use  of

electricity  and  water.  In  other  words,  we   are

installing electricity in the rural areas.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.40 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are cutting down the provision of stand-pipes in

order to encourage the rural people to install water-

pipes  in  their  own homes. The  additional  tax  on

public utility services will be a burden on the rural

people  who  are  already poor. They  are,  in  fact,

poorer than the urban people. They will thus hesitate

to install water and electricity in their homes. As a

result,  they will not be able to enjoy these  modern

facilities.  In my humble view, the Finance  Minister

should  give  further thought to  the  new  forms  of

taxation.  He  should look further into the  question

before he makes a final decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there no way of increasing revenue other than by

increasing  the levy on the public utility  services?

Cannot  we  impose additional taxes on luxury  goods?

Cannot  we do it by way of purchase tax? In my  view,

it  is  only by increasing the taxes on luxury  goods

and  purchase tax that we are able to get money  from

the    rich.   For   example,   refrigerators,   air-

conditioners, perfumes and cosmetics for women and  a

host of other luxury goods can be considered for  tax

increases. These are the articles used by  the  upper

middle class or the middle class people. More revenue

will  come from these sources than from the  levy  on

public utility services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to statistics, the yield from this new tax

on P.U.B, bills will amount to $11 million per annum.

[f  we were to substitute this tax with purchase  tax

and  taxes on luxury goods, we might be able  to  get

more  money from the people who should be taxed.  Our

budget  will  then be nearer to perfection.  It  will

then  be  in keeping with the Government's policy  of

looking   after   the   majority   of   the   people,

particularly the poor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is gratifying to note that, due to the

efforts made by the Ministry of Finance, we have been

able  to attract a large amount of  investments into

Singapore.  I think this is  a  very  important feature

in  the Finance Minister's Budget Statement. As  a result

of the continuous flow of foreign investments  into

Singapore, we are able to give more  jobs

to our people. Our economy is given another boost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to draw the attention of the Finance Minister

to  the  fact  that amongst the investors  coming  to

Singapore, there are very few women investors. As far

as I know, there are many wealthy women in the world.

Although  these rich women are not so  aggressive  as

their  male  counterparts, they are financially  well

off  to  be able to invest in our markets. We  should

not overlook them because of their lack of aggressive

ness.  If we are able to attract them to invest here,

we    can    perhaps   get   additional   substantial

investments. As regards the women in our own country.

the  Finance Minister should find ways and  means  to

encourage  them to invest locally. This  will  be  of

great   assistance  to  our  national  economy.   For

example,  our women may have property like  jewellery

and   other  precious  ornaments.  They  bought  them

because  of  the fear that their cash may be  stolen.

They  bought  them as a form of investment.  This  is

because  there  has  been no encouragement  from  the

Government  for our women to make proper investments.

lf  the  Government  can set up a women's  investment

bureau,  perhaps our economy will be  better  off  in

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give consideration to these

problems. I give him my full support.



<br><br>6.46p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  British  troops are withdrawing fast  from  this

region.  Since  the announcement of  the  accelerated

withdrawal of British forces from Singapote,  no  one

inside  and outside this House has any doubt  of  the

need to build up our own defence forces



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



quickly.  However,  apart from the  consideration  of

national    security   against   possible    external

aggression, one side issue of the withdrawal  is  the

mass increase in unemployment. This increase, Sir, is

over  and  above  the  present  serious  unemployment

situation resulting from the large turn-out of school

leavers  year  after  year.  The  resultant  economic

problem  poses such a formidable challenge that  many

Finance  Ministers  even  of the  affluent  countries

would  rather quit their posts than stay  on.  Taking

this  into account, Sir, I cannot help congratulating

our  Finance  Minister on his courage  and  brilliant

rendering of his annual Budget Statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side by side with the military build up, the

Minister outlined his plans for economic growth  and,

in  this  respect,  he quoted gratifying  figures  of

achievement  in  our  industrial  expansion.  Foreign

capital  is  continuously being  poured  in  and  the

Minister  is optimistic that the factories in  Jurong

and other industrial estates will continue to grow in

number  and  in  size.  I would  like  to  share  his

optimism,   but   industrialists,  both   local   and

overseas,  have  repeatedly  warned  that  with   our

population of two million, the prospects of industria

lisation  would  be  dim unless our  industries  were

oriented towards exports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that among the factories already

engaged in the export trade, some have secured repeat

orders while others have not gone beyond their  first

order.  I  am  sure the Minister is  aware  that  the

establishment of new factories will only serve  as  a

temporary  relief  in our unemployment  problem.  And

unless   these   factories  can  be  sustained,   the

situation   will   quickly  be   reversed,   to   the

disappointment  of  everyone. The sustenance  of  any

factory  depends  on the quality  and  price  of  its

products.  As  I  see  it,  the  Government,  by  its

economic incentives like relief from income  tax  and

other   concessions,  has  succeeded  in   attracting

foreign  investors to set up factories in  Singapore.

And  by  the  Employment Act,  it  has  succeeded  in

improving  efficiency which is supposed to  cut  down

the cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



of  production. But nothing seems to have  been  done,

from  the  statement  of  the  Finance  Minister,   to

regulate the quality of products. Sir, I consider this

most  essential  now.  Otherwise, our  export-oriented

factories  receiving their first  export  order  would

also have received their last export order. Therefore,

I  earnestly suggest that the Minister look into  this

matter as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the raising of revenue, the Minister has

announced four new taxes. On the basis of distributing

the  burden  according to individual ability,  I  feel

that  a  five per cent levy on P.U.B, bills for  those

whose bills fall between $10 and $20 a month is to ask

the   lower   middle   income   group   to   carry   a

proportionately heavier burden. It may be argued  that

this levy does not amount to more than $1 a month. But

in  the  light of the increasing cost of  living,  the

additional  $1 means much more to this group  than  an

increase of $100 to the higher income group. It should

also  be  borne  in  mind that  this  group,  although

consisting of 32 per cent of the total, has  a  larger

number  of children. Any specific increase in taxation

on this group, however small it may be, would be borne

not  only by the head of the family but shared out  by

the children as well. I therefore urge the Minister to

reconsider  the levy of five per cent on P.U.B, bills

for  consumers whose bills fall between $10 and $20  a

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Finance  has  said that this is not a  high  tax.

His explanation is not satisfactory. Therefore, I hope

the Minister will reconsider this matter.  In   conclusion,

I  am  not  unappreciative  of  the

difficulties confronting our Finance Minister. Despite

my  remarks,  to  which I hope he will  give  due  con

sideration, I endorse his Budget Statement.



<br><br>6.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

while  many other countries find themselves in a state

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



serious   concern  over  the  international   monetary

crisis,  we,  in a newly emergent Singapore,  must  be

thankful  that  we  have achieved continuous  economic

growth  and industrial progress during the past  year.

Despite  the fact that we are faced with the  prospect

of   British   withdrawal  and  the  problem   arising

therefrom in the l970s, we have been presented with  a

fairly  mild change and what I might say a  reasonable

Budget  in  the circumstances for the coming  year.  I

feel  sure that this will most certainly be envied  by

others,  and  we Singaporeans can take  pride  in  our

achievements and what we hope for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Budget, the Minister for Finance has

brought realistic changes which, in the Minister's own

words,  dispel  unwarranted  gloom  and  reassure  the

people  that  the  new  taxation  will  not  have  any

damaging effect on investment incentives. In  fact,  I

would  like to add that it establishes confidence  for

the  future.  Due  to  the accelerated  withdrawal  of

British  troops by 1971, the stability in this  region

can no longer be taken for granted. Readjustments have

to   be  made  to  meet  the  changing  circumstances.

Therefore,   it   is  inevitable  that   our   defence

expenditure  will be increased if we are  to  be  more

secure and keep up with new developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 1970s are drawing nearer and nearer. We

must  now start preparing and planning for the future.

if we do not take cautious and steady steps to prepare

for  a  more secure and brighter future, then we  will

live  to  pay for the consequences of our neglect.  If

that were to happen, future generations would judge us

as  having  been selfish and leaving them  to  face  a

world  of  hardship and desperation. We in this  House

are  all  aware  of the fact that changes  are  taking

place  with  great  and  startling  rapidity  in  this

turbulent  part of Southeast Asia. The whole  security

and  political situation in Southeast Asia is  in  the

process  of  change. Change, according  to  our  Prime

Minister,  is the very essence of life. The moment  we

cease to change.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



to   be   able  to  adapt,  to  adjust,  to   respond

effectively to a new situation, 'then we  have  begun

to die.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the changes that the Minister for Finance has

brought  to us in this Budget are realistic  and  the

people  can draw inspiration from it to overcome  the

problems  of the crucial years ahead. In the  Budget,

we  notice  the change in the basis of the  financial

year  in  the presentation of the Estimates  and  the

need to spend more on national defence. I support the

move  by  the  Minister for Finance to  increase  our

defence  expenditure  on the  ground  that  the  real

problems  facing  us  are of a  completely  different

world  after  the British withdrawal. The  prevailing

stability in this region will then vanish. The vacuum

left  by  the British withdrawal makes it  imperative

that we establish an effective defence system of  our

own   to  maintain  our  security  and  preserve  our

identity.  If we do not develop a strong and  lasting

emotional  attachment to Singapore, then I am  afraid

our rich and strategically valuable island will be  a

tempting place for others, especially at a time  when

the fact of international life is for the nations  to

be increasingly driven by hatred and conflict against

each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in

his  speech  in  Bangkok on the 14th  October,  after

examining  the  hard  facts and  harsh  realities  of

Asia's  political scene, warned us that  today  Asian

countries live in fear not of Western imperialism but

of one another's imperialism. This statement has made

us realise the fact that the entire situation in this

region does not encourage optimism about regional  co

operation, but instead if we look around us, we  will

notice   that  confrontation  has  overshadowed   co-

operation.  Faced with such an unpredictable  environ

ment,  it  might  be advisable to follow  the  French

principle  our destiny, our path, our policy  be  our

own - in order to deal with the narrow-minded foreign

policies  of certain nations in this region.  At  the

moment, it would be more appropriate that we devote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



more of our time and energy to ensure our survival by

consolidating  our national defence and  working  for

economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance, in presenting his Budget,

has  observed  the  objectives for  the  Republic

as outlined  by  the  President in his  Speech  to

this Chamber on 6th May. The three objectives are:



optimum use  of  the time available to build up an  effective

defence  capability;  greater  economic  growth;  and

enhancement of national consciousness of the problems

that will come upon us in the next few years. A study

of  the above objectives will make it easy for us  to

understand the intention of the Minister for  Finance

to allocate $330 million, or about 30 per cent of the

total expenditure, on defence, $364 million, or about

35  per cent, on social and educational services, and

$108  million,  or  about 10 per  cent, on  economic

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above expenditure for the coming 15 months,

we  notice that the Government is determined to build

up   an   effective  defence  capability  to   ensure

continuing  security and that, at the same  time,  it

has  not  forgotten the task to speed up our economic

development. The figure of $35.8 million to be raised

from  the  new  taxes  is relatively  very  low  when

compared  to  the amount to be spent on  defence.  It

merely, in the Minister's own words, helps to pay for

rather  less  than 10 per cent in defence expenditure

to  be  incurred next year. Moreover, these new taxes

have  been so calculated by the Minister for  Finance

that  families in the lower income group will not  be

affected, and they will not have the effect of impair

ing    incentives   to   economic   development    or

discouraging  and  disrupting  the  flow  of  foreign

investment.  This is the price that the people  could

pay  in order to build up an effective defence system

at  the  minimum cost, and this cost is not too  much

for  the  people to bear. In fact, the price that  we

pay  today  to ensure a bright, secure and prosperous

future is relatively low. Sir, you may agree with  me

that this is due



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



to  the economic growth which has reached the mark of

7.7  per  cent  since last year despite  the  British

military rundown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of June this year there were 174 pioneer

industries   in   production  with  a   total   fixed

investment  of  $436 million and the combined  output

was $472 million. Investment and production increased

by  19 per cent and 64 per cent respectively when com

pared with the same period last year. This is another

indication  that  enhances our belief  that  economic

growth in our Republic is beyond doubt. Although  the

economic situation is bright, there is still the need

to create confidence in foreign investors in order to

encourage  their active participation in our  overall

economic programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that in the new Budget no

disruption  has  been laid upon  industries  and  the

export trade. Since last year, some fiscal incentives

have  been  designed to encourage export  to  oversea

markets  and  expansion of productive  capability  to

increase  output.  To  meet  our  growing  industrial

expansion, recently the Jurong Town Corporation,  the

Development Bank of Singapore and INTRACO were formed

to  provide  facilities to assist local  and  foreign

potential investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a suitable investment climate in the field of

economics   is  insufficient  to  attract   investors

without   security.   Today,   many   under-developed

countries, though rich in natural resources, find  it

difficult  to  create a stable political  climate  to

attract potential investors. As a result, the  people

in  these countries are still backward and living  in

poverty. Fortunately for us in Singapore, we  have  a

far-sighted government that has in the past few years

started  planning  to build a secure  and  prosperous

nation  which  will provide a better living  for  the

people.  But  how long can we enjoy such  a  pleasant

position  will  depend  on the determination  of  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has assured us that for the

coming  year the greater part of the cost of  defence expenditure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



will  be  met  by increased revenue due  to  economic

growth  rather than by new taxes. To  me  this  is  a

challenge  -  a  challenge for the best  or  for  the

worst..  The  implementation of  his  assurance'  can

simply  mean that if we are disciplined and dedicated

to  make the grade in our economic growth, new  taxes

would  not  be necessary to meet the cost of  defence

expenditure. If we are not disciplined and dedicated,

we  will  have to face the consequence of our  short-

sightedness. There are some selfish people who  think

they  can quit Singapore if something happens to  it.

Let  me tell them that there is no alternative  place

to  escape  but  to follow the Chinese saying,  "Live

here, die here."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should instil into the minds of our people a deep

concern not just for their personal future only,  but

also for the future of Singapore. This is the kind of

thinking  that is working directly to strengthen  our

effort  in  nation building. We are  all  aware  that

nation  building is a long process and the task  that

we  are pursuing to achieve it is difficult. But I am

confident that our people, imbued with initiative and

dedication,   will   be  able   to   overcome   these

difficulties. Even the Prime Minister of  Japan,  Mr

Sato,  when  he  visited Singapore on  15th  October,

1968,  was confident that the course' which Singapore

is  following today, however thorny it may be, is the

path leading to a bright and hopeful future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to realise this expression of confidence

and  translate  visions  into realities,  the  whole-

hearted  efforts of the people must be  harnessed  to

achieve specific projects. Plans must be laid now and

concurrently  the  people must be wakened  to  devote

their resources to the implementation of these plans.

ideas  and plans are easy to formulate. The difficult

task comes after. The time has come for the people to

realise  the  pitfalls ahead  if  the  plans  do  not

succeed.  To  this end, the Government  must  make  a

concerted effort to educate, the people to  meet  the

task ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the people of Singapore will

rise to the occasion, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



they   did   in   the  past,  to  overcome   whatever

difficulties they may have to encounter.  I  may  add

also   that  I  am  confident  that  the  people   of

Singapore, with their resourcefulness and initiative,

will push Singapore to new heights of achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us with studied

confidence look forward to a new era in the nineteen seventies.



<br><br>7.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this

Budget comes as a surprise in many ways. Most  of  us

knew   of   the   extensive  military  build-up   and

consequently expected substantial tax increases. Most

of us, including those in business, knew how well our

economy was developing. What we did not know was that

we  were  doing  so  well that the  heavy  demand  of

military  spending  could be met almost  entirely  by

normal  increases in revenue arising from an expanded

economy.  Sir,  this  is  a remarkable  feat  by  any

standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in most cases, non-defence

expenditure had to have increases curtailed. I regard

this as a rather small price to pay for our security.

We  all  know how awful the burden of defence is.  In

most   countries,  including  even  developed   ones,

increases in military spending would have given  rise

to   severe   economic  problems,  if  not   led   to

bankruptcy.  But here our Finance Minister  does  not

even  have to increase rates. All he needs is an addi

tional  $35 million in 15 months, representing  about

three  per  cent  of his Budget, to pay  for  further

economic  development. I regard this as  close  to  a

modern miracle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were told that a preliminary estimate of our

gross  domestic  expenditure for  1968  put  the  per

capita  figure  of Singapore at $1,940.  This  figure

must surely indicate that we are a rather rich nation

in Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister, in a speech at the recent

opening  of  a  new  factory, said that  our  foreign

reserves  stand at S$2,000 million. With a population

of around two million, our per head of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



external reserves is S$1,000. In Asia, only Japan and

Thailand  have more external reserves than Singapore.

In  June  1968, the external reserves of  Japan  were

US$2,001   million  and  the  external  reserves   of

Thailand  were  US$1,051  million.  Their  respective

populations,  however,  are  99.5  million  and  32.7

million. Therefore, in terms of external reserves and

on  the  basis of population, Singapore is  ahead  of

Japan and Thailand. The per head of external reserves

of  Japan  is 5560 and that of Thailand  is  S$96  as

against  ours of S$l,000. This figure must again  put

us  well ahead of other nations in Asia, if not ahead

of many prosperous nations of the West.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having done so well in the year, it is no wonder

that  the  public  have responded favourably  to  the

additional  requirements  of  the  Finance  Minister.

Furthermore,  the  additional sums required  are  for

transfer  to  the Development Fund to expand  further

our economy. Therefore, I do not wish to touch on the

new  tax measures and the variations on the old ones.

All  of them appear to have been carefully calculated

and designed to spread the load on those most able to

bear them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I wish to touch on is the rather

grim  prospect facing us in  the  next  three years.

I have little doubt that our economy will  ex pand  enough

to meet the increasing needs of defence. However, I do

have grave misgivings about the outcome of  the  work

of  those Ministries  whose  share  of

economic  increases  will  be  siphoned  off  to  the

Ministry  of Interior and Defence. I quite appreciate

that without an adequate defence system, all economic

and  social development will not be to our good.  But

at  the  same  time we have to ensure  that  we  have

something worth while to defend. I fear that if  non-

defence expenditure is kept at a standstill, not only

will  there  be  a  standstill in  the  work  of  the

Ministries  concerned, but there may be  a  deteriora

tion  that will, in the end, be very costly to arrest

and rectify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While agreeing that our rate of defence build-up is

necessary, I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



that  at  the same time other Ministries  should  not

acquire  the defeatist attitude of doing  nothing  as

far  as  improvements are concerned, The Ministry  of

Finance has set up a trading company and a bank on  a

commercial  basis so that the additional  expenditure

involved will be more than met from commercial  opera

tions instead of being a further charge on Government

funds.  The Ministry of Communications now  functions

more  like  a  huge  business  concern  than  like  a

regulatory  Government department.  The  Ministry  of

Culture has formed a trading company to cut down  the

cost of production of radio and television programmes

and  at  the  same  time to market  those  programmes

locally  and  abroad.  The  other  Ministries  should

follow  suit.  The  Ministry of  Education  can,  for

instance, try to sell its excellent E.T.V, programmes

abroad. The Ministry of National Development can, for

instance,  sell  more  of its housing  and  technical

expertise   to  other  countries.  The  Housing   and

Development Board should accelerate its sale of  low-

cost  houses.  At present, I do not think  that  more

than  15  per cent of those who live in the  low-cost

housing estates own their own flats. The ideal  would

probably  be  about 50 per cent. I am not  suggesting

that the Government should go all out to compete with

business  enterprises. What I am suggesting is  that,

with some thought and imagination, the Ministries can

in  one way or another operate along commercial lines

to  cut  costs  and increase their  income.  Even  if

nothing  more  than  an attempt has  been  made,  the

exercise  will  keep those Ministries  which  have  a

standstill  budget for the next three years  fighting

fit until better times come.



<br><br>7.23 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, so that I may not cut you

short in the middle of your speech, may I say that

you have seven minutes. At half-past seven I must,

under Standing Orders, call the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget and

the Government's financial policy for the coming year

have obviously been framed with an eye on and under

overwhelming intimidation of the impending withdrawal

of the British forces from Singapore. In the midst of

extremely wild speculation, the Budget has been

hailed as sensible and mild. But, Sir, I have my

reservations and consider that the levying of a ten

per cent tax on P.U.B, services is incorrect and

untimely and that the allocation of expenditure in

certain cases is unbalanced and not properly handled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the 10 per cent tax on P.U.B.

services,  I wish to draw the Government's  attention

to the following considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it was only on the 1st November, 1966, that

the P.U.B, last raised its rates of charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government has exempted some $14 million

taxes  on  petroleum products consumed by the  P.U.B.

whose  trade  surplus  for  the  coming  year,  as  I

understand  it,  is somewhere in the  region  of  $26

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, as pointed out by the Minister for Finance,

with   the  introduction  of  more  efficient   power

generation  systems, there could  be  a  considerable

drop  in production costs resulting in still a higher

trade surplus. Therefore, if the Government reimposes

the  tax  on  petroleum products, it  will  still  be

possible  for the PUB, to maintain a reasonably  high

level  of  trade  surplus  which  should  fulfil  the

requirements of the World Bank Loan without having to

throw the burden of tax on to the people at large, if

this  is clone, it will probably make the P.U.B, work

harder  and raise the level of its trade surplus  and

at the same time ensure that the services it provides

are kept at the most efficient level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my point that the allocation of expenditure is

unbalanced  and  not  properly handled,  I  refer  in

particular  to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  which

has to live with only about one per cent of the total

Budget.  I  beg  to  disagree with the  Minister  for

Finance if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



this  allocation is any indication of the  importance

he attaches to this Ministry. I base my consideration

on  the  relative  merits of the two  Ministries  the

Ministry of the Interior and Defence and the Ministry

of  Foreign Affairs - which are both important to our

security and prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of our defence build-up is "to achieve

security in the long term so that the people can  now

plan  ahead  in  whatever they are doing".  This  was

declared by the Minister for Defence in his statement

on  26th March. 1968. This is all very good if a more

logical  and  realistic  approach  is  made  in   all

directions to attain such an objective. Sir,  we  are

living  in  a  turbulent area which has  always  been

subjected  to  wars  and  conflicts  throughout   its

history  and  where  the political situation  changes

rapidly.  I am sure that our very existence, security

and attitudes are to a very large extent affected  by

conditions and decisions made more from without  than

from  within  this  region or  our  country.  If  the

Minister for Foreign Affairs is here, I am sure  that

he will agree with my observation in this respect. If

this  is the case, does the Minister for Finance  not

consider it of paramount importance that we  must  be

in  a  position to project a true and clear image  of

Singapore   overseas  and  that  we  must   be   kept

adequately informed of world opinion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will quote an example to show how a foreign

mission  can  help tremendously to prevent  conflicts

and  to  promote peace and security. I refer  to  the

recent   difficulties  we  had  with  our  Indonesian

neighbours. I am sure that the situation in Indonesia

took  a  turn  for the better because of the  tactful

handling by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs  and  the

fact  that  we  have a capable and  gallant  diplomat

there.  This  goes to show that the returns  from  an

investment  in  such  a  mission  can  bring  us  big

dividends. Had it not been for the fact that we  were

able to afford this mission, and have it established,

we would probably have had to pay a much higher price

for an amicable settlement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another reason for our defence build-up is to

show  to  the world at large that we are prepared  to

defend  what  we  have so that prospective  investors

will  feel it safe to put their money with  us.  Does

the  Minister  for Finance not consider  it  sensible

that  any prospective investor will first look around

and  see how well we are getting along with the world

at large before he conies and invests here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to clarify two points. The fact

that  I am asking for more money for the Ministry  of

Foreign  Affairs does not indicate my full  agreement

with  whatever  is being undertaken or pronounced  by

this  particular Ministry. It is neither my intention

to  belittle the good work that the Ministry  of  the

Interior  and Defence has been doing in  fostering  a

climate  that  is  conducive to the continued  peace,

security  and prosperity in our Republic,  nor  do  1

wish  to  deny  that we have to be in a  position  to

contribute  substantially to any eventual  collective

defence  agreement and be a party  of  importance  in

such an exercise as early as we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I am fully convinced of the

importance  of  handling foreign affairs  for  us  in

Southeast  Asia.  If  the  Government  neglects   the

contributions to the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs,  I

am  of the opinion that it is putting the cart before

the  horse  and' that it does not have a correct  and

balanced approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask the Government to provide us not only

with  an  alert, 'disciplined and well-trained  crew,

ready and capable of defending us from any danger and

threat to our survival, but also with people who  are

capable  of  reading and interpreting  signs  of  bad

weather and of seeing us through the rough seas ahead

so that we will come safely into port.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker.  Sir, my task this evening is made  somewhat

easier  by  the  novel arrangement of introducing  my

Parliamentary Secretary at half-time.  He  has  dealt

with so many of the points raised by Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



of  the House that only a few are to be dealt with by

me.  However,  since my Parliamentary Secretary  made

his  speech,  some speakers have raised a  number  of

points and I think they deserve careful attention and

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have said that the tax on P.U.B, bills

is  not such a good idea, particularly the levying of

a  five per cent tax on bills between $10 and $20 per

month,  The  Member for Delta, the Member  for  Anson

and, I think, the Member for Crawford have criticised

this  proposed measure in very clear terms. In  fact,

the  Member  for  Delta thought  that  in  some  poor

families children may be reduced to such straits that

they  will  have to study by kerosene  light.  May  I

remind her of the "Three Character Classic", which no

doubt  she had read in her early childhood, in  which

there was a very distinguished scholar who studied by

the  light of glow-worms. We are still far from  this

desperate  position. To all these people I just  want

to  make this reply. Let us get down to figures. They

say  that a family earning $300 per month and  having

many  children  will have difficulty in  paying  this

tax.  In  fact,  on the average, they will  pay  only

something  like  75 cents more per month.  I  do  not

think a family earning an average of $300 a month  --

according to the Member for Delta - would find it  an

incredible  hardship to pay 75 cents more per  month.

Of   course,   there  are  so  many  of  them   that,

collectively, we get about half a million  dollars  a

year. That is a very tidy sum. I do not think one can

despise  half a million dollars a year.  In  defence,

all  I  say  is that the amount they have to  pay  is

really small, the number of tax payers is large,  and

the total sum collected is not negligible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has asked me to think of ways

and   means  to  attract  foreign  rich  women   into

Singapore. I confess I am very startled by  this  pro

posal.  It  has never occurred to me just how  to  go

about this job. If there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



volunteers  among the strong, virile  and  attractive

Backbenchers to help us in this task, I  am  sure  we

might  achieve something. The Member for  Delta  said

that  our women buy jewellery and perhaps they  might

be  induced  to  sell  the jewellery  and  invest  in

industry.  I  am  not  a prig in these  matters,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  see no harm in  women  buying  and

keeping jewellery. After all, it is a very good hedge

against   inflation.  In  any  event,  where  Finance

Ministers in poor countries have asked their women to

disgorge themselves of their jewellery, they have all

been  singularly  unsuccessful.  So  let  us  console

ourselves  with the thought that our Singapore  women

buy  jewellery and use it. Let us hope that they look

more   attractive  and  raise  the  morale   of   the

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Nee Soon has made what I

consider  to be a sober and constructive analysis  of

the  problem that faces us. I would like to underline

some  of  the points that he has made. The  first  is

this.  After  1971,  with the  departure  of  British

military  protection, we will be  living  in  a  nevi

world. I do not think he is exaggerating the position

when he says that it will be a new world and that  in

this new world it is as well that we have an adequate

defence capability. He also makes what appears to  me

a  very  crucial point, when he says that apart  from

buying weapons and training people, we need to instil

into the population a strong emotional attachment  to

the  country.  I wholeheartedly agree with  him  that

this  point must never be overlooked by the  Ministry

of  Defence,  by the Government, and by  the  general

population. If we ignore this important psychological

factor, we do so at our own risk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the population of Singapore is

really of recent migrant origin. Our society does not

strike  deep roots into the past. Therefore,  the  natural

basis  of  patriotism which  exists  in  older societies

does not exist here. In fact,  I  remember reading  the

editorial of a local  Chinese  language

newspaper   just  before  the  Budget  and   it   was

speculating on defence expenditure. The leader



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



writer  made  this point. Although in  terms  of  the

legal  constitution we may be an independent country,

in  fact we retain a great deal of the colonial  heri

tage  -  namely, a good proportion of the  population

live  in Singapore not as residents of a home but  as

paying  guests  in a hotel. If there  is  prosperity,

people  'enjoy  it. But if there is  adversity,  they

pack  up  and go to another hotel. This unfortunately

is  true of a good number of Singaporeans, it  is  as

well  that we recognise this fact. At the same  time,

we  must also admit that among the younger people who

have grown up here and are educated here, this strong

emotional  attachment is developing.  We  should  see

that  it develops speedily and strikes deep roots  in

our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon is entirely right in saying

that  without  security there can be no stable  basis

for  investment. In fact, security from  disturbances

both from within and from without is an essential pre-requisite to economic growth. He has correctly  noted

that  in many developing countries which have  failed

to  provide  a secure framework of internal  security

and  defence  against external threat, no development

of any kind is possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock has drawn our attention to

the  strong  position of our external  reserves,  the

level  now being some $2,000 million. He has compared

it  with the reserves of Japan and Thailand. Although

in  the  aggregate  both these  countries  have  more

external  reserves than ours, in terms of per  capita

reserves,  ours is between 10 and 15 times  those  of

Thailand  and Japan. I think his figures are correct,

except  that the Japanese have been increasing  their

reserves  very  fast in the last few months.  He  has

asked how we compare with European countries. He  may

be  interested to know that I have in my Ministry two

German  advisers  who  have been  sent  here  by  the

International   Monetary   Fund.   They   have   done

calculations and compared the external per capita  re

serves of Singapore with those of their ~wn country -

Germany. As you know,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



the  Deutschesmark is the strongest currency  in  the

world. But our per capita reserves are two and a half

times  those of the Germans. So I think, all in  all.

we  are  in a good position. Let us always  keep  our

position that strong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock is entirely right in saying

that  the  Ministries  which  are  now  suffering   a

standstill  in  their budget allocations  should  not

despair.  He has given us some proposals  on  how  to

raise  income. It is not at all a bad idea. In  fact,

so  far  as  the Ministry of National Development  is

concerned, they are carrying on with a very energetic

plan  to sell houses to the tenants. In the next  few

months the Housing and Development Board itself  will

launch a very extensive scheme to sell houses to  the

tenants. That part of his proposal is in hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from getting income from various sources, and

mind  you,  this  sort of thing can be  over-done,  I

think there is scope for ingenuity by officials. With

the  same  money, if they can think  of  solving  the

problems in novel ways, if they can apply their minds

in  bold and imaginative ways, we can see not  merely

the  maintenance  of  existing  standards  but  great

improvements  in the standards of services  provided.

Let  us  hope  that the non-defence  Ministries  will

regard  this  as a great challenge and  rise  to  the

occasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Crawford raised a number of points.

First,  with  regard to the P.U.B, he said  that  the

P.U.B, has a surplus of $26 million. He thought  that

if  we had reimposed the fuel tax, which could easily

get us $12 million, it would not be necessary for  us

to  have a 10 per cent tax on P.U.B, bills. First  of

all,  the  trade  surplus of the P.U.B, is  somewhat

different  from, say, the trade surplus of a  private

corporation. Supposing XYZ Company makes $20 million.

That  belongs to the company --the directors and  the

shareholders.  But  when the P.U.B, enjoys  a  trade

surplus, all it means is that it will need less money

from the Finance Ministry by way of loans. Therefore,

in a sense, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



trade  surplus of the P.U.B, helps the Government  in

that  we  need  to  give them less  money  for  their

development expenditure. Therefore, to impose a  fuel

tax  would mean that in the end, although we get  $12

million from them, we will have to give them back $12

million for their development expenditure. That  does

not help us very much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, more money for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs!

Of  course,  no one will argue against the importance

of having a good diplomatic service, having effective

missions abroad which will influence friends and keep

enemies  at arm's length. We will agree to all  that.

The  Member for Crawford gave the good example of our

Ambassador  in Jakarta who put up such  a  brave  and

resolute show in the face of very acute difficulties.

We  have  a  good man there and we have good  men  in

other missions. But the trouble is that the supply of

good, resourceful and perceptive Ambassadors is  very

limited.  You may have good men who can  become  good

Ambassadors,  but they prefer to remain in  Singapore

and  make  money.  After  all,  we  do  not  pay  our

Ambassadors all that much money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. My

point is that the Ministry has no money. That is  the

reason why we cannot pay them well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We have got to pay Ambassadors

according  to  the salary scale of the civil  service

structure.  If you pay the Permanent Secretary  Grade

C,  which is about $2,300 all-in a month, you  cannot

pay  the Ambassador $50,000 a month. This is  what  a

successful businessman is making. Be that as it  may,

the  supply  of  top-class  diplomats  is  a  greater

limitation  than money. Of course, it takes  time  to

develop  the  Foreign Ministry. It is  not  merely  a

matter  of getting staff and training them: there  is

the   further  problem  of  developing  a  tradition,

inculcating  professional skills and  so  on  and  so

forth.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member says that we struck a wrong balance

between  the  Ministry  of Foreign  Affairs  and  the

Ministry of the Interior and Defence. I do not  know.

Of  course, we agree that we have to get on well with

other  countries. But whereas you can take your  time

to develop your Foreign Service, you have three years

only  to  develop "the muscles". That is why  we  are

spending so much time and putting so much effort into

our  defence build-up. Of course, what encourages  us

or should encourage us and should assure other people

is  the  fact  that it is quite fantastic  to  regard

Singapore's defence build-up as in any way  offensive

or  threatening  to  other people,  because,  by  our

nature, we, as a trading centre, a small island  with

a  small population, above all, value peace, security

and  stability. Wars and aggression are for countries

with  100 or 200 million people. Small countries just

want to be left alone to exercise their abilities and

their talents for their own advantage. Unfortunately,

in  this part of the world and in the age in which we

live,  we are more likely to achieve these objectives

and  to  get on well with other countries if  we  are

respected rather than if we are despised. So whatever

the correct balance may be in the next two years,  it

is  quite  clear in my mind that we have  to  proceed

with  the defence build-up. In the meantime,  we  are

looking around for astute, resourceful and perceptive

ambassadors.
