<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether he will consider taking steps with the view to

the  extension  of the period, which  closes  on  31st

January,   1958,  for  the  initial  registration   of

Singapore citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

no.   The   Government  has  accepted  the   All-Party

Committee's   recommendation  to  close  the   initial

registration of citizens on 31st January, 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what will then

be  the  fate of those who have not registered by  the

target date but who are desirous of becoming Singapore

citizens?

<br><br>10.07 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Hon. the Financial Secretary in his  budget

speech  on  4th  December, said (column  2830  of  the

Hansard):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... it is possible that the actual deficit would be

of the order of $8 million...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that the actual deficit in 1958 will be

of  the  order of $8 million, and to meet the deficit,

it  is  proposed to increase, among other things,  the

duty  on petrol and to make a slight increase  in  the

special tax on heavy oil engine vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I disagree most strongly with the Financial

Secretary when he said that the imposition of the  new

rate  on  petrol is unlikely to cause any hardship  to

Singapore. It is quite possible, Sir, that in the near

future,  this increase in the price of petrol will  be

passed  on  to those who have to use public transport.

Nor  have  the  owners of private cars  been  let  off

lightly.  Sir, car owners in the higher  income  group

may  be able to take the increase of 20 cents a gallon

on  petrol, they can afford it. But for those who find

it  necessary or convenient to own a car for a  number

of  good reasons, this increase will result, when they

come  to  balance their monthly budgets, in having  to

rob Peter to pay Paul.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking closely at the picture, Sir, one cannot help

coming  to  the  conclusion that it is those  who  can

least afford it who will be the most hard hit by  this

increase  of 20 cents a gallon on petrol. For example,

Sir,  take a clerk who owns a car, draws $300 a  month

salary,  and  uses 1½ gallons of petrol  a  day.  This

means  that  the increased charge to him  will  be  30

cents.  This  clerk who owns a car conveys  neighbours

who  work near his office or in the same office.  They

pay  him,  on  mutual agreement, $10 per  man,  which

means  that each of them will have to pay an  addition

of $2 per head. This is what I do not like, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2896</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is a taxi. Owners of taxis work on

day  and  night shifts. The majority of them use  five

gallons  of petrol per shift. An increase of 20  cents

in  the  price of petrol will mean an addition of  one

dollar  to the cost. As taxi drivers now earn  at  the

rate  of  $5 per shift, this will mean that they  will

lose  a dollar, thus reducing their actual earning  to

only  $4. How can they live on $4 a day at the present

time?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instead of imposing an additional tax on petrol

to  meet  part  of  the deficit  of  $8  million,  the

Government   should   concentrate   its   energy    on

encouraging  the establishment of industries  here  by

foreign  investors,  so that more employment  will  be

available  to  local citizens. With  more  employment,

more  money  will be in circulation. Instead,  we  are

told  by the Financial Secretary (column 2843), "Money

is tighter." Sir, it is obvious that foreign investors

can  only be induced to come here to set up industries

if the Government is in a position to assure them that

the  business and political climates here are  healthy

for  their  enterprises. If such  conditions  are  not

forthcoming in 1958, I am afraid there may be  even  a

larger deficit when the Financial Secretary makes  his

next  budget speech. Additional means of taxation  may

then have to be found to meet the deficit and probably

it  will  again be those who can least afford  it  who

will have to foot the bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point on industry. The Government

concentrates on having more industry in Singapore, but

the  industries have to pay company tax or income  tax

at the rate of 30 per cent. And we have export tax and

import tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> There is no import tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan:</b> We must bear these in mind. On

big   industries,  Sir,  the  Hon. the  Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry says, 'Oh, we have  a  few  of

these  industries  breaking down, but  we  have  small

industries coming up.' Sir, one must realise that if a

big  industry closes down we may have unemployment  of

300 persons. The small industries come up, and two  or

three of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2897</b></font><br><br>



them  may employ only about 100 people. So the balance

of  200 persons are still unemployed. The Minister for

Labour  and  Welfare is therefore  not  seeing  things

quite  clearly.  Also  each  unemployed  man  may   be

supporting a wife and child. I take the family to be a

small one. So, 200 unemployed each with a family of  a

wife  and  child - an addition of two - will mean  another

400  unemployed, making the total 600 instead of  only

200.  Sir,  this  is what I expect  the  Minister  for

Labour and Welfare should look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, income tax. An increase in taxation

may  be coming up. When the 1958 budget comes up,  the

Financial  Secretary  will  say,  'We  are  still   in

deficit.  We  have no money now. So we are  trying  to

find  some  way to meet the deficit.' That means  more

tax  will be coming up for the wage-earner. We are now

not  taxing  those  earning  $3,000  a  year  but  the

Government may think, 'Ah, we must do something to get

some money by fixing up a minimum of $25 income tax on

$3,000.' Who is going to suffer in the end? It is  the

lower income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I come now to the Financial

Secretary's remarks on Malayanisation. He said (column

2824):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... it is likely that actual expenditure in 1957

will amount to about $242 million. It should be noted,

however, that this total includes a sum of $9  million

in  respect  of  compensation under the Malayanisation

Scheme."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, Sir, I have no quarrel with the principle

of Malayanisation. In fact I am all in favour of it. I

voted for it.

But  what  I  do  not  like about one  aspect  of  the

operation  of the Malayanisation Scheme is  that  when

certain expatriate officers are upgraded they take the

opportunity  shortly thereafter to retire and  thereby

receive  higher Malayanisation benefits. I have  heard

of  certain senior police officers who, while on leave

abroad  8,000 miles away from Singapore, were promoted

to  higher  ranks. They came back from leave  to  fill

their higher appointments for just a few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2898</b></font><br><br>



months  and  thereafter elected to  retire  under  the

Malayanisation  scheme  with larger  retirement  sums.

This  business of being here today and there  tomorrow

should be stopped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the opposite Government Benches must realise

that  the  amount  we  have  for  payment  under   the

Malayanisation scheme comes out of public  money,  not

from  ourselves. We must look into this carefully  and

not allow expatriates to return from their leave after

being  promoted from grade one to special  grade,  and

then  to  retire. Otherwise where are we  to  get  the

money to pay them? It might cost more than $9 million,

the  figure stated in the Estimates. Sir, I would like

the  Government to look into this matter. We must stop

the practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Hon. the Financial Secretary in his last speech as  an

ex-officio  Member of this Assembly  has  taken  great

pains   in  supporting  his  arguments  for  increased

expenditure and consequent increased taxation. He  has

also  drawn a gloomy picture for the future. Sir,  not

only  he  but his predecessors have from time to  time

drawn  such pictures. I do think the picture  for  the

future  is  gloomy  when one looks  at  the  appalling

expenditure. Sir, be has raised matters in his  speech

with  regard to stability and so on. I would  like  to

touch on the speech he made the other day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the backbone of our income is the entrepot

trade. Now nearly 150 years old, Singapore, what it is

today, is built on entrepot trade. This life-blood  we

can  still preserve if we try but there are conditions

to  keep  this entrepot trade. First, Sir, is economic

stability.  Now,  Sir, economic stability  depends  on

political stability. An unstable government can  never

inspire   confidence  in  the  minds  of  the  public,

especially the investor, and unless there is a  stable

government, of the elected majority - I wonder  why  the

Nominated  Member Mr Thomas should laugh at this - this

is an acknowledged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2899</b></font><br><br>



fact  which  I  can  prove;  and  can  anyone

challenge  this fact, that unless there  is  a  stable

government with an elected majority of the people, the

government is not stable? Sir, I will deal  more  with

this subject a little later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, entrepot trade requires low handing charges.

Handling charges should be the lowest to preserve  and

compete  with  neighbouring countries  in  selling  or

transhipping  your goods, either imports  or  exports,

from  this territory. Now when I say handling  charges

it  means  lorry  and  boat hire, insurance,  overhead

charges,  profits and so on, plus cheap  labour.  Sir,

another  condition to preserve this state  is  a  free

trade  policy. We have heard time and time again  wild

talk of import duties or expectation of import duties,

and  of  luxury taxation (of course dead now, I hope).

Such  talk  keeps  the mind of the public  in  a  very

uncertain  state. There is a fear and trade  will  not

settle  down at its own proper level. If you  want  to

preserve the entrepot trade, free trade policy  should

go on as it is now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth thing is capital and labour. Sir, we

should  not  forget  that the  reason  why  Singapore,

originally  a  fishing village, is today a  prosperous

city  is  due  to  its entrepot trade.  In  the  first

instance,   capital  was  brought   by   the   British

merchants.  But capital could not do anything  without

labour,  and labour was brought from India and  China.

Capital  and labour worked hand in hand and  therefore

we  now  see a prosperous place. In other words,  Sir,

capital  and  labour,  in  the  peculiar  position  of

Singapore,  is  inter-dependent.  I  have  said   this

previously  and  I  repeat it again. Without  capital,

labour  cannot  exist. Capital can always  flow  in  a

favourable  climate. Therefore, in a place like  this,

we  should  see  that the capital is  there  and  that

labour is cooperating with capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say this. When I said that in the first

instance  the  British brought the capital,  I  should

also  say  that they have taken back to England  many,

many   times   more   of  what   they   brought   into

Singapore - through dividends, salaries,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2900</b></font><br><br>



pensions, banking, insurance, shipping, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a condition to preserve a state of racial and

class   harmony  demands  that  preaching  or   saying

anything which can create this racial or class  hatred

will  destroy  the economy of this city.  Can  we  get

capital  from abroad to come to this city if  we  have

wild  talk which does more harm than good? We do  know

that  we  want  capital.  No country  can  do  without

foreign capital. That is the position today in Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us, Sir, depend on our sound commonsense. Many

people  have brought in a lot of "isms", possibly  all

from  foreign countries. Now, Sir, Singapore  being  a

small  city, can we not form a policy taking the  best

of the two blocs for our economic purpose? I think the

politicians  should refrain from talking wild  slogans

unnecessarily,   which  will   ultimately   harm   the

masses - and our population is fast growing with  plenty

of unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another factor towards maintaining our entrepot

trade  is a low cost of living. Can we not reduce  our

cost  of living? Can we not formulate our policy  that

our  cost  of  living comes down?  Means  have  to  be

devised.  As  it stands today, the cost of  living  is

going higher and higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next thing is industry, after entrepot

trade. Many a time, politicians on the Government side

have  talked  about the development  of  industry  and

bringing in capital from foreign countries to  develop

industry  here.  Sir, this kind  of  bluff  serves  no

purpose  whatsoever. It might keep people busy  for  a

short  time but these false hopes will only  raise  or

create more unemployment and unrest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, how can industry survive unless these

conditions are fulfilled? - capital is necessary; there

should  be  cheap labour as in competing countries;  a

low  cost  of  living so that the  worker  can  remain

contented;  a  vast  hinterland for  markets  for  our

goods;  political  stability  which  can  satisfy  the

investor  that  his capital is safe;  cheap  power  to

reduce  our cost of production; low taxation; and  raw

material of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2901</b></font><br><br>



own (but this can be imported if the other factors are

present).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say here and now, Sir, it is on these factors

only  that  large industries can exist,  and  all  the

confusing and irresponsible talk will only cause  more

harm  than  good.  Have we these  conditions  here?  I

challenge  anyone to say that we have.  They  are  not

existing at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, take for granted that someone starts a

factory.  What  are  you going to do  with  the  goods

produced  at  high  cost? Can you sell  them?  If  you

cannot, then that industry has to close down. Then the

argument starts:

why  not  impose import duties to help this  industry?

Yes,  you can help in that way, but the reason against

it   is   this - that  you  are  preventing   your   own

Singaporeans  from  buying cheaper goods  manufactured

elsewhere in preference to his own goods, to meet  his

immediate  needs.  Another thing.  Sir -  if  you  have

import duty to preserve such an industry, then you are

selling your manufactured goods to your own people  at

a  very high price. The result will be this, that  you

will have to increase wages and salaries. It leads you

nowhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our population is growing. What is the solution

then? The only solution in the circumstances as we are

faced  today  is  to develop cottage  and  small-scale

industries  of which I spoke also at the  last  budget

sitting.   We  should  keep  the  families - wives   and

children - busy.  The creation of these industries  only

is  not sufficient - what is also very necessary is  to

foster them with loans, advances, marketing, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, people are blind to these and other

factors  when  they  talk  of  import  duties.   Those

countries having import duties are already large  with

vast  populations, and they do not depend on  entrepot

trade  only. We are not in that position; we  in  this

small territory are in a very peculiar position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, economic stability is very essential and I said

that it depends on political stability which can bring

confidence to the investor, businessman and worker.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2902</b></font><br><br>



What  have we seen since this present Government  came

into  power?-strikes, lock-outs, unrest, arrests, etc.

Can  this  bring  any confidence or stability  to  the

public mind? We are not better off even today. We  are

in  the  same  position. Government can  always  avoid

strikes by looking into the matter immediately.  If  a

strike  takes  place and is settled, it leaves  a  bad

taste  in  both  the  mouth of the  employer  and  the

employee.   Settlement  should  be  made  immediately,

before a strike develops. Sir, the masses should  also

understand that they should not be misled by the wrong

people. After all, they will be hitting themselves  by

this process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the short period of the Coalition Government

we  have  had two commissions of corruption appointed.

Can they bring stability to the minds of the public?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to expenditure, Sir, there should be very

rigid   control  of  expenditure,  both  capital   and

administrative.  Cut  down  extravagant   expenditure,

banquets and unnecessary travelling, and cut our  coat

according to our stature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one can compare our expenditure and income with

those of the Federation, our neighbour. The Federation

has a population four times bigger than Singapore. The

Federation  has  thousands of miles of territories  to

administer. They have an Emergency too. If you compare

it  with  our 220 odd square miles, you will see  that

our expenditure is definitely very high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an illustration I might mention conferences.

In previous years, Sir, Singapore was more politically

advanced than the Federation. When we were invited  to

conferences,  the  Federation  used  to  be  satisfied

either with briefing us or the United Kingdom chief of

the delegation, and thus avoid expenditure. Can we not

do  this  now wherever possible? After all  we  are  a

Colony  still and we are in a secondary position  with

no vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our cost of administration is the highest

compared with that of any other Asian territory.  Why?

Yes, our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2903</b></font><br><br>



standard  of  living is high, but  in  comparison  the

administration  cost is too high, and that  should  be

cut down wherever possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to taxation, the Hon. the Financial

Secretary  has  said  that the financial  position  is

sound.  If  so,  why  this  additional  taxation?  The

increase  in  tax  on  petrol and  diesel  oil  engine

vehicles will add to the difficulties and hardships of

the masses mostly, as taxis, lorries, buses and so  on

will  have  to  put up their fares. Who  will  be  the

losers?  It is the masses. They will have to bear  the

extra  cost, they will have to foot the bill. Besides,

it  will  harm our entrepot trade too. Your lighterage

and lorry charges will go up higher. You are making it

more  difficult for the entrepot trade because of this

higher cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Government, a fraction means nothing. I say a

fraction, in relation to our 1½ million population, is

very  much.  Sir,  I might quote here  a  part  of  an

editorial of the Singapore Standard:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a political party comes into power, it wishes

to  experiment with its political theories, and in the

course of such experiments the public are made to foot

the   bill,  however  unjustified  that  may  be.  The

Government must remember that Singapore must  be  able

to  earn enough to meet its expenditure, since  it  is

not   a   producing  territory.  Therefore,  political

experiments must not destroy world confidence in  this

entrepot, thereby affecting its trade and prosperity.

The  most  capable  of  Financial  Secretaries  cannot

perform   miracles   if  the  Government's   political

experiments  were  to drive away trade  and  kill  the

sources of revenue."



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member give the date of

issue of the newspaper?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thursday, 5th December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this view is shared by thousands of people

in  Singapore.  God alone can help if a  recession  in

trade  and  a  slump comes, as the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary has made a forecast of it. The best thing is

to  spend  as little as possible. No doubt  essentials

like  education  and health should be fully  supported

but  capital  costs  certainly can  be  reduced.  Sir,

compare the population of two or three years back with

that of today. It is not so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2904</b></font><br><br>



high and yet your expenditure has gone so high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last thing, Sir - in the Estimates I have not seen any

contributions to the Chinese Y.M.C.A., the Ramakrishna

Mission,  Sultan  Mosque and the  Young  Men's  Muslim

Association,  even though I understand  the  Financial

Secretary received requests for help. I will not  take

up  the  Assembly's time on this; I will take  up  the

matter at the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end I must only say this, that the

Coalition Government has failed, and failed miserably.



<br><br>10.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

once  again we meet in this House to debate the Second

Reading  of  the  Appropriation  Bill,  that  is   the

Estimates for next year. I consider that this work  is

more  or less routine and nothing else. Every year  at

the  end  of  November we come here and are  asked  to

approve   the   Budget  produced  by  the  Government.

Whatever amendments moved by the Opposition will serve

no  purpose.  I  have this morning received  about  60

amendments to the Budget, Sir, but I doubt how many of

them,  or  any  at all, will go through.  It  is  most

unlikely because every time when a vote is put to  the

House, the  Government  has the  majority,  with  the

support  of the ex-officios and Nominated Assemblymen.

I   may  then,  Sir,  call  elected  Members  of   the

Opposition as rubber stamps and nothing else. We  come

here  just to put our signatures to the Budget because

we  are part and parcel of that Budget as well. We are

partly responsible for its approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year the Hon. the Financial Secretary

presented us with Estimates which showed a deficit  of

$18.7  million. What is the result of that deficit  of

$18.7  million, Sir? May I quote column  2824  of  the

Financial Secretary's speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Turning now to expenditure, it will be remembered

that  the original estimate was $254 million,  and  it

will  be  seen  from  pages 15 and  16  of  the  Draft

Estimates that it is likely that actual expenditure in

1957 will amount to about $242 million [only, I add in

that  word].  It should be noted, however, that  this

total  includes  a  sum of $9 million  in  respect  of

compensation under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2905</b></font><br><br>



Malayanisation  Scheme [as quoted by the  hon.  Member

for  Kampong Kapor]. If this sum is excluded - it is,  I

think, a fair charge on surplus funds since it will be

recouped  by savings on expatriation pay and  passages

over  a  period of years - what might be called  normal'

expenditure  will amount to about $233 million  [only]

and  there will probably be a small surplus of revenue

over  actual  normal expenditure at  the  end  of  the

year."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Financial Secretary, actual

expenditure  is only $233 million, that  is  excluding

the    $9   million   for   compensation   under   the

Malayanisation scheme. Now if we add that $9  million,

it comes up to only $242 million. Taking the $233 into

consideration   compared  with  what  was   originally

estimated  at  $254 million, I now  see  that  we  are

actually having a surplus of $2 million, rather than a

deficit of $18.7 million as estimated by the Financial

Secretary last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if we take the $9 million into

consideration, we then actually have a deficit of only

$7  million,  and  not, may I emphasise  again,  $18.7

million. Sir, if we compare this figure quoted by ,the

Financial  Secretary with the $7 million, I  may  call

his  figure a fictitious one. The budget for next year

shows a substantial deficit of $35 million. Where  can

we get that money, Sir? I wonder whether the Financial

Secretary  will, when he comes before this House  next

year, say that the result will again be a surplus? May

I  quote what he has got to say, expecting that he may

say that by next year, in col. 2830:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The position therefore is that the estimate of

revenue  is  $242 million, the estimate of expenditure

is  $277  million, and we are faced with an  estimated

deficit of $35 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is what would this deficit be in the

event if no steps were taken to eliminate it. We  know

that,  in the past, expenditure has invariably  fallen

short  of  the  estimate and estimated  deficits  have

turned into substantial surpluses."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very substantial surpluses, I may say. Sir, I would

not  certainly employ the Financial Secretary  as  the

accountant  of my firm if earlier he had  predicted  a

deficit and then at the end of the year I found that I

had  a  surplus.  All  these figures  are  just  make-believe, just to misguide us -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2906</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is time I ought to

pull  up  the  hon.  Member for using  unparliamentary

language.  I  think he has used the  word  "misguide".

That word is unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I will stick to

my  original  word "make-believe". These  figures  are

just  make-believe, to show us that  there  should  be

some  form of taxation or increased taxation in  order

to meet this deficit of $35 million. Now it so happens

that  this  year  the Budget sittings happen  to  take

place  during  election month. We will be  having  the

City  Council  elections, and it is rather  surprising

that the Government has not got the courage to put  up

more taxation proposals, as they were expected to  do.

They  have  very  carefully chosen only  one  item - one

small item - and that is an increase of only 20 cents  a

gallon on petrol.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Very clever!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes, very clever, and it is the

contention of the Government that if it increases  the

duty  on  petrol, it will only soak the rich and  will

not  affect the poor, because only the rich can afford

to  own  cars. How can you expect poor people  to  own

cars?  But it is rather surprising, Sir, that we  have

so  many vehicles on the road today. I wonder if every

owner  of a vehicle that is on the road is in  fact  a

rich  man. Does the Government know that most  of  the

Government clerks also own cars? Are they rich  people

or are they working class people earning a few hundred

dollars  a  month?  I  leave  that  to  the  Financial

Secretary to answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary in his speech also said that

this  small  increase of 20 cents a gallon  on  petrol

will not affect the ordinary people at all. As I have

said,  it will only affect the rich. I will quote  his

speech again, Sir, in col. 2831.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This rate of $1 a gallon has been in force in the

Federation  since  November  of  last  year  and   its

imposition  is  unlikely  to  cause  any  hardship  in

Singapore. It has caused none in the Federation."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2907</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time the Government has something to say,

"Oh,  we  must follow the Federation. We must fall  in

line  with  the  Federation."  Why?  Why  cannot   the

Federation  for  once follow us rather  than  that  we

follow  the Federation? Let us set an example and  let

the  Federation follow us for once. I quote again  the

Financial Secretary:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new rate of duty will result in cars which do

20  miles to the gallon costing 1 cent a mile more  to

run.  Those which do 30 miles to the gallon will  cost

2/3rd  of  a cent a mile more to run, those  doing  40

miles  to  the gallon, ½ a cent more, and  so  on.  If

1,000 miles a month, or 30 miles a day, is taken as  a

fair  average  mileage for private cars in  Singapore.

cars  doing 20 miles per gallon will cost $10 a  month

more to run, . . . These additional sums can be of no

consequence to people who can afford to run  cars  for

pleasure...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what about those who cannot afford to run cars

for  pleasure?  What  about  the  clerks  working   in

Government offices, Sir? They do not own cars for  the

sake  of  running them for pleasure. They own cars  so

that  they  can  go to work. I quote  again  from  the

Financial Secretary's speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nor will the increase in duty be of much

consequence  to haulers. A round trip to  Penang  will

cost  about $10 more. I do not think that the increase

in  duty  will affect consumption. The number  of  new

cars, and the total number of cars registered, tend to

increase  each  year  and the  consumption  of  petrol

increases  accordingly. I doubt if the  increase  will

tend to make people use their cars less than they have

done in the past."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will certainly try to take shortcuts or walk, if

possible,  so  as to economise on petrol  consumption.

But  if I do not, Sir, it is going to cost me $10 more

a  month.  Is my employer going to pay me $10  more  a

month?  I do not know where to get the extra  $10.  My

income  will be the same as it is now. Where  can  the

Government  expect  me  to get that  extra  $10?  Beg,

borrow or steal? Is the Government trying to encourage

car  owners to try and beg, borrow or steal to get the

extra  $10  a month? I leave it again to the Financial

Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1956 Budget the petrol tax was increased by 5

cents.  That  was  a very small figure.  In  the  1957

Budget  the  Government said they had to increase  the

petrol tax again by another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2908</b></font><br><br>



7  cents,  just to meet the deficit. Now in  the  1958

Budget  all of a sudden there is a jump of  20  cents.

What will be the fate of the car owners then when  the

Financial Secretary puts up his 1959 Budget? Will  the

petrol  tax  go up by another 40 or 50 cents  or  even

more? The Financial Secretary might bear in mind  that

a  Member of the Assembly has suggested an increase of

50 cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has also increased the tax on

heavy  oil  engine vehicles, and again  the  Financial

Secretary has said that this will not affect  anybody.

Will  that not affect the bus companies? Not  the  car

owners,  but  the  bus companies? Now  who  travel  in

buses? Do the rich travel in buses? Are the owners  of

bus   companies  in  the  least  worried  about   this

increase? I doubt they are. Whatever increase  in  tax

they  have  to pay will ultimately fall  back  on  the

people  that  travel  in  their  buses.  If  the   bus

companies find that their budget cannot balance,  they

will  certainly  put  up  their  fares  to  meet   the

increased  expenses. Ultimately it will all come  back

to  those  who travel in buses. It is more or  less  a

merry-go-round. As the Member for Kampong Kapor  said,

it is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. I think that was

the phrase he used. It goes round and round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer, who is a businessman, has

said that we should have some stability in the country

rather  than an increase of taxation. Let us encourage

new industries. The Minister for Commerce and Industry

has  always tried to encourage more industries. He has

said that quite a number of small industries have been

established  during this year. That  might  have  been

correct, but the Member for Kampong Kapor has  pointed

out  that many big companies have closed down. I think

he  has quoted a figure of about 4,000 people who have

lost  their employment. Is that stability? I doubt  it

is.  Now let us encourage local industries so that  we

can  buy  local goods and we can have more  employment

for our own people here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2909</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next comment I wish to make on the Budget is the

creation of new posts. I went through the whole  Draft

Estimates - it  is so thick - and to my surprise  I  found

more than 1,300 new posts being created for next year.

Now  is  this  necessary? As I again went  through  it

carefully  I  found  most of  the  posts  overlap  one

another.  Is  that necessary, Sir? Cannot  we  try  to

economise on the money that will be spent on these new

posts?   It  is  rather  surprising,  Sir,  that   the

Financial Secretary in his speech gave no word at  all

about  the  creation of new posts which will  increase

government  expenditure. He  never  told  us  anything

about  it. That is one of the reasons for the deficit.

The Financial Secretary does not bother to mention the

1,300 new posts at all.

<b><br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b></b> Sir, I believe the Financial

<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The list of new posts is given as an

appendix  to  the  memorandum  which  accompanied  the

Estimates.

than  argue with the Financial Secretary! He is a  man

of  figures  and I am not, so I do not  think  I  will

argue with him!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to page 122 of the 1958 Draft

Estimates,  I find there is an increase in expenditure

in  the Police Department of roughly $600,000. For the

Police  Department,  this figure appears  to  be  very

small.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2910</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is developing

that  argument,  I suggest that that development  take

place in the Committee of Supply, when he comes to the

appropriate Head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker,

but  I  am  not trying to quote actual figures.  I  am

speaking on the policy of the Police Department  as  a

whole.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is exactly what the hon.

Member can do in the Committee of Supply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you, Sir, I will then

reserve that for the Committee of Supply. But  what  I

may  say,  Sir,  on  this subject  of  stability,  the

Government  has not taken steps to prevent riots  and,

as  has been mentioned by an hon. Member, kidnappings,

extortion,  burglaries and so  on.  In  the  Singapore

Standard  I find almost every day that they publish  a

special   column  on  the  first  page   showing   the

kidnappings,  thefts  and other crimes  in  Singapore.

Sir, where is the stability? Where is the security for

the people? If we are going to vote for more money, we

must have some form of security in return. If there is

no  security,  why should we vote for more  money  for

next  year? As law abiding citizens, I am sure all  of

us  expect to have freedom of movement either  in  the

day  or  at  night. But as it stands, I know  quite  a

number  of  people who are not prepared to go  out  at

night,  because  they are afraid of  being  kidnapped.

Then where is the security to the people? We must have

law and order. Unless we have law and order, there  is

no   stability  at  all.  The  Government   introduced

"Operation  Dagger" sometime ago, and  I  wonder  what

happened  to  that operation. No news has  been  heard

about it but I understand that it is still continuing.

Whether  it is really continuing is left to  be  seen.

Now if we have security, then we will achieve our goal

of having control over our internal security and self-government  will  come much earlier.  Unless  we  have

internal  security,  I  doubt if  we  can  have  self-government;  and  if  we cannot have  self-government,

when can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2911</b></font><br><br>



we  gain  independence?  So  let  the  Government  pay

particular  attention to this question of security  so

that we can have our independence. At the moment, Sir,

under  the  Defence and Security Council,  we  have  a

Member from the Federation presiding over us. In  that

Council  his casting vote will decide the  destiny  of

this  country. It is not we Singaporeans  who  are  to

decide  the destiny of our country. It is the  casting

vote  of  a  Member of the Federation, and  he  is  an

outsider  who has nothing to do with us;  or,  as  the

Tunku  said,  "We  do  not  want  you  at  all."   The

Federation  does  not want us. Why should  we  have  a

Member of the Federation to preside over this Council?

If  Government can provide security, then  we  do  not

need him at all and we will have our own people on the

Defence and Security Council. Let us then look forward

to self-government and independence. Majula Singapura!



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I had not

intended to speak so early in the debate, but  I  fear

that if I had to sit through another two hours of this

minor heckling, we might all go nuts before the debate

is  over. Quite frankly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  used  to

believe  that  when  we met the mobs  we  talked  more

nonsense than when we met the legislators. After  this

morning's  debate  I have decided that  we  talk  more

sense  when  we meet the mobs than when  we  meet  the

legislators of Singapore. I do not propose to touch on

the  remarks made by Members who sit on the same  side

of  the House as I do, because their approach to  this

problem has nothing in common with ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the last Labour Front

Budget  and  I think that it should not be allowed  to

pass  unnoticed. I remember the first Budget  when  it

came in with all the pomp and fury which we have since

learnt  to  associate with the ex-Member for Cairnhill

and the ex-Chief Minister. However, all that grandiose

talk  has left the Labour Front and this Party is  now

left  only with the tarnished gilt with which  it  was

once adorned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2912</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is in a quandary regarding this Budget.

Though we have no love for the Labour Front, we should

hate to see the Liberal-Socialist Party beat it at the

polls.  It is therefore our duty to see that, whatever

the  weaknesses and deficiencies of the  Labour  Front

Coalition  Government,  it  should  not  result  in  a

Liberal-Socialist victory at the City Council polls on

21st December, because we have been throwing stones at

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that has decided us to take a much more matter-of-fact approach to this Budget. It could have been

worse.  After  all, petrol has gone up  20  cents  and

nobody is going to be better off. The chances are that

nobody  is  going  to be much worse  off,  except  the

pirate taxi, drivers who will be seeing the Member for

Kampong Kapor, and the licensed taxi drivers who  will

come  and see the P.A.P., and we might have to  change

the  taxi meters. Instead of 40 cents showing  on  the

meter  when the flag comes down, we might have to  put

it  up to 50 cents. But I do not expect the economy of

Singapore  would  be  very  much  dislocated  on  that

account.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Lower the petrol tax first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But what really is alarming is the

carefree way in which the Financial Secretary has  put

forward  his  Budget  Estimates.  Those  who  have  to

contemplate  having  to  use  the  apparatus  of  this

government  one day must be dismayed at  the  complete

inefficiency of the Government departments  when  they

come  to  work out their estimates. This  is  not  the

fault  of  the  Labour Front. It is the fault  of  the

colonial  government machinery which the Labour  Front

has  to manipulate at the moment, and which succeeding

governments will also have to work. I think it is glib

to  the  point  of  dishonesty to put forward  figures

which the Financial Secretary knows-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow the expression

"glib to the point of dishonesty".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2913</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought if I

did  not  say  it  was  dishonest  it  would  not   be

objectionable. However, since you have ruled that that

is  not a complimentary way of expressing my thoughts,

I  will put it in this way: that it is an inept way of

handling  government finance. When  we  are  presented

with  a budget, we must be sure that every figure that

has  been  budgeted for is one which  that  department

intends  to  spend and can spend. If  that  department

cannot spend it, then let it say in the remarks column

that this was an amount which would have been budgeted

for  if  it  could have spent it, but as it could  not

spend  it,  it  was therefore not budgeting  for  this

figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1957 Budget estimate for revenue was $235.9

million.  The  actual revenue is now  expected  to  be

$235.7.  There  is  quite a drop  in  the  Income  Tax

collection  although there have  been  some  gains  in

other   directions.  The  1957  Budget  estimate   for

expenditure   was  $254  million,   but   the   actual

expenditure is $241 million, including $9 million  for

abolition terms to expatriates. In other words, if  we

knock off the $9 million to expatriates, which was not

budgeted  for  in the 1957 Budget, then we  have  $232

million, i.e.  $22 million short in expenditure.  The 1958 Budget estimate for expenditure is $277 million,

i.e. a rise of $23 million on last year's estimate  of

$254  million. Then this very glib, this real  sleight

of hand on page-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member should

choose his words a little more carefully. "Sleight  of

hand", I think, is unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I do not know what they call

a clever company promoter who presents a prospectus in

such  a  way that everything appears to be all  right.

These  slick  company  promoters  are  very  good   at

presenting  figures,  but I should  have  thought  the

Financial Secretary would at least have allowed us  to

see the movement as he folds the handkerchief from his

sleeve  and then make sure that he says that there  is

nothing in it before he puts it back. He says:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2914</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no formula which indicates what actual

expenditure will be. We make our estimate in the light

of  past experience and results and anticipated future

requirements and capacity. We know that, for the  past

two years, actual recurrent expenditure has tended  to

increase on the average by about $18 million  a  year.

In  this connection, I invite attention to the  tables

which  were  given in the Memorandum which accompanied

the Draft Estimates. It seems likely that this rate of

increase  will be maintained in 1958. If  that  should

prove  to  be the case, actual expenditure,  excluding

any  compensation  in respect of Malayanisation  which

may  have to be brought to account, should be  of  the

order of $250 million."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, having gone to the trouble of

working  out  the  estimate  for  each  item  in  this

voluminous Budget, he says, "Well, actually  all  this

is a lot of rubbish. Do not believe it. The way we are

going  to  budget  is this: last year  we  spent  $241

million - never mind about what we said we were going to

spend - we spent $241 million. From our past experience,

not based on any length of time, but based on the last

two   years,  we  found  that  expenditure   kept   on

increasing by $18 million a year. In 1955 and 1956  it

went up by a few million dollars; in 1957 and 1958  it

went up by $18 million. So let us forget all about it.

It  is all rubbish. Plus another $18 million, that  is

the  way to work out the Budget - $241 million plus $18

million. But knock off $9 million first, that makes it

$232  million.  Then  plus $18 million.  That  is  the

figure  we  should have budgeted for." Sir,  then  why

present  it?  Why  are  we  not  told  that  for  each

individual   item  we  are  going  to   approve   this

expenditure?  Let  this be said honestly  and  plainly

against  each individual item, if this is supposed  to

be  a  serious Budget: "This is what we hope to spend.

Our  intentions  are  good  intentions.  This  is  our

capacity." And then we will know what we are  passing.

As  it is, we have all these good intentions here  and

the  Financial Secretary has the audacity to  come  to

this  House and say, "Well, I do not know how all this

is  going  to work out. I take last year's  figure  of

$241  million, minus $9 million for expatriates, which

really should not be in the Budget. It is one of those

sudden  capital losses which we will have to bear.  So

it  is $232 million plus $18 million - $250 million. The

revenue,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2915</b></font><br><br>



if  it goes on unchanged, and if none of the rates  of

taxation  change,  will be $242  million.  Therefore,"

says  the Financial Secretary, "let us find where  the

$8  million  is  going  to come  from."  I  quote  the

Financial Secretary:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If that should prove to be the case, actual

expenditure, excluding any compensation in respect  of

Malayanisation  which  may have  to  be  brought  into

account,  should be of the order of $250  million.  In

the  circumstances,  assuming  that  the  estimate  of

revenue  is  achieved, it is possible that the  actual

deficit  would  be of the order of $8  million,"-



<br><br>and these are the operative words



<br><br>"and  it is this sum which we must endeavour to cover

by means of additional taxation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a rebuke to the Labour Front

Ministers  or  of  the U.M.N.O. Minister.  We  do  not

expect  them  to come into power and bring  their  own

apparatus  of  state with them. The democratic  system

does  not work that way. Political Parties compete  on

political   policy,  not  on  the   effectiveness   of

political bureaucracy. What is alarming is that we may

be saddled with a machinery of state which cannot tell

us  at the end of each year what exactly happened last

year  and  what we can do for next year. The Financial

Secretary -  next  year it will  be  the  Minister  for

Finance elected by the people - will have to come  again

to  this  House  and say, "Well, gentlemen....".

Having  heard  some of the speeches  this  morning,  I

think  "gentlemen" is to too kind a word. But if  next

year  we have the same kind of legislators as we  have

had in the last two years, then I say they deserve the

kind  of figures they will again get next year.  I  do

not  see how, unless we have a real shake, up  in  the

civil  service  administration,  we  can  improve  the

situation.  The instruments of policy  are  blunt  and

ineffective,  and  whoever has to  use  them  must  be

dismayed at the prospect of not being able to  sharpen

them  in  the  space of time that is left for  popular

democracy to operate effectively in this part  of  the

world.  We view the position in South-east Asia  as  a

whole.   I   would   like  Members  of   this   House,

particularly  the Member for Queenstown - he  reads  the

Singapore Standard (I myself never read that rag)  but

nevertheless if he wants to torment himself by reading

it  every  morning,  especially  the  thefts  and  the

kidnapping column, then let



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2916</b></font><br><br>



him  do  so. But I would like him to look at  what  is

happening in some other parts of the world. We have to

view  our  position from the context of the  whole  of

South-east Asia. We want to escape the fate  that  has

befallen  some  of the other countries  in  South-east

Asia,  because  they  also  took  over  from  colonial

regimes  which were effete and ineffective  and  which

packed up because they were effete and ineffective. So

we  have  to  consider seriously how we are  going  to

sharpen  those instruments of policy, because  whoever

comes   in   will  have  to  work  through  the   same

bureaucratic  machinery. Without  any  slight  at  our

newly-promoted   Permanent   Secretaries,   let   them

remember  this: that their pensions and  their  future

depend   upon  the  bureaucracy  being  an   effective

bureaucracy. If it is not an effective bureaucracy, it

is  not just the politicians who will be going.  They,

the Permanent Secretaries, themselves will also go  to

the  limbo of all forgotten men, and the whole society

will  be  swept away and a new dictatorship will  take

its place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot allow this Budget to go without making

some  reference to the expatriates. They are  a  much-abused and maligned group of people, but I think  they

deserve  every bit of the abuse that has  been  heaped

upon  them.  But  today I do not intend  to  join  the

Member  for  Kampong Kapor - I have a  sneaking  feeling

that   somebody   else  wrote  his  speech   for   him

[Interruption]. I am quite sure the P.A.P. would  not

be involved in such a nefarious scheme as to write the

speech  for the Member for Kampong Kapor. We say  what

we  think openly and frankly. We do not seek  to  hide

our  views  under the cover of the Member for  Kampong

Kapor.  But  I would like to have this thrown  at  the

Financial Secretary. He said last year they spent - this

is  another  one  of those glib things - $9  million  on

expatriate compensation. "It is well worth  it.  There

will  be savings in allowances and all kinds of things

when  we  get rid of the expatriates." Now they  agree

with  us  that there will be savings. But the rate  of

compensation and the rate of savings - let us work  them

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$9 million was paid out last year. The expatriate

allowance budgeted for the next year is $1.04 million.

This year it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2917</b></font><br><br>



is $1.42. In other words, the saving is $0.38 million,

i.e. $380,000. It looks as if it will take 30 years to

recover this $9 million. When I was talking about this

to  an  accountant, he said, "Ah, yes, but you  cannot

have $9 million and not pay interest." Now, if we  add

interest and we calculate the interest running  on  $9

million - I  will not go through the laborious  counting

process - I am told the $9 million will not be recovered

in less than a generation. So $9 million has gone down

the  drain and we are saving $380,000 a year.  We  are

not likely to recover in one generation the $9 million

if  we  have to pay interest, as we have to, according

to the accountant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$21 million - that is the total we have to pay for

Malayanisation. If $21 million were paid out all of  a

sudden,  then  we  would have to wait  till  the  next

century  to  recover it at the rate we are  recovering

the  $9  million. Something has gone wrong  somewhere.

This  is  the gloomiest prospect of them all which  we

will have to consider one of these days; doing to  the

Chartered  Bank and Hong Kong and Shanghai  Bank  what

they have been doing in Djakarta, and that is to put a

banner  up at these two establishments and say, "Taken

over  by  the people of Singapore in order to pay  for

the   compensation  terms  that   we   paid   to   the

expatriates." Because $21 million plus interest - to  be

recovered  at  the rate of $380,000 on $9 million - will

take  two  centuries to recover. The right way  to  do

this is to write the whole thing off. But, however,  I

do not want to alarm any foreign capital away because-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> You will not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, we will not. We would be

able - and let us put it bluntly and simply - to tell them

exactly  where  they stood, and they would  know  that

what  we  say  we mean. The first thing the  political

Parties, particularly the political leadership in this

country,  have to learn is this: do not bluff anybody.

You cannot bluff people more than once. The best thing

to  do is to tell them what is in your mind before you

do it. Tell the electorate quite clearly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2918</b></font><br><br>



and frankly what you intend to do before they vote you

in,  so  that there is no danger of your early  demise

six  months after election, because you cannot do what

you  said  you were going to do. Having got  in,  tell

your  opponents exactly where they stand, particularly

vested  interests, so that they will know how to  plan

in  order to recoup what they hope to invest  in  this

country. If you can assure them that you say what  you

mean and they work on that basis, then let me tell the

Nominated  Member  Mr Sutherland, even  he  would  be

pleased to deal with the P.A.P. Government because  he

would  know  when to hop it in time. With  the  Labour

Front Government or a Liberal-Socialist Government, he

might be caught napping.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Never!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Has the hon. Member booked his

airplane ticket yet?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is what we think of the extra

$9  million on expatriates, Sir, It is a shocking  way

to  work  this  Budget  and we should  not  have  been

bothered with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now about taxation. Sir, no one is more conscious

than the P.A.P. of the limitations on fiscal policy in

Singapore  as  a result of the peculiar  economic  and

political   situation  of  Singapore   vis-a-vis   the

Federation  of Malaya. To those in the Federation  who

are  not so conversant with political leaders  or  so-called  political  heroes in Singapore  and  political

stars,  let  me say this: what was said by the  Member

for  Queenstown  is not what the people  of  Singapore

say. If the Member for Queenstown does not believe it,

then  I  will  invite him to attend  the  next  P.A.P.

rally - he  is  not  here, but nevertheless  let  it  be

conveyed  to him that the people of Singapore  do  not

share his opinion. It is because of the stupidity  and

the  irresponsibility  of opportunist  politicians  in

Singapore  that,  from time to time, silly  statements

are made which not only do themselves a lot of harm - we

like  to  see  them  heap  more  and  more  harm   and

humiliation upon themselves - but which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2919</b></font><br><br>



might  adversely  affect temper  and  feeling  between

large  groups  of people who may not be aware  of  the

unworthiness  of  the source of these  statements.  We

understand  these  limitations on  fiscal  policy  and

therefore I do not wish to ask awkward questions like,

"Why  was  not company tax put up to recover  this  $8

million deficit? Why on petrol? But, anyway, it has to

be  done on petrol, but why not company tax first? Why

not income tax, why not a lot of other things?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were further alarmed at the light-hearted

way  in which the Financial Secretary said, "Oh, well,

the  Income Tax Department has not collected its  full

quota because it lost a few expert Europeans." One  or

two  of  them pocketed a large sum of money  and  then

switched  round to the Telephone Board and climbed  on

to  another  cushy  and  comfortable  job.  All  these

personal  things aside, we do not understand why  only

$65  million is expected to be collected next year.  I

am not an expert on Income Tax figures, Sir, but I put

forward  this  proposition as one which is  sound  and

reasonable  and  one  which  I  think  merits  serious

consideration in this House. Everybody knows that  tax

evasion  goes  on  everywhere in the world.  In  fact.

great  democracies like America, when they cannot  get

kidnappers  for  kidnapping, get them for  income  tax

evasion.  The  Income Tax people here should  look  up

these  things. They might be able to profit  from  the

American system. If you cannot get our local Al Capone

for kidnapping Tan Lark Sye's nephew, then get him for

dodging the income tax or do something about it.  Here

are figures which, in my estimation, prove that if  we

have a tough and efficient Income Tax Department,  not

less  than  $100  million should be collected  on  the

present  rates.  Sir, the figures  are  quite  useful.

There are no less than 12,300 employers-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether a

detailed  argument  of  this  nature  should  not   be

properly pursued in the Committee of Supply. The  hon.

Member  can, of course, touch on the subject, but  not

in detail.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What I am intending to do is to

give an illustration of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2920</b></font><br><br>



the  ineffectiveness of the instruments of  policy  of

the  state of Singapore. Here is an example  where  we

have  a  machine which did not do its job. If  it  had

done  its  job, there would have been an  increase  of

revenue  in this country of no less than 35 per  cent.

The  figures  to support this proposition briefly  are

these.  There are 12,300 employers, according  to  the 1955 Annual  Report of Singapore, and these  are  the

profit   figures  published  by  some  companies   and

distributed by them in 1956. They are big employers,

Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal Dispensary Ltd.-20 per cent-$200,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fraser & Neave-25 per cent- $2,025,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gammon (Malaya) Ltd.-20 per cent-$780,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Jacks & Company (Malaya) Ltd.-40 per

cent-$2,400,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this distributed in one year--1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayan Breweries Ltd.-31 per cent-$3,960,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overseas Chinese Bank-20 per cent-$3 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson & Company Ltd.-22 per cent---$880,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straits Trading Ltd.-17½ per cent-$1,! 75,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Engineers-15 per cent- $1,043,700.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearne Brothers Ltd.-30 per cent-$2,400,900.



<br><br>We  can  go on, although there are companies like  the

Chartered  Bank  which  do not publish  their  figures

here,   so  we  do  not  know  what  they  distributed

[Interruption]. I do not know what that  was  supposed

to  mean  unless Mr Sutherland is quite  prepared  to

tell  me that he pays no less than 30 per cent,  shall

we say - for an average efficient European company?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member addressed the

Chair, he would not have seen Mr Sutherland, but I do

urge  that possibly the hon. Member is going too  much

into detail because the Standing Order itself says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The debate on the motion for the second reading of

the  Bill  shall be confined to the general principles

of Government policy and administration ...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2921</b></font><br><br>



And the argument that the hon. Member is developing, I

think,  could  best be developed in the  Committee  of

Supply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We are just indicating, Mr

Speaker, Sir, as a matter of general government policy

that  if and when the P.A.P. runs this government, we

shall  see  that  the Income Tax Department  does  its

duty.  The way to do it is the way it is done  in  all

civilized  countries. If you think that Mr  Goldsmith

has  not  been paying his tax, then judging  from  the

number  of  cars and the number of diamond  solitaires

his wife exhibits, you just put in an estimate of what

you think he ought to pay and let him disprove it.  If

he  pays  it, next year double the estimate; then  let

him  disprove it. If he pays again, quadruple it,  and

so  we  go on until we make everybody in the community

pay their fair share of taxation or become barrow-boys

or  hawkers, in which case they do not have to pay any

taxes  at all. It might well be, as a result  of  just

rounding  off this computation, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  at

12,300  employers, as I said, on the mean  average  of

$50,000 chargeable profits, that ought to bring $8,630

per  employer, which means $106,149,000 per year  just

from  employers alone. I could develop this  argument,

and  I  will, all about this property tax both in  the

city  area  and  the Rural Board. But  a  conservative

estimate  of what could be collected on present  rates

is  somewhere in the region of $128 million per  year;

in  other  words, double what the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary estimates for next year. The tragedy of  the

situation  is this, that although this is what  should

be  the  case, what, ever Government comes into  power

next  year  it will be saddled with the same apparatus

with  which  to  extract the tax.  Unless  we  have  a

ruthless Minister for Finance who will deal with inept

and  bureaucratic civil servants and will improve  the

running of the machinery of state, we will be back  in

the same position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to wind up, it is only fair to say that the

Budget  could have been worse. The Labour  Front  took

the easiest course out for its last year of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2922</b></font><br><br>



office. It has forgotten all the big paper promises. I

remember  the  first Budget debate when there  was  at

least a spirited defence. Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated)

reminded  the P.A.P. that this was a four-year  Labour

Front  programme and that it was only  one-quarter  of

the  way. Now this is the last year of three years and

it  has  given  up  trying  to  pretend  that  it  can

implement them. It cannot. That is one of the  reasons

why  it  will  be  in the soup in the next  elections,

because it could not implement the programme on  which

it  got  elected. It said all kinds of foolish  things

and I hope that all other political Parties and would be politicians will benefit from this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Including you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed I have. I have taken this

very  much  into account and the P.A.P. programme  for

the  next elections will be a programme which will  be

implemented  after the elections. But  there  was  one

politician who I see is still running around the place

like  a mad dog and he has not learned from all  this;

he  has  started a new Party. He wants  to  start  the

concertina  all over again - try again with a  big  high

bid  and wind up once more in the gutter. Sir, I  send

out   my  formal  condolences  to  the  Labour   Front

Ministers opposite. Theirs is a very unhappy  position

and I have to tender to them my formal sympathies. But

I  hope that they have served a useful purpose if only

to be an example to all political leaders in Malaya of

how  not  to win the elections and how not  to  run  a

government.



<br><br>11.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

quite  unusual in the debate on this important  Budget

that,  except for the leader of the P.A.P., the  other

speakers are Independents. I must confess that I  have

never  listened to the speeches of the leader  of  the

P.A.P., the Member for Tanjong Pagar, so carefully  as

today.  I  think we must congratulate him in  that  at

last, with God's blessing, he realises that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2923</b></font><br><br>



responsibility lies on his shoulders, and  the  advice

which  he  has given to this House I should  recommend

sincerely to the P.A.P. itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for Members to argue with statistics and

figures is, I think, a waste of time. I wish to recall

the  remarks and recommendations which I made  to  the

Government  in  last year's Budget debate.  We  should

adopt an old Chinese saying: "Open more fountains  and

restrict  the outflow." In other words, we should  try

to find more sources to collect money and restrict the

spending  of  money. I do not oppose the principle  of

taxation.  I was not surprised at all when the  Member

for  Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng) said that  we  are

taxing   the  poor  but  I   am  surprised  that   the

Government has not the courage to impose new taxes  on

companies, which means taxing the rich. Sir, it  shows

a  lack  of  confidence  in  the  prosperity  of  this

country.  If this country's prosperity can be assured,

then the Hon. the Financial Secretary be the first one

to try to get money from that source.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not satisfied with the argument which is

put  up  that the reason why the Government refuse  to

increase  the  company  tax is because  they  want  to

attract  foreign investment. Sir, I cannot  deny  that

that  is  partly  the reason but  how  can  we  expect

foreign  investment when we are faced today with  such

instability - politically  and socially?  Therefore  the

fundamental remedy to solve this problem is  to  bring

stability to this colony. The Member for Tanjong Pagar

said  that  he  was not playing party politics  but  I

would like to point out that even on the first page of

this  Budget the phrase "Colony of Singapore" appears

and  the  P.A.P. leader went on to  attack  it  as  a

colonial Budget. Yes, it is a colonial Budget. What is

wrong with that? Such an outlook shows that we are not

approaching the problem seriously and practically.  He

still plays a great part in politics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2924</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my views are these: first of all, the

Government   has  failed  to  increase  company   tax;

secondly,  the  Government has  refused  to  heed  the

public  demand to increase the parental allowances  on

personal  relief. All that shows that  the  future  of

Singapore is not very bright.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, the Member for Queens-town mentioned

kidnappings  and  extortions in  connection  with  the

stability  of this country. I wish to add  it  is  not

only  the  rich who are affected; pupils, hawkers  and

dance  hostesses  are in the grip of  gangsters.  They

must pay a monthly rate of extortion or protection fee

to  certain groups of gangsters. So I wonder why, with

all  the  power  in  his hands,  the  Chief  Secretary

considers  that  the Preservation of  Public  Security

Ordinance   should  only  apply  to  those   who   are

subversive  elements but not to gangsters.  Since  the

implementation  of  the  Citizenship  Bill,  does  the

Banishment Ordinance still serve any purpose?  I  hope

that  the Chief Secretary and the Government will take

all  this  into consideration. The stability  of  this

country is in their hands, and if they want to attract

foreign investment, the stability of society is, first

and   foremost,   important,  and   not   merely   the

maintenance of a low rate of company tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary said that the

complicated education problem has at last been solved.

Sir,  to  me, it is still not solved but only halfway.

Some days ago I read - I cannot remember which paper  it

was - that two parents were arguing in a market. One  of

them  asked, "To which school do you want to send your

children?" The other one said. "No, I will not send my

children to any school." The former asked, "Why?"  The

answer  was, "If I send John to an English school,  he

is  bound to be a delinquent. If I send Mary to a high

school,  she  is  going  to be a subversive  element."

That, of course, cannot be a true picture, but if that

is  part  of  public opinion, then it shows  that  the

people  have no faith and have lost confidence in  our

education system for which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2925</b></font><br><br>



we  provide and spend so much money. Sir, I would like

the  Hon. the Minister for Education to consider  this

question: how is he going to solve the problem of  the

over-age  students who are thrown out from Standard  V

and  the  many more we expect from the Chinese  Junior

middle schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the hon. Member will

agree that that question could best be answered in the

Committee of Supply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am just on

the  problem  of  education. The  Hon. the  Financial

Secretary  has said that the problem has been  settled

but to me it is only half-way solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to touch on the subject of expenditure

on  the Defence Services. All of us have to work under

the  constitution and the constitution, whether it  is

the  Rendel Constitution or the one which is proposed,

clearly states that defence is solely in the hands  of

the  British  Government. Yet we are  now  to  have  a

battalion  and a navy. Sir, I would like to  ask  this

question. Is it necessary, in this new age of sputniks

and the hydrogen bomb, to be talking about defence  in

the   form  of  creating  new  battalions,  purchasing

minesweepers and bolstering up our military forces  to

protect our soil? Sir, I want to ask another question.

Is  there anyone in this House who opposes or does hot

believe   in   the  stand  taken  at  the   Afro-Asian

Conference  held  in  Bandung that Afro-Asian  nations

should  unite into a solid front and should  stop  and

oppose  any form of war through the banning of nuclear

weapons?  Therefore  from which prospective  enemy  of

this  country  can  we  expect an  attack?  With  full

confidence and full support in a lasting peace for the

whole  world, there is then no necessity for  building

up  a  defence force to defend our territory. That  is

the first argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument is: for whom is this defence

necessary? We cannot deny that we are a chain  in  the

British  Commonwealth defence strategy. But we  are  a

small island, just only 224



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2926</b></font><br><br>



square  miles,  with  a population  of  just  over  1¼

million. And when we say that we must have a navy,  an

army-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not like interrupting so

frequently but I am doing so today because I  have  to

remind hon. Members that we have only one day for  the

debate  on the Second Reading, and the debate must  be

confined to general principles. Details of the Defence

Services  can  always be debated in the  Committee  of

Supply  and there is time allotted for that debate.  I

would  ask the hon. Member then to confine himself  to

general principles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. Therefore, I

strongly suggest that the expenditure shown under  the

Head  of  Defence  Services should,  if  possible,  be

scrapped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us come to commerce and industry. We are

very  happy  to  have  such an  able  and  experienced

businessman  as Minister for Commerce and Industry.  I

would like to touch on the expansion and promotion  of

trade  and  industry. I deeply regret that the  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  is not here.  I  think  he  could

contribute  a great deal more, instead  of  a  lot  of

rubbish talk, if he were to advise the mass of workers

who follow him to increase the output of industry, and

not to demand higher wages only, because if the output

of  industry  can  be  increased, it  will  indirectly

increase  the  national output. If we are  faced  with

high wages and low production, how can we compete with

our  neighbouring countries like Hong Kong  and  Japan

which  are  highly industrialised? If any  leaders  of

workers are in the gallery, I would say, "Please,  for

the sake of the country, do let us-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is now

playing to the gallery. I would ask the hon. Member to

address his remarks to the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I said that if there are

any  leaders  of  workers in the gallery,  I  wish  to

remind them to advise the workers sincerely and  truly

to   increase   the  industrial  output   which   will

indirectly  increase  the national  output.  Then  the

stability of our country can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2927</b></font><br><br>



be  assured and the Government - any government, even  a

P.A.P. government - can  carry   on   smoothly   with

industrialisation  and to achieve our  ultimate  aim - a

welfare state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to point this out. I regret that under

the  Development Estimates, I fail to trace  any  plan

for the development of the fishing industry. I wish to

go into details on this at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the Ministry of Local Government,

Lands  and Housing. We are very happy to look  at  the

report   that   the  rural  residents,   farmers   and

fishermen,  who are producing more food and increasing

the export of eggs and poultry (which brings a lot  of

income to this country), should be encouraged. I  hope

that  the  Minister  for Local Government,  Lands  and

Housing will help the farmers and fishermen to enjoy a

certain security of tenure of land, because the Master

Plan  and private building developments involve  them

in great difficulties. The resettlement plan should be

a long-term policy in order to ensure that the farmers

will not only be able to maintain their livelihood but

also to produce more food for this country.



<br><br>11.55 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

colleagues  of  the Liberal-Socialist  Party  will  be

covering  many of our grounds of dissatisfaction  with

the policies and performances of the Government, and I

will therefore limit myself to a few comments. I hope,

Sir, that I shall have permission to quote a few facts

and  figures  to  substantiate  the  arguments  I  put

forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of our greatest causes for dissatisfaction

is  the Government's failure to expand industry  which

is   essential  if  we  are  to  absorb  our   growing

population in employment. It is a subject on which the

Hon. the  Financial Secretary was  almost  completely

silent,  as  might be expected, as he could  have  had

nothing  good to say. The only reference he  did  make

was  indirectly  through the  mention  of  income  tax

returns:  $68  million  was  collected  in  1956;  $65

million  is  the  anticipated sum for  1957,  and  the

amount budgeted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2928</b></font><br><br>



for  in  1958 is again $65 million, despite  the  fact

that  personal income tax was increased last year from

30  per  cent  to 40 per cent. Those,  I  submit,  are

confessions  of  failure by the Government  to  expand

industry because if industry had expanded, it would be

reflected in income tax revenues. But there are  other

barometers  to indicate this. While our population  is

increasing  by 50,000 a year from 940,000 in  1947  to

1,463,000  estimated in 1957, the number of  labourers

employed in manufacturing dropped from 57,332 in March

1956  to  55,011  in March 1957 and in all  industries

from 124,645 to 123,263 in the same period. Since  the

general elections, 125,000 roughly have been added  to

the population, and yet less are employed in industry.

That   is   the   Government's  record.  In   existing

industries, to take only two examples, the manufacture

of  biscuits  has dropped from 196,000  cwt, for  the

period  January to September 1956 to 136,000 cwt, for

the  same  period in this year. Production  of  rubber

sheeting has dropped from 277,000 lbs, from January to

September 1954 to 112,000 last year and 79,000 for the

same  period in this year - a drop of something like  60

per  cent.  I  mention these points  in  view  of  the

Financial  Secretary's  statement  that  an  excellent

understanding  had  been reached with  the  Federation

Government  and  that  there  has  been  a  return  of

confidence   in   the   future  of   Singapore-unusual

exaggeration   for   a   usually  cautious   Financial

Secretary  to  make. The fact of the  matter  is  that

hardly   a   single  new  major  industry   has   been

established and developed in Singapore in the  2½ years

of  the Government's life; hardly a single big factory

of any consequence has been opened. When questioned in

this House or by newspaper reporters, the Minister for

Commerce  and  Industry has always hinted mysteriously

at  large  developments impending and behind-the-scene

negotiations  with  large  industrial  concerns  which

cannot be disclosed, but nothing concrete has emerged.

In the Governor's speech on 22nd April, 1955, when the

present Government first announced its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2929</b></font><br><br>



policy, it was stated that it would be "the policy  of

the  Government to encourage in all practical ways the

development of local industries". On 29th June of  the

same year, I asked:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What plans the Government has in view for the

carrying out of its declared aim of attracting private

capital from both local and overseas investors for the

purpose of expanding trade and industry."



<br><br>I obtained from the Minister the reply:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...assistance in the industrial and commercial

fields  is  taking the form of attention to individual

applications on their merits..."-



<br><br>an extremely nebulous answer. In November 1955, in the

debate  on  the  Second Reading of  the  Appropriation

Bill - two years ago - I said that I had hoped in vain  to

hear that the Government-



<br><br>"will  carry  out its declared policy  of  encouraging

investment,  both locally and from overseas,  by  such

methods  as allowing income tax relief's, both initial

and  annual,  on the cost of factory construction  and

initial plant and ensuring that such construction goes

ahead with the least possible administrative delay."



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member identify that

passage?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Yes, Sir. Col. 988 of Vol. 1, No. 19.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite my own enquiries in this House at intervals

during  the past 2½ weary and fruitless years,  there

has  been  no firm policy laid down and announced  to

the  world  regarding tax exemptions or relief's  for

new   industries  or  new  factories  or  on  capital

equipment.  A week ago, the Minister announced  in  a

feeble  bleat that industrial concerns can apply  for

exemptions-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that the words "feeble

bleat" are probably unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, that is uncomplimentary to the

Minister  and it was of course not intended to  be  so

but I will perhaps reduce it to a "whisper".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2930</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> He said that each application would be

considered  on  its merits but that legislation  would

have  to  be  introduced before concessions  could  be

granted - 2½  years, and the Government is still  toying

with   the   measure  we  advocated  in  our  election

manifesto  three  years  ago.  That  is  the  sort  of

announcement   expected   of   run-of-the-mill   civil

servants  trained  in  caution and  the  avoidance  of

decisions,  not  the  trumpet blast  of  the  Minister

determined   to   tackle  with   energy,   drive   and

imagination one of the most urgent problems  affecting

this country's welfare. But the Government machine  is

tired  and  worn  out;  it never  had  much  drive  or

efficiency  but now it has run down and lost  so  much

confidence  in itself that some of the Ministers  have

to go off on various pretexts to Tokyo or Delhi, while

those  who remained behind threw themselves  into  the

arms of the P.A.P. to get them to fight their election

battles  for them. And so, Sir, there is no sign  from

the Financial Secretary's speech or from the Estimates

of  any  sign of improvement on the industrial horizon

during the life of the present Government, nor have we

found,  in  turning the pages of the  Estimates,  that

there  is any sign of important decisions in any other

direction.  Commissions and experts  have  come,  made

their reports and gone at enormous public expense, but

nothing  has  been  implemented.  The  unified  public

transport system, free legal aid, minimum standards of

living,   Singapore's  port,  television,  a   housing

authority,  the drive against tuberculosis,  a  public

corporation  for  broadcasting,  the  results   of   a

Commission  to investigate corruption - all  these  are

empty  promises or paper proposals or recommendations,

and  nothing  is done. The Minister for Communications

and Works in weary cynicism has said that he no longer

trusts  experts because experts always differ. So  the

Government  which  is  barren  of  ideas  of  its  own

mistrusts  the  ideas which it pays highly  at  public

expense  for  experts to supply.  An  example  of  the

inefficiency  of the Government is the fact  that  the

present session has been allowed to run on from August

1956 beyond the usual period of a year to January 1958

presumably in the hope that something will turn up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2931</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government expects bouquets for two reasons.

Firstly,   it  has  through  a  firm  policy   towards

subversive  elements  removed an  immediate  Communist

threat  to Singapore. We have supported the Government

stand but we would remind the opposite side that it is

only  a negative policy. While stamping out subversion

on  the  one  hand,  what  has  been  done  to  create

conditions  which will make Communism impossible?  Not

only  do we need more industries for our young people,

but  more  secondary and technical education to  train

them  for industry, and cheap housing for them to live

in,  but  what  do  we  find? - employment  in  industry

declining,  as  I  have  already  quoted,   only   one

secondary  school or technical school being built  for

every three primary schools as the Estimates show,  an

increase  of  only $20,000 in the grants  for  evening

classes which could help to bridge the educational gap

between the primary school and fitness for employment,

and  the  deplorable failure to build  houses  to  the

extent that between September 1956 and August 1957 not

one  single S.I.T. housing unit was completed. Sir,  I

feel  that I must elaborate to a little extent on this

deplorable   failure   regarding   housing.   In   the

Governor's   speech   on   22nd   April,   1955,   the

Government's policy was stated as follows in column 8,

Volume 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The imperative and pressing need for adequate

housing for those in the lower income group, including

the  solution of the problem of the attap dwellers and

the  clearance of slum areas is a challenge which  the

Government  appreciates can only be met  by  the  most

vigorous and in some cases drastic measures."



<br><br>Four days later, the Minister for Housing in the first

flush  of enthusiasm in his first few weeks in  office

stated, and I quote from column 40 of Volume 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;".... it is proposed to tackle the housing problem

more  vigorously  and  efficiently  by  setting  up  a

statutory  Housing  Authority, solely  responsible  to

Government,   to   replace   the   present   Singapore

Improvement  Trust. It is hoped that  such  a  Housing

Authority would be able in a comparatively short  time

to  bridge  the increasing gap between public  housing

programmes and the needs of the people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what vigour has the housing problem been tackled?

The  Minister gave this answer on 21st August of  this

year  when  he informed us in reply to a  question  of

mine that whereas the number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2932</b></font><br><br>



of   applicants  on  the  waiting  list   for   S.I.T.

accommodation  on  30th June,  1955,  was  9,571,  the

number on 30th June. 1957 was 11,547; no housing units

having  been completed since September 1956.  So  much

for  the  Government's vigour - 2,000 more families  on

the  waiting list for houses after two years' vigorous

effort!  And where is the Housing Authority? There  is

no  sign of it. Let us hear the opinion of a Member of

this  House  on  housing given in the  debate  on  the

Second  Reading  of the Appropriation Bill  two  years

ago, appearing in column 1047 of Volume 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Housing is a very, very essential social service.

It  is  almost  basic in the social service  programme

because,  unless you get your housing  done,  you  are

going  to have a slum population and a slum population

is  a  political  and  economic liability.  Some  slum

dwellers  in Singapore - a remarkable number  of  them

manage  to  rise above their environment and  maintain

proper   standards   of  behaviour  and   cleanliness,

character  formation and so on, but by and large,  the

pressure   of   life  in  the  slum  is   such   that,

scientifically speaking, it does cause the  population

to   deteriorate  as  human  material.  You   get   an

irresponsible,    unemployable, uneducable,    dull,

backward, and criminal population which is a permanent

liability  to  that  part of the population  which  is

employable  and  productive and it is  most  important

that  you should get rid of your slums as a matter  of

first priority."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the words, Sir, of the Minister for

Communications  and Works - words spoken doubtless  with

great  emotion, but sounding horribly hollow  now.  If

the  Government felt really sincerely like  this,  why

have they failed so miserably?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recall with some cynicism paragraph 50 of

the  Governor's speech opening this session from  29th

August of last year when it was stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government has been gravely concerned by the

danger  to  the  public welfare from  gangsters,  from

secret  societies,  from  armed  violence,  and   from

corruption.".



<br><br>No  doubt the Government is still gravely concerned in

its  own  platitudinous way 16 months later, but  what

has been done to improve the situation? We see no sign

of  a vigorous housing policy or educational policy or

industrial  policy, all of which would have undermined

the disorders, gang-fights, and kidnappings which have

become an almost daily occurrence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2933</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another bouquet which the Government expects is

regarding the small $8 million gap between revenue and

expenditure,  which has to be filled by  taxation.  We

submit  that greater industrial activity, more  vigour

in  the  Income Tax Department and more vigour in  the

Rural  Board  offices  where  there  is  a  figure  of

anything up to $3 million in rates to be collected, as

Members  of  the Public Accounts Committee discovered,

could have bridged this gap without extra taxation  at

all. If a result of the rise in the higher charges  of

haulage  is an increase in the cost of living  because

of  the  petrol tax and diesel tax going up, then  the

Government must take the blame. At best, the  cost  of

living  will not drop. The price index for  the  lower

income  group in September of this year was  319.8  as

against  313.1  in September 1956, 317 in  October  of

this  year as against 311.4 in October last year.  The

price  of  rice  in October this year  was  $1.54  per

gantang  against $1.35 a year previously. So much  for

the  Government's boast that it has helped to increase

wages  by ten per cent! This has been swallowed up  in

the increased cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only bouquet I will permit the Government is

their  realisation, though belated, that economic  co-operation  with  the  Federation  Government  is  more

important  than political co-operation, and  that  the

success   in   the  former  may  lead   in   time   to

understanding  in  the  latter.  Singapore   and   the

Federation must operate as one economic unit  and  the

sooner that is accepted as axiomatic on both sides  of

the   Causeway  the  better  chances  there   are   of

reasonable  prosperity. We hope that this policy  will

be pursued with tact and imagination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion. Sir, I would like to say how heartily

I  agree with the Hon. the Financial Secretary when he

said in the course of his speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is undeniable that there is at the present time

a certain amount of pessimism about the future.".



<br><br>That  pessimism will continue so long as  the  present

Government  remains in office and leans on the  P.A.P.

for its survival.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is an old English

saying that a drowning man clutches at the last straw.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Like the Labour Front!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> That has been proved in this

morning's  debate  when the hon. Members  for  Kampong

Kapor and Queenstown spoke. Since they could not  find

any  taxation  which they could really  say  would  be

detrimental to the poor man-in-the-street, they had no

other  way but to pick holes in this increase  in  the

petrol  tax.  However,  Sir, their  reasoning  is  not

according to the logic that a normal man would pursue,

and  I am not going to comment at length on what  they

said  because  their arguments are not of  such  great

importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another English saying, Sir, and that is

that  a  little  knowledge is more dangerous  than  no

knowledge,  and that was proved when the  hon.  Member

for  Tanglin was speaking. But before I comment on his

arguments,  I  would  say that there  are  other  hon.

Members  who  put  up various other arguments  on  the

Budget  that  is  before  the  House  today  deserving

comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly glad, Sir, to notice that certain

members of the Liberal-Socialist Party have now fallen

in  line with the trend of thought which I put to this

House as far back as last year, and that is that  wild

talk is detrimental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2935</b></font><br><br>



and does harm to Singapore and its economic position,

and that politicians should refrain from wild talk. I

sounded  that  warning at a similar sitting  of  this

House  last year when we discussed the Budget, and  I

sounded  it  before, when I opened the  office  of  a

local  insurance  company.  And  when  I  said  that,

probably certain Members who sit smugly now thought I

meant  only  those  irresponsible  elements  in   our

society.  But  I  also  meant  others,  Sir,I   am

clarifying  it  now  for the information  of  certain

members  of  the  Liberal-Socialist  Party  who  have

always  been  saying. 'Capital has  flown  away  from

Singapore.  What  have  we  got  to  attract  capital

here?', and this and that. That also is wild  talk - talk that is calculated to harm us in the long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad. Sir, that we have also found support

in  the Liberal-Socialist Party for Singapore's  free

port  policy but here again, they are a little behind

the times. In fact, the Singapore Standard of the day

before yesterday contained this headline:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Government's free trade policy to stay - Commerce

Minister. Singapore's Commerce and Industry Minister,

Mr J. M. Jumabhoy, yesterday gave the assurance that

Government  would  maintain a free trade  policy  and

keep the island a free port as far as possible."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, Sir, on this side, realise the importance of the

free port policy. At the same time. Sir, we must make

an   effort  to  develop  our  industries.   And   in

industrial   matters  there  are  always  conflicting

interests.  To develop industries, there are  certain

times when certain industries would require a certain

amount   of  protection.  On  the  other  hand,   the

merchants who predominate today in Singapore are  all

for  the  free port policy, and therefore we  have  a

conflict of interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the merchant class predominates in

Singapore: the industrial class is much less. But  we

have  to  get a balance between the two  and  to  see

whether  both  views  cannot be brought  together.  I

stated  earlier  in this House - I think  it  was  last

year - that there was a possibility that in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2936</b></font><br><br>



future  we  might  have to have  tariffs  to  protect

certain industries. I specifically mentioned that  if

that does come about, we should see that the entrepot

trade  is  not hampered, in other words, that  if  we

ever impose tariffs, they should be selective tariffs

on  such  items as would benefit us in the industrial

field  but at the same time would not take  away  our

entrepot  trade. That means those items that  do  not

enter  into  the  entrepot trade and which  we  could

manufacture locally to advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore used that word particularly, Sir - it is

"selective" tariff. But of course, Sir, when  Members

want  to  interpret  it to their own  advantage  they

conveniently forget certain words - like the Member for

Tanglin  has when he quoted statistics (I shall  come

to  that  later) and then put out a one-sided version

for  the  consumption of the public. That, I suppose,

Sir,  is quite a common practice with Members of  the

Liberal-Socialist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the hon. Member for Telok Ayer gave us the

points which would have to apply here in Singapore if

industries are to function. I will deal with them one

by one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that, first, capital was required. No doubt

capital  formation is the chief of the  requirements.

Without  capital we cannot have industry - and we  have

set  up  the Industrial Promotion Board to  help  the

small  man  with capital. But we have to  rely  to  a

great  extent on imported capital. Why?  The  reason,

Sir, is that our local millionaires do not believe in

long-term investment. They want to get quick  returns

in  a  short time. They go in for the rubber  market,

the  share  market,  the tin market  and  other  such

markets  which  give them quick returns  in  a  short

time.  In  spite of a lot of speeches to the contrary

by  people  outside  this House,  these  facts  still

remain so. Even this afternoon's Free Press has  this

to  say, "Slight interest in loans" - referring to  the

City  Council loan of $13 million floated in  October

last. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... The City Treasurer yesterday reported that

only  $9,000,000 had been subscribed so far. Most  of

it came from the Central Provident Fund...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2937</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This loan, Sir, is offering a very good rate of

interest and good returns compared with similar  loans

floated previously and with the general interest  rate

prevailing  at the moment, and yet we find that  local

investors are not interested in investing in it.  They

want  to  go  in for quicker returns. So that  is  the

trouble  with us; we cannot blame anyone particularly.

It  is a thing that will have to be realised slowly by

our own investors and be rectified by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sir, the Member referred to cheap labour. Now

it  is not necessary just to have cheap labour. We can

have  very cheap labour but labour that is inefficient

and  ineffective. What is required is not cheap labour

or the cutting down of the wages of labour and thereby

reducing  their  standard  of  living  (because  every

country wants to raise the standard of living  of  its

people),  but  higher  productivity  from  labour.  If

labour  can  produce more, if it acts in a responsible

manner while it does its job, and gives full value for

the money it is paid, you can step up productivity and

therefore  make goods at a cheaper price. You  can  be

more competitive in your final product.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer also says that one of the

requirements is low cost of living. Cost of living  in

Singapore, Sir, is a matter which is beyond our hands.

We  depend  on  our food supplies, like rice,  on  our

neighbours.  We do not produce much of  our  food  and

therefore  the  cost  of  living,  where  food  items,

textiles  and  wearing  apparel,  and  most   of   the

necessities  of  life are concerned,  depends  on  the

market trends operating in the countries from which we

import  those  goods.  Therefore  it  is  beyond   our

control. Later on, however, I will prove with  figures

that  the  cost of living has not gone up - in  fact  in

certain cases it has come down slightly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vast hinterland is required; no doubt about that.

A  vast  hinterland is always useful  but  it  is  not

something that we can get for the asking. In fact  our

policy  to  merge with the Federation of  Malaya  will

provide that the economy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2938</b></font><br><br>



of  both  territories will operate as  one.  Therefore

there  would be no question of a hinterland for  us - we

would be part of Malaya with a population of seven  or

eight million people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political stability, Sir - that is a thing which you

cannot have overnight. That is a thing which is in the

hands of certain Members of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheap power - I think we already have cheap power

available in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower taxation - Sir, compared with those in many

other  countries, our taxation rates  are  quite  low;

except  perhaps those of Hong Kong; but then in  Hong Kong  you do not have a government responsible to  the

people  and therefore does not have to give the social

services  to them. You can find thousands of  refugees

in  Hong Kong living in appalling conditions. Here, if

you build an Improvement Trust house and charge $30 in

rent,  you have the Opposition Members shouting, "$30!

How  can the poor man afford it?" - in spite of the fact

that  half  of the appropriate rent is a subsidy  from

Government  derived from taxation. If  you  have  such

irresponsible Opposition Members, Sir, what can you do

with them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raw materials - Hong Kong has no raw materials and yet

it has got first-class industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, a question was asked by the Member for

Tanglin,   "What   has  the  Government   done   about

industries?  Government  has  no  definite  policy  or

interest   in  industries."  The  Member  conveniently

forgets,  Sir, that on 7th November, 1956,  I  made  a

statement   to   this  House  in  which   I   outlined

Government's policy in regard to the encouragement  of

foreign  capital and industries. I would like  to  say

that most of that policy has been carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go through it point by point. First of all, a

suitable  climate  for investment - Government's  action

against  subversive elements is intended to  create  a

suitable  climate, but this is not something that  can

come overnight.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2939</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then repatriation of profits or capital - that is in force now. We are not refusing

repatriation of capital, or remittances of profits, to

any foreign enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entry into Singapore of skilled workers, technicians

and  so  on  who  are not available  here - that  is  in

operation  now, Any foreign investor can say  that  he

needs  so  many  skilled workers or higher  managerial

staff  and  we  give him permission to bring  them  in

provided  he  can  not get similar  types  of  persons

locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importation from competitive markets of raw

materials,  machinery  and  technical  equipment - there

again even though hard currency is really hard, we  do

allow  hard  currency to a manufacturer where  he  can

prove  that he can get an advantage by buying  from  a

hard currency source.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I said, "Government intends that a survey of

the  Colony's industrial potential and markets  should

be  carried  out"; and, "enquiries are being  made  to

obtain the services of an expert". I think at the last

sitting  of  the Assembly, Sir, I made a statement  in

which  I  said  that we had obtained  an  expert  from

Canada  under  the Colombo Plan for this purpose.  Now

Members  will  ask, 'Why did you take  a  year?'  Sir,

experts are not produced from our pockets; we have  to

get  a suitable man from a friendly country, and  that

is  something which we have to wait and  try  and  try

until we get him, and no amount of shouting across the

floor can accelerate getting that man. And experts are

also in short supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Government intends to establish an Institute of

Scientific and Industrial Research" - we had Dr  Godwin

here to make a report on that. That report is now with

the  Federation Government for consultation with them,

and until these consultations are finalised, we cannot

move  in that direction. And if the Member asks,  'Why

wait for Kuala Lumpur? Why don't you do it here?',  he

will  be  belying  his  own statement  just  now  that

economically we must be in step with the Federation - we

must have one policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2940</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I said that an Industrial Promotion Board with

a  capital of $1 million would be set up - that has been

done already.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then "Government is investigating the question of

making  tax concessions to industries..".  I  said

further,  "The outcome of this investigation  will  be

reported  in due course" to the House. Now, Sir,  that

is  again  a pan-Malayan matter - income tax is  a  pan-Malayan  matter and any time we want to move  in  that

direction   we   have  to  get  agreement   from   the

Federation.  Therefore this is something in  which  we

cannot move unilaterally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members seem to be impatient at the

slowness   at   which   industrial   development    is

proceeding, and I can understand that-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Hon. Minister identify the

document he is reading from?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The quotations are from a

statement  I made on 7th November, 1956, and  included

in the Official Report of that day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, hon. Members seem to be impatient at the

slowness  of  industrial development and  I  can  well

understand that. But when a man wants to invest even a

thousand dollars he thinks ten times before he puts in

the  money.  This is a question of people coming  from

other  parts  of  the world to invest millions,  in  a

country of which probably they have heard a lot  about

adversely  because  of  certain  politicians  on   the

opposite  Benches. Therefore it takes time to convince

them  that  all is not bad with us; that we have  good

people -  even  though  they  may  not  be  in  a   big

majority - on the Government side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said also that Government intends to carry out a

survey  of  the  Colony's  industrial  potential   and

markets  which  will, for the first time,  reveal  the

possibilities for industrial development.  This  is  a

process you cannot expedite. The findings will act  as

a  basis  for future industrial development and  be  a

useful guide to prospective investors who are desirous

of   ascertaining  the  industrial  possibilities   of

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2941</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And about tariffs I said that the question would be

deferred  until  the industrial potential  and  market

survey  had  been  completed. It  is  no  use  running

headlong  into  such  a  thing.  When  you  plan  your

industrial  development or economic future,  you  have

got  to  be  very  certain that you are  not  damaging

anything,  that  what  you plan will  give  you  added

benefits   but  not  take  away  from  your   existing

resources. And therefore you cannot rush headlong into

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention was made, Sir, of 4,000 workers going out of

jobs  in  the  footwear industry. Sir, as  soon  as  I

received   an   appeal   from  the   rubber   footwear

manufacturers,  I  said we would  investigate, and  I

referred the matter to the Industrial Promotion Board,

which is the competent authority to examine this.  But

they  took their own time. It was only yesterday, Sir,

that  they approached the Board and you will  find  in

today's papers a reference to the fact that they  have

now set up a Working Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before we rush headlong into giving tariff

protection to every Tom, Dick and Harry who  asks  for

it,  we  have  got to make certain that there  are  no

other   possibilities  by  which  we  could  save   an

industry. If we are absolutely certain that  there  is

no  other way for the survival of that industry,  then

we  can think of tariff protection, but not before. It

is  no  use  rushing precipitously into giving  tariff

protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin also said, 'Where is the

trumpet blast of Ministers?' -referring to me, Sir.  He

forgets  that about a year back we had trumpet  blasts

every day from the ex-Chief Minister which were not to

the  liking  of Members. Now when we have  no  trumpet

blasts,  they bemoan the fact that we have no  trumpet

blasts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to see, Sir, how facts can be put

in  a  one-sided manner, when the Member  for  Tanglin

referred  to  labour  and said  that  in  March  1956.

124,645  labourers  were  employed,  in  March   1957,

123,263 - a  short  fall of just over a  thousand.  Sir,

what he did not mention were figures previous to those

years.  The  figures for 1954 (when  we  were  not  in

power)  and early in 1955 (when we were not in  power)

he omitted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2942</b></font><br><br>



to   mention.  He  also  omitted  to  mention  another

significant  fact,  that is that  these  returns  were

obtained   from  employers.  The  1956  returns   were

obtained  from  5,470  employers,  whereas  the   1957

returns  (which  show  about  a  thousand  less)  were

obtained from 5,155 employers - 300 less of them.  I  do

not  know  why  the remaining employers did  not  give

their returns but these figures represent returns from

employers, of whom 300 have not given returns. So both

figures are not fully given and even in the ones given

you might get slight variations. You do not look at  a

particular  month in a particular year and quote  that

as  an example; you have got to look at the graph over

a  long period to gauge the trend. Not to do that,  of

course, comes out of immature understanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member quoted some figures, about rubber. I

have  some  figures  here.  January!  September  1955,

remilled  rubber  including smoked  rubber  except  on

estates,  Singapore  production, 56.2  thousand  tons;

January/September    1956,    59    thousand     tons;

January/September 1957, 62.5 thousand  tons - a  gradual

increase over the three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubber footwear, over which there has been a lot of

bemoaning     in    this    House    this     morning:

January/September  1954,  Singapore  production  2,141

thousand  pairs;  January  /  September  1955,   2,832

thousand;  January / September 1956, 2,919.7 thousand;

January! September 1957, 2,784 thousand. So from  1954

to  1957  there has been an increase in production  of

roughly over 600 thousand pairs, if I am not mistaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also quoted figures about rice prices and said

the  price  had  gone up. There again I  said  it  was

beyond  our  control if the price went up because  the

market  had  gone up in Thailand or in  Burma  due  to

delayed rains or some other causes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Stockpile.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is not due to stockpile. That

is an absurd argument, Sir,In 1954 the rice price per

gantang  was $1.65; in 1955 it was $1.36, in  1956  it

was $1.38-a sharp reduction from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2943</b></font><br><br>



$1.65  to $1.38. Of course, Sir, the Member will  pick

out  a particular month which is to his advantage  and

quote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flour, wheaten, Australian - in 1954 it was 27 cents

per  pound  and it has gone do wn until now  it  is  25

cents.  For the last two years it has been  25  cents.

Mee - in 1954 it was 28 cents; now it is 25 cents.  Sir,

these figures show that the situation is not as bad as

the Member for Tanglin wishes to make out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the main part of his speech, in

which   he   said   that  the  Minister   had   hinted

mysteriously  in  newspaper reports  about  industries

being opened but nothing concrete was being done. Sir,

that  was  almost  a hint that the  Minister  did  not

understand  what truth was. I have figures here  which

may  surprise  the House. In 1955, 74  new  industrial

companies were registered; in 1956, 93; in 1957,  129 - these  are  industrial companies. Of these  industrial

companies,  you have a vegetable oil refinery  with  a

capital  of  $1½  million. The Member mentioned  small

industries, not big ones, having been registered; I am

giving   the  big  ones - with  $1½  million   capital - a vegetable oil refinery. Then you have industries  with

$1   million   capital - a  biscuit  and   confectionery

manufacturer,  cotton  spinner,  linen  maker,  rubber

miller - each  with $1 million capital. In  the  half  a

million   dollar  capital  class  you   have   a   box

manufacturer,  gramophone  record  maker,  latex  foam

products maker and pineapple canner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these industries have been registered in the 11

months  of  this  year, from January to  November.  In

these  11 months, 2,154 businesses were registered  of

which  165  were  limited liability companies  of  all

types with a total capital of $225 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that shows that Opposition Party members can

always  talk at random, generalise and ask, `Where  is

the evidence of industrial progress?', but they cannot

quote  figures. I have here proved that they  are  far

from the truth when they make such allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955 and 1956 there were $2 million capital

companies operating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2944</b></font><br><br>



canneries,     sauce    factories,    rubber     goods

manufacturers; and of course we have a steel and  iron

mill  plus  other manufacturers with a million  dollar

capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> On paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> They are not on paper; they are

operating. All these companies are working.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now. Sir, what are the new industries which are not

in  this list but which are coming? I am going to tell

the  House  now - the  ones that I  have  been  `hinting

mysteriously' about. Unfortunately, Sir, I have had to

hint mysteriously because as Minister for Commerce and

Industry  I  am in a responsible position  and  cannot

divulge  secret  information; the companies  concerned

would  not  like  me to do so. It is against  business

interests  and business etiquette to give  out  secret

information which is in my possession and which  I  do

not have the authority from them to divulge. Therefore

I  have  had  no  recourse but to  generalise  without

making  special  reference  to  what  they  are.  Now,

however, I can tell the House something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are now finalised for the establishment of a

flour mill which, in the final stages, will involve  a

capital of $5 million. The company will be operated by

Hong Kong capital. Approval in principle has also been

given for another big enterprise with about $2 million

capital the nature of which I am still not allowed  to

disclose.  However, I can say that  one-third  of  its

capital  will  be  local and two-thirds  foreign.  The

Shell  Company,  as I have stated  in  the  Press,  is

planning to build a big oil-bulking plant with a total

expenditure of about $3 million. Then negotiations are

now  going on for the establishment of a tuna industry

using Singapore as a base for the fishing vessels, and

the   ancillary  industries  of  canning  and   others

connected  with  tuna fishing. We have  also  received

enquiries  and  are  negotiating  for  various   other

ventures. I am sorry that even if hon. Members tax  me

to  the extent of raising my temper, I cannot disclose

the  nature  of  these enterprises because  I  am  not

allowed to do so yet. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2945</b></font><br><br>



are,  however, coming up and if only Members will have

patience, they will see them established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How long?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the capital is not owned by

me  or  by hon. Members on the Opposition side. If  it

were,  I  could probably tell the people concerned  to

hurry  up.  The capital is owned by outside interests,

they  will take their own time and nothing can be done

about  it.  We cannot force them to hurry. We  do  not

want to hurry them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have today given to the House figures to

prove  that  this grouse about slowness in  industrial

development has no justification. There are many other

points on which I would like to comment but I see that

time is getting short and I do not want to take up the

time of the House unduly. Therefore I will comment  on

each particular item at a later stage as they come  up

for discussion in Committee.



<br><br>3.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have been blasted with figures and-

<div align="center"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motions)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is it a business motion?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, it is.

Under  the provisions of Standing Order 7 (11), I  beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down this

day as items 1, 2 and 3 of the Order Paper be exempted

from the provisions of Standing Order 7.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 2 and 3. Sir, are related to the Budget and I

am  sure hon. Members would like to have these matters

disposed of today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What about item 4?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2946</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The matter should be put on a

proper plane. I draw the attention of the Hon. the

Chief Minister to Standing Order 69 (2), the last

sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One day shall be allotted for the second reading of

the  Bill  and  at 4.00 p.m. on that day  the  Speaker

shall  put  any  questions  necessary  to  bring   the

proceedings on second reading to a conclusion."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary first to dispose of that

provision  before  we  suspend  Standing  Order  7.  I

suggest  then  that the Chief Minister  first  move  a

motion  that,  notwithstanding the  relevant  Standing

Order,  proceedings  on  the  Second  Reading  of  the

Appropriation Bill be continued after 4.00  p.m. this

day.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am grateful for your guidance,

Sir,I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That notwithstanding the provisions of Standing

Order 69, proceedings on the Second Reading of the

Appropriation Bill be continued after 4.00 p.m. this

day.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> I second

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That notwithstanding the provisions of Standing

Order 69, proceedings on the Second Reading of the

Appropriation Bill be continued after 4.00 p.m. this

day.



<br><br>3.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I now move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down this

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I was saying that the Hon.

the Minister for Commerce and Industry was blasting

at  us  for  nearly half an hour with  figures  and

telling  us  that hundreds of millions  of  dollars

worth  of  capital  have been  registered.  He  has

carefully avoided telling us how much of  the  $200

million  worth of capital has been paid up.  It  is

very easy for anyone to start a company with a  $10

million capital and registering it by paying a very

small  premium on that capital but the main  factor

is  how  much of it is paid up? He has not told  us

how   many  of  these  companies  which  have  been

registered are really companies, not companies like

partnerships and concerns which have been  carrying

on  for  a number of years and are now being turned

into  limited  companies  and  which  have  to   be

registered under the Companies Ordinance. That is a

crucial  factor and not the fact that $200  million

worth of capital has been registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has attacked the Liberal-Socialist Party

regarding  our wild talk to scare away capital  but

he  has.  I  do not understand why, not noticed  or

commented upon the real scare that has been  thrown

in  this House today by the partner whom the Labour

Front  has hastily married and for which I am  sure

that they are now repenting at their leisure.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, on a point of order. Is

that relevant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, he had a quarter of an

hour of irrelevance and I fail to see why he should

object to it now. Perhaps it hurts him.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the hon. Member will

allow  me  to give a ruling. I cannot see  anything

irrelevant about that remark of the hon. Member. It

is quite good sometimes to marry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Now, referring to the wild

remarks  of  the  leader for  the  People's  Action

Party, he has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2949</b></font><br><br>



I  declared  the stand of his Party and  there  is  no

compromise. His policy is that if they get into power,

they  will scare away capital and "tell them where  to

hop off". Sir, I must say that we are very grateful to

him  for letting us know his policy at this stage  and

it is for all of us in Singapore now to decide on what

future for Singapore we would like to have: whether we

would  have his choice to scare away capital which  is

so   badly  needed  at  the  present  moment,   create

unemployment and chaos, inevitably leading us into the

position  as  in  Indonesia today,  or  to  adopt  the

principle  which  our Party stand  for - a  co-operation

between  capital and labour which we think is possible

and  the  only solution for Singapore. If we  have  to

fight  like Indonesia for independence, then  I  would

agree   with  his  principle.  We  have  to  sacrifice

everything so that we can free ourselves and become an

independent nation. But when Great Britain has offered

to us everything on a platter, I fail to see why there

is any necessity to plunge our children and children's

children   into  the  depths  of  misery   that   must

inevitably  follow if we follow the footsteps  of  the

countries surrounding us. This is a step which  I  say

is  unnecessary and on which we should all - everyone in

Singapore - now decide and make up our minds  to  follow

which  Party, otherwise we will wake up  one  day  and

find ourselves being led into chaos and ruin.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> By the

Lib-Socs!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, that remark makes me say

this.  At  one  time, we had the  Labour  Front  as  a

cushion.  Unfortunately now it has disappeared  having

chosen to leap into the abyss instead of fighting  and

dying in noble defeat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to the only point in this Budget which I

shall  deal  with, Sir, on a matter of  which  I  have

considerable expert knowledge. I refer,  Sir,  to  the

statement of the Hon. the Financial Secretary when  he

said with great pride:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By all standards, the achievement has been

monumental. Since the war, over 15,500



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2950</b></font><br><br>



housing units and 600 shops have been built at a  cost

of $95 million."



<br><br>Sir, that is indeed monumental, but may I ask what has

the  present  Government done in the way  of  housing?

They  have  built  less than 3,000 houses  which  were

built in 1954, out of a total aim of well over 10,000.

That  I  must describe as an ignoble failure. Sir,  we

are being given excuses and reasons for not being able

to  build  these houses. The public is  not  concerned

with  reasons. We are concerned only with the  failure

and  the consequences that they have brought upon  the

people  of Singapore. We are only concerned  with  the

promises  that have been broken. At the elections,  we

were told that we would have everything and now we get

nothing. What do we have? We have 12,000 families  now

on  the  waiting list and for them there is no earthly

chance of getting houses in the next few years because

every house that is going to be completed will have to

be  given  to those living on sites which have  to  be

cleared  for  building  by the  Singapore  Improvement

Trust.  Sir, that is a grievous position and what  has

the  Government  done to make up for  the  failure  in

meeting this what must be the most important platform?

Nothing,  absolutely nothing! Private development  has

been  held up too. In my experience, it has  taken  us

longer  to get a plan passed than to build 500 houses.

I  am afraid and I am ashamed that I have to say this.

Still,   that  is  true  and  because  of  this,   the

Government has created problems everywhere.  What  has

happened? You cannot stop people from finding shelter;

they have to live somewhere. That has given the chance

to  speculators to build wildly all over  the  country

hundreds  of  houses. That has already  caused  or  is

going  to  cause the collapse of the Master  Plan  and

that has created a problem for any government to solve

and  it can only be solved with firmness and sympathy.

Government could have easily acquired large tracts  of

land, putting roads, water and light and selling plots

to  the people who want sites to build their houses on

or   lease  the  land  out  so  that  they  can  build

themselves  a  shelter over their  heads.  Instead  of

that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2951</b></font><br><br>



everything  that goes out to the Planning Department  is  held  up

because  of the Master Plan - a Master Plan which has never had  our

sanction  but which has been applied during the last three  years.

And what is the result? Now, there are thousands of illegal houses

and what is to be done? Sir, that is the biggest problem before us

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same position, Sir, also applies to development schemes. The

Hon. the Financial Secretary sighed with relief when he mentioned:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... it appears likely that, instead of the estimated deficit of

$3 million, the Development Fund will show a surplus at the end of

the year of the order of $40 million...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is no progress. What it means is that $43 million

worth  of works which should have been done has not been done  and

is  projected  into the future causing more delay  and  confusion.

Would  it  not  be better for us, Sir, to have a realistic  Budget

than just hopes and aims unachieved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do however endorse heartily that more of the Central Provident

Fund  should  be invested locally and also the suggestion  of  the

Hon. the  Financial  Secretary that  a  Planning  Committee  with

representatives  of  the Government, the City  Council  and  other

development  authorities  be set up as quickly  as  possible.  Too

often have I noticed roads being torn up, repaired and being  torn

up  again for the water, light and sewerage services and I am sure

a  Planning  Committee like this will avoid all these  unnecessary

expenses being incurred.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, contrary

to  the opinion of some Members on this side of the House,  in  my

opinion, one of the most cheerful things about the review of  1957

which  the Hon. the Financial Secretary made in his speech is  the

record  of  progress. The Budget has been described by  the  local

Press as "painless" and I think that is a very fair criticism;  so

also  were the Hon. the Financial Secretary's remarks on  economic

cooperation  between Singapore and the Federation of  Malaya.  The

future of these two territories, Sir, is so closely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2952</b></font><br><br>



linked that one would like to believe that anything other than the

closest  economic  liaison  between  them  would  be  unthinkable.

Nevertheless, I have heard fears expressed from time to time about

the  future of the currencies of these territories and, in a  way,

it  is a pity that the Hon. the Financial Secretary was unable  to

tell  us  more  at this stage regarding the issue and  control  of

currency,  foreign  exchange control,  import/export  control  and

other matters which, as he said in his speech, were for the moment

sub judice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I do not find myself in agreement with very many of the

remarks  made by the Member for Tanjong Pagar this morning,  I  do

agree that there must be a large amount of income tax evasion  and

this  is a particularly sore point with the much maligned European

community  who nobody will deny have always met their  obligations

in  full.  It is at least reassuring however to hear the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary  saying  that  outstanding  arrears  will  be

collected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the good thing about this Budget, Sir, and indeed about

almost  every Budget presented to us over the last few  years,  is

that  the  position remains, as described by the Hon. Minister  on

more than one occasion when he uses the effective but prosaic word

"sound".  A  small  public  debt and  a  general  revenue  balance

equivalent  to  3½  months  revenue is indeed  a  sound  position.

Nevertheless, one cannot help experiencing a little uneasiness  at

the  thought of expenditure growing year by year while revenue  is

showing signs of levelling out. It is true that the main increases

in  expenditure  are  in  social services, education  and  medical

services but in the final analysis, the country's expenditure must

be  related to its revenue capacity and, in view of the  Hon. the

Financial    Secretary's   rebuttal   of   allegations   regarding

Government's  extravagance, it is difficult  to  see  how  in  the

forthcoming years, the gulf of $12 to $15 million annually can  be

bridged  unless there be a considerable increase in taxation.  For

my  own  part, I cannot see any reduction in the rate of expansion

of the social services, and so on,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2953</b></font><br><br>



being  lightly undertaken by any socialist Government.

Personally,   I   accept  the   Hon. the   Financial

Secretary's  statement that there is  nothing  new  or

novel in the estimate of expenditure. I should believe

that under his supervision and direction, the Treasury

may and probably does argue bitterly about expenditure

before it is approved. So, Sir, we arrive at an actual

estimated deficit of $8 million and the Assembly  last

week  heard,  to  my  mind, the astounding  fact  that

increases  in taxation this year would be confined  to

petrol, diesel vehicles and stamp duty on conveyances,

and  I doubt, Sir, if any Members on this side of  the

House were other than greatly surprised. I cannot  pay

any serious attention to the arguments put forward  by

certain Members on this side of the House against  the

introduction of a tax on petrol. It seems to me a  tax

which  is  both logical and equitable but  while  many

people  must have sighed with relief at the moderation

and   mildness   of   the  measures  introduced,   the

ineluctable fact remains that much greater taxation is

in  the offing and that the present is no more than  a

respite.  We have to admit that we are indeed  one  of

the  most lightly taxed nations in the world,  as  the

Hon. the  Financial  Secretary has  said,  but  those

countries  which are more heavily taxed  probably  get

more  for  their money. However, if we want  more,  we

must pay more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find, Sir, again that I cannot share the Member

for   Tanjong   Pagar's  view  that  the   method   of

presentation  of  these Estimates  is  deplorable  and

inefficient. There is no overt attempt to deceive  the

people  or  to  secrete  large  sums  away  like  some

mendacious company director or, as we already have had

reference  to  sleight  of hand, some  prestidigitator

such as the Minister for Health. However, perhaps  the

Government  will make an attempt to simplify  them  so

that  in  the  unlikely event of the  People's  Action

Party coming into power, then the great brains of  the

Party will be able to understand them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say, Sir, that I do not like at all, in the

Hon. the  Financial Secretary's speech, the  sinister

references to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2954</b></font><br><br>



eventual   introduction   of   import   duties.   Many

businessmen would be dismayed at the thought and  even

if  the  tariffs,  as, the Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry has indicated, were carefully chosen to avoid

items  which figure largely in the entrepot  trade,  I

should  feel that there is more in the entrepot  trade

than goods to godown basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a debate such as this, it is inevitable that

political Parties will attack one another and it is in

a  way  surprising that they should spare any time  at

all  for nominated Members. I never had such limelight

this  morning since the days of the ex-Chief Minister.

However,  one is not impressed by the remarks  of  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar. He rarely makes  a  speech

without   reference  to  perils  unseen   and   people

perishing  and  diving  into  the  sea  and  such-like

remarks  but one or two things he said this morning  I

cannot let go unchallenged. One would have thought  to

hear  him speak that the making of profits is an evil.

Far  from being an evil, it is indeed the chief object

of business and is in itself an entirely laudable one.

What  is  important is how profits are dealt with.  An

examination.. Sir, of the balance sheets of many local

public  companies, such as the list read  out  by  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar this morning, reveals  that

far  from paying a large percentage of the profits  to

avaricious shareholders, the shareholders only receive

what  in  business circles is known as a fair  return.

Frequently  a large percentage is ploughed  back  into

the  business  here  in  this country  permitting  the

companies  to  expand and thus creating employment.  A

dividend  of, shall we say, 30 per cent  paid  on  the

paid-up capital of a company would be described by the

uninitiated and even by the Member for Tanjong  Pagar,

who  in this field shows an obtuseness which he shared

with  the ex-Member for Cairnhill (Mr D. S. Marshall)

probably  as  "an  obscene  profit" -  that   was   the

expression  once used in this House.  A  30  per  cent

dividend,  Sir, does not mean that  one  can  invest

one's  money  in a company and obtain 30 per  cent  on

one's money. It is entirely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2955</b></font><br><br>



wrong and illogical to consider in isolation dividends

paid  on  paid-up capital and unless  one  takes  into

account all the money employed in the business -  funds

which incidentally belong to the shareholders - one  may

receive  an  entirely  wrong  impression.  Any   local

investor  knows very well that he can  only  expect  a

certain  yield on his investment. Such yield might  be

10  per  cent although the dividend might be  100  per

cent.  I  would  say, Sir, just before  I  leave  this

subject  that an investor is entitled to a  reasonable

return  on  his  money  especially  in  an  industrial

enterprise. He is taking a calculated risk .and he  is

entitled  to  a  certain return. Out of  this  return,

Government  takes  a  .good  slice.  The  attitude  of

certain politicians to this is that the workers should

share  in all this in a bigger way than they  do.  The

wicked capitalist. .of course, supplies them with jobs

and  their livelihood but he also takes all the  risks

as  all  the  headaches, pays  the  taxes,  gives  his

workers  annual  leave, medical leave,  casual  leave,

maternity  leave and virtually runs a  welfare  state.

His  motto  might  very well be  Liberty  Egalite  and

maternity. All this he must do so even if his  company

makes  losses and we know full well that if they  made

losses, the workers would never dream or indeed  would

be  incapable of making them up. But my last  word  on

this subject, Sir, which I am cutting short, is simply

this.  Let  us remember that a large majority  of  the

local  companies here may have foreign-sounding  names

or   may  have  originally  been  foreign  or  British

entirely  in their origin but today a great number  of

their  shareholders  and the executives  too  are  not

necessarily foreigners. The owners of the company  may

in  fact  be  the clerks in your office who  may  have

ventured their small capital in order to get a  better

return  than  they  get  in  their  miserable  deposit

accounts with banks or the Post Office savings bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one other thing I would like to say,

Sir,  apropos  the remarks of the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar,  and  that is this: he actually  mentioned  the

corporation  I myself serve and I would like  to  tell

him  that in the dire circumstances which he envisaged

of our being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2956</b></font><br><br>



taken  over  by  some unfriendly local set-up,  I  can

assure  him that whoever they are, they will  probably

get less than the Japanese got out of us.



<br><br>3.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I must contradict the statements and the speeches made

by  two  Members in the Assembly today.  One  was  the

Member  for  Tanglin (Mr Ede) and the other  was  the

Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck). They accuse

the  Government,  Sir, for the state of  affairs  with

regard to the housing programme. It is true that I did

make  a  statement  earlier  this  year  that  between

September  1956  and August 1957 not a single  housing

unit  was completed. I hope that both the Members  and

the  other Members of this Assembly would realise that

I used the word "completed" and that I did not use the

words  "under construction". But in actual fact,  Sir,

during that period, there were more than 4,000 housing

units  under  construction. If Members had  taken  the

trouble to follow some of the statements which I  have

made  both in this House and outside, they would  have

realised  that  to  have a house  completed  in  1956,

planning  should  have started way  back  in  1954  or

earlier. That was the time, Sir, when we were  not  in

power. You cannot build a house, less still complete a

huge  building programme, by the mere stroke of a pen.

You  need  planning,  money and vacant  land.  As  for

vacant  land,  Sir,  there  is  hardly  any  place  in

Singapore  today which is not crowded with  squatters.

One  cannot  arbitrarily evict this  class  of  people

without  giving  them alternative  accommodation  even

though  Government has taken mandatory orders  against

them.   The   resettlement  of  squatters  from   land

earmarked for the Singapore Improvement Trust building

schemes   is  the  most  formidable  task  confronting

Government   in   its  housing  projects.   One   non-cooperative squatter can hold up the whole  scheme.  I

hope  that Members of this Assembly will realise  this

when they send their chits and bits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2957</b></font><br><br>



of  papers to me pleading for an extension of time  on

behalf  of squatters on Crown land against whom action

is    about    to   be   taken.   The    Member    for

Tanglin - fortunately he is not here today - is one of the

most   distinguished  offenders  of  this  habit.   If

Opposition Members blame Government, then  I  think  a

fair measure of the blame should also be placed on the

shoulders of the Members themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Housing Authority, I have promised this

House  that a Bill for this will be introduced at  the

next  session of the Assembly. There has been no delay

in  tackling  this  problem. The  establishment  of  a

housing  and  development  authority  is  also  inter-dependent  on  the  establishment of  a  new  planning

department  and  a  new planning authority  since  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust is at present responsible

for both housing and planning, and the dissolution  of

the Trust therefore requires that planning should also

be covered besides housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last word, Sir. The Member for Paya Lebar said

just  now  that there had been delays in having  plans

passed by the authorities because of the Master  Plan.

As far as I am aware, Sir, this is not quite the case.

The  question of saving plans passed in Singapore does

not  necessarily  rest entirely with the  Master  Plan

team  or  the Master Plan itself but you have so  many

authorities  in Singapore which have got to  give  the

green light. Sometimes it may be the City Council  and

sometimes the Rural Board but inevitably the  approval

must finally rest with the Singapore Improvement Trust

who  are not, shall I say, the authority on the Master

Plan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> r Speaker, Sir, in

his  reply, the Minister for Commerce and Industry has

tried  to paint a picture to tell us that all is  well

but from one of his colleagues, the Hon. the Financial

Secretary,  we  have heard that "the  boom  period  is

over"  and  that "money is now tighter". We have  also

heard with truth from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2958</b></font><br><br>



Hon. the  Financial Secretary that in  the  field  of

labour  relations,  there has  been  labour  disputes,

strikes  and  consequential losses of pay and  working

time. In effect, he has admitted:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It would be idle to deny that the events of 1955

and 1956 did much to destroy the feeling of stability,

security  and  confidence  which  is  vital  for   the

existence  of  Singapore as a centre of  world  trade,

services and communications.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the two, I believe that the Hon. the Financial

Secretary  has spoken the truth. Today,  Singapore  is

losing rapidly its position as a centre of trade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> How do you know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> There is no need to explain to

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar, who is a specialist  at

strikes and a specialist at riots.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think to accuse an hon. Member

of   being  a  specialist  at  strikes  and  riots  is

certainly unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It was at his invitation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please withdraw those remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I withdraw them, Sir. The Member

for Tanjong Pagar will not know anything about this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Tell us what you know of-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I think he is a stranger in

business.  In Singapore, we all know and we all  admit

that   we  have  nothing  to  produce.  There  is   no

hinterland  as the Minister for Commerce and  Industry

is dreaming about.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.

I  did  not  say that. His own Party member made  that

remark.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is disorderly to stand unless the

hon. Member gives way. Is the hon. Member giving way?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2959</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I think he has explained it even

without  my  giving way, Sir. The Government  Benchers

have always taken that advantage and I think they take

it as a matter of right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that today trade has not been good. The

Minister for Commerce and industry will remember  that

when   we   met  this  time  last  year,  there   were

delegations of traders coming to see him. I would  say

that  there had been people who were manufacturers  of

beehoon  who  came along to see him saying  that  they

would  have  to close down 20 or 30 factories  and  he

said, "We will help you. We will start a corporation."

He  called that the Industrial Promotion Board with  a

capital  of $1 million. They did what they  could  and

took his advice. Today, they are still in exactly  the

same  position.  The  manufacturers  still  find  keen

competition and many of them are throwing out more and

more   of  their  employees.  I  think  the  Singapore

Standard  published  a  report  of  some  more  people

calling  on  him and this time it was the  oil-millers

who  described to him the shortage of copra which  was

affecting  their business. I do not think that  he  is

going  to  be  able to do anything for  them  in  that

matter. Again we had the shoemakers headed by Mr  Soh

Koon  Tin seeing him about their difficulties. He told

them  that  he  could not do anything for  them,  that

things  must take their course, that goods  cannot  be

stopped from coming in and that the free flow of goods

must  not be stopped - and I should say nor can he stop

his salary from getting into his pocket! Last year, we

had  the  soap  manufacturers rushing madly  about  in

Singapore and the biscuit manufacturers too and  these

people  have reduced their output; many of  them  have

shifted their factories into the Federation. I suppose

this   would  be  described  as  being  an   excellent

understanding  that  has  been  established  with  the

Government  of  the Federation of Malaya.  Yes,  in  a

matter  such  as  this, our Singapore  Government  has

never  been  in a position to protect its  own  trade.

With  the Federation, it is a sovereign state  and  we

must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2960</b></font><br><br>



take  the  heavy end of the stick! Today we are  faced

with   another  difficulty.  There  is  a  crisis   in

Indonesia. I think that our Ministers will again  fold

their  arms  and  say, "Well, you  may  complain  that

business  has  dropped 50 per cent. The  import/export

business  between Indonesia and Singapore has  dropped

because  of  this crisis, but we cannot do  anything."

Local  traders are afraid of what will happen to their

capital  in Indonesia. They will want protection  from

this  Government.  I expect the same  reply  from  the

Government  will be, "We cannot help you.  We  can  do

nothing.  It  will have to take its  own  course."  Of

course, Government will claim credit especially during

last  year  when  it  sent  an  expensive  mission  to

Indonesia and came back announcing everywhere that  it

had  brought  back  so many tons of goods  and  rubber

which had incidentally already been negotiated by  the

traders themselves. All these, Sir, leave me to  think

that Government has never awakened to the fact that it

is  their  duty to increase trade because it  is  only

with increased trade that we can increase revenue.  If

we  look  into the income tax returns right  from  the

beginning when we started to collect tax, we will  see

that  right  from  1948  we  started  collecting  $2.8

million, going up to $30 million and going up all  the

time  until  in 1956 it was $68 million.  This  shows,

Sir, that expenditure in this colony may rise, we  may

need  more money for our social services, but the most

sensible  way and the most painless way of  collecting

revenue would be to increase trade because anybody who

makes money will not worry about being taxed. With the

same rate of income tax but with increased business, I

expect  that  we  should not be  collecting  just  $68

million but should be collecting near $100 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2961</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I want to know, Mr Speaker, Sir,

whether  the  hon.  Member could explain  to  us  what

increased  trade  has  got to  do  with  the  mounting

figures over the years. Does he suggest that the trade

has  been  increasing from 1948 to  1956?  Hence,  the

greater amounts year by year being collected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am glad that I have been asked

for an explanation by the Member for Tanjong Pagar.  I

suppose this time I have a bright student. Income tax,

Sir, is collected from profits and if profits rise, we

have  more income tax; if profits rise, the volume  of

trade  has increased so that with increased  trade  we

should  have  increased  profits  and  with  increased

profits  we shall have more in the form of revenue  by

way of income tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, may I put a supplementary

question?  Is  the  Member aware  that  the  increased

amounts  collected  by  way of  tax  was  because  the

percentage  for  tax was increased steadily  over  the

years  and that that amount collected has no  relation

whatsoever to the total national income year by year?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The hon. Member does not know

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very sad

for  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar to hint that  trade

has  not  increased because it is hitting directly  at

his  partners in the coming elections to say that they

have  not  been able to bring in more trade,  but  the

experts  in  the  Statistics  Department  which   send

voluminous  stuff  to  him every  month  dealing  with

trading  figures should have given him  those  points.

However,  I  do  not think that we should  waste  time

because  one  Member  cannot  understand  this  simple

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Can you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, in increasing trade, we

must,  as the Minister for Commerce and Industry said,

create a suitable climate. We must not have wild  talk

as  he  said. We must keep Singapore as a  free  port.

Yes, we must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2962</b></font><br><br>



keep  Singapore as a free port, so said the  Minister,

but  we would have introduced the Luxury Tax Bill  and

make it not so free, and from what the Government  has

been  trying  to tell us, we expect that this  freedom

will  be  curtailed soon. This would be  very  serious

indeed. To create a suitable climate, the Minister for

Commerce and Industry remarked that they have arrested

subversives  and  that  there has  been  a  return  of

confidence. Yes, they have arrested subversives but at

the same time while condemning the Party that produced

them   they  have  allied  with  them  in  the  coming

elections  in order to create not a good  climate  but

another  doubtful climate with black clouds  all  over

the Island.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Because the Lib-Socs are going to

be defeated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sooner or later, they will find

that  instead of the hope that they will get  capital,

capital will flee.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The Lib-Socs are frightened.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Lib-Socs have never been

frightened.  I was indeed very glad this morning  when

the leader of the People's Action Party expressed that

victory  in the present polls would go to the  Liberal

Socialist Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Not in the 14 divisions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> And he referred to the tarnished

gold  of the Labour Front which has now vanished since

our ex-Chief Minister left them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the matter of trade promotion, there are two

types  of  capital, local capital and foreign capital.

Foreign capital needs that "climate" but local capital

is in Singapore and local capital should be willing to

invest  in  Singapore but how is that even  the  local

people  who  have  the money refuse to  invest  it  in

Singapore?  The  local people understand  things  even

better  and  the local people I would  say  have  even

advocated that their money be invested in foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2963</b></font><br><br>



countries. I will give you a very good example,  Sir,

an  example that is, I should say, sponsored  by  the

Government  because I again agree with the  Hon. the

Financial  Secretary that this  step  is  wrong:  the

Central Provident Fund Board insists that 25 per cent

of  its fund should be invested outside Malaya  at  a

time  when Singapore is requiring it and the  Central

Provident  Fund  Board is a Board  appointed  by  the

present Government! This Board I would say must  have

the blessings of the Government to give an example to

the  people of Singapore not to invest all its  money

in   Singapore  but  elsewhere!  This  I   think   is

absolutely bad for Singapore. We need that money.  We

must  have confidence in ourselves. All organisations

that  have money and all capital in Singapore  should

express  confidence  in Singapore  and  invest  their

money here otherwise how can we attract the people in

foreign countries to invest their money here? However

let  me now turn to what Singapore can supply in  the

matter  of its facilities. Singapore produces nothing

but  she can produce the service and we just  do  not

produce the service by folding our arms or by leaving

things  to  take their own course. We must train  our

men. In one of the -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> The Singapore Standard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, in the Standard again, you

will  find that they referred to the large number  of

students who are leaving schools this year in  search

of  jobs and they referred to them as aspiring to  be

clerks - Singapore as a country or as a  land  that  is

turning out people fit to be clerks. In this country,

we  produce nothing and if we just produce clerks, we

will not progress. I compare Singapore with countries

like  Britain and Japan with limited land  but  which

make  use of their services for their livelihood.  In

these countries, the Governments should plan to  give

the  people facilities so that students will not only

get training to be clerks, but they can be trained in

technical  jobs  too. They should be trained  in  all

lines of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2964</b></font><br><br>



professions  to fit them in with the requirements  of

their country. I know in the Estimates that there  is

a Head for-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Boys' clubs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b>- Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will come to that. There is a big Head for

Defence. We are spending a lot of money on our  Navy.

I  wonder how big a Navy we can create, whether  that

Navy  will be big enough to withstand any one of  our

neighbours. At best it can be said that the  Navy  we

can   create   will  be  a  coastal  patrol   against

smugglers. Why can we not put that sum of money  into

something  more  useful? Why can  we  not  train  our

people  to become mariners and navigators? We have  a

lot  of seamen in Singapore but we do not have people

who  are  trained to take over the control of  boats.

That money, I think, is utterly wasted. Of course the

Hon. the Financial Secretary assured us that  should

the  Federation of Malaya take over our Navy then  we

must  provide  further regiments.  I  again  ask  why

further regiments? Are we going to war? Even  if  the

whole population of Singapore become soldiers, can we

fight any of our neighbours? We will have to rely  on

other  factors than our own strength and  that  money

could  be usefully spent in training our own  people.

The  regiment is needed to help the Police in keeping

internal  peace  but we do not want to  overspend  on

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now even turning to Education, we know that we have

provided  nothing to train technical  people  to  fit

them   into  the  various  positions  in  trade   and

industry. The Government has even failed to implement

its  policy  of giving a place to every child  before

the  age  of  12  or  14 years.  Again  I  find  this

reference  in  the speech by the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the aim of the Government to give primary

education to all children between the ages of  6  and

14.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today we find that many of the students have been

thrown out of school because they failed to pass  the

Std. V or Primary VI examination, and they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2965</b></font><br><br>



have  not attained the age of 14. Even some of  those

who  passed  have  not been given places  because  the

Government's  policy  seems  to  be  that  for   every

secondary  school there must be two or  three  primary

schools.  I  think  under  this  Development  Head  on

Education you will find that on the schools planned by

the Government



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is the same point raised

earlier  on  when other hon. Members  were  speaking,

that  possibly if the hon. Member wishes  to  embark

on   a   detailed   criticism  of  the   Government's

education  policy, the right moment would be  in  the

Committee of Supply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I agree with you, Sir. This is

only  fleeting criticism and I am not dealing with  it

in detail; I am only making a rapid reference to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was referring to this Head, Sir, D 45, in order to

point  out that even Government itself, in the  matter

of  building schools, would be building something like

66  primary  schools  to  20 secondary  schools.  This

again,  Sir,  will be contrary to the promise  of  the

Labour Front and children between the ages of 6 and 14

will  not  have a place in school. Of course,  if  the

Government is pursuing such a policy and knows that it

cannot  sufficiently provide for all students and  all

the  children,  then it should help  young  people  in

other ways. Today we find that because of insufficient

educational  facilities young people have been  thrown

out  into  the streets, too young to be employed,  and

not  educated enough to be employed, and  nobody  will

ever  employ them because of these factors;  and  when

they are out in the streets, they become a problem  to

the  police.  We have heard a great deal  of  juvenile

delinquency.  Government has not  been  helping  these

people much. The Member for Tanjong Pagar referred  to

boys'  clubs.  At  least the boys' club  movement  has

tried to help the young people of Singapore. What  has

the  P.A.P. to offer to the young people of Singapore?

I certainly feel that with organisations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2966</b></font><br><br>



and  movements such as this they  should  get

encouragement  from  leaders like the  P.A.P. leader,

instead  of  having cold water poured on them.  If  he

would do a stroke of work to lift the young people  up

from  their  idleness and uselessness,  I  would  have

taken my hat off to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am full of admiration for boys'

clubs properly run without government aid. I am not so

full of admiration for boys' clubs not so properly run

with  government  aid. So far as  the  youths  of  the

P.A.P. are concerned they are very active indeed.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think an intervention of that

nature  is  not quite in order. It should be  just  to

elucidate what an hon. Member is saying.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We can always forgive the P.A.P.

for their rudeness.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, on the problem of the young

people,   with  so  little  assistance   coming   from

Government, I cannot help feeling that young criminals

will  grow up to be old and hardened criminals.  Today

we  find  there is a general feeling of insecurity  in

Singapore.  This feeling is expressed by  one  of  the

most  important organisations in Singapore - the Chinese

Chamber of Commerce. They have downright condemned the

inactivity of the Government in matters such as  this.

We  must be able to live in peace and security, and if

Government cannot offer us that, then it is not  doing

its job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now, Sir, touch on some of the points raised

by  other  speakers this morning during the debate.  I

was  most surprised to hear the P.A.P. leader  talking

of  the  Labour  Front being hoodwinked  by  the  past

colonial government and again offering to its partner



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2967</b></font><br><br>



a wreath for its early demise. This seems to be bad. I

am referring to this because the Minister for Commerce

and   Industry  mentioned  stability.  I  wonder   how

stability  can be brought about when one  of  its  own

partners  is accusing it of being led by the  nose  by

the  colonial  government and  that  the  millions  of

dollars   that  was  approved  for  payment   to   the

expatriates  is going to be poured down the  drain.  I

find  it  most  illogical for  the  young  brother  to

criticise the big brother.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of taxation, Sir, when the

Labour Front presented this Budget, I would say it was

presenting a Budget meant for the election.  We  shall

call  it an election budget- with an eye to persuading

the  people  of  Singapore that it is going  to  be  a

painless  budget, that it is not going to  hurt  them,

and  that the best way not to hurt them is to tax them

very  little. The Labour Front seems to think  that  a

tax on petrol would do the job. I was thinking that it

will have its repercussions and I think I am not wrong

because the newspapers have reported that the increase

of 20 cents a gallon on petrol will increase the fares

of  taxis. The taxi drivers have protested against  it

and  they  are thinking of increasing the  fares.  The

lorry  owners' association, bringing in rice and daily

necessities  for  the  people, have  also  thought  of

increasing  haulage fees. These increases  in  haulage

fees  and  in taxi fares will certainly not hit  those

who  own the vehicles, but they will usually be passed

on to the consumers. As the Chinese say, "If the sheep

wants  more wool, then it has to be pulled out of  its

own  body."  If  the  poor  people  want  more  social

services,  then the Government will get the money  for

them  out of their own pocket. This method of taxation

is  not only directed at the people who have money but

is also directed at those who have to travel by public

conveyances and who rely on shopkeepers or lorries  to

supply  them with food. A newspaper article says  that

the  increase in petrol will also affect fishermen who

use  motorised  sampans.  It will  also  affect  those

industries that have anything to do with petrol. So on

this taxation, I find that the Government has again



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2968</b></font><br><br>



placed  it  on  those people who would  want  to  have

facilities from the rich but have now to pay for  them

out  of their own pocket. On the question of promotion

of  trade,  the Government has failed. On housing,  it

has  not built sufficient houses. On education, it  is

well  known  that the people of Singapore  have  never

been  satisfied with what Government has done. So  all

in  all,  I  find that this last Budget of the  Labour

Front  is  not  at  all a Budget for  the  people.  It

presents  a programme that is cock-eyed, and one  that

will not benefit the people one iota.



<br><br>4.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I sometimes get

rather bored when I am travelling in my car, and I try

to  find  something  to do. One  little  thing  I  did

recently was to take a count of the taxis I met on the

road.  I think the hon. Member for Serangoon and other

hon. Members might be interested to know the result. I

took a count extending over nine days and over a total

of  12 trips. These were mostly at rush hours, at 8.30

in the morning or at 5.30 to 6.00 in the evening which

are  the  hours when I am going to and from my office.

There  were other trips as well. I counted only  those

taxis  which were actually in the traffic stream,  not

parked taxis or taxis at the stands or drawn up by the

side of the road because the driver was going to get a

cup  of  coffee.  I found that there  were  334  taxis

travelling along with no passengers on board  and  236

had  passengers on board. My deduction  from  that  is

that  the  236  passengers who  were  travelling  were

paying not only for their own 2 miles or so, but  they

were  going  to pay for the 3 miles during  which  the

vehicle was travelling empty. If that is true  of  all

taxis  in Singapore, then that means, of course,  that

by  and large, out of every 5 miles they travel, 3 are

unpaid  miles  during which they are travelling  empty

looking for a fare. If that is true - I do not  say  it

is,  it  is  not a sufficient sample,  but  it  is  an

interesting   one -  then  the  taxis   have   a   very

considerable margin which they can still absorb in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2969</b></font><br><br>



the  way of taxation before they have to put up  their

fares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, there is another margin which can well be

absorbed by taxis before their fares are driven up  by

increased petrol costs, and that of course is the fact

that  about  50  per  cent  of  the  taxis  are  still

capitalist-owned, for which a worker has to pay a rent

to  the capitalist. After he has paid the rent, he  is

then  free to make his own personal living. The number

of  taxis has gone up by about 40 per cent. There  are

roughly  600  more  taxis  on  the  roads  since   the

delimitation  which we have secured on taxis.  Of  the

2,300 operating, I am told that half of them are owner-operated and the other half are still capitalist-owned

rented ones. The man who rents a taxi, I am told,  has

to  pay about $10 a day; or $7 or $8 if it is a  night

rental.  That  means that this $7, $8, or  $10  is  an

available  margin which can still be absorbed  by  the

industry.  The capitalists can go out of business  and

sell  their taxis to the good men who are driving them

and  there is still an ample margin before fares  have

to  go  up.  At  present, the largest  amount  of  the

earnings in the industry are going to idle people  who

are  sitting  back and making a noise. I think  it  is

highly  desirable  that we should have  owner-operated

taxis  and  I  think, in so far as  this  increase  in

petrol costs, or diesel costs for that matter, has  an

effect  on  the taxi industry, it will be to  turn  it

into  an owner-operated industry and not a capitalist-controlled one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not heard much about the diesel-engine tax.

Everyone seems to think in terms of the petrol engine,

but  it  is  worth noting that the diesel  engine  has

hitherto  had  a  very  marked  favourable  margin  in

comparison  with  the petrol engine  in  the  past.  A

diesel  motor-car - not many of them, but such as  there

are - has  been  paying $168 in tax before  compared  to

$364  paid  by a 14 h.p. petrol car doing  a  thousand

miles  a month. That gap is still a wide one with  the

new  tax.  The figure is $456 for petrol and $336  for

diesel, and there is still a big advantage in having a

diesel-engine vehicle if you can get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2970</b></font><br><br>



one.  The  same  sort of margin applies  to  buses  or

lorries, but I will not take up the time of the  House

because the debate has already gone on too long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out also that in the bus industry - there

are  some  1,200 vehicles - about two-thirds are  diesel

buses  and one-third are petrol buses, and the  diesel

buses  have  had  a marked advantage  in  relation  to

petrol  buses, and still have it after tax. The number

of  passengers  carried  in buses  is  probably  about

200,000,000 a year, possibly more, and I do not  think

that  the  amount of tax distributed amongst  them  is

going to affect the bus fares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one little point to make about the lorries,

and  that  is  that the Registrar of  Vehicles  is  at

present unable to impose a load limit on them, so that

they do carry very heavy loads for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to turn, quite briefly, to one or

two  other  points made by Members of the  Opposition.

One  of their favourite tricks is to say that we  have

said things which we have not said and then to attempt

to  shoot us down. Mr Lim Choon Mong remarked of  the

Minister  for Commerce that he had said that  all  was

well  in industrial development. He did not say  that;

he said there had been progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr John Ede remarked about myself that I said I had no faith in experts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of order, Sir, Is it

in  order  for the Minister to call an hon. Member  by

name?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Mr  Deputy  Speaker (Mr R. C. H. Lim): </b>Perhaps  the

Minister should have referred to him as the Member for

Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do apologise, Sir, I was looking at

my  notes  and  "J. Ede" is shorter than  "Member  for

Tanglin". The Member's point was that I said I had  no

faith  in  experts. I did not say so. What I said  was

that  when we got experts we had to stick to them.  We

have had expert after expert coming in and putting  up

schemes all of which have been admirable, but they  do

not agree with each other, so when we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2971</b></font><br><br>



to  get an expert, we have to work on his advice. This

sort of misrepresentation is damaging, Sir, because it

leads  off  into  a  general inaccuracy  of  mind  and

misrepresentation  which is carried  to  quite  absurd

lengths  in  Singapore. We know that  there  are  some

difficulties and troubles in Singapore but there are a

great many more signs of hope and prospects of success

and  it  is  of no service at all to this  country  to

pretend  that  Singapore is a bad place or  a  foolish

place or a weak place, because it is not. It is a very

good  place  indeed and it is very far ahead  of  many

other territories in this part of the world, and  even

of  territories  with a very much  longer  history  of

development;  and no service is done to  Singapore  by

misrepresentation  of the facts. Particularly  a  very

bad  case  of  this  is  where  the  hon.  Member  for

Serangoon - he  has  gone out for his tea - chose  to  say

that  the  trade of Singapore has fallen. It  has  not

fallen. I will read out the figures to the House

to get them on the record:



<pre>



      1954                    $



       Imports         3,024,000,000



       Exports         2,685,000,000



      1955



       Imports         3,849,000,000



       Exports         3,369,000,000



      1956



       Imports         3,929,000,000



       Exports         3,429,000,000



</pre>



In  other words, trade has gone up in value year after

year,  $5,700,000,000  in 1954  to  $7,350,000,000  in

1956.  And when an hon. Member stands up in this House

and  hopes to get himself quoted in the Press  with  a

completely inaccurate statement that trade has fallen,

I  regard  it as doing no service at all to  Singapore

but  doing considerable harm, because he may find that

his  incorrect  figures and views are quoted  and  the

truth  is  ignored and the good name of  Singapore  is

damaged.  Luckily  I do not think the  words  of  this

particular  Member will carry very great  weight  with

any section of the community.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2972</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another attempt was made by the same Member. He

quoted  various industries - beehoon and oil-milling,  I

think,  footwear and so on - and said that the  Minister

for  Commerce  and Industry had not done  much.  Well,

there  again  that is a misrepresentation.  What  they

asked  for of course were protective tariffs, throwing

away  our  free  port  status in order  to  give  them

protection. Well, that is a very big thing to ask for.

In  view  of  the fact that Members of the  Opposition

have  laid  great stress on the free  port  status  of

Singapore, they can hardly say that we have been wrong

in denying the beehoon factories protective tariffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just some of the points which, I think,

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, ought to be  referred  to.  Even

though the hon. Members concerned are not here, I wish

to  get  them on the record, to see the facts  of  the

case are there for those who wish to find them out  in

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I might make one further reference, Mr

Deputy Speaker, and that is to the unification of  the

transport system. We have in fact been told by one  or

two  Members  of the Opposition that we have  not  yet

unified   the  transport  system.  There   have   been

difficulties  and  delays and I think  the  public  is

entitled  to know what these difficulties  and  delays

have been.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am far from having lost my faith in experts. I

have  a  transport expert who has been helping  us - Mr

Hawkins - and he was here a year ago. Unfortunately,  he

fell  sick  early this year and had  to  get  back  to

England for an operation and has not been available to

us, although he is now restored to health and will  be

available, I hope, in the near future. Well that is an

act  of  a  misfortune  on  which  no  government  can

provide. We cannot ensure that an expert whom we  have

relied  on  will  not get sudden and  serious  illness

which  may cost him his life; and if he gets  ill,  we

shall  have to wait till he gets well again before  we

can go forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor is that last year when I went to

England  one of the points which I managed  to  secure

was  an  agreement  by the Singapore Traction  Company

that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2973</b></font><br><br>



should  have full access to their records and accounts

for   the   purpose   of   getting   an   accountant's

professional  report, so that if  we  consider  taking

them  over  we  should be able to  go  ahead  with  an

accountant's  report  as  a  guide  and  a  basis  for

negotiation.  I  got  that  agreement  and   we   then

discussed with them in detail precisely what they were

making  available and what we would do,  with  various

arrangements.  In  February this  year  we  were  able

definitely  to  employ accountants both  here  and  in

London,  and  to  put  them to work  on  the  Traction

Company's  accounts. We hoped to have the report  from

the   accountants,   I  think  it   was   last   June.

Unfortunately,   for  one  reason  or   another,   the

accountants have not been able to produce their report

and  I have still not got it. So there again I had  to

get  an expert or experts to do the survey of accounts

and  the experts unfortunately have not yet been  able

to keep to their due date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we are operating in Singapore at a time of

financial  stringency with very  great  calls  on  our

capital,  and  I  have  been  anxious  to  devise,  if

possible,  a  method of unifying our transport  system

which  would minimise the amount of capital which  had

to  be  found  from public funds and  therefore  which

would  employ  as  far as possible  private  funds  at

present in the industry. This is of course one of  the

points  made  in the Hawkins Report, one on  which  we

have  been working. I particularly refer at the moment

to   the  Chinese  Bus  Owners'  Association,  the  12

companies run by Chinese firms of varying sizes. I had

hoped  very  much  that we should  retain  the  skill,

capital and initiative which those Chinese bus  owners

have shown in the industry, because if we lose them we

will  have to find somebody else - and that is  also  a

troublesome and maybe costly business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they have not shown any enthusiasm for

unification  but,  in the process of  negotiation  and

discussion  extending  over a  very  long  period,  we

finally - a  little earlier this year, a  month  or  two

ago - got them to agree that they would he unified, they

would be prepared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2974</b></font><br><br>



to  amalgamate. We have on the files the general lines

of  what  they had in their minds and we were  waiting

for  further progress on that. But unfortunately I  am

told  (I  do not read the Chinese papers myself)  that

now  the  President of that Association has  come  out

with  a  further  statement  saying  that,  on  second

thoughts,  he thinks amalgamation would be a  mistake.

Consequently, I am back where I started. After seeking

to  get  the co-operation of the bus owners, I am  not

quite sure where I stand now in relation to them,  and

it  may  be  that we may have to think again,  and  on

different lines. As to that again, I cannot  say,  but

these  are factors which do not lie under the  control

of Ministers or the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot control the sickness or health of an expert

nor,  having  engaged a very highly  reputed  firm  of

accountants, can I compel production of  a  report  in

time;  or  if  not, to get another firm of accountants

and start all over again; having engaged an expert,  I

have  to  stick to him. For these reasons, there  have

been delays. I have wished very much to avoid them and

I  think  the  House will be interested  to  know  the

reasons  why  Government has not been  able  to  avoid

delay.



<br><br>4.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I think the most ignorant speech

I  have heard this afternoon was the one delivered  by

the  hon.  Member  for Serangoon, who  styles  himself

leader  of  the  Opposition. I  suppose  the  Liberal-Socialists  can  never  produce  any  better  man   of

calibre.  He  went  on attacking  the  Government  for

failures, piled on it one criticism after another, and

said that Government had failed to increase trade.  On

the  other hand, he failed to tell us how to  increase

trade. He failed to give us any constructive means  or

ways by which Government can increase the trade of the

Colony. All he did was to criticise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also gave us a false impression by saying that

Government  was  not  do, ing its  part  in  providing

adequate   educational   facilities   for   the   vast

population. He said that Government had no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2975</b></font><br><br>



plan  to  provide  technical education  for  over-aged

students. It is extremely mischievous - I am sorry he is

not  here to hear this, although I do not think he has

the courage to hear this-it is mischievous to say that

there is no plan for over-aged students, or that  they

are being neglected. Even at the present moment, there

are   large  numbers  of  over-aged  students  in  the

schools.  There is no intention to throw them  out  to

make space (which would be proper) for children of the

correct  age group, of whom there are many  clamouring

for  places.  So long as these over-aged students  can

make the grade, they will be allowed to continue,  and

to  assist  them to make the grade, schools have  been

asked  to separate them from those of the proper  age,

so  that  teachers  can pay special attention  to  and

assist them where there is no need to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is under the Adult Education Council a large

number  of  over-aged students or  young  adults,  who

receive  some sort of education. Government  gave  the

Council  a grant of $500,000 this year and I  have  no

doubt  that  this  amount will increase  as  the  need

arises.  There  are evening classes run by  Government

which will cost Government an estimated $360,000  next

year.  Recently,  I have noted that  voluntary  bodies

want  to  run  night schools or classes for  over-aged

students. I would like to take this opportunity to say

that  I  note this with satisfaction and that officers

in   my  Ministry  will  be  instructed  to  give  all

assistance to such a scheme which may be submitted for

approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect I want to stress that there is no

shirking  of  responsibility,  but  Members  must   be

reminded that Government resources - such as finance and

personnel - are limited, and that it will therefore fall

on the shoulders of public-spirited people to come and

assist Government in this gigantic task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of school buildings, I think it was

the  hon.  Member for Tanglin who said that Government

did  not  provide  any technical  education  to  fight

Communism, and that only one technical school had been

built. Well, two technical schools have been operating

for a year now. I wish to remind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2976</b></font><br><br>



the  Member that during our term of office, 54 primary

schools  have  been built, as against  42  during  the

period  between 1949 and 1954. And of 12 new secondary

school buildings planned, some have been completed and

others  will be completed within the next  12  months.

The peak for secondary school buildings has yet to  be

reached,  but  it  will not be  long  before  the  big

increase  in  the  post-war primary school  population

will be felt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the biggest challenge is provision of

more schools for Chinese education. The Government  is

committed  to this and will see it through.  The  next

four secondary school buildings completed will be used

to  house the present four Government Chinese middle

schools.  Indeed,  two of the four have  already  been

completed and will be used next month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten-year plan, augmented by the previous five-year plan, is based on the need of the English schools

system.  Now that the full grant-in-aid scheme  is  in

operation  and  Government  is  committed  to  Chinese

education side by side with English, Malay and  Tamil,

I  can  assure the House that a new phase in  planning

has begun and that this will be pursued vigorously  by

my Ministry.



<br><br>4.43 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. \): Sir,

I do not propose to take up the time of this House for

more  than a few minutes but I would like to touch  on

one or two points which has arisen out of the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is in connection with Malayanisation.

I think when the hon. Member for Kampong Kapor touched

on it, he was under the impression that an officer, on

being  promoted  to  a  higher post,  can,  under  the

Malayanisation scheme, retire with higher compensation

after  occupying that post for just more  than  a  few

months. For the purpose of clarification, Sir, I would

like to point out the fact that if an entitled officer

is  promoted, it does not necessarily mean an increase

in his compensation. Officers are required to serve in

a  promotion  post for a minimum period of  two  years

inclusive of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2977</b></font><br><br>



leave  before they are entitled to compensation based

on the salary of the higher promotion post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reference was made this morning to the present

problem  of  crime and gangsterism in Singapore.  The

police, Sir, have already taken certain steps in this

direction, but I am sure its work in combating  crime

and gangsterism can be made much more effective if it

receives    an   increasing   measure   of   support,

information and co-operation, from the public. I  can

assure the House that the Government is giving active

consideration   to  other  measures   to   meet   the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the hon. Member for Serangoon touched on the

need  to  expend money on our regular  Battalions.  I

think the short answer to that, Sir, is that we  must

have our local forces; we would like to have them  to

support  the  police  in maintaining  law  and  order

should the need arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the hon. Member for Changi seemed to have

adopted  the attitude that in this H-bomb and sputnik

age,  we  should not bother about defence at  all.  I

think  this attitude would be all right, Sir,  if  we

could  get an undertaking from all potential  enemies

that  they would never attack us except with an  all-annihilating H-bomb! As well say, 'Why bother to  buy

and  carry a payong? It would be no good if  you  are

struck  by lightning!' Yet a payong will protect  you

completely  from  light showers  and,  to  a  limited

extent, from the heaviest rain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the truth, Sir, is that, unfortunately,

there  are many forms of warfare and aggression short

of  all-out attack with the most devastating weapons.

I  think the atomic and hydrogen bombs, Sir, have not

lessened   the   destructive   force   of   what   is

euphemistically called conventional high  explosives;

and  nuclear weapons can be used in a tactical  (that

is  limited objective) as well as strategic (that  is

blanketing) role. And whilst Singapore wishes nothing

but  peace to all, Sir, we must have local forces  to

support our police in maintaining law and order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2978</b></font><br><br>



within  our borders which (Singapore being an island)

include large tracts of sea.



<br><br>4.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member

for  Tanglin, in the course of a rather feeble effort

to  belittle the achievements of Government,, amongst

other  things suggested that the Coalition Government

has  not achieved anything in combating tuberculosis.

I  think he picked on TB because our achievements  in

practically all fields have been so substantial  that

he  could  not think of anything else,  but  even  in

this,  his appreciation of the true situation  is  in

error.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conquest of TB is not one of those things which

can be achieved overnight. Tuberculosis has been with

mankind  for as long as history can recall.  Even  in

countries where medical facilities and advances  have

been  considerable, it has taken a very long time  to

come to a state where the incidence of the disease is

under control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I assumed office, what was the situation in

regard  to TB? A small body of hard-working men  were

trying to cope with the demands of thousands,  in  a

hospital  which could not accommodate more  than  500

persons,  and a part of which was for the chronically

sick  other  than TB. I refer to the  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is very much otherwise today, Sir. The

bed  accommodation has been increased to nearly 1,000

and,  before the first half of next year is over,  we

will see a further increase of another 400 beds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the school medical service's has

expanded   its   programme  of  contact-tracing   and

detection  of  cases  amongst  pupils  and  teachers.

Substantial  financial assistance, far in  excess  of

that  which  the  previous  Government  provided   or

thought  of  providing, has been  made  available  to

another  body which is attempting to combat  TB,  and

that is the Royal Singapore Tuberculosis Association.

Government is also making a contribution towards  the

capital  expenditure of a hospital  which  SATA  will

manage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2979</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under the Colombo Plan, we have come to

arrangements  with the Australian Government  for  the

initiation of a case-finding programme. That programme

will develop and soon become a reality. Registrars and

radiographers have been trained overseas, officers  to

man  it  have  been appointed, the unit is  ready  and

Australia  will  be able, I am told (unless  something

absolutely   unforeseen  develops)  to  initiate   the

programme here in the second half of 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to you, Sir, that these are not small

achievements. They are real achievements  when  viewed

against  the  background  of  indifference  which  the

Members  of  the former Progressive Party who  adorned

the  Legislative Council, displayed over and again,  a

sprinkling  of  whom I see today, who have  made  vain

attempts  to  grasp  power, and who  have  lost  their

identity  in a marriage with lion dancers  and  former

independent capitalists.



<br><br>4.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> It falls

to my lot, Sir, to wind up this rather lengthy debate.

I  will  try to make my remarks as short as  possible.

The criticisms and comments on the presentation of the

budget,   Sir,  appeared  to  fall  into  three   main

categories.  One  was  criticism  of  the  method   of

presentation  and  compilation of the  Estimates;  the

second  was  criticism  of the  measures  of  taxation

proposed; and the third was general criticism  of  the

policies of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the first, Sir-criticisms of the

method   of  presentation  and  compilation   of   the

Budget-colonial  officials were accused  by  the  hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar of inefficiency and worse.  I

do  not think I need reply to this criticism, Sir. The

record   of  colonial  officials  in  the  Colony   of

Singapore  speaks for itself and requires  no  support

from me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other criticisms made by the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar, I feel sure, Sir,  that  he

was   carried  away  by  the  exuberance  of  his  own

verbosity when he said that my presentation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2980</b></font><br><br>



the  Budget  was  glib to the point of  dishonesty.  I

doubt whether Members of the Assembly will require  me

to  contradict that statement. However, if it is  felt

that I must for the record, of course I deny-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Hon. the Financial

Secretary   must   have  heard  me   over-rule   that

expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Perhaps then, Sir, I may be allowed to say

that,  if  I  were  a  practitioner  of  the  art   of

glibness - which  I  am not - I would not  fail  to  avail

myself  of this opportunity to make deep obeisance  to

the  high priest of the art, who is unfortunately  now

absent from his seat!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the compilation of the

Budget - this vexed question of estimated deficits being

converted  in  the event into surpluses - I  should  say

first  of  all,  Sir, that we are to a certain  extent

bound by precedent in the method of compilation of the

Estimates.  The form in which they are  presented  has

stood  the  test of time. It has been  used  for  many

years.  It  has been shaped and amended as  conditions

have  demanded, and I think it does represent the best

possible  way  of  presenting  the  Estimates   of   a

Government under the present Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extraordinarily difficult, Sir, to estimate

actual  expenditure  with any degree  of  accuracy  in

conditions   of   an  expanding  economy   and   where

departments  are  growing  rapidly.  We   take   every

possible step to ensure that nothing is entered in the

Estimates  which  is not required  for  the  efficient

conduct   of   Government   business   and   for   the

implementation  of plans for the expansion  of  social

services, but it is difficult if not impossible to say

what  will  be spent in the event. If I may  take  the

example of Personal Emoluments, Sir, we examine  every

application  for  new appointments with  extreme  care

because,  if  approved,  not  only  will  it  mean  an

increase  in Government expenditure for the period  of

the  officer's service, but it will also increase  the

bill  for pensions. We examine these applications with

very  great  care and we only enter in  the  Estimates

those new appointments which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2981</b></font><br><br>



are  required for the efficient conduct of Government

business.  But  we cannot say when  we  make  up  the

Estimates  how many of the new posts will be  filled,

what will be the state of the recruitment market, how

many  officers will be promoted to vacant  posts,  or

when  they  will  be promoted, or what  savings  will

eventuate at the end of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the case of Other Charges Annually

Recurrent  and Other Charges Special Expenditure,  we

may provide recurrent expenditure for a new launch or

a  new  building,  or some similar service,  but  the

launch  or building may not be completed on  schedule

and  savings result. I think Sir, that explains  how

these savings do occur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, a solution of the kind whereby

over-estimating  might  be  avoided.  It   might   be

possible  to make a very rough guess under each  head

of  expenditure of what under-expenditure might be at

the  end  of  the year, and then make a corresponding

deduction from the total of that head. But that is  a

purely arbitrary approach to the matter, Sir, and any

guess made in that way is as likely to prove wrong as

to prove right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally prefer the course which we have

followed for many years in Singapore. That is to  let

the Estimates stand and then to try, on the basis  of

experience and the record of the past, to  give  some

estimate of what actual expenditure is likely  to  be

when presenting the Budget. That is what we have done

in  the past, Sir, and what I have done this year.  I

have endeavoured, on the basis of past experience, to

estimate  what actual expenditure for 1958  will  be,

and  I think that my estimates will not be very  wide

of  the mark. I cannot believe, Sir, that this  is  a

glib presentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may continue, Sir, on the subject of the speech

of  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar, he  touched  on  a

matter  of  Malayanisation which I think  illustrated

very  clearly his facile manner of speech. He said - if

my  memory  serves me right - that the total  bill  for

Malayanisation, taking this at $25 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2982</b></font><br><br>



would  take  approximately 200 years to wipe  off.  I

would like to refer him to the Interim Report of  the

Malayanisation Commission and to Chapter VI which  is

entitled the "Financial Aspect", in which he will see

that  the  members of the Commission estimated  that,

when  Malayanisation  was complete,  the  savings  on

expatriation  pay,  passages  and  allowances   would

amount  to  approximately $34 million per year.  That

being  so,  the  total cost of Malayanisation  would,

according to my calculations, be wiped off  within  a

period of eight years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also made, Sir, some rather facile

references  to  income tax, to the inability  of  the

Income  Tax  Department to collect tax, and  he  also

made what I regard as rather facile suggestions as to

how we might collect $108 million in a full year.  He

quickly  passed from the matter - perhaps  he  did  not

have  time to explain how it could be achieved - but  I

hope,  Sir, that before the matter comes  up  in  the

Committee of Supply he will give me an opportunity to

consider   his   suggestion   by   showing   me   his

calculations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Minister responsible for the Department of Income

Tax,  I  must  protest  most vigorously  against  the

accusations which are constantly levelled against it.

The  Department has been in existence  for  a  little

more than nine years. It now collects 27 per cent  of

the  revenue  of  the  Colony.  I  am  satisfied,  on

investigations which I myself have made in connection

with  criticisms made in this Assembly, that most  of

the  people  who are liable to tax are known  to  the

Department. To assess 20,000 individuals in  a  year,

60,000  cases  are examined. As I say, Sir,  I  think

that  most  of the people who are liable to  tax  are

known to the Department. It is, however, an extremely

difficult matter, in a complex society such  as  that

of Singapore, to make certain that everybody pays the

amount of tax which he is liable to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, in the matter of the assessment and

collection of tax, we have been hampered to a certain

extent   by  the  fact  that  the  officers  of   the

Department started as it were from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2983</b></font><br><br>



scratch  in  1948. But we have, over a  period  of  9

years,  Sir,  built  up what  I  regard  as  a  quite

extraordinary volume of experience in tax  assessment

and   collection.  And  I  am  confident   that   the

efficiency  of  the Department will increase  and  as

this  efficiency  increases, so  the  amount  of  tax

collected will increase, and the number of evaders of

tax be substantially reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing now, Sir, to the question of taxation, it

has  been suggested that this was an election  Budget

and  I would like to deny this most stoutly. The fact

of  the  matter is that, on my calculations, no  more

than  $8  million  will be required  to  balance  the

actual  expenditure and revenue next year.  Had  more

been   required,  the  Government  would   not   have

hesitated to impose further taxation. I would like to

make that quite clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also suggested, Sir, that in choosing petrol,

we were following the lead of the Federation. That of

course  is not correct. It was stated when presenting

the   Budget  for  1956  that  the  policy  of   this

Government wherever items in the tariffs of  the  two

territories  coincided, was to  bring  the  rates  in

Singapore  to  the  same  level  as  those   in   the

Federation.  The  necessity for  such  action  is  of

course  obvious  and  I  need not  elaborate  to  any

extent.  The existence of different rates of  tax  in

the    two    territories   creates    administrative

difficulties  and results in a considerable  loss  of

revenue.  It  was said by, I think,  the  Member  for

Queenstown  (Mr Lee Choon Eng) that it  would  be  a

very  good  thing  if, for a change,  the  Federation

Government followed the Government of Singapore but I

would  point  out that this has indeed happened  this

year. The Government of the Federation of Malaya  has

raised  its rate of estate duty to the same level  as

that of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the increase in petrol duty, we

went  into this with very great care, Sir, and  quite

apart  from the desirability of having the same  rate

here  as in the Federation, we are convinced that  an

increase  of  20  cents  per gallon  would  cause  no

hardship to any category of society in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain remarks were made during the course of the

debate on the statement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2984</b></font><br><br>



which  I made in my speech, and which my hon, friend

the  Minister for Commerce and Industry made  in  his

speech,, to the effect that import duties  might  be

imposed  in Singapore. I would however like  to  draw

attention to the fact that I merely mentioned this as

a  possibility  which would only be considered  after

all  other  possible means of increasing revenue  had

been explored - you might say, as a last resort. As  I

said,  I  hope  sincerely  that  it  will  never   be

necessary  to impose import duties and thus undermine

the free port status of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy)

expressed a desire that all possible steps should  be

taken  to  reduce expenditure and I can  only  assure

him, as I did when presenting the Budget, that we are

very  conscious  of  the need.  It  is  our  constant

preoccupation,  Sir, to take every possible  step  to

reduce  expenditure. We examine  every  proposal  for

increased expenditure and new appointments with  very

great care and I think that most heads of departments

will  agree  that it is an extremely hard  matter  to

persuade  the  Treasury that any new  appointment  or

increased expenditure is essential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on the question of the general policies of

Government, attention has been drawn to the fact that

I  said  that it was idle to deny that confidence  in

Singapore  was less at the moment than  it  had  been

prior  to  1955. I should point out that my statement

referred to the fact that events in 1955 and  in  the

early  part of 1956 had done much to destroy external

confidence  in the future of Singapore. What  I  also

said  in  my  speech, Sir - and here I  would  like  to

speak,  if I may, as a colonial official - was that  a

feature of the last two years was the extent to which

confidence in Singapore has been restored by the  Lim

Yew  Hock Government. This has been due to the  quiet

and   commonsense  approach  to  all   economic   and

financial matters which has characterized its work. I

would like to stress that I speak not as a politician

but  as a civil servant of some years experience.  We

are  all  aware that Singapore has been built  up  by

trade, that the future of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2985</b></font><br><br>



depends  on trade, that trade cannot exist or flourish

unless   there   is   confidence  in   the   policies,

organisation  and the constitution  of  the  place  in

which trade takes place. Traders must be certain  that

their contracts will be honoured and that, if they are

not  honoured, they can obtain redress in the  courts.

It  is  with these facts in mind that I say  that  the

efforts  of  this  Government in connection  with  the

suppression of subversion, and the action which it has

taken to pursue commonsense and realistic economic and

financial policies, have done a very, very great  deal

to restore confidence in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend the Minister for Commerce and Industry

spoke  at  considerable  length  on  the  question  of

industrialisation. On this particular  point,  Sir,  I

must  congratulate the Member for Telok Ayer  (Mr  R.

Jumabhoy)  for setting out so succinctly  the  various

conditions  which have to be fulfilled if industry  is

to flourish in Singapore. As for the criticisms of the

action of the Government in this matter, I think these

have  been  answered very fully by  the  Minister  for

Commerce, but I would like to say, Sir, before I leave

this particular subject, that we should free our minds

from  any  misapprehensions  about  this  question  of

industrialisation of Singapore. Industrialise we must,

but  it  must  be  realised that our  main  source  of

livelihood  has  always been and  always  will  remain

trade,  and  industry can only be at the very  best  a

second line of defence. All this talk about industrial

expansion must not be allowed to distract the minds of

our   traders   from   what   must   be   their   main

preoccupation, that is, the prosecution of  trade  and

the  preservation of their ability to be  competitive,

to  offer  immediately  the  best  possible  terms  to

anybody  who  comes  to  buy  or  sell  in  Singapore.

Singapore can never be a Birmingham. We will never see

a  pall of smoke above Singapore indicating a range of

factories  turning  out  manufactured  goods.  We  are

already  fairly  highly  industrialised  in  an  Asian

context. There are very few places in Asia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2986</b></font><br><br>



which  are more heavily industrialised than we are  at

the   moment,   and  any  expansion  of  industry   in

Singapore, as I see it, can only be by small  advances

along  the  very  wide  existing  range  of  secondary

industries. We cannot hope for steel mills  or  thread

mills or anything like that on a highly industrialised

scale.  What  we  can hope for is the  replacement  of

existing   machinery   by   better   machinery,    the

reorganisation of the capital structure of the  family

firm  to  allow  expansion,  the  employment  of  more

capable  managers and the examination and exploitation

of  overseas markets. But that could amount to a  very

great deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Mr Sutherland touched upon the question of

the  Central  Bank. As I explained in my  speech  when

presenting  the Budget, this matter is sub  judice  at

the  present time. I should say quite clearly  however

that  it is the concern of the Government of Singapore

to  preserve  a  stable, strong and  an  automatically

convertible  currency,  because  a  currency  of  that

nature is vital to Singapore as a trading centre,  and

I  may  say  that we are prepared to go to very  great

lengths indeed to achieve the aim. I hope that, in the

future,  it  will be possible to reach some compromise

whereby,  over a period of time, we can,  on  the  one

side, learn to appreciate the value of a Central  Bank

and  on the other side learn to appreciate to the full

the great advantages of a currency such as we have  at

the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

(Chapter  160  of the Revised Edition), resolves  that

the   Customs  (Duties)  Order,  1957,  published   as

Notification No. S 328 in Gazette Supplement No. 87 of

4th  December,  1957, as contained in Sessional  Paper

No. S.L. 27 of 1957, be confirmed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion refers to the Customs Order which

was published in connection with the change in duty on

petrol.  The  only  alteration to the  Customs  tariff

contained  in the Schedule to the Paper is that  there

is a change in respect of petrol duty from 80 cents to

$1.  The  reasons  for  the  change  have  been  fully

explained  and  discussed in  the  course  of  today's

debate,  Sir, and I will do nothing more than  beg  to

move.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it that the Sessional Paper is

correct  because on page 3 there appears to me  to  be

some  alteration in the Second Schedule. I trust  that

the  Sessional Paper has been correctly produced. Item

(c) (ii) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Manufactured tobacco (excluding cigars, cigarettes

and Snuff)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) imported otherwise than in containers of

any  kind for retail sale to the public per

pound $2.50",



<br><br>as  against, I think, formerly, $4.50 and  there  also

appears  to  be a reduction in item (d)  on  the  same

page.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir, but I am firmly

convinced that there is no change in the tariff  other

than the change in petrol duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All that I want to be quite convinced

about  is that Sessional Paper No. S.L. 27 of 1957  is

properly produced and that there is no error in it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I do not think so, Sir.

an assurance from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2992</b></font><br><br>



Government that, since omnibuses and most passengers buses use diesel engines, this increase

in taxation will not increase the fares of buses. If it does, it will again be a tax on the bus-users

and not a tax on the bus-owners. I want the Governemnt to give an assurance that there is not going to be any

increase in bus fares.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2993</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did refer to this during the debate on the Budget. I then

made incidentally a number of remarks about diesel and petrol costs. Diesel-engined buses amount

to about two-thirds of the 1,100 or so buses in Singapore. They have had a marked advantage in the past because

the amount of tax actually paid by the petrol bus was considerably higher. There still remains a very wide margin between the diesel and the petrol bus even after this new

tax. I have the figures available if the hon. Member wishes to have them. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2994</b></font><br><br>

do not think that there is any particular reason to expect that this tax would push up the fares nor of course

is it a matter on which the Government has to make a decision. The rates of fares is a local government

decision and it will be in the hands of the new City Council. If the bus operators sought to apply for

a rise in fares, then the new local government authorities, when they are all in existence, will have to make

the decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>VEHICLE LICENCE FEE VIS-A-VIS RESTRICTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ON DRIVING TUITION</b></div>



<br><br>5.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

raising  this  matter  on  vehicle  licence  fee  and

restriction  on  driving  tuition,  I  refer  to   my

Questions  tabled in this House on 4th  December  and

the  replies  given by the Minister thereto.  I  must

admit  that I was very dissatisfied with the  replies

given  and  at  that  time  I  considered  that   any

supplementary Question to those replies  would  serve

very little purpose because I would not be allowed to

elaborate on my Questions. So the only course left to

me  was to claim the right to speak on this matter on

the  motion  for adjournment and I have now  obtained

this right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I will deal with the restriction of hours

within the city limits for learner-drivers. The hours

that  are restricted are from 8.00 a.m. to 9.30 a.m.,

from  12.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. and from 4.30  p.m. to

<br><br>6.30 p.m. Sir, these hours happen to be the best

hours  for  a  working man to learn  driving  because

these are the hours during which a working man can be

free.  Apart from these hours, a working man has  got

to  be  at his office from 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. So  if

the hours outside 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. are restricted,

there  will not be a good chance for a man  to  learn

how  to  drive.  So  is it then  desirable  that  the

learner  should learn how to drive after dusk because

if  he leaves his office at 4.30 p.m. and there is no

chance  for him to learn between 4.30 p.m. and  6.30

p.m., which time is restricted, the only time that he

can learn is after dusk? Is it then desirable that  a

learner should learn driving when it is just about to

become dark? Now, as a learner, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2996</b></font><br><br>



is  new to the wheel; that is number one. He is  new

to  road sense; that is number two. And, Sir,  he  is

new to all the Jaws of the Road Traffic Ordinance. At

the  same time, he may have loss of judgment at dusk.

So  where is the chance for him to actually learn how

to  drive?  I  do  appreciate that these  restriction

hours are for the purposes of restricting people from

learning to drive cars within the congested areas  or

in the heart of the town. Certainly, Sir, I would not

encourage a learner to drive in Raffles Place,  North

Bridge   Road  or  South  Bridge  Road   during   the

restricted  hours because I do agree that  all  these

places are congested with traffic and it is not  only

undesirable  and  risky to the life of  the  learner-driver  but  also  to  the lives  of  the  public.  I

certainly agree, but what I am saying is this:  I  am

asking  the  Minister to consider  that,  apart  from

these  congested  streets, whether  there  are  other

streets within the city limits that are not congested

within the restricted hours. The area within the city

limits covers an area of about 39.6 square miles.  Is

the  Minister  to suggest to this House  that  within

this  39.6 square miles every street within this area

is  congested  with traffic during all hours  of  the

day?  I  doubt it very much, Sir. Take, for instance,

Alexandra  Road which is in the division I represent.

I  find very little traffic at any time on that road.

Again,  Sir, I do not find that there is much traffic

on  Holland  Road during the restricted  or  ordinary

hours.  Now Farrer Road is another road which  I  may

quote on which you cannot find heavy traffic at  all;

also Pasir Panjang Road which is a straight road  and

is very good for a learner to drive for a distance of

about  5  to 8 miles or so. All these roads  are  not

congested at all and why then should we restrict them

within  the city limits during certain hours? Now  if

we  relax  the  question  of restricted  hours  on  a

certain  number of streets, only then will a  learner

be able to have the chance of driving much earlier to

office - he  could start much earlier than 9 a.m.,  say

at about 7.30 a.m. - and on the way down he can have  a

chance to learn driving. At the same time when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2997</b></font><br><br>



he  leaves his office at 4.30 p.m. to go home, he will

also  have the chance to learn from 4.30 p.m. to  just

before dusk, say 6.30 p.m. or 7.00 p.m. Why should  we

restrict  the hours for driving on the streets  within

the  city limits which are not congested at all?  This

is  one  of  the things in which I think the Singapore

Government has not followed the Federation Government.

For  all purposes, the Singapore Government says  that

we must follow the Federation Government. As far as  I

understand, Sir, there is no such restriction  in  the

Federation.  So  if  in  everything  we   follow   the

Federation,  why  should  we  also  not   follow   the

Federation  on  this question of restriction?  I  also

understand, Sir, that in a big city like London, there

is  no  question of restriction at all, and I am  sure

that within the City of London there are more vehicles

than we have in Singapore. Although Singapore may be a

small  little  island  with  the  number  of  vehicles

registered now having a new serial lettering  "SS",  I

think  that  London  must be a far  busier  city  than

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not asking the Government to lift the ban

altogether.  What I am only suggesting is  this,  that

Government should consider making or make a survey  of

all  the streets within city limits and then ascertain

which  streets are really congested with traffic - as  I

have  said,  Raffles Place, South Bridge  Road.  North

Bridge  Road and so on. Have a survey to find  out  if

these  streets are actually congested; then  in  other

streets   that  are  not  congested,  let   us   relax

restrictions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here, Sir, a letter from the Hon. the

Minister for Communications and Works addressed to the

President    of   the   Singapore   Driving    Schools

Association,  and  with  your permission,  I  quote  a

paragraph from it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I am bound in consideration of the general

interests   of  the  public  to  refuse  to   consider

wholesale   lifting  of  these  restrictions,   I   am

sympathetic to the needs of the driving schools and am

anxious that they should improve their service,"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Minister is really sympathetic to this

move,  but he says that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2998</b></font><br><br>



in the interests of the public

he  is  not prepared to consider the wholesale lifting

of  restrictions.  I am not asking for  any  wholesale

lifting of the restriction, Sir. What I am asking  for

is  that  the Minister consider relaxing the ban,  the

restriction,  on some streets which are not  congested

with  traffic.  As the Minister has said  that  he  is

really  sympathetic, I hope that he will  consider  my

request  and make a survey of all the streets  whether

they  are  congested or not, and then  accede  to  the

request I have just made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is that of licence fees. I see

that tuition cars must be charged double fees compared

with   those  of  privately  owned  cars.   I   cannot

understand  this discrimination between a tuition  car

and  a privately-owned one. There is no difference  at

all  because  a tuition car is as much a  car  as  the

privately  owned.  Both are of the  same  category  of

vehicle whatever their horse powers may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Sir, that the driving schools that

belong  to  this Association charge the  same  tuition

rate  irrespective of whether a learner uses  his  own

private  car  or  one from a school belonging  to  the

Association. What is the difference then, Sir? Even if

a  learner provides his own car, he pays the same rate

for  tuition that he will have to pay if he uses a car

from a school. There is no difference at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there to prevent me teaching my children to

drive?  Will you consider me a professional instructor

and charge my car double fees? I do not think so, Sir,

because I have already taught my son how to drive  and

I have not been charged double fees. Is the Government

going  to  do so now? I may go further, Sir,  and  say

that even a Minister in this House has used his car to

teach  his wife to drive. Are we going to charge  that

Minister  double tax on his car? Are we going  to  say

that  he  should pay double tax on his car as  on  one

which  is used for tuition? His car has been used  for

tuition; it comes under the category of a tuition car;

then  why not charge it double tax? if not, why should

we victimise all these instructors?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2999</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should relax all these restrictions and

impositions,  and  see  that we  give  the  same  fair

treatment  to  everyone.  If  not,  Sir,  we  will  be

encouraging illegal driving schools because  there  is

nothing to prevent an ordinary car owner using his car

for  tuition purposes, as long as he does not use  the

word "school". He has a privately-owned car and he can

teach  on  it  without  paying  double  fees.  Is  the

Government trying to encourage illegal driving schools

then?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything to differentiate between a tuition

car  and  a privately-owned one, or has the Government

registered   all  cars  used  for  tuition?   Has   it

registered all such cars and said that they are solely

used  for the purpose of tuition and nothing else?  If

it  has, then by all means charge double fees; if not,

there  should be no differentiation or discrimination.

There  is no registration to prove what a car is  used

for.  How  then  can we call one owner a  professional

instructor and another an amateur? I cannot see why we

should penalise one man and let go the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After tuition hours, Sir, a car used for tuition

will  be  used  by  its  owner  for  his  own  private

purposes. Where is the difference? He uses his car for

his  own  pleasure and not for tuition  after  tuition

hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point, Sir, is the Minister's reply to my

question whether an instructor is allowed to accompany

a  learner  while  out on test. His reply  was  rather

vague, I might say. With your permission, Sir, I  will

quote his reply the other day, printed in column  2815

of the Official Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As an instructor myself I learn the faults of my

pupils when I am instructing them."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister concerned happens to be an ex-school master. I do not know whether he was drawing

from  his experience as a schoolmaster or as a driving

instructor.  If he was drawing from his experience  on

how to drive cars, I am surprised to know that one  of

our Ministers is also concurrently minister of driving

instruction!  Can  a Minister hold  two  appointments,

Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that as a schoolmaster he learns

the faults of his pupils



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3000</b></font><br><br>



whilst he instructs them, but teaching how to drive is

entirely  different  from checking  his  pupils  in  a

classroom.   In   the  class,  the  schoolmaster   has

examination papers to guide him. At the end of a  term

or   a   certain   period,  the  pupil  undergoes   an

examination.  The  examination  papers  come  up,  the

instructor  or  schoolmaster checks the answer  papers

and finds out the faults of his pupils. With a driving

instructor, it is all practical work, so if faults are

made  by  a  learner  whilst  out  on  test  and   his

instructor is not present, how can the latter find out

the  faults  of  his pupil? The instructor,  from  his

impressions after coaching a learner for a few months,

feels,  or  is confident that his pupil can  pass  the

test. But what happens when the pupil does go on test?

The instructor is not allowed to accompany him and the

latter fails.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the present system of tests is most

undemocratic  because you are not allowed  to  appeal.

All the faults of the learner are not known to anybody

except  the tester. Now, Sir, may I say that it  is  a

matter   of  opinion - a  term  always  used   in   this

Assembly - whether the learner has passed  the  test  or

not.  The instructor feels that his pupil learner  can

pass  but  the tester feels that he cannot. So  it  is

just a matter of opinion and there must be a board  or

some body to which the learner can appeal against  the

decision of the tester.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point, Sir, is that if the tester does not

like the face of the learner when he presents himself,

he  may  say,  "I do not like to see your  face",  and

however good that learner may be, the tester may  say,

"I  am  sorry,  young boy, because I do not  like  the

face" - he  says it privately to himself, not  openly - "I

am afraid I have to fail you." This is not fair, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an instructor brings a pupil to the traffic

police, the instructor ought to go on the test and  so

be  able to find out the faults of his learner  during

the  test.  Then if the learner has to go back  for  a

second test, the instructor can coach his pupil on the

faults made during the first one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3001</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I may suggest, Sir, that when a learner goes for

a  second test, he should only be tested on the faults

he  made during the previous or first test; he  should

not be tested all over again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these good reasons, I say that instructors

should be allowed to follow their pupils on test. I do

hope that the Minister will take all these points into

consideration, stick to his letter to the President of

the  Singapore  Driving  Schools  Association  on  7th

December that he is sympathetic to its demands and

consider the request made by me in this House.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Could I just clarify one or two

points of information before I speak, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Elucidation, or points of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Arising out of the speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Supplementary to the speech, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid the Hon. the Minister

should make his speech now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, I had intended to ask the hon.

Member  for  Queenstown how long he had  been  a  City

Councillor. My recollection is, since 1952, but I  may

be  mistaken - I am not quite certain about the date.  I

was  then  going to ask him what he himself did  as  a

City  Councillor in this matter of the restriction  of

hours  and the fee for instructional cars and  so  on.

And  finally, I wanted to ask him whether he was aware

of  S29,  1957,  and SL33 of 1955. Because  these  are

essentially  City  Council matters which  come  to  me

under  a  very complicated Ordinance - the Road  Traffic

Ordinance - on  which I constantly have  to  refresh  my

memory  because  it  is complicated.  I  have  certain

duties, responsibilities and powers but,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3002</b></font><br><br>



by  and  large, these are matters dealt  by  the  City

Council  which  come up to me and  I  have  either  to

approve  its proposals, or I may disapprove  of  them.

Whenever I can, of course, I approve because certainly

I   have  no  wish  to  come  into  conflict  with   a

democratically elected body. And the hon. Member, as a

City  Councillor, has had the fullest access to  these

matters no doubt, and I am sure or I should wish to be

sure that he has taken advantage of his position as  a

City  Councillor  either in the long  past  before  he

added  the  duties of the Assembly as  well,  or  even

today when he still retains his position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Second thoughts are always good.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> But apparently he has not in fact done

so.  He  was under the impression that a worker cannot

get  tuition except after the hours of dark,  that  is

presuming that he is working in his office or  factory

during  the  hours of daylight. Well, I  am  presuming

that  the  worker  is not working over-time  over  the

weekend,  and  if the Member had studied  this  matter

with  the  care which I am sure all Members  ought  to

before  raising a matter on the adjournment, he  would

be  aware  that one of the things that I, on  becoming

Minister,  did in connection with this matter  was  to

free the weekends so that in fact tuition can be given

on  Saturday afternoons and the whole of Sundays,  and

of course also on gazetted holidays.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Not enough tuition time.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It may well be that he feels that that

is not enough time but nevertheless there is time, and

it  is  not true that you have to manage it all  after

dusk. You have half Saturdays and the whole of Sundays

available if you want to take your private tuition  in

driving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have lost my notes and I cannot remember

what  the  hon. Member said - a tragic loss to posterity

if I do not answer his remarks. However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3003</b></font><br><br>



I  will do my best according to my recollection - ah,  I

have  found them. Now here is one thing I must  resist

very   strongly, a  perfectly  wrong  statement - is

"disgraceful"   an  unparliamentary  expression,   Mr

Speaker? - a  disgraceful expression  that  testers  who

test  people fail them because they do not like  their

faces.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think "disgraceful" is an

unparliamentary expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Well, Mr Speaker, I will say that it is

a  suggestion which should not be made, and  certainly

not made by a responsible person who is concerned with

the  proper  conduct  of public  business,  because  a

suggestion  of that sort can only do harm  and  cannot

possibly  do  good.  There is no  ground  at  all  for

supposing that in any case a person has been failed on

the ground of personal dislike, If the hon. Member has

any evidence of that, he should have brought it to  me

long  ago;  if he has no evidence, then he should  not

make that sort of suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> No appeal allowed.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member for

Queenstown feels he has been misunderstood  or  wishes

for  elucidation, he can always stand up and I am sure

the Minister will sit down and hear him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Now he was using an entirely wrong

argument  to support the suggestion that the tutor  or

instructor should accompany his pupil on test, and  he

went  on to speak about examinations and that kind  of

thing.  The  simple  fact is that  when  you  have  an

examination  you  do  not have  your  teacher  sitting

beside   your  desk  helping  you  pass  your   school

certificate;  if the Member suggests  that  a  driving

tutor who sits in the back of the car will not in  one

way  or another attempt to assist his pupil during the

test - and  is certain to distract the pupil's attention

from  his job of being tested - I cannot agree with him.

To  suggest that it is undemocratic to insist  that  a

man is tested under test



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3004</b></font><br><br>



conditions,  and  not with an instructor  on  hand  to

encourage  and guide him, seems to me a most fantastic

misuse  of words. There is nothing undemocratic  about

it  at all. A man has been taught and he then goes  to

the  test;  if he cannot pass it, he can have  another

try - at  quite  short notice if he has  any  reason  in

support of it. So much for what is the weakest part of

the  hon. Member's argument, and one in which I cannot

see any validity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the same tuition rate, whether you

own  the  car  in  which you are being  instructed  or

whether  you use the instructor's car - it is  purely  a

matter  for  the instructor to decide  what  rates  he

wishes to charge. If he wishes to charge more, it  has

nothing to do with the Government. The point is simply

this, that if a man proposes to use his car for reward

for instruction, if he is making his living out of the

use  of the roads, then it is very reasonable that  he

should pay rather more highly than he would pay if  he

was  merely driving around in the ordinary  course  of

his social life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road is turned into a place of profit and

business,  then it is very proper that the  person  so

using it should pay a sort of rent for it because what

is  meant for everybody to use for normal movement  is

being  turned by him into a place of business.  It  is

therefore  reasonable that he should pay  rather  more

than  the  ordinary person does, just as a  hawker  or

anybody  else  who  tries to  trade  on  the  road  is

expected to contribute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. Member had studied the matter with the

care  with which it ought to be studied, he would have

noticed of course that the tax is not levied on  those

who  use their motorcars for instruction, it is levied

on  those who use their motor-cars for instruction for

reward,  and that the tax is levied only on those  who

are  professional instructors. Well, so much for  that

point.   If   the  Member  had  studied  things   more

carefully,  he  would have taken less time  and  there

would have been less need to answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the central point that the Member wants to make

is simply this, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3005</b></font><br><br>



there are some streets or roads within city limits  on

which it would be possible for instruction to be given

without  adding  to congestion, because  there  is  no

congestion. Well, that is a matter of opinion. I  have

already  written  to  the  President  of  the  Driving

Schools  Association and I have had meetings with  and

letters  from  him. Then I had meetings  with  Chinese

driving instructors, with Mr Lambert, and with  other

people  concerned with giving driving  tuition.  I  am

very willing to have meetings with these bodies and it

is  quite  unnecessary for an hon. Member  to  get  up

without  instructing himself about the  matter  he  is

raising  and  to  waste the time  of  this  House.  If

members  of the public have these points to  raise.  I

have  never denied them access to myself.  I  am  most

willing  to  consider any points they  raise,  and  if

anybody can show me, indicate to me, streets and roads

which are free from heavy traffic and can be used  for

instruction during the hours at present forbidden, and

if  they  can suggest how the pupil and the instructor

are   going  to  get  themselves  there  without   the

temptation of the pupil taking the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3006</b></font><br><br>



wheel  on  the way there through the heavy traffic,  I

will  be willing to look into the matter to see if  we

cannot come to a reasonable agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is of course why I said in my letter that I

could   not   envisage  wholesale   lifting   of   the

restrictions. But I am perfectly willing  to  consider

reasonable  suggestions put to me, provided  that  the

person knows what he is talking about, has studied the

matter  and is prepared to support his arguments  with

some reasonable facts and figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately in my Ministry I have no transport

expert,  and  all transport work has  to  be  done  in

addition to the normal work of the Ministry. In  these

circumstances, I cannot call for advice on matters  of

this sort. I must necessarily depend on those who wish

for  special  consideration putting  up  a  reasonable

case;  then  we  will give it reasonable consideration

and no difficulty will arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
