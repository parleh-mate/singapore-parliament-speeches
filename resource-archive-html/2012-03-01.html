the Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) treatment co-funding scheme
was introduced to help make ART treatments, such as in-vitro fertilisation
(IVF), more affordable for couples who have difficulty conceiving.
Since the scheme's inception in August 2008, Ministry of Health
(MOH) has subsidised a total of 5,503 ART treatment cycles, benefiting
3,841 couples in the process. Thus far, MOH has disbursed around
$13 million in funding for this scheme. We are encouraged by the
effectiveness of this scheme. About 26% of the treatment cycles
under this scheme successfully resulted in live births, which compares
well with the national average of 22%.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister of State for
the answer. In her reply, the Minister of State said that MOH subsidises
about 3,000 couples for this particular scheme. I would like to
ask the Minister of State, first, is this a subsidy given, because
from what I understand, all patients going through IVF are considered
"private patients" and no Government subsidy is entitled? My next supplementary
question is that since the success rate is so good, will the Government consider
extending this particular programme, because I understand that the
grant is only available to couples who are receiving IVF treatment
in Government restructured hospitals only? Will that be reviewed
and can that be extended to the private hospitals, given that it
is a grant and not a subsidy?</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
the Member is right to say that it is not a healthcare subsidy <em class="ph i">per
se</em>. The ART co-funding scheme was introduced as part of the
Marriage and Parenthood package to allow couples who have difficulties
conceiving to go for ART treatment and make it more affordable for
them. ART treatment is not essential to the patient's health and
so it is a non-standard form of treatment. Like all non-standard treatment,
there is no healthcare subsidy. So, if the patients go to a public
hospital for ART treatment, if they are not under this co-funding
scheme, they will be treated as private patients and charged private
rates. So, the Member is right. But if they qualify under this co-funding
scheme, then they will get subsidy under the co-funding scheme. When
we implemented this, we did not extend it to the private hospitals
because the scheme was new. We will continue to monitor demand and
consider this as an option as we review our experience, but currently
we are not thinking of extending it beyond the public sector as
yet.</p>

                  </span>: Thank you,
Mr Speaker. My last question. I would like to thank the Minister
of State for agreeing to review it with a view that it may be introduced
to the private hospitals. I would like to ask the Minister of State
when MOH compares the average success rate of 22% at the national
level versus 26% for this particular programme, is there any factor
that causes the success rate to be higher compared to the national
level? From what I understand, patients going through this programme have
to be below a certain age limit, and have to meet other governing
criteria. In fact, a lot of couples unable to fit the criteria have
no choice but to resort to going to the private hospitals to receive
treatment. I am not sure if MOH would agree that the age difference
may have contributed to the difference in success rate. Will MOH
now relook at the data to see if when the patients are equal in
terms of criteria, the success rates would be the same between the
Government hospitals and private hospitals? </p>

                  </span>: Sir,
the statistics that I quoted, that is, 26% under the co-funding
scheme as compared to the national level average of 22% – are based
on the same age profile. So, in fact, our 26% is also better compared
internationally to, say, Australia and New Zealand for the same
age profile, where it is about 22.3%. Yes, the Member is right that
there are qualifying criteria for patients to go under this scheme. Age
is one criterion. The patient has to be below 40 years old. There
are certain clinical considerations too. That would likely have
contributed to the higher success rate. Clinical evidence is that there is a higher
success rate for patients below 40 years old. We need to impose
conditions because we are subsidising using taxpayers' money. So, we
need to ensure that it is effectively used. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak. Allow me
to declare my pecuniary interest as a banker. I would like to begin
by congratulating the Deputy Prime Minister for delivering a Budget
for a more inclusive and stronger Singapore. I am also heartened
that the Budget appealed to our younger Singaporeans, many of whom
care about our elderly, our poor and our disadvantaged, as we all
should.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-af1d4ab9-9eea-4713-b7fa-d9ca0ba367e2">
                  <a name="budget__id-af1d4ab9-9eea-4713-b7fa-d9ca0ba367e2"><!--a--></a>That said, the Deputy
Prime Minister's stated goal is a Budget for the future. A Budget for
the future should address the long-term issues faced by Singaporeans.
A Budget for the future should perhaps relook or adapt to a different
economic model to fuel our future growth. The growth model that
propelled us for the past 10 years has worked well but reached its
limits. We have been successful in attracting MNCs to Singapore,
in building high-end manufacturing, and a vibrant services sector,
and tourism.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f4ccbf65-6767-4ac5-b08c-eee84fe4feff">
                  <a name="budget__id-f4ccbf65-6767-4ac5-b08c-eee84fe4feff"><!--a--></a>But these successes have
led to a reliance on foreign labour and caused a significant jump
in our population. And this in turn has tested the limits of our
domestic resources like transport, housing and healthcare. This
is not sustainable. For the next 10 years, we need to look for growth
that will not add so much to our already highly-stressed domestic
resource pool. The kind of growth that will not lead to spiralling
inflation, a widening income gap, or an over reliance on foreign
labour. This may mean that we look for growth beyond Singapore's shores.
This may mean that in the long term, we need to re-sharpen or retool
ourselves for a different economic growth model.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1570</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9b645019-6069-4478-bb58-3e1e126731d6">
                  <a name="budget__id-9b645019-6069-4478-bb58-3e1e126731d6"><!--a--></a>So, today, I want to offer
three key issues to focus on: (i) inflation and how the high cost
of living is impacting our business competiveness and how perhaps
a fresh look at our existing monetary policy could address this;
(ii) the sustainability of Singapore businesses, especially at the
international level; and (iii) the building of our human capital
with our education system becoming more innovative to keep us all
ahead.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-58906775-902a-49c8-ab70-22c55d2f5f50">
                  <a name="budget__id-58906775-902a-49c8-ab70-22c55d2f5f50"><!--a--></a>Let us begin with inflation
and monetary policy. It is obvious that Singapore is becoming an
increasingly expensive city in which to live and to operate in.
Last Friday, we saw our Consumer Price Index (CPI) going up 4.8%
and core inflation was a three-year high of 3.5%. This reflects
a serious build up of underlying cost pressures. Let us not forget
that CPI represents a "change", or a delta. So when the previous
figure was already high, then our costs get higher each month and
each year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c325fcb6-163d-4494-a84e-ed61ecd298ae">
                  <a name="budget__id-c325fcb6-163d-4494-a84e-ed61ecd298ae"><!--a--></a>In 2011, the CPI was at
a high of 5.2% and that was more than five times the median of the
1.0% in the prior decade. Rising inflation hurts our businesses,
especially SMEs who are already operating on low single digit margins.
High inflation is passed onto consumers, and reduces our purchasing
power, with our retirees one of the worst affected. With the new
Budget measures pushing labour costs higher, whilst doing not much
to address the key challenges of high rental and housing costs,
core inflation will likely remain high this year. Is this the "new
normal"? Are we asking our consumers and business community to accept
that rising prices are here to stay?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-68ad3e11-1ca3-4cd0-9d46-2ed4a57abd76">
                  <a name="budget__id-68ad3e11-1ca3-4cd0-9d46-2ed4a57abd76"><!--a--></a>Whilst the MAS has continued
to maintain its strong Singapore dollar (SGD) appreciation stance,
and this has helped keep imported inflation at bay, it is domestic inflation
that is the greater threat. Key drivers of domestic inflation are
increases in rentals, wages and COE costs. These are demand-side
driven inflation pressures that may require some supply-side measures
to counter them. An inclusive Budget should target and hold down
domestic inflation. Having a strong SGD policy may not be enough.
Perhaps at this point, we may want to think about adapting our monetary
policy for a mature economy like ours, focusing on managing our
nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) may not be sufficient. We
may need to start to focus on other variables, including interest
rates and money supply.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2e063d72-0377-4e02-82b1-f5b1e16626c1">
                  <a name="budget__id-2e063d72-0377-4e02-82b1-f5b1e16626c1"><!--a--></a>Two, business sustainability
and internationalisation. It does appear that the Budget seeks to
encourage Singapore businesses to venture offshore, be it to tap
lower cost facilities and labour or new sources of revenue growth.
Whilst this is to be applauded, the facts are not encouraging, especially
for SMEs. The National Business Survey for 2011, conducted by the
Singapore Business Federation (SBF), showed that businesses are
actually looking to scale down their overseas expansion in 2012.
The number of companies with an overseas presence has already dropped
from 75% to 56%. The main sectors with the biggest drop are: manufacturing
-23%; construction and real estate -20%; and trading -10%.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-61ca843e-e1a4-42d9-94cf-36ed700f7970">
                  <a name="budget__id-61ca843e-e1a4-42d9-94cf-36ed700f7970"><!--a--></a>Why? Competition, manpower
issues and unclear rules and regulations were cited as key reasons.
The volatility of the SGD has not helped either. The SME Development Survey
2011 shows that foreign currency exchange loss is the key challenge
for 43% of SMEs. And here is why – there was an 11% spike in the
volatility of the SGD, with the standard
deviation of the SGD/USD increasing to 0.086 over the last four
years, versus 0.077 in the four years before. This spike in volatility
has clearly made hedging costs for exporters very high. Furthermore,
a continued appreciation of the SGD nominal effective exchange rate,
means that overseas profits when repatriated back to Singapore,
are worth less in SGD, again compressing margins. Hence, a Budget
for the future may need to address some of these challenges faced
by local companies as they venture abroad, especially SMEs.</p>

               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4fdcc6c8-59cd-4051-b137-928e8942bc66">
                  <a name="budget__id-4fdcc6c8-59cd-4051-b137-928e8942bc66"><!--a--></a>Three, education. Let
us now talk about education and the grooming of our future talent.
This is my final point, and as I had started on a good note, I too
want to end on a good note. Education is a sector in which the Singapore
Government has done well in the last decades. Now that we've been
recognised as one of the world's best, what is next? The Chinese
have a saying:长 江 后 浪 推 前 浪, 人 不 进 则 退. As
we reach our goals, we need to aim higher. That does not mean better
scores or grades. At this juncture, we want our children to stay
relevant, to stay ahead. And I think we need to purposefully test
some new models and new solutions that will better prepare our children
for a more complex, inter-connected world. If we are to face a new
economic growth model based on innovative thinking and collaborative
action, then the old linear way of thinking is no longer sufficient.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-379ac32d-e02c-46f5-af09-5071d7d953c8">
                  <a name="budget__id-379ac32d-e02c-46f5-af09-5071d7d953c8"><!--a--></a>At this point, allow me
to introduce the House to the Collage Method, a non-linear method
of learning that has just been piloted in Singapore. My family actually experienced
the Collage model of learning first-hand as my son's school had
a team of very brave, forward-thinking teachers, and my son, when
he was in Primary 3, was fortunate enough to be picked as a guinea
pig. As a mother, I was delighted with the Collage experience and
I really hope that more can benefit from it.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d90a8db8-a208-4159-9539-ec294a10c8d3">
                  <a name="budget__id-d90a8db8-a208-4159-9539-ec294a10c8d3"><!--a--></a>So, what is Collage? It
is about collaborative teaching and learning. It is about the intertwining
of different disciplines, helping children to think for themselves.
And it is this connectivity of ideas that make a big difference.
Let me share with Members an example where the children were asked
to make kites. As they made kites, they learnt Math – angles and
triangles. And then they painted the designs on their kites and
they learnt art. And the fun part was when they were taken to the
park to fly the kites, they saw science in motion. They realised
that the faster they ran, the higher the kites flew. Hence, they
learnt all about kinetic energy. Then they came back to the class
and learnt how to do a presentation on the history of kites 风筝的历史 in
Chinese, where they picked up Powerpoint and Chinese Google. They
even learnt to make a movie on the kites! And the best part? They
all loved going to school and they developed a love for learning
that will stay with them for the rest of their life. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d9615d56-af0b-498d-90a4-0c7349c7ba25">
                  <a name="budget__id-d9615d56-af0b-498d-90a4-0c7349c7ba25"><!--a--></a>So, whilst the Primary
Education Review and Implementation (PERI) system has focused pretty
much on the hardware of our primary school system, for our future,
why not focus on the software? I hope that by sharing Collage, we
can plant the seed to encourage our teachers and parents to adopt
such teaching methods where students' learning styles are respected
and they are taught to innovate and collaborate at a young age.
Yesterday, Ms Indranee Rajah cited a great example of how public-sector productivity
could have been improved if only each agency collaborated more with
one another. Perhaps, the Collage style of training could be adapted
for the public sector too. I can understand the resource constraints
faced by the MOE but if the MOE would consider the merits of a Collage
model and enable more of our students to benefit from it – even
if the initial steps are modest – I am sure our young will benefit
greatly. </p>

km, which we have expanded through ingenuity, hard work and vision.
Thankfully, today, our reserves allow us to spread our wings and
invest in far flung countries, and bring home the gains to fund
our public expenditure each year. And, yet, we need to do more to
ensure that this investment income is not our only source of income.
To do so, we need a new model of growth, without all the negative
issues that we have seen built up over the last five years. So, whilst
we are a small island, we have big dreams, and as we sit on the
cusps of big structural change, we need a Budget and a Government
to turn these dreams into reality.</p>

and honesty in helping those who are less fortunate. I would like
to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for giving special attention
to the elderly, children from low-income families and the disabled.
The Government's move to strengthen and widen the social safety
net to take care of society's needs is very reassuring. As we face
the challenge of an ageing society, we can overcome it with composure
and confidence.</p>

to move forward, each citizen must play his or her part. If there are
those who isolate themselves, it will impede development and disrupt
the country's security and peace. We have seen countries, where
those who are rich and in power continue to prosper, and those who
are poor are unable to escape from the cycle of poverty. To continue
to survive, they turn to crime and, occasionally, succumb to depression.
The Deputy Prime Minister's move to continue providing room for
society to help the disabled is timely and very appropriate. Each
person has an aim in life, talent and uniqueness that we can tap
on and channel towards the nation's development. If we do this together,
we can continue to progress and succeed.</p>

Budget. When the Minister for Finance was delivering his speech,
the image of smiling old folks, innocent children and confident
persons with disabilities came into my mind. This is part of the
Prime Minister's effort to build an inclusive society for the past
five years, and was not started only after last year's election. </p>

looking at various ways to ensure that older Singaporeans have a
place to live and are able to work if they are healthy. The Silver Housing
Bonus provides elderly Singaporeans with financial difficulties
one more option. I hope HDB can allow citizens joining this scheme
to enjoy priority and choose a unit
near their children's home, so they can take care of each other.
It will also enhance the attractiveness of the scheme. </p>

wish to move, I hope HDB will allow them to participate in the Lease
Buyback Scheme, including those living in 4- or 5-room apartments,
as not all old folks can adjust to a new environment. If the elderly
needs to move away from their friends, sometimes it may cause great
psychological stress to them. It takes time to cultivate friendship.
Similarly, familiarising with the living environment also takes
time. In addition, some old folks have grown attached to their homes,
the environment and their friends, they prefer to stay where they
are and age in place. </p>

by my residents is, when they want to downgrade from a bigger flat
to a smaller flat, most do so because of financial difficulties.
I realised that they often face a lot of obstacles. The main problem
is that they are unable to get a loan, or that the waiting time
to get a new flat is too long. Can HDB render more help, for example,
approve an additional concessionary loan or allocate an existing
small unit for them? We should help them to downgrade to a smaller
flat and not make the whole process more difficult, as this will
cause them to incur more overdue interest payments and penalties. </p>

that need help are those who downgrade from private property to
HDB flats. The existing 30-month debarment period prevents them
from buying a new flat directly from HDB. I see some residents stuck
in their small condominium units, which they bought when they were
married. Their children have now grown up, yet they cannot move
house, as renting a place in the open market for 30 months is a
considerable financial burden. As a result, they are stuck. I hope
the Minister can consider removing the 30-month debarment period
for those private property residents who have not bought a HDB flat
before. </p>

with is the sandwiched group. On one hand, their income does not
qualify them for a rental flat; on the other hand, HDB says they
do not have the ability to purchase a flat. Why can they not buy
directly from HDB if they are not qualified to rent a rental unit?
This is mainly because HDB applies double standards when calculating
income. When the resident wants to apply for a rental flat, everything is
included, including overtime pay and income from businesses; but
when he wants to purchase a flat, many items are not included, for
example, CPF non-payable income and overtime pay. They even want
to see if your savings have been increasing every month.</p>

choice but to rent in the open market. However, in the past few
years, rentals have been increasing, and most of their income is
spent on rent. Their $2,000 monthly rental is higher than the mortgage
they have to pay if they buy a flat directly from HDB. Can we make
their money spent worthwhile and allow them to use money spent on
rental to buy a flat? I hope these suggestions that I have just
made can bring warmth and love to more residents.</p>

Sir, our Government has done much to help the people. It has steadily
put in place over the last years schemes like Workfare, ComCare
and many others. It has taken measured steps because our Government
is responsible. It is mindful that there is a need for funding to
support these programmes. While we face an ageing population which
invariably demands more spending on such programmes, we need to strike
a balance so that we do not over-burden the young working people
who are paying taxes. So, we need to improve employment opportunities
for Singaporeans, and the
Budget has taken the right direction to call for an increase in
productivity. This is the way to reduce dependence on foreign workers
in the long run and, in the process, will eventually lead to a rise

in order to have long-term gain. My concerns right now are: is this
cut in foreign workers too sudden? Can our SMEs cope with the pain?
Or will it be so painful that they just die? Perhaps, it is also
time for the Government to do R&amp;R, ie, Review and Reflect. Why
are our SMEs in this state? Are our Government policies contributing
to it? We have been asking Singaporeans to look at the bigger picture.
I think it is also timely for the Government to look at the bigger
picture. I must declare my interest as an engineer in the construction
sector, the industry that I am most familiar with. We have been
building MRT projects for the last 20-30 years. Besides spending money
on getting the infrastructure, did we put in deliberate efforts
to also build up the capability of local expertise? How many local
contractors and consultants have gained experience? And is there
anyone who can go out to compete for jobs overseas? I would say
there is none.</p>

to build the rail network at the cheapest possible cost and, in

them of sufficient jobs to recoup their investment? We keep complaining
that locals are reluctant to be in construction and engineering.
But look at the way HDB is calling tenders for consultancy works.
I have calculated and it is not even enough to pay our engineers
adequately. I am sure the intense competition will have an adverse
long-term repercussion on the profession. I am not surprised if
more will exit this profession.</p>

I am sure there is unanimous agreement that a world-class public

But I would like to ask Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, if SMRT and
SBS Transit are private companies, why is the Government setting
aside public funds for the purchase of buses? The profits reaped
by the operators only benefit the shareholders. In the meantime, public
transport operators are increasing transport fares every few years,
making very little effort to translate their profits to benefit
the public. Should the public transport operators not set aside
a form of sinking fund for the replenishment of buses and trains? What
we are going to do is akin to providing a sort of bail out for the
public transport operators. Are there any conditions stipulated
by Government in exchange for these new buses? In <em class="ph i">Hokkien</em>,

You give them the buses, they must give back in some other way. </p>

Lunch time is only half an hour. If the bus were to be delayed along
the journey, the half an hour lunch time can cut down to just few
minutes. He has no time to go to toilet also." The Minister said
that under this new plan, we hope to have a bus at every 10 minutes'
interval during the two-hour peak period. This is very good. But
where to find the bus drivers if we continue to give them that kind
of salary and give them that kind of working conditions. In fact,
my resident told me that her husband wants to quit. I told her,

Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to congratulate the Deputy Prime
Minister Tharman for the efforts taken in the Budget to bring about
a more inclusive society in Singapore and attempts to alleviate
the effects of inflation. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-760eb072-fac8-4c10-acd9-3579e9490f88">

here to share my thoughts and views on the Government's efforts
to achieve inclusive growth. Our rapid economic growth over the
years has allowed Singapore to be noticed on the world map today.
While we are extremely happy and proud of this collective achievement
of ours, the benefits of the growth need to percolate deeply enough
to all sections of our society. Inflation in the recent years has in
particular prevented a good part of our middle and lower sections
of the society from fully enjoying the fruits of Singapore's growth.
This section of the society has been struggling to cope with the
increased costs in everyday life.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-71f9b267-41cc-47aa-99f3-c3865db15806">
                  <a name="budget__id-71f9b267-41cc-47aa-99f3-c3865db15806"><!--a--></a>Inflation in the recent
past has been very high and is caused by factors both within our
system and global factors. While global factors are hard to be controlled
in the difficult times we are living in, we could possibly try to
keep our focus on factors within our system. Inflation has affected
all factors of production within our economy almost equally. This
increased cost of business is forcing prices to rise further and
add to the inflationary pressures. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0c57583e-f40f-4a75-a825-8a09c8e7b3c6">
                  <a name="budget__id-0c57583e-f40f-4a75-a825-8a09c8e7b3c6"><!--a--></a>While Singapore has moved
towards increasingly hi-tech industries, banking and financial sectors,
other sectors are also needed to provide our economy with a diversified
base. Today, with sufficient liquidity in the system, the capital
cost and its availability has become relatively cheap and easy.
But the other two factors which are scarce in Singapore, namely,
land and labour, are having a significant impact in the rising cost
of business. </p>

has become an important investment opportunity for Singaporeans
and foreigners alike. This applies to all kinds of property, commercial
and otherwise. With land being limited and more monies chasing it
than ever before, the prices continue to move up faster. Structured
options like Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) allow more retail
participation and the perpetual increase in property prices makes
sure more monies chase REITs. </p>

by this increased property rentals, be it in the office space, shopping
malls and industrial buildings, today have no one to look up to
with even JTC slowly moving away from their original agenda of facilitating
and assisting small businesses. A recent poll in October 2011 by
SBF found that 64% of SMEs were affected by high labour costs, 44%
affected by high rentals and 52.8% struggled with high material
costs. Three quarters of them responded that "reducing business
costs" is their
top agenda list. On one hand, SMEs are making every effort despite
the challenges to improve skills and productivity and, on the other
hand, inflation is the key business costs which is eroding the hard-earned
gains from the improved productivity. </p>

any reserve price set by the Government which is not matched by
a potential buyer of any site. While the prices keep going high,
the investors, particularly foreign investors, continue to invest,
as our economy is viewed as stable and one of the better managed
economies in the world. While it is a matter of pride for us to be
so appreciated by global investors, it is also a source of worry
that the global wall of money should not crowd out our local needs.
Increasing rentals squeeze the businesses of any gains they make
either through productivity, efficiency or effective marketing of their
products within the system. With limited choices available to their
business, they simply pass the increased costs to their customers,
fuelling further inflation.</p>

labour force faster than businesses as they have limited income in
hand. The labour force expectation from the job has been increasing
and they are choosy about the kind of profession they would want
to join, with many preferring desk jobs to field jobs. Many businesses
which require long hours of standing on the floor are forced to
look beyond the local talent pool. Increasing the levy on employment
of foreign workers will also result in cost increases, which ultimately
will be passed on to the consumers.</p>

which, in my opinion, is acting against our efforts to achieve inclusive
growth is the rising cost for essential services like transportation,
health and education. Singapore in the past has always prided herself
on providing exemplary public transport facilities and clear deterrents
to owning private transportation means. This allowed our planning
of infrastructure and predicting the growth in traffic. Easy financing
options in the recent years, including other reasons, have suddenly
allowed a flood of private vehicles onto our roads which has affected
the quality of transportation services. Public transport companies
have also passed their increased costs to the consumers. While public
transport companies may have justification as profitable companies,
it is a fact that they are assisted in several ways, including exemptions
on levies, duties and current budgetary funding for new buses to
the tune of $1.1 billion. Therefore, it is hard to accept the profit
motive at least on their transport operations. </p>

the choice of using public transport, including taxi services, did not
offer sufficient economic advantage to deter people from owning
vehicles which are easier to finance now. Perhaps, an approach to
treat import of cars for use as taxis differently than private vehicles
could help in ensuring the need for owning private vehicles is kept
low. </p>

have gone up significantly in recent years, attributable primarily to
the increased cost of running the business as often stated by healthcare
operators. The shortage of local labour with expertise in this area
and the nature of the business forces more import of talent which
is expensive. While it is fair for us to look at having more Singaporeans
in the workforce, it is my view that our aptitude and attitude towards certain
type of jobs besides specific skills make it harder to recruit locally.
With an ageing population, we need more healthcare workers and our
Singaporean local talent is not inclined to work in these sectors.
To ensure increased labour costs in such essential sectors are not
passed on to the customers, we should review the additional burden
of levies on foreign
labour in these sectors. This will be an approach leading to a lasting solution
for the continuously increasing costs. </p>

very heartening to see that the Budget has made efforts to enhance

my speech by saying that the Government has a very difficult balancing
act to do. While we are striving sincerely to achieve an inclusive growth
within our system, it is important for us to achieve this sooner
than later. The Government has taken steps in the recent past to
address some of these issues. However, more needs to be done and
soon. Reigning in inflationary pressures from within our system
will be a key to ensure that there is no decrease in social mobility. Budgetary
grants at various levels will help alleviate the effects of rising
costs temporarily. Inflation tends to rise faster than the help
given. Therefore, we will need to look at structural changes to
ensure inflationary pressures on key factors of production, like
land and labour, are curtailed. It may be worthwhile to consider
reviewing guidelines for companies operating to provide public services
and amenities. The yardsticks for their performance may need to
be pegged beyond profitability so that they are not tempted to pass
on cost increases to the consumers. </p>

market with limited competition in the market in most sectors. Market
forces may not be able to neutralise inflationary pressures as easily
without structural intervention. It will be necessary to do for
a more inclusive growth. In my humble opinion, while the Government
through MAS has been trying to control inflationary pressures through
a range of monetary policies, it must also exercise its options
to take regulatory steps and nip all the causes that trigger inflation
at the bud, rather than to give grants and subsidies to compensate
for the increases in prices which may only provide short-term help
and solution. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget. </p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to start my speech with a quote of
what a true friend is: "A true friend is one who reaches for your
hand and touches your heart."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a2efd35b-5f03-441d-b378-d1093313b720">

told me that Budget 2012 shows that the PAP Government is a true
friend in its efforts to reach out to the less fortunate citizens,
particularly low-income earners, senior citizens and the disabled.
Budget 2012 puts money in the thin wallets of many needy people.
More importantly, it puts warmth into their hearts. They call it,
"The Budget with a heart". Many diplomats that I have met were envious
and said they wished for such a budget for their own countries.</p>

the following as we come to grips with just how the Budget will
affect each and every one of us. First, the emphasis on building
an inclusive society. While many agree that we have to be more productive
and we should rely less on a foreign workforce, many Singaporeans
perceive that we are already working too hard, that it is hard to
achieve a work-life balance, as a result of which it is difficult
to have more children
and there is a constant need to look for a less stressful job. Briefly
put, there is a gap between what our head tells us and what our
heart says. </p>

readily understood – so many per cent each year and so much can
be achieved over a decade. The issue for many people, however, remains
that each day presents a huge challenge, in terms of getting my
work done to the satisfaction of my boss and my colleagues, getting
my children to perform as demanded by the school system, managing
my aged parents who feel confined in the flat and trying to get
a slightly bigger flat before the prices go sky high, and so on.</p>

that we provide more platforms to connect the budgetary measures
announced to the daily concerns that our people face. It would be
good if, at the workplace, group discussions could be set up so
that Singaporeans can see the link between what the Government has
carefully put together to achieve sustained growth and veer away
from the financial crises that many countries in the developed West
now face. There is a danger that beyond the superficial nod given
to a poor-friendly budget, our people wake up each day feeling that
not much has happened to change the things around them.</p>

our dependence on foreign workers, there is much discussion online
about how it is not the lowly-paid construction worker that bothers
us but the foreign talent deemed necessary to keep the corporate
organisations profitable and should be less visible. As employers
grapple with the impending headache of staffing costs and limited
pool of available local workers, there is a need to explain, using
words that are easy to understand, why the Government's foreign
talent policy is vital to Singapore's future. When a thoughtless
Chinese scholar's remarks could create such a furore online and
even in the coffee shops, it is a sign that there is much pent-up resentment
and much that is misunderstood about foreign talent in Singapore.</p>

from China created an uproar because of his careless remarks. We see
online discussions on such matters quite frequently. Let me give
my own view on this issue. What kind of mindset makes Singaporeans
react in such a way, even to become angry with Members of Parliament
who proposed a moderate response to the incident? As I watched the
media frenzy over Jeremy Lin in NBA matches, I reflected on how
differently Singaporeans reacted to this American Chinese compared
with Chinese viewers in Taiwan and China. There is none of the eagerness
to take pride in him. This could be due to the fact that young Singaporeans
have a strong sense of national identity and deep feelings towards
our local culture. They are proud of anything Singaporean. Even
though Jeremy Lin is Asian, he is still different, therefore there
is no need to worship him. On the contrary, if it is someone with
an Asian background just like most of the Singaporeans, then we
cannot tolerate his ignorant and insulting remarks that hurt the
feelings of Singaporeans. This feeling may cause some young Singaporeans
to be very subjective and intolerant, and they protest strongly
against a hurtful remark made by a non-local student. </p>

programme in schools should take this up so that our children can
become more tolerant and be willing to accept a non-local person,
as long as he is willing to contribute to Singapore and work together
for the country. I think this will dispel the misunderstanding among
some Singaporeans about our foreign talent policy. We need to explain in various
ways the importance of foreign talents for our long-term development,
so all of us will understand the issue better.</p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang"> (<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>Another important
area for my residents has to do with healthcare. Some healthcare
professionals are concerned about the prohibitive costs of early intervention
and treatment for special needs children. Some cared about senior
citizens who could not afford medical screening costs and could
not be persuaded to go for screening. Some raised the possibility
of more effort devoted to developing the role of the GP in palliative
care. Yet, others asked about increasing the $400 cap for Medisave withdrawal
and expressed concerns about the polyclinic being ready for a large
increase in patient numbers. Put simply, many of the questions deal
with how the individual poor or elderly Singaporean would be able
to derive the benefit that the budget is giving out to the broad
categories of needy Singaporeans who are from low-income families, beyond
a certain age and have certain disabilities, including challenges
to mental well-being. This calls for more attention to the question
of individual access. It is like the food problem that some developing
countries face; when we increase the supply of something desirable,
we have to consider how deserving individuals can access what is meant
for them. </p>

more and more announcements from individual Ministries and agencies,
there are two categories of feedback that captured my attention.
One is related to the perception that the budget for improving the
transport system would have been better spent on providing jobs
or relief for the poor – and as my parliamentary colleague Er Dr
Lee Bee Wah has just said, to provide subsidised travel for polytechnic students
and more salaries and welfare for the SBS and SMRT bus drivers –
and the other is about how singles feel left out. It seems to me
that as more people voice their wish to be included as beneficiaries,
there are not as many willing to speak on behalf of our children
and what they think will benefit them. I read with disbelief media
reports about financial ruin in some countries which have not exercised
budgetary discipline and the devastating effect that it has on its
citizens. One sad example was Greece, where children were reported
to have been abandoned by their parents who have become too poor
to feed them. There ought to be some discussion, perhaps at the
community or school level, as to what our children are saying about
the way other countries are spending money on their people. What
can we do to make the country richer so that those who deserve to
be helped can get what they need? Are our children aware that a lot
is being done with their welfare close to the Government's heart?</p>

Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate. I would
first like to thank Deputy Prime Minister Tharman for presenting
a progressive and
forward-looking Budget. This Budget achieves a good balance between fulfilling
the social needs of our country and addressing the longer term economic competitiveness
of Singapore. I am particularly heartened by the range of schemes intended
to help three important groups of Singaporeans: the elderly, the
lower income and the disabled. Many Singaporeans cheer the widening
of the social support net to engender a more inclusive and stronger
society. </p>

to an increased level of social investment, some Members of this
House cautioned against promoting a culture of "entitlement", like
systems in many Western countries. I am pleased to see that we continue
to build our system around a culture of work ethic with initiatives
that are really targeted at encouraging skills upgrading and continued
employment. This year's Budget provides support to improve the employability
of older workers, enhanced support for training as well as measures to
increase the attractiveness of work for older workers by increasing
CPF contributions and doubling their income tax relief. We must
never waver in our conviction that "work is the best form of welfare". </p>

are in the enviable position of being financially strong, and many
Members contrasted our position with those in the West. But our
Government goes further by taking the "long view", leveraging our
strong fiscal position to build solid foundations for the future.
Not every similarly-endowed country is as farsighted, and I would
like to quote from an email written by a friend from Hong Kong.
He wrote:</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph hcProceduralText" id="id-733e1e9f-1792-4c61-ba89-22213eaf1e01">
                  <a name="budget__id-733e1e9f-1792-4c61-ba89-22213eaf1e01"><!--a--></a>"Whilst both the Hong
Kong and the Singapore Governments run budget surpluses and both have
accumulated substantial reserves, each takes a very different approach
in leveraging its strong fiscal position. By investing in long-term
productivity growth and helping the underprivileged, Singapore's
approach is more sustainable and targeted. In contrast, rather than focus
more on 'structural' spending, the Hong Kong government has resorted
to simply handing out 'freebies' such as giving out HK$6,000 (which
is close to S$1,000) to every adult resident last year, whether
rich or poor. This cost the Hong Kong taxpayers the equivalent of
S$5.8 billion."</p>

economy is at a crossroad. This year's Budget underscores the urgent
need to restructure and upgrade for the future. Sir, we have set
ourselves a very ambitious target of increasing productivity and
real wages of Singaporeans by 30% in the coming decade. This is
really aspirational, given that we managed to grow productivity
by only 20% and real wages by only 11% in the previous decade. </p>

this House to highlight that the journey will pose significant challenges
to many Singaporean companies, especially SMEs. And should these companies
fail to transition successfully, it will put at risk the livelihoods
of many Singaporeans. Many employers are concerned that the foreign
workers restrictions announced in this Budget are coming at a time
of escalating business costs, a tight labour market and an uncertain
external environment. Many businesses are wondering if they would
survive the coming "squeeze", with so little room to manoeuvre. </p>

a theme that I raised at the Opening of Parliament last year: whilst
Singapore's overall jobless rate is at a 14-year low of 2%, the
employment rate of older workers between the ages of 55 and 64 is
only at 61%, and that of women is especially low, at 46%. Furthermore,
there are still about 235,000 economically inactive women between
the prime ages of 25 and 54 who may be re-inducted into the workforce.
These Singaporeans may not be suited for all jobs, but I hope companies
will take active steps, will think of all the possibilities to tap
into this pool of talent to ease the labour shortage, thus giving older workers
and women a chance to earn a living, raise living standards for
their families and live more fulfilling lives. </p>

productivity journey and reduce reliance on foreign workers, employers
need to re-engineer their operations by redesigning workflow and
processes, as well as leveraging technology and automation. Employers
need to accept that, in order to attract local workers, both their
salaries and working conditions will need to be improved. Companies
will also need to review their operating rhythms, job design and offer
flexi and part-time work arrangements. And, of course, employers
will also have to invest in the training and "onboarding" of new
staff. But once successfully inducted, they can form a strong stable
base of loyal employees and they can make a huge difference with
their local knowledge and insights, particularly in the services
sectors like retail, hospitality and tourism – who else should best
deliver the "Uniquely Singapore" experience, but a local Singaporean!</p>

said, the journey ahead will be painful, but it is a journey that

"one-size-fits-all" that cuts across companies of varying size and

their operations is not linear. During a change process, we sometimes
have to take one step back in order to take two steps forward. So,
for companies that have clearly embarked on a journey to restructure
for productivity, we should exercise discretion – give them "breathing
space", give them what they need to ready themselves for the gains
that are to come. Companies need the time it takes to establish
a new process, familiarise themselves with new machines or induct
and train new workers, particularly if they hire workers who have
left the workplace for some time. </p>

of the restructuring journey, we would do well to be sensitive to
the effects of our early efforts, to observe, learn and adapt as
we help steer SMEs through this critical transformation. It is important
to keep the overall targets steadfastly in sight, but just as important
to maintain flexibility, responsiveness and nimbleness in applying
our policies, all the while fine-tuning for continuous improvement. </p>

out to help SMEs with tailored sector-level interventions and support.
The Government has introduced a number of major initiatives to help businesses
with their drive towards productivity improvement. </p>

schemes, I found a total of 33 different assistance schemes designed
to provide companies with funding, expertise to improve processes and
capabilities, and/or training support. Twenty of these schemes are
generic and another 13 designed for specific industries. The productivity
schemes are all currently managed and administered by different
Government divisions or agencies such as Spring Singapore, IE Singapore,
IDA, e2i, WDA and others. </p>

they feel lost in this sea of complexity, they are unsure about which
schemes to apply for and how to go about it. It is especially challenging
for small businesses, with limited administrative resources, to
navigate through this ocean of paperwork, fathom the complex network
of schemes and properly execute the different application processes.</p>

to the Government to align all the productivity schemes to be company-centric,
organised along the lines of the 16 priority sectors identified
by the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council (NPCEC).</p>

to access the different productivity improvement schemes via one
single interface, whether it is for access to funding, productivity
strategies, or training. And there should be only one "all-in-one"
application to apply for any or a combination of these schemes.
This will then avoid duplicative efforts on the part of both the
Government agencies and the companies. This will also help provide
a consolidated view of the holistic productivity efforts of any
particular company; new schemes that are introduced later can be
easily added on as supplementary applications. </p>

to organise assistance schemes is consistent with the NPCEC philosophy
that each sector faces different challenges and requires different solutions
to improve productivity. We can reap economies of scale and offer
customised assistance that target the unique needs of that sector.
Companies further up the value chain can also help those that work
with them, raising productivity of the sector as a whole. Trade
associations and chambers (TACs) should play a key role in supporting
the Government and companies to map out productivity strategies
as well as serve as important platforms for migration of best practices.
Sir, the way in which we organise ourselves to champion SME productivity
can itself be a real lever to leapfrog and accelerate down the sector's
learning curve.</p>

internationalisation of Singapore companies is a key pillar of our
restructuring. This is becoming increasingly important as companies
leverage off overseas markets, labour pools, land and other resources.
Given the strength of our Singapore dollar, overseas market investments
are becoming even more attractive. We should accelerate our efforts
to build strong international Singapore enterprises, tap into the globalised
supply chain and expand Singapore's market share in global markets. </p>

do more to help SMEs is to encourage groups of local companies to
collaborate as they venture overseas. We can learn from the Japanese
and the Korean companies who do this particularly well. Their expansion
into other countries is usually spearheaded by big corporations
who will have the muscle and connections to secure large projects
overseas. Then they "bring along" a whole collection of smaller
companies or suppliers who will now have an anchor customer on which
to sustain their overseas presence whilst building up their own
funnel of business. There are many opportunities for Singapore companies
to do likewise – collaboration and symbiosis are the key. </p>

like to conclude by pointing out that the Government can only create
an enabling environment, rich with opportunity and facility. It
is up to the SMEs to seize the moment. I urge SMEs to step up, and
leverage the available schemes as much and as quickly as they can
to take their business to higher levels of productivity and competitiveness.
SMEs are the backbone of our economy. They provide over 60% of jobs,
they create value, they fulfil dreams of many Singaporean entrepreneurs. Singapore's
future depends heavily on the establishment of a strong and vibrant

Budget is based on the notion of building a more inclusive and stronger
nation. Many targeted measures are put in place in Budget 2012 to
help older Singaporeans, the disabled and the low-income earners, with
the aim of narrowing the rich-poor gap in Singapore.</p>

the GST Voucher – a permanent programme which would cost the Government
$680 million a year comprises of three components, namely, cash
payout, Medisave top-up and Usave rebates. In addition, there are
also permanent incentive schemes for housing, education and healthcare.
Optimistically, Singaporeans will have a better future with all
these policies in place. </p>

experts, academics, businessmen and common Singaporeans reported
in the media, it can be said that most Singaporeans support Budget
2012. However, there is a group of Singaporeans who felt that there
could be more handouts as the grants could only cover one month's
expenses, older Singaporeans felt that it is more practical to give
cash handouts than to raise the CPF contribution rate, while SMEs felt
that reducing the foreign worker quota will affect the way they
operate. No government can implement a perfect Budget. What is important
is whether a government can set a Budget that best benefits most
of its citizens. In my view, the Singapore Government is one such
government. </p>

an interview on 26 February 2012 with Mr G Muthukumarasamy, General-Secretary

most daily-rated workers are either from the cleaning industry or related
industries. They are mostly aged between 40 years and over 60 years
old, earning a monthly salary below $1,200. The same report also
published a survey by a research company commissioned by the NTUC
Unit for Contract and Casual Workers which showed that among the

are fair and reasonable, providing a sense of security for low-wage

to join these industries and reduce our dependency on foreign labour.

restructuring and increasing productivity have been emphasised by

Government ensure a broader range of finance for SMEs who are struggling

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>
                  </span>:
Sir, I rise in support of the Government's Budget. Let me speak
first on foreign workers. Sir, the Government has indicated that we
need to manage our dependence on foreign workers and, in the long
term, avoid having foreign workers beyond one-third of our labour
force. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b7ca4ea3-0f73-4c7e-9404-ca4a7ad5df5a">
                  <a name="budget__id-b7ca4ea3-0f73-4c7e-9404-ca4a7ad5df5a"><!--a--></a>For the past few years,
we have received many complaints that we have too many foreign workers
in Singapore. Their presence has caused a squeeze on the limited available
public amenities. So, Singaporeans complain that the public transport
like buses, trains are overcrowded, food centres are overcrowded,
public places like beaches and parks are overcrowded. It is more
difficult for Singaporeans to own their first property because of
the competition from a large influx of foreigners. Singaporeans
also worry about the limited places in our hospitals and universities
being taken up by the presence of more foreigners. Thus, it is only
sensible that we should do more to encourage our companies to try
to employ Singaporeans first.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5d3d5c8e-3f51-472e-9aa4-9ca8ed96e961">
                  <a name="budget__id-5d3d5c8e-3f51-472e-9aa4-9ca8ed96e961"><!--a--></a>However, I do urge the
Government to monitor this situation carefully. Ever since the Government
tightened the supply of foreign workers last year, I have received
many appeals from owners of small enterprises asking for help to
allow them to employ certain categories of foreign workers. These
employers claim that Singaporeans are not willing to work in certain
industries and, hence, they have no choice but to rely on foreign
workers. For example, the employers tell me that Singaporeans generally
shun from jobs in the cleaning industry and in the construction
industry; they also tell me that Singaporeans do not wish to work
in the nursing field or in the service line as waiters or sales
staff. Thus, some employers have said that if they are not allowed
to employ foreigners to supplement their workforce, their business
may no longer be viable. These small companies may have to either
liquidate their business or be forced to relocate. And in such cases,
Singaporeans employed by such businesses may also lose their jobs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d78e6c65-73ad-4e58-a00a-d75957b6a5fb">
                  <a name="budget__id-d78e6c65-73ad-4e58-a00a-d75957b6a5fb"><!--a--></a>From the feedback given,
Singaporeans ask that we reduce the foreign workers in areas which
our Singaporean children are being trained for. Thus, many Singaporeans ask
why are they or their children facing stiff competition for middle
management jobs; for IT-related jobs, for jobs in the banking or
finance sector. These are jobs for which Singaporeans are trained
for and they are aspiring towards. Thus, the request is for the Government
to relax the criteria for certain labour intensive industries –
at the construction line and the cleaning line – but we need to
tighten our criteria to reduce the number of S Pass workers or other
professional workers into the country.</p>

held with residents, several residents had also expressed concern
about the additional costs that businesses have to incur as a result of
having to employ more Singaporean workers at a higher wage. </p>

in manpower costs been factored into by the Government? Would this
result in higher cost of living? Would this contribute to higher
inflation for the next few years? I urge the Government to study
this issue carefully to ensure that cost of living does not increase
drastically for all Singaporeans even as we try to limit the impact
of having too many foreign workers in Singapore.</p>

about the inclusive society. I support the effort of the Government
to build an inclusive society for a stronger Singapore. The objective
of most Budgets is to redistribute wealth from those who are better
off to those who are not so well off. Personally, I would prefer
not to have taxes collected by the Government and redistributed
amongst all Singaporeans whether they need the financial subsidies
or not.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aa08c7bf-097a-495f-9a42-2ab258effc28">
                  <a name="budget__id-aa08c7bf-097a-495f-9a42-2ab258effc28"><!--a--></a>There is an urgent need
to plan for the future to reduce the income divide between those
who are well-off and those citizens who may not have benefited from
our system for whatever reasons. Thus, I am glad that that this
year's Budget focused on the three groups – our senior Singaporeans,
Singaporeans with disabilities and the lower income group. It clearly
shows that the Government is planning for the future and has a heart for
the less advantaged in our society.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f37b67d9-7924-4641-b269-e6171b253ce9">
                  <a name="budget__id-f37b67d9-7924-4641-b269-e6171b253ce9"><!--a--></a>Sir, I note that this
year, the Government will have a small surplus of about $1.27 billion
after transfer of NIRC (Net Investment Returns Contribution). The
surplus last year was $2.32 billion. Would it not be better for
the Government to run a balanced budget each year rather than have
such a surplus? After all, we will have set aside half of the NIRC
into the country's reserves. And for this year, that NIRC amount
is projected at $7.33 billion.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cc567adb-5f94-45c5-ab05-23cce56d7b12">
                  <a name="budget__id-cc567adb-5f94-45c5-ab05-23cce56d7b12"><!--a--></a>Sir, allow me to make
the following suggestions for the Government's consideration: this
year's Budget proposal provides that only Singaporeans whose property
annual value is below $20,000 would receive GST Vouchers. There
are several retirees living in landed properties in my constituency
without any income at all. The annual value of their old landed
properties may be in excess of $20,000. They are asset rich but
cash poor; and they are reluctant to sell their properties because
they have lived in their properties all their lives until they retire;
their friends living with them as well. Surely for these residents,
they should also be eligible for GST Vouchers since they have no income.
The proposed scheme provides that even those citizens who have an
income of up to $24,000 would be eligible for the GST Vouchers.
Since we do have a small Budget surplus, can we not be more generous
and extend the GST Vouchers to those citizens living in properties
with an annual value of perhaps not more than $30,000 but without any
income at all? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d12198ab-988d-40d6-b424-fe18aee8a1b0">
                  <a name="budget__id-d12198ab-988d-40d6-b424-fe18aee8a1b0"><!--a--></a>Next, Sir, every year,
property tax is assessed and constantly increased. That increase in
property tax has been a constant bug bear amongst my residents.
Property tax is a tax on assets. However, in Singapore, where the
national policy is to encourage home ownership, many Singaporeans
question why do they have to pay property tax on a property in which
they reside in? They also face constant upwards revision in the property tax year
after year. Sir, we have reviewed property tax in the 2010 Budget.
May I urge the Government to consider waiving property tax for properties
which are owner occupied or, alternatively, property tax can be
remitted for properties with an annual value of less than $30,000
and which are owner occupied? The Government can continue to impose
the wealth tax on properties which are used for investment and not for
owner occupation. </p>

try to help our seniors live well and live long, I note that we
have not made any provision for our pensioners who have contributed
much in the growth of Singapore during our earlier nation building
years. Inflation has eaten into their pension. I raised this point
last year and I would like to appeal again to the Minister for Finance
to consider a cost of living adjustment for these pensioners. There
is also another group of people who face difficulties due to our
pro-family policies. Can we consider doing more in our housing policies
for the singles and the divorcees? This group of people do deserve
consideration for more help to own their flats as well. I will elaborate
on this point during the COS debate.</p>

hon Member, Mr Hri Kumar, who spoke earlier before me, I urge the
Government to consider accelerating say, a pilot programme to construct
lifts at overhead bridges. Sir, I have a large number of elderly
residents living in Tanjong Rhu. They struggle everyday to cross
Mountbatten Road because of a high and steep overhead pedestrian
bridge. For years, they have raised this complaint to me and asked for
a traffic crossing along the road or for a lift to be built at the
pedestrian bridge. With an ageing population, the need for a lift
at the bridge is no longer a luxury but fast becoming a necessity
for these residents. </p>

on the Bus Services Enhancement Fund. Like many other Members before
me, I wish to express concern about the $1.1 billion Bus Services Enhancement
Fund which the Minister for Finance announced during the Budget.
Whilst I applaud the efforts of the Government to try to improve
the bus capacity and to reduce overcrowding, I am concerned about
the impact on the Public Transport Operators because they have to
hire more drivers and they have to incur more maintenance costs and
depreciation costs on the new buses.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-da5d8913-e1e8-4927-8107-b0396bc69291">

expressed that these additional buses would allow the transport
operators to increase their fares. Could we have more details as
to how the Bus Services Enhancement Fund work? Who owns the buses?
Who would bear the depreciation costs and maintenance costs on the
buses? Very importantly, would the additional buses result in higher
fares this year or the next year? Would it not be better for the
Government to subsidise the costs of public transport directly with
this injection of $1.1 billion? I urge the Government to explain
clearly what is the rationale for the Government to inject such
a substantial sum of money into the listed transport companies.
Are taxpayers being asked to foot the bill for dividends to be paid
to the shareholders of the transport companies? This topic has been
of concern to many Singaporeans and I will submit that the Government
should clear the air as soon as possible.</p>

past two days, almost every Member of this House who spoke had given
suggestions to the Minister for Finance on how he can improve on
the Budget; or asked him to give more; or asked him to consider
various disadvantaged groups which may have been left out in the
Budget. It is in the nature of politics for politicians to keep advocating
for more improvements to make Singapore better. But I believe that
we should always
give credit to the Government when due. I look up the past few years' Budgets,
I recall that the Government had introduced Workfare in 2007 to
help supplement the income of lower-wage workers and, in that year,
gave out $4 billion in GST offset packages. In 2008, the Government
gave out $865 million in growth dividends to all Singaporeans and
then topped up Medisave for the elderly. During the recession in
2009, the Government had introduced the Resilience Package costing
$20.5 billion of which $5.1 billion went to Jobs Credit so that
we can preserve jobs for all Singaporeans. And another $580 million
was given out in GST Credits of which more went to the elderly and
the lower income. In 2010, the Government had provided $100 million
for the Workfare Income Supplement, again to help the lower income
and to top up Medisave accounts for Singaporeans aged 50 and above.
Last year, the Government gave $3.2 billion in the Grow and Share
Package with substantial amounts again going to the elderly's Medisave
and substantial amounts going to the lower income Singaporeans. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-bd99f51d-c77e-48de-bdb0-ede05f27b2f5"><!--a--></a>Sir, I believe that the
Government's record of helping the elderly and lower income speaks
for itself. This year's Budget is an extension of the caring PAP
Government that I know; a government with a caring heart for the
people. Can more be done by the Government? Of course, more can
be done – which is why I believe many Members in this House serve,
so that we can continue working with the Government to improve the lives
of Singaporeans and to improve the lives of those who are disadvantaged
or under-privileged and who need more help in society. Sir, I believe
that this year's Budget is especially helpful to those with disabilities
because of the constant advocacy by the hon Member for Jalan Besar
GRC, Ms Denise Phua. And I hope that in my term, I too could serve
and make an improvement to the lives of my constituents because
of my advocacy on their behalf. Sir, I support the Budget.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, over the last two and a half days, we have heard 63 speakers
before me and we have heard much praise about this Budget from both sides
of the House. Fundamentally, I think we are in agreement that this
is a good Budget. However, looking at the new media, looking at
the papers, looking at the <em class="ph i">Forum</em> pages – some have criticised
this Budget as nothing new as compared to the past while some Members
in this House have described this Budget as signifying a new left
shift to take care of the vulnerable members of the society. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-af5ac6f4-09eb-4909-ab91-294787de28fe">
                  <a name="budget__id-af5ac6f4-09eb-4909-ab91-294787de28fe"><!--a--></a>In certain ways, I think
both groups are right. I would like to borrow the famous phrase
from Mr Lim Swee Say, "same-same but different". Why same-same?
Same-same is because the additional assistance and support given
to the elderly and given to the needy has always been a constant
feature for all five preceding Budgets that were debated in this
House. I think the hon Member before me, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, has stated
all the figures. I shall not repeat that. The Government has always
paid special attention to the elderly and to the needy in all previous
Budgets handouts and redistributions. And this is true for the previous
utility and conservancy rebates, Workfare Income Supplement Scheme,
GST rebates, Growth Dividends, Singapore Shares, and it is the same
with the GST Voucher. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1591</p>

if this were the first time that this Government provides assistance
to the elderly and needy, but this is not true. Some called this
Budget "populist", some called this as a response to General Elections
2011, some called this as a fundamental shift. But whatever one
calls it, it does not matter. What matters most is the benefit of
this Budget that will bring to the people of Singapore and to Singapore. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-73713905-5fbe-4933-9712-a769dcf5cad1">
                  <a name="budget__id-73713905-5fbe-4933-9712-a769dcf5cad1"><!--a--></a>Now, let me go through
what is the "different". Although this Budget is same-same but different,
there are three ways that this Budget defers greatly from previous
Budgets. First, this Government that we know is extremely prudent
when it comes to budgeting. The Government will not promise something
that it cannot deliver. In the past, we expect a good Budget payout
if the Government enjoys a windfall surplus in finances as we witnessed
in 2007. The Government will share and redistribute part of the
surpluses to support the needy and the elderly. Such programmes
are usually once-off exercise that will not affect future budgets
and they will not put a strain on the next generation. The Government
usually already has the money in the Government's coffer or has
plans on how to get this money before distribution. Such programmes
are like the once-off GST Offset Package, the top-up of the post-secondary
accounts for students, the Medisave top-ups for the elderly, Singapore
shares, Growth Dividends, etc. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0855173c-61a0-4f9f-9836-c107f5d2c6b2">
                  <a name="budget__id-0855173c-61a0-4f9f-9836-c107f5d2c6b2"><!--a--></a>This time round it is
slightly different. The Government announced a surplus of $2.3 billion
for the financial year but pledged to set aside $3.6 billion for
GST Vouchers over the next five years and also to double the healthcare
spending annually from $4 billion to $8 billion per year. This is
certainly a significant departure from previous Budget. While I
welcome the change, I am also concerned with whether the increase
in social spending is sustainable or will it erode away our financial
prudence that we painstakingly built up over the years. Is this
increased recurrent spending sustainable? Will this lead to higher
direct or indirect taxes that Singaporeans need to pay in the near future? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-83017202-4831-4409-bd74-1d1ec4776136">
                  <a name="budget__id-83017202-4831-4409-bd74-1d1ec4776136"><!--a--></a>I think many Members of
this House have given more suggestions and are asking for more.
The question I would pose is: where do the resources come from?
The GST Vouchers will require $0.6 billion per year and the Workfare
Income Supplement Scheme costs the Government about $0.5 billion
per year. The Government will be making transfers of $1.1 billion
annually. While the WIS is funded by the proposed GST increase when
it was announced, how is the GST Vouchers funded in the long term?
The current fiscal surplus was possible because of a strong property
market and good corporate earnings for the last financial year.
But will this last year after year? We cannot expect a repeat as
we are experiencing a slowdown in the property market with cooling-off
measures implemented by the Government and also corporate earnings
may be hit, may be below expectations with the unstable global financial
markets and rising oil prices due to potential Middle East conflicts. </p>

including the hon Ms Denise Phua and NMP Laurence Lien in this House,
calling for higher taxation for those in the higher income group
and also to re-prioritise our current Government spending, especially
on defence. If you look at the Government's revenue, the total amount
that is brought in mainly by personal income tax comes out to about
$6 billion to $7 billion per year. The corporate tax doubles that
to about $12 billion. The Net Investment Income contributes about
$8 billion whereas the GST – about $8 billion. Rising income tax
on high wage earners itself will have a small impact actually on
the overall because it is the lowest of the four high figures there. Raising
income tax on high wage earners may risk an exodus of these high wage
earners who are very mobile and will be readily accepted by many
other countries. </p>

an alternative: that we relook at the Net Investment Income that
is earned from our national reserves. Currently, the Government
is already tapping half of the Net Investment Income which contributes
about $7 billion to $8 billion annually for our Government's expenditure.
If we need to, can we increase by another 10%, which is about $700
million annually, to fund the additional amount needed for the GST
Vouchers? Our national reserves represent the hard work and the
accumulation of wealth contributed by our fathers and grandfathers
and all those before us. Today, many of them are in their golden
years. There is no need for us to continue to increase our national
reserves at such a rapid pace. Is there one? After all, all land
sales proceeds still go to the national reserves, and with about
40% of Net Investment Income going back to national reserves, the
reserves will not be depleted but will still be increasing, but
just at a slower pace.</p>

like to make is that this is a more "silver" Budget than in the past.
While the Government has always supported the elderly in the past
with various programmes and schemes introduced, all programmes,
including GST Offset Package, Singapore Shares, Growth Dividends,
were tilt towards the favour of the elderly and to provide better
support for this generation. It is the right thing to do. It does
reflect our Singapore societal values. However, previous Budgets
would have significant focus on growing the economic pie so that
we can continue to have resources to support our social programmes.
Previous Budgets would also have focus on investing in the young for
the future and also investing in R&amp;D, so we can continue to
innovate and stay ahead of the regional economic race. Previous
Budgets also had economic focus to strengthen our position as a
transport hub and as a financial and business centre. Although the Deputy
Prime Minister has emphasised that our growth strategy is largely
intact, focusing on rising productivity and the efforts that we
started a few years ago, the focus is obviously not as prominent
as in previous years.</p>

bold moves to support our elderly through employment credits for
seniors, raising the CPF contribution rate, silver housing bonus,
GST Vouchers and increase in healthcare expenditure. These are long-term
social programmes. May I ask what is the projected increase in expenditure
in the next five, 10, 20 years, as we approach 2030 when one in
five Singaporeans are above 65 years old?</p>

Asian values and supporting our elderly in our families remains
critical in this respect. What is the long-term strategy of the Government
for our silver generation? What is their role in taking care of
the elderly? When the state takes on more responsibilities to take
care of the elderly, will that erode the responsibility of the family?
How is the Government maintaining this balance? Should more incentives
be introduced to encourage families to take care of the elderly at
home in our society? While building more elderly homes is needed,
will more homes lead to young families dumping their elderly to
these institutions? Can the Government do more to support families
taking care of the elderly at home?</p>

like to touch on is the green focus. I have spoken on this year after
year for the last five years. I am hoping more for this Budget to
encourage all of us to adopt a green mindset. I am glad that the
green vehicle rebate has been rectified to be based on carbon emission.
The previous green car rebate did not take into account carbon emission
at all. In fact, many of the large cc green cars, including some
SUVs which actually emit much more carbon than normal non-green
cars, are given a green rebate because they are fitted with a small
hybrid engine and a small battery. However, the $20,000 rebate on
the Additional Registration Fee (ARF) seems pale in comparison with
the green car rebate, and I wonder whether it will actually make
a difference to the green car population in Singapore. We had mooted
in this House a green car COE, but the problem was in the definition
of "what is a green car". I hope the Government can still consider
this suggestion but now change it to a low carbon emission COE –
we can still call it a green COE – as a sure way of obtaining buy-in
from the population. I doubt the current carbon emission-based rebate
would significantly increase our green vehicles on our roads, and
I suspect we still have a long road ahead to see a greater proportion
of green vehicles on the road.</p>

incentives to support green industries although the Government has
earlier identified that a possible growth sector for Singapore is
to develop green industry. Green buildings are reported in the media
occasionally, and we are building an eco city in Tianjin. What have
we done to promote more green buildings in our own city? Can more
be done to ensure our buildings comply to green codes so we can
be more efficient with our energy needs? Since the price of solar
panels have dropped significantly in recent years, can we do more
to encourage buildings, both public and private, to install solar
panels on their roofs and open spaces? We should encourage energy
generated to be channelled and sold back to the grid during the
day so as to reduce our reliance on non-renewable energy sources.
Can the Government incentivise Town Councils, private property owners,
to install more solar panels on the roofs of covered walkways, roofs
of carparks, roofs of HDB flats and other properties, systematically
to increase the use of solar energy over time? The Budget did not
cater for a greener Singapore. What is our long-term strategy towards
a greener Singapore?</p>

echo the concerns of many Members on the reduction of foreign labour
force. I do, however, disagree with the Non-Constituency Member
of Parliament, Mrs Lina Chiam, in her analogy that cheap foreign
labour force is like performance-enhancing drugs. I have spoken
on this topic for the last three years during Budget, and I think
describing cheap foreign labour as an addictive narcotic drug is
more appropriate. Addictive narcotic drugs will give instant gratification
and numb all pain for the users. Over time, the drug will weaken
the user and, ultimately, leading to destruction, while performance-enhancing
drug will artificially boost the performance but may not have long-term
detrimental effects on the user, and they are usually not addictive. Performance-enhancing
drugs can be withdrawn without any withdrawal symptoms. If we stopped
all foreign labour tomorrow, many businesses will suffer immediate withdrawal
symptoms; some may even have cardiac arrests instantly. </p>

drug addict is still cold turkey treatment but with proper support.
But I am glad that the Government is not doing that, bearing in
mind that the Government has basically suggested a reduction in
the dependency ratio, not completely abolishing it until zero. There
must be proper support given to treat drug addicts. Likewise, the
Government's approach of enhanced Productivity and Innovation Credit
and enhanced training support is similar to the support given. However,
just like treating drug addicts, the therapy must be a closely supervised
one, as many addicts will not follow through the therapy or treatment
voluntarily on their own. We have witnessed that in our drug addicts,
and we have witnessed that in our businesses and SMEs as well. </p>

my request in last year's speech for a more individualised and more
supervised approach to each company or business that is addicted
and has grown too dependent on cheap foreign labour. Many do not
have the insight of how they can be weaned off. If they give up,
many good jobs for Singaporeans would be lost in the process. I
hope the Government can provide more proactive consultancy service
on increasing productivity to companies in need.</p>

raise the issue of retirement adequacy. I am very concerned that the
main items that Singaporeans rely on are their CPF savings and their
HDB flat. These are their two most valuable assets when they retire.
The CPF was originally intended as a saving scheme to meet our basic
needs in our old age, as we did away with the pension scheme. Along
the way, there were more and more requests to use the CPF for other purposes
such as housing, education, healthcare and investments. The CPF
is a limited pool of resources, especially for the lower income
group. For this group, there is hardly any amount left after deducting
the CPF for housing. CPF LIFE and annuity plan were started to ensure
a constant and steady supply of a stream of income for our retirement. However,
for most, it is insufficient to depend on the monthly payout alone.
The HDB flat remains as the most valuable asset many Singaporeans
have when they retire. One way of supplementing their income is
to allow HDB flat owners to unlock the value of their flats, and
owners can do this in three ways: one, rent out the rooms or even
the whole flat if they have an alternative place to reside in; two,
the Government's Lease Buyback Scheme as enhanced by this Budget;
three, they can sell and right-size their flat with the Silver Bonus
given by the Government as well. So, the elderly who own the flat
can have various options to monetise their flat asset. There is
really no preferred option as it is really up to the elderly now
to decide what is best for them, depending on their individual preference
and the family support that they have. Hence, in my opinion, there is
really no need for the Government to provide an annual report on
actually how many have opted for each option, as suggested by a
Member in the House.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4ba4716e-9ff3-49ef-b606-baad079df567">
                  <a name="budget__id-4ba4716e-9ff3-49ef-b606-baad079df567"><!--a--></a>All these options are
only possible if HDB flat prices remain stable. What happens if HDB
flat prices drop, as many Members have hoped for in this House?
The elderly homeowners will be left with a less valuable asset.
With the current ramping up of supply of HDB flats to meet the increasing
demand, I fear that we may see another round of HDB flat oversupply
situation as we had witnessed more than a decade ago. Currently,
there are nearly one million flats for 3.2 million Singaporeans
and 0.6 million Permanent Residents. That is almost equal to one
flat for every 3.8 residents, assuming all of them staying in HDB flats. The
current building pace will certainly outpace the demand and swing
the pendulum to the other extreme if we are not careful. With the tightening
and slowing down of the foreign labour force, the demand of housing
will also ease somehow. This is likely to affect the rental market
and will affect property prices indirectly. With the triple whammy
of increased supply of both HDB and private properties, reduced
demand from the reduction or stagnation of foreign labour force
in Singapore and the property-tightening measures implemented by
the Government recently, the most likely effect is a further depression
of HDB property prices. How will that affect our elderly HDB homeowners? </p>

with the sustainability of old HDB flats. HDB flats, after all, are
99-year leasehold properties. Almost one-third of the flats are
more than 30 years old now, which means only two-thirds of the lease
are remaining. In another two decades, they will be 50 years old
with less than half of their lease remaining. Can they still command
the prices today? Will banks or HDB still give loans to buyers of
such properties with less than 49 years of lease left? What happens
to these flat owners? I do not think it is realistic to expect the
Government of the day to <em class="ph i">en bloc</em> all these flats or to expect
buyers of these flats to fork out what they are willing to pay today.
I do not have any suggestions on this issue, but I hope the Government
will address this early and prepare the owners of these flats for
the eventuality. </p>

plan and do not have the means to plan for their retirement adequacy.
With our ageing population and shifting demographics and reduced
dependency ratio, we cannot rely on the next generation to fund

retirement adequacy. </p>

in the throes of a serious global financial crisis. Many of us remember
the economic gloom at that time. It affected many Singaporeans and
the future looked uncertain and distinctly uncomfortable. But the
Government responded quickly and decisively. It introduced measures
in the Budget at that stage to pull Singapore away from the serious
crisis, with programmes to save jobs, create new ones, provide assistance
to those affected. We have Special Risk-Sharing Initiative (SPUR),
we have Jobs Credit Scheme, and these were just some of the programmes
which were added to Workfare at that time, and may I say, to great
effect. </p>

rebounded faster and stronger than expected. We posted a record
growth of 14.5% in 2010. This was achieved in no small measure because
of the forward thinking in both Budget and Government policies which
were introduced at the time when the global economy remained in
serious depression.</p>

growth in 2010 has, however, masked some of the challenges which
we have in our economy. A growth of about 5% last year is good,
but it is fair to say that 2012 opened with much less positive sentiment
in the economy than at the start of last year. We need only look
around at the US economy, or anywhere in Europe to know that this
year will be a challenging one. Some challenges are new; some are
old. We have a declining birth rate, an ageing population, a growing
income inequality and an increasing strain on some of our infrastructural
resources like transport and healthcare.</p>

be seen in the light of the prevailing conditions, both in Singapore
and externally, against which this Budget is to be applied. In my
view, this is a Budget that reflects Singapore's philosophy, perhaps
even a need, to always remain ahead of the curve. We have to embrace
change and harness it, before change overtakes us. In the face of
a tight labour market and rising costs, we must find a way to reinvent and
reinvigorate our workforce. As Minister Lim Swee Say put it so well
yesterday, we have
to suffer some short-term pains in adjusting and restructuring,
in order to reap longer term rewards of a more productive and innovative
workforce. </p>

underpinning this change is a deliberate move away from over reliance
on foreign workers. A lot has been said in this House about this
and I cannot add much to the debate. I only want to say that I support
the initiative, and I welcome the fact that the Budget does not
expect our businesses to trade foreign workers for increased productivity
and innovation overnight, and a period of adjustment is indeed catered
for. I hope that in this adjustment period, the Ministry of Manpower
will look more closely at the deserving appeals which will no doubt
be made for the entry of foreign workers for some small and medium
businesses. </p>

even in the immediate short term, the foreign worker policy can only
be good for our lower-wage workers. In this respect, I heard the
Member for Aljunied, Mr Chen Show Mao, make a case yesterday for
lowering the bar for the entry of foreign workers in the low wage
sectors, particularly. The upshot of his proposal is that our Singaporean
low-wage workers will have increased competition for jobs at that level,
and this will ultimately depress the wages for the already low-wage
workers. These were the very same arguments canvassed very strongly
by the Workers' Party not too long ago and, I believe, from what
I heard yesterday, ran directly counter to what the hon Member,
Mr Chen, had pressed for in Parliament yesterday.</p>

One very visible and marked emphasis in this Budget is the deliberate
stepping up of social policies to provide greater economic security
for a range of less advantaged in our society. In addition, this
Budget introduced, I believe for the first time, a permanent transfer
scheme by way of the GST Vouchers. This is distributed to Singaporeans
by way of U-save credits, Medisave top-ups and straight cash.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-739da063-87c7-4c24-bc40-6cb96f4c83b0">
                  <a name="budget__id-739da063-87c7-4c24-bc40-6cb96f4c83b0"><!--a--></a>As the Deputy Prime Minister
has acknowledged, the income inequality in Singapore has widened
over time, and it will be here to stay. Singapore, like any newly
developing global city, sees a significant income gap, and the trend
in the last 10 years shows that the income gap will likely grow
larger. If you look back at the last 10 years, the Gini Co-efficient
has grown steadily from 2000 to 2010. It is true that many other
countries, including advanced Asian economies like Japan and South
Korea, have also experienced rising Gini Co-efficients in the same
period. But, as I understand it, their rate of growth is not as
quick as that of Singapore's. </p>

that we see and transfers aimed directly at helping the low income
will be a feature that will be here to stay. Indeed, the GST Vouchers
will be a long-term feature of our fiscal policy and not just a
temporary offset measure. This, Sir, signifies the Government's
assessment that the income gap will not be significantly bridged
anytime soon, and, by extension, we are also likely see progressively
enhanced social policies to assist the lower-income Singaporeans.</p>

policies, part of making this Budget an inclusive one, received
widespread cheers when the Deputy Prime Minister announced them,
and I support them. I particularly support the measures which address
the disabled and the elderly because it is those two groups who
will likely find employment very challenging and difficult.</p>

these measures were that we should be careful that we do not go
too far with these measures and end up on the slippery slope to
being a welfare state. Welfarism has long been said to be the anti-thesis
of competitive culture. In Singapore, we maintain our competitive
meritocracy and we have steered clear of the welfare mentality.
Our public assistance and other similar schemes are very rigorously
means tested, and granted only for a limited period of time to discourage
welfare dependency.</p>

that this Budget creates an attitude of welfarism. I believe public
spending in Singapore on social programmes still lags behind the
pace of economic development in Singapore and still remains the
smallest amongst our competing, developed economies, and for good
reason. Our economic competitors − such as Hong Kong, South Korea
and Taiwan − they have a much larger social programme and they have
also not lost their competitive edge.</p>

be careful as we revise and add to the social policies in later years,
particularly where it involves permanent transfers. The GST Voucher
will now be a permanent feature in future fiscal policies. We have
heard the hon. Member Dr Lim Wee Kiak said that this will cost the
Government $3.6 billion over the next five years. This is a policy
which will grow to become an entitlement for Singapore and Singaporeans will
depend on it. In contrast to temporary offset packages, it will
be more difficult to remove or re-calibrate such permanent transfers.</p>

strive to balance the free-market operation of the economy with
concern for the less advantaged, but never at the expense of undermining

growth and economy. </p>

is that on investments we made in education. The Budget recognises
that central to the uplifting of low-income families is the enhancement
of education opportunities for our children – all of our children.
I agree entirely with that. I am heartened to see that the Budget
allocation to the Ministry of Education is amongst the highest.
This comprises pre-school subsidies, which now operate on a per
capita basis, MOE Financial Assistance Scheme, where the income
ceiling has been raised from S$1,500 to S$2,500 per month and, finally,
a $200 million top-up to the Edusave Endowment Fund. </p>

in October last year, President Tony Tan, in his Address to the
House, noted that heavy investments have been made and continue
to be made in education for the young, and that we should maximise
their pathways, give them options, help them gain confidence and
blossom. Sir, to me, this is absolutely vital and there is no doubt
in my mind that the future of Singapore lies in our children, and
a good all round education gives our children from the lower income
families the best opportunity to break out of the lower income mould,
and to do well for themselves in life.</p>

continually upgrading our education system at the primary, secondary
and tertiary levels. There have been progressive changes which the MOE
has made to our education system over the years. The most recent
ones have been most
exciting. The focus has shifted to quality and diversity, with the
goal being to develop the potential of every child to maximum, such
that we attain many and different peaks of excellence, particularly
in terms of character development and the inculcation of a good
value system in our children. In addition, more choices are being
introduced for students so that they can develop their strengths
and interests in sports, in arts, in culture, in intellectual endeavours
as well as to enhance the varied pathways offered to our students.</p>

about how much the Government spends or hands out, or what subsidies
there are, or what bursaries there are, or what financial assistance
can be obtained. Singaporeans must themselves endeavour to play
up to their strengths and seek out their own pathways.</p>

cited the example of Mohd Fairoz, a student from Yusof Ishak Secondary
School. It was a very heart-warming story. He comes from a lower-income
family. He has obtained a variety of Edusave bursaries and scholarships,

to embrace diversity, seek their own paths of success and take the
opportunities which present themselves, which this Budget strives to
achieve. Too many Singaporeans grumble about the workload in school,
or the competition with foreign students or spend all their free
time at tuition centres. I believe, with the investments we have
made in our education system and the emphasis which MOE has given,
we now have a system of pathways which can shoulder the nurturing of
different talents and allow our students to pursue different dreams
at different times. I urge Singaporeans to be broad minded in pursuing
that dream. Be like Mohd Fairoz or be not, and choose your own path.</p>

with one observation. Again, the Deputy Prime Minister's closing
remarks to the Budget Statement resonated strongly with me. He said,
and if I may quote: "Opportunity, improving ourselves, compassion.
They define the character of our society we are building, and must
be our common purpose as Singaporeans." This statement does not
just define the goals of this Budget and what it seeks to deliver to
Singaporeans. It is a statement which sets our national agenda.
It is a statement which tells us what the Government sees as its
vision of Singapore and what we want to achieve. I agree entirely
with it. It also reminds all of us, as elected representatives of Singaporeans,
that our collective mission, indeed, is to improve the lives of
all Singaporeans. Sir, with that, I support the Budget.</p>

about our SMEs. Do they have a future? What role will they play
in our economy? Will they be a vibrant part of it or will they suffer
and find it difficult to survive, year after year? The SME sector
is a key concern for our economic policies. They are also important
from the social point of view because they are mainly owned by Singaporeans
and hire a majority of Singaporean workers. Therefore, keeping that
part of our economy alive and thriving is also a way in which we
preserve an inclusive society. </p>

expensive, because wages have gone up significantly for Singaporeans.
Basically, the labour market is tight and will remain that way.
This is however a good thing for Singaporean workers, and we do
not want this to change. Second, rentals are increasing. This is
principally because of our natural constraints as a city-state,
and the fact our business community is on the whole doing well.
Demand for office, industrial and commercial space has gone up faster
than supply because we have many more businesses being formed, and
growing. These are the two major cost drivers: a tight labour market
with rising wages and a strong demand for space (industrial, commercial,
office) which is driving up rentals. Rentals also follow a cycle, and
hopefully this year, rental growth will level off. We are already
seeing signs of moderation in average rentals. MTI will be addressing

try to mitigate or slow down the pace of cost increases. With regard
to the cost of commercial and industrial space, we are increasing
what we are putting out to meet demand in the Government land sales

over the medium term. If Members look at the potential supply of
new shop space, there are 90,000 square metres of new shop space
coming on stream each year over the next five years. For industrial
land too – extra land is coming on stream. In fact, 24 hectares
of industrial land is being made available in the first half of

let me first make clear that foreign workers are and will remain
integral to our economy and to our competitiveness. They are a valuable complement
to the Singaporean core that we must keep building up in every segment of
our workforce. They are arms and legs, and part of the brain, of
a competitive global city. Foreign employees are a valuable complement
to our Singaporean core.</p>

foreign workers at all levels of our workforce – those with low
skills and in areas where you do not normally find Singaporeans;
those with technical skills; and those with the higher skills, the
talented or entrepreneurial individuals who bring specialised skills,
networks and opportunities for Singapore – this strategy has by
and large worked. It has gone hand in hand with the rise in incomes
of Singaporeans, both lower income Singaporeans as well as our middle
income Singaporeans. You have seen the data.</p>

very clear two years ago after the Economic Strategies Committee's
Committee Report, when we started tightening. We introduced a three-year
programme of increasing foreign worker levies. Last year, we accentuated
the increases, because foreign worker growth had been rapid in an
unusually strong economic recovery. This year, we are taking a further
step, with a calibrated reduction in dependency ratio ceilings, again because
the growth of foreign workers continues to be rapid – and much more
rapid than the growth of local workforce. </p>

move. We have to watch how rapidly the foreign workforce grows this
year. And if need be, we will have to make further moves particularly
in the foreign worker (FW) levies in the years to come. We will
watch this carefully over this next year, and calibrate our moves
so that businesses can adjust. We will also accompany any further
levy increases with support for businesses to help them upgrade.</p>

views on the pace of FW tightening. Some Members, such as Mr Zainal

squarely in favour of the pace we have adopted in tightening policies.
Some others were concerned and understandably, such as Mr Teo Siong
Seng, Mr Inderjit Singh and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah. They were concerned
about whether SMEs would be able to cope and whether we are moving
a bit too fast. </p>

Mr Chen Show Mao, I think, now recognise that we have to maintain
a very careful balance in how we go about our foreign worker policy.
I think you have shifted your position because I have checked what
was said previously during the 2010 and 2011 Budget and COS debates
and also your Workers' Party manifesto in last year's General Election
when you criticised the Government for allowing in too many foreign
workers. I think your position now accords with ours, and recognises
that this is a very careful balance. First, because we have to ensure
that our companies can stay competitive, and that Singaporeans thereby
keep their jobs and their incomes continue to grow. Second, we have
to be extremely concerned about the SMEs, which you have all rightly
emphasised. If we withdraw the foreign workers too quickly, this
will curb our SMEs and they will not be able to cope with the pace
of change. But if we are too slow in tightening on foreign worker
policies, the incentive to upgrade will also lessen. And we will
face, as Minister Lim Swee Say said, even bigger and longer term problems
further down the road. So, it is a very careful balance we have
to maintain.</p>

think we can slow the pace that we have adopted in our foreign worker
policies – the pace of adjustment of the foreign worker levies,
and the moderate reduction in Dependency Ratio Ceilings (DRCs).
As I mentioned earlier, we may have to go further in future years
on the levies. For the latest DRC measures, we are giving companies
a two-year transition period for them to adjust to the new DRC for existing
workers, as we recognise that businesses have already invested and
trained these workers.</p>

this is a challenge most can respond to – investing in creating
better jobs, equipment, looking for new markets, improving their
branding. Many smaller companies will be affected, but, in fact,
the number of workers involved in most of these cases is small.
For most small companies affected by the new DRCs, they will only
need to find a substitute for one or two foreign workers – either
finding a Singaporean to take the job, or raising productivity. </p>

allowing companies to keep experienced foreign workers who have
been trained for longer periods, as long as the company is still
within its DRC. There is merit to this proposal. Retaining well-trained and
experienced foreign workers is a plus for productivity, and it spares
the company from having to re-hire and re-train another foreign
worker. MOM is reviewing its policy to see how we can achieve this
objective for Work Permit Holders (WPH), particularly for workers
who are unable to pass the stringent skills tests but have gained
experience on the job and are useful people in the firm.</p>

that has been raised is in the deployment of foreign workers across
job duties within the same firm. We have been very strict about
the occupational roles. In our dialogues with industry, business
chambers and associations, there have been requests to allow more
flexibility for this. For example, in hotels, housekeeping staff
may be needed to help out in F&amp;B when there is a slack period
in house-keeping. And in the small restaurants, they sometimes want
kitchen staff who are not being used to be re-deployed as waiters
or <em class="ph i">vice-versa</em>. In small restaurants, this can be a meaningful
boost to efficiency. MOM will look into allowing this. We will start
with relaxing the occupational restrictions in the hotel sector.
We will be working closely with our tripartite partners to set the
criteria and conditions to make sure the productivity improvements
also flow through into benefits for our local workers. </p>

of how our foreign worker policy is implemented. In particular,
we have had some suggestions from Members as to whether we can give more

constructions, marine and the process industry. </p>

suggestions for the cleaning industry, F&amp;B, retail, healthcare

has some appeal when you first look at it, and especially if you

some detail, as this is an important issue on how we implement our
foreign worker strategy. The reality of the matter is that the most
rapid growth of foreign workers has been in the same sectors that
we are now asked to make exceptions for. These are the construction
industry and services industries like F&amp;B and retail. Services
and Construction account for 90% of the total increase in foreign
workers that we have seen in the last five years. Within Services,
it is basically the industries that the Members have identified
that are the ones that have seen the most rapid growth. So, if we
want to be more liberal on them, whether it is in DRCs or levies,
either we have to be extraordinarily stringent on the other sectors
where foreign worker demand has not been going up, or we accept
more rapid foreign worker growth overall. And the likely and realistic
outcome is we will have more rapid foreign worker growth overall.
That is the upshot.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7a142bac-4e66-4f21-afd0-1d25474b78a2">
                  <a name="budget__id-7a142bac-4e66-4f21-afd0-1d25474b78a2"><!--a--></a>Second, if we are going
to do something along the lines of what Mr Chen Show Mao suggested,
where the more productive and higher skill industries are given
more stringent limits, while the less productive ones like construction
are given more liberal limits, over time, what that amounts to is
that we provide more help to the low-productivity sectors relative
to the high-productivity sectors. And that is the opposite of the
restructuring we want to encourage in our economy, because that
will hamper overall productivity growth. Overall, the economy weakens
and slows down.</p>

in every sector is help the more efficient players, whether it is
construction or F&amp;B. If you have low productivity, raise it.
If you already have high productivity, raise it even further. And
that is our approach. That is why we have a levy system. The levy
system is the basic approach we have in place to ration foreign
labour. We do not control the actual numbers that come in but we
control the price. It is a level playing field, every firm in every
industry knows what the levy is. Within the same industry, if I
am competing with another firm and if I am less efficient, I will
have to pay more, because I need more foreign workers. If I have
to pay more, there is an incentive for me to upgrade. And for an
industry that is inefficient as a whole, the same incentives apply.
So, there are incentives for everyone to upgrade. It would not be
a sensible strategy to discourage upgrading, weaken productivity
growth and seed further growth of our foreign workforce.</p>

are in greatest need of foreign workers are also the sectors where
our productivity lags furthest behind international leaders, such
as Construction, F&amp;B, retail. In F&amp;B, we are three-quarters
the level of productivity of Hong Kong and 40% the level of New
York. In retail, we are two-thirds the level of Hong Kong and 45%
the level of New York in terms of productivity. Construction, we
are one-third the level of Japan and half the level of the US. </p>

cry out for more foreign workers are in fact those with the greatest
scope to upgrade productivity, and to attract Singaporeans into
better quality jobs.</p>

will not be the right approach to go "industry by industry" or "firm
by firm" is because of its complexity, and because it would therefore
also not make for an equitable system. There is a great overlap
between industries. Even in the current system with broad sectoral
distinctions – between manufacturing and services, we already face
issues of an unlevel playing field. If I am a large F&amp;B operator
with a central kitchen, my central kitchen is classified as Manufacturing
and has an advantage over a smaller company that is not able to
have a central kitchen and is hence classified as Services, which
is subject to a more stringent Dependency Ratio Ceiling. Likewise,
in a manufacturing company, in-house logistics is part of Manufacturing,
whereas an independent logistics provider is treated as Services,
with more stringent foreign worker limits. </p>

classifications that we are making in our current framework, we
already have problems at each of the boundaries, and consequently
the lack of a level playing field. These inequities will be greatly
accentuated if we get down to "industry-by-industry" distinctions.
Take the aerospace industry, which Mr Chen Show Mao cited. What
is aerospace? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7be4a71c-2645-42d5-b288-54a5a38fd431">

comprises many different types of companies operating in a broad
cluster. It may sound high-end and high-skill, but actually a significant
part of aerospace is airframe maintenance and overhaul which is
highly labour-intensive. At the other end of the spectrum, the components
part of the business is not so labour-intensive. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a9d750af-63d8-4eea-9f9f-53da3e21b96c">
                  <a name="budget__id-a9d750af-63d8-4eea-9f9f-53da3e21b96c"><!--a--></a>Within the aerospace industry,
there are some large firms that perform both high-skill and low-skill,
labour-intensive businesses, and others that specialise in one particular segment.
It will be quite inequitable if a large firm that undertakes both
the high-end and low-end segments is entitled to a higher foreign
worker quota on grounds that it is doing low-end work, while a small
firm that is competing with it at the high-end is forced to operate
within the more stringent foreign worker quota. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1561fdd4-faaa-4445-ae5e-58bf6e22eb38">
                  <a name="budget__id-1561fdd4-faaa-4445-ae5e-58bf6e22eb38"><!--a--></a>These are impracticalities
and inequities that arise when we try to choose how many foreign
workers each specific industry or firm should obtain based on merit
or consultations. Who is more deserving than the other?</p>

made a good point. We should avoid the situation where small firms
are disadvantaged compared to large firms, or where a firm that
is able to get foreign labour has an advantage and can succeed,
while those that cannot are disadvantaged. That is precisely why
we should not go about choosing and deciding that you should get
more foreign labour and you should get less. It would be highly inequitable
and will disadvantage our small firms in practice.</p>

but you may not have realised fully what its consequences will be.
The consequences are quite predictable. It would mean more growth
of our foreign workforce, lower productivity growth and a lot of
inequity on the ground, as well as scope for abuse.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-e1b91768-fdd0-4fd6-a93e-6bd0bd936aed"><!--a--></a>We have to maintain a careful balance,
and this applies also to the issue of Employment Pass holders. Mr
Patrick Tay and Mr Low Thia Khiang raised concerns about Employment
Pass holders. This is an issue we are concerned about as well. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-eb5a2816-be01-4614-abed-0f51d6cf26c0">
                  <a name="budget__id-eb5a2816-be01-4614-abed-0f51d6cf26c0"><!--a--></a>First, let me say that
Employment Pass holders are an important part of our economy, very
important part of the diversity of our workforce. The growth in
Employment Pass holders in our workforce has gone hand-in-hand with
the growth of local PME employment, as well as local PME wages.
The fact that both wages and employment went up for local PMEs indicates
that it was demand that was the driver, because both wages and the
number of jobs went up. So, there has been an increase in demand
for local PMEs. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1606</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-35827ce0-2725-401b-93c2-ca70617e84a8">
                  <a name="budget__id-35827ce0-2725-401b-93c2-ca70617e84a8"><!--a--></a>Likewise, at the lower
end of skills − Singaporeans who perform ordinary jobs in our firms
have also benefited from the presence of Employment Pass holders.
If you go down and look at any individual company, you will see
the complementarities. Without that team of people comprising both
Singaporeans and foreigners working in the technical and professional
jobs, it would be hard for the company to stay competitive and to
generate the jobs lower down in the skills ladder. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-de6cc5fb-a8aa-4de3-97b7-85667e39905d">
                  <a name="budget__id-de6cc5fb-a8aa-4de3-97b7-85667e39905d"><!--a--></a>So, we have to be careful
about how we tilt this balance as we go forward. We are tightening
on Employment Pass eligibility rules, because we want to build up
our Singaporean core in each sector. But we are tightening in a
graduated fashion. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ff719c61-b5e1-45db-874c-7554c6b48b37">
                  <a name="budget__id-ff719c61-b5e1-45db-874c-7554c6b48b37"><!--a--></a>One of the reasons why
we have to be concerned is our SMEs. Our SMEs are an important source
of demand for Employment Pass holders and S-Pass holders, both of which
Mr Low Thia Khiang mentioned. Mr Low spoke about what happened in
the last two years. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-24c24ada-a447-4bfc-b21a-8e9bd83eed20">
                  <a name="budget__id-24c24ada-a447-4bfc-b21a-8e9bd83eed20"><!--a--></a>In fact, in the last two
years, one-third of the increase in Employment Pass and S-Pass holders
were hired by small firms, those with less than 50 workers. If we
tighten too quickly, these small firms will be hurt the most. So,
let us be careful about how we go about this.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f9c28b26-c305-406b-ac98-10e14113b01b">
                  <a name="budget__id-f9c28b26-c305-406b-ac98-10e14113b01b"><!--a--></a>I am glad Mr Low now shares
the same objective. We now have the same sense of needing to maintain
a careful balance and go about this in a graduated fashion. We will not
spare any efforts in helping our SMEs upgrade and improve productivity.
I do not need to go through the schemes that have been announced
in the Budget, but I do want to address Ms Jessica Tan's point that
some of our brochures about PIC are excessively long. No one will
need to read 66 pages, which include all the annexes. We will make
it as simple as possible for SMEs. We will go out of our way to
reach out to them, hold their hands, work with the business associations,
enterprise development centres and CDCs. We will proactively look
for SMEs and help them to take advantage of our schemes, instead
of waiting for them to come forward. We will talk more about this during
the MOF's Committee of Supply. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3a5aacf9-bcbe-4572-bb0d-ece9ef36bcbc">
                  <a name="budget__id-3a5aacf9-bcbe-4572-bb0d-ece9ef36bcbc"><!--a--></a>Mr Inderjit Singh asked
if we will be overtaxing our SMEs, if we add up all the taxes that
they pay. Now, our tax rates in Singapore are extremely low. Our
tax rates for SMEs are lower than most jurisdictions. A small enterprise
with a turnover of less than $10 million pays on average corporate
income tax of 8%. In Hong Kong, the same size company would pay about 16.5%, and in
Taiwan about 17%. The other developed countries typically have higher
tax rates. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2bdba274-4b44-461a-9578-46414d1d1e6e">

worker levy, which is a form of tax. But as I emphasised in the
Budget, we are giving back much more to companies through our tax
deduction and grant schemes, much more than the increase in foreign
worker levies. And this applies especially to SMEs. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1607</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-d4c8d0ef-5da3-4d08-981a-5ea603a8bee8"><!--a--></a>Not everyone will get
the same support. We have adopted a strategy that deliberately favours
those that are doing something to train their workers, invest in
equipment, and make better use of technology - anything to raise
productivity. The gains are substantial, even for companies that
do not have taxable profits – they can get a very generous cash co-payment.
For every $100,000 of expenditure on productivity, the Government
will pay $60,000. </p>

something, the company must invest in something, and then it gets
aggressive support. That is our basic approach, and I think we have
at least a fair chance of success. As Mr Lim Swee Say had emphasised
yesterday, we cannot say for sure that we are going to succeed.
But I think we have at least a fair chance of success, of ensuring
that amongst our SMEs today and the new SMEs to come, that we will
have a vibrant pool of Singapore firms 10 years from now, and with
a significant international reach.</p>

the second broad theme of the debate, which is about tackling inequality.</p>

on this topic. I am glad that most Members supported the thrust
of the Budget and the direction the Government is taking, not just
for this year, but in the years to come. </p>

more help to the lower income groups, such as Ms Amy Khor, Ms Lily
Neo and NMP Mary Liew. </p>

Tay, Mr Zaqy Mohamed, NMP Eugene Tan and Mr Sitoh Yi-Pin, spoke
specifically about the middle-income group or the sandwiched class, especially
those who feel the squeeze of costs, with young children and elderly
parents. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2bf28c5e-d993-4ab8-8628-1c07d8c691fe">
                  <a name="budget__id-2bf28c5e-d993-4ab8-8628-1c07d8c691fe"><!--a--></a>Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr David
Ong, Mr Zainudin Nordin, Ms Mary Liew and Dr Lim Wee Kiak also spoke
about retirement adequacy. That, too, is a very important issue, which
will be addressed in the Ministry of Manpower's Committee of Supply
debate.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-3d103e51-78a4-44cd-bbba-d6e012eb8461"><!--a--></a>Let me start by reiterating
our basic approach in tackling the challenge of inequality. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aa3b986d-9f2f-4639-a212-f5069377cfb6">
                  <a name="budget__id-aa3b986d-9f2f-4639-a212-f5069377cfb6"><!--a--></a>First, we must grow our
economy on a sustainable basis and, in particular, grow it by raising
productivity so that we can raise incomes across all income levels.
Our economic strategies are thus closely bound with our social strategies
- how we create an inclusive society depends also on how we grow
our economy. This first strategy, of growing incomes of all Singaporeans,
is extremely important. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2a74cfb0-79ca-4897-847a-114ebb3b78b6">
                  <a name="budget__id-2a74cfb0-79ca-4897-847a-114ebb3b78b6"><!--a--></a>Second, we have to do
everything we can to preserve social mobility, starting from a young
age. Several Members spoke about various initiatives – Dr Intan
Azura gave the example of Mendaki's Max-out programme. Mr Faisal
Manap spoke about social workers, and I am glad he agreed with what
was said in the Budget Speech about the need to reward social workers appropriately
and give them fulfilling careers. Ms Low Yen Ling spoke about specific
schemes to attract therapists and Learning Support Coordinators
to work with children at the pre-school level. There are many programmes. We
have to work harder in each of these areas and do everything we
can to preserve and enhance social mobility.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1608</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a091b61e-c0b1-4637-938c-d9aced229d16">
                  <a name="budget__id-a091b61e-c0b1-4637-938c-d9aced229d16"><!--a--></a>Our third strategy is
redistribution. Quite apart from growing incomes and doing what
we can do to preserve social mobility, we have to redistribute resources
through a fair system of taxes and benefits.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6efe6ed0-e292-481c-9c59-9200221346e4">
                  <a name="budget__id-6efe6ed0-e292-481c-9c59-9200221346e4"><!--a--></a> This has been a feature
of all our previous Budgets, and is very much present in this year's
Budget. We will provide significant benefits to the lower income
group to help them keep up and upgrade. But we also want to avoid
placing an excessive tax burden on the middle income group. That
is our third strategy.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b9598293-abac-4709-b590-5aa92aa72be1">
                  <a name="budget__id-b9598293-abac-4709-b590-5aa92aa72be1"><!--a--></a>Our fourth strategy, equally
important, is to partner the community. This is not about the Government
alone. It is about building up our VWO partners and supporting community
volunteers in every field, so that we can support the disabled,
poor and elderly. None of this is about just the CDC or the Government,
but also about community organisations and volunteers who are there
with us. So, those are our four prongs to tackle inequality and
we are going to do more and do better in each of these four prongs.</p>

of the main issues in turn.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e42fe860-8153-46e5-9cab-e409e7031d71">
                  <a name="budget__id-e42fe860-8153-46e5-9cab-e409e7031d71"><!--a--></a>First, the issues concerning
the lower-income group. Let me say that inclusive growth is not
a new focus in the Budget, as Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim
had pointed out, and Mr Lim Biow Chuan just a short while ago had
emphasised. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e076bd89-45c0-4032-9796-fce612f9b611">
                  <a name="budget__id-e076bd89-45c0-4032-9796-fce612f9b611"><!--a--></a>We made major moves in
the last five years, major interventions – Comcare; Workfare in
2007; enhancing housing subsidies very substantially. I would like
to assure Mr Gerald Giam, who might not have caught up with all
the developments, that our enhanced housing grants are such that
a family with a monthly income of as low as $1,000 can now purchase
a small flat. 98% of our younger cohorts, those who are below 35,
earn at least $1,000 of income a month. A family that earns a bit
more, say $1,400, can purchase a medium-sized flat. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8473e38a-eb83-489b-bc9a-7b99f0edb637">
                  <a name="budget__id-8473e38a-eb83-489b-bc9a-7b99f0edb637"><!--a--></a>So, if the Member is concerned
about younger people being unable to afford a flat, try and catch
up on what we have been doing. The housing grants that we have been giving
are more aggressive than what any other government would give. For
those who really cannot afford it, we have other schemes to help
them. Home ownership is a very important plank of how we are helping
our low-income group, and helping them to accumulate savings over
time. So, that was a major intervention in the last five years.</p>

subsidies significantly in recent years – especially at the tertiary
levels – and healthcare subsidies. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-bbfb760e-a9ea-4742-a047-51ad3cc82475"><!--a--></a>As a result, in the last
five years, the transfers we provided to the low-income group –
net of the taxes that they paid, which is basically GST – amounted
to almost 20% of their incomes. This is a significant increase from
the previous five years. We have made major moves through a range
of interventions, to address the issue of inequality and help build an inclusive
society. So, this is not something that came about only post-GE 2011. <em class="ph i">(Refer

what we are doing, and taking into account what this year's Budget

you will find that for every dollar that the low-income household
pays in taxes, they get back more than $4 in benefits. A whole set
of benefits add up to this – which includes Workfare, housing grants,
and means-tested healthcare and education subsidies. <em class="ph i">(Refer to <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=016_20120301_S0021_T0002.pdf"">Annex B on Pg 1697 *</a>)</em>

of how progressive our system is. Everyone pays some taxes, because
everyone should contribute to a better Singapore. But the low-income group
gets back much more in targeted benefits, which support work, education,

of a different point, raised by Mr Ang Hin Kee, Mr Edwin Tong and
Dr Amy Khor, which is that we also need to be careful how much further
we go. As Mr Ang Hin Kee and others mentioned, we have to be concerned
about what too high a level of benefits will mean. It is not that
people try to game the system deliberately. It is only natural human
behaviour to want to stay where we are, and not upgrade, if it means
losing benefits if we upgrade. Every society has found this to be
a problem. As we expand benefits, more people try to stay within
the group that receives the benefits, instead of upgrading beyond
that threshold. </p>

To preserve that drive to do better, to learn a new skill, and to
help the whole family move up. Because that drive at every level
of Singapore society is what defines us. It is not just the drive
among the most talented or the most well-educated, but the drive
among ordinary, working Singaporeans, that has defined us. Let us
not lose that. </p>

to help the lowest wage workers, including cleaners, the lower end
of security guards, and a few other occupations. Wages have been
stagnant in these occupations. They need more help, and we must
intervene on a tripartite basis to help them. </p>

why wages are so low. The composition of some of these occupations
is part of the reason. About three quarters of our cleaners in offices
have very low education – primary level or lower – and most are
older Singaporeans. While that does not justify such low wages,
it is part of how the market works. We do need to do more to help
them, and make sure they get a proper wage – enough to live on,
and enough for their families to get by.</p>

for those with disabilities. Many Members have spoken on this. Ms
Denise Phua and Ms Jessica Tan had a specific suggestion about extending
the Special Employment Credit (SEC) to people with disabilities
who had not gone through our SPED schools. This is a useful suggestion.
MCYS will be addressing this in the COS. </p>

during the debate about extending the SEC to other groups – home-makers
who re-enter the workforce, ex-offenders, single mothers. I would
be very careful about extending this to more and more groups, as
the SEC is a major intervention in the job market. </p>

the same disadvantage. There are some home-makers who are not disadvantaged

our support for our elderly, particularly in healthcare. We have
spoken extensively about this. There were some suggestions. Dr Lily
Neo had a view with regard to how much money needed to be put into
CPF LIFE when an elderly person takes advantage of our Silver Housing
Bonus or our Lease Buyback Scheme. This is a valid issue. For those,
say, in their mid-70s who want to take advantage of our scheme,
it may not make sense for them to top up their CPF all the way to
the prevailing Minimum Sum to purchase a CPF LIFE annuity. This
is something which we are studying, and we will complete our review
within a couple of months.</p>

middle income group – a very important group. Many Members spoke
about this, as I mentioned. </p>

to help the middle income group? First and foremost, it is to raise
real incomes. That is our most important strategy for helping the
middle income group to cope with the cost of living.</p>

in raising the incomes of our middle income group. It is not very
well known, but our middle income households have seen the most
significant growth in real terms over the past five years – 3.2%
per annum. <em class="ph i">(Refer to <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=017_20120301_S0021_T0003.pdf"">Annex C on Pg 1698 *</a>)</em>

lower for lower income households, but the median household has
done well compared to the higher end households. This is on a per
capita basis, which is the most meaningful indication of income
growth. </p>

are rare when looked at internationally over the last five years. In
Hong Kong and Taiwan, the median income growth in real terms was
negative over the same period. Median income growth in Korea was
positive, although lower than ours. And most developed countries
have had either lower or negative income growth over the last five
years. </p>

to keep the tax burden low for the middle income group. This is
an important feature of our tax system, which is not widely recognised.
Our taxes for the
middle income group are much lower than in most countries. The middle
income group has to pay GST and very limited income taxes, since
the income tax schedule starts from the 60th percentile of incomes
– and even then, at very low rates. Some pay maid levies or expenditures
for their cars. But overall, the tax burden on the middle income
group is relatively low by international standards. </p>

they get more than $4 back for every dollar paid. For the middle-income
family that owns a car – and a car is extremely expensive in Singapore
– they get back about 80 cents for every $1 in taxes paid. Without
car ownership, they could get back $1.50 in benefits for every dollar
in taxes paid. And this is also, by the way, the reason why we are
investing very heavily in our public transport system – rail, bus
and the whole system - to make it as convenient as possible for
the majority of Singaporeans to do with a car. If you do not own
a car, even as a middle-income Singaporean, you will get back $1.50
for every $1 you pay over your lifetime. <em class="ph i">(Refer to <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=018_20120301_S0021_T0004.pdf"">Annex D on Pg 1699 to 1705 *</a>)</em>

that provide this. Even for those who want to have a car, for convenience

However, if we extend healthcare spending all the way to 2030, which

it will increase to around 3.5% of GDP – an extra 2 percentage points

If we have to take our healthcare spending to 6% of GDP, which is
around the global average, it means that we will have to raise taxes
very significantly to generate the necessary revenue to fund the
system. It would mean increasing the GST to about 20%. Or raising
corporate income taxes to above 40%. Or lifting personal income
taxes across the board and with the top rate moving to 60%. Some
countries, especially the Nordic countries, do have such high tax
rates.</p>

Eng Hwa, Mr Hri Kumar and Dr Chia Shi-Lu said, we should focus on
healthcare outcomes, instead of spending, as a measure of our healthcare system.
We are already getting relatively good outcomes – it is not a perfect
system, but one of the better healthcare systems in the world when
we look at outcomes. This is despite spending much less, both through
government and private spending.</p>

subsidies on where they are most needed. There will be groups that
have affordability problems. We should help them with targeted subsidies, not
broadly across the population. In particular, we should encourage
people to shift to lower-cost, but good quality care settings. Instead
of staying in an acute hospital for a long period and incurring
high costs for the individual or family as well as for the taxpayer,
they can instead enjoy community-based or home-based care at lower
cost. This is what we are doing in this year's Budget. We have provided
very substantial subsidies and expanding our capacity for community
and home-based care to help people stay at home and yet obtain quality
care. This is a very important dimension of keeping healthcare costs
down while getting good health outcomes.</p>

support for the middle income group. Under the measures introduced
in this year's Budget, a typical middle income family will see their expenditure
on long-term care halved. The Medisave top-up introduced in GST
Voucher is also significant. For those who are, say, 75 years or
older, the permanent, annual Medisave top-up through the GST Voucher
scheme is enough to fund, on average, half of their annual Medisave
withdrawals. </p>

have to keep the 3M framework going, because that is at the heart
of our system. The framework encourages people to save, to think
about their health actively from young, because it is also their
savings that will eventually be paying for it. </p>

Lim and Mr Laurence Lien that we have to think about increasing
the scope for risk-pooling. We are indeed studying ElderShield to
see how we can enhance the scope. MOH is studying how we can, in
the right measure, use ElderShield to support the longer-term medical
needs of Singaporeans. Likewise, we will study Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's
important suggestion on the portable medical insurance. It has not taken off as much
as it should and we should look into whether we should provide more
incentives to promote portable medical insurance. </p>

will be some who cannot afford their medical expenses. We want to
make sure that these individuals make use of MediFund well before
their children's savings are exhausted. There are flexible criteria
and, in fact, a growing number from both the lower-income group
and also the middle-income group are being helped through MediFund.</p>

part of our approach to providing long-term care. I think Ms Sylvia
Lim has overstated things when she said that the Government is taking
the backseat and leaving things to the VWOs. Quite the contrary,
there is, in fact, no government that is as aggressive as us in
supporting VWOs and working with them. Looking at fiscal support
alone, the Community Silver Trust has set aside $1 billion, and together
with our tax deduction schemes for donation, this means that for
every dollar VWO receives from a donor, 60 cents comes from the

we are going to go up by another 1.5 percentage points of GDP beyond

With the ageing of the workforce, there will be increased utilisation
of healthcare services and long-term care services. Demand will
go up and, as technology improves, people will want better care.
This is why we must expect healthcare expenditure to go up another
2 percentage points of GDP by 2030. </p>

new sources of revenues. Our Budget is fine for the next five years.

of raising revenues.</p>

social expenditures to creep up gradually, thinking that each incremental
rise will be affordable. However, each term of Government – whether
it is a conservative of left-of-centre – has found itself pressured to
raise the subsidies or include more people in the subsidies. The
overall bill goes up, from one term to the next. And it is almost
always the middle-income groups that end up paying much higher taxes. </p>

Denise Phua's point. There is a limit to how high you can push taxes
at the upper end. The reality of the matter is that our income taxes
are significantly higher at the top end of incomes compared to Hong
Kong. So the competition for talent is real. </p>

taxes are paid by non-citizens. But even if we consider Singaporeans,
they are mobile. If we look at many graduates, increasingly, many
of them start their careers in Hong Kong or elsewhere. They are
well-educated. They are talented. They too are mobile. We have to
ensure that we keep our best talents here. We will make our system
more progressive over time, particularly with regard to property taxes.
But there is a limit to how high taxes can go at the top end, without
hurting our competitiveness. This is the reason why we have got
to guard how we spend and what we spend on, so that we avoid imposing
too heavy a burden on the middle class.</p>

we come to the issue of why the Government is taking the extraordinary
step of spending $1.1 billion over 10 years to increase bus capacity.</p>

about this, including Dr Amy Khor, Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Lim Biow
Chuan and Mr Pritam Singh. There are, in particular, questions on whether
this is a subsidy to the transport operators and their shareholders.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a76e54c4-6b06-4970-b736-2e681d185afd">

its investment to expand bus capacity very carefully. This was not
a normal budgetary decision. It is an important step, to reduce
waiting times and crowdedness that Singaporeans experience daily
as they take public buses.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-878cf6f0-cf41-4cd9-a611-6c295160fcef">
                  <a name="budget__id-878cf6f0-cf41-4cd9-a611-6c295160fcef"><!--a--></a>Let me start by explaining
what the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) themselves are responsible
for. The PTOs are required to expand their fleets, their bus fleets
to cater to the growth in passenger numbers, as well as to ensure
that they meet the service levels that are mandated under the existing
regulatory framework. This is why, in addition to operating the
existing bus fleet of about 4,000 buses, they will have to buy 250
additional buses to achieve this; and they will fund this on their
own.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4979a8ab-4bb0-4c72-b45b-bbfc476fc998">

$1.1 billion into the bus system in order to step up bus service
levels beyond the current service standards that are required of
the PTOs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-73ef745b-4d84-4edc-82fa-eca158b20424">
                  <a name="budget__id-73ef745b-4d84-4edc-82fa-eca158b20424"><!--a--></a>It will increase bus capacity
on existing heavily-utilised routes making them less crowded and
giving commuters a more pleasant journey. </p>

will run every 10 minutes or less – for two hours in the morning,

period under the current service level requirements.</p>

improve connectivity, and provide commuters with more public transport

Government's investment, the PTOs will have to deliver on these
service level improvements, which go beyond existing regulatory
requirements.</p>

that the PTOs add these 550 buses to improve service levels. First,
because it goes significantly beyond the current service levels
in the current regulatory framework. Second, the PTOs' bus operations
are already running operating losses, and the 550 additional buses,
in particular, are projected to be a loss-making operation. The
cost of acquiring and running the 550 buses is beyond what can be recovered
from revenues in running the buses. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-65992506-cf1d-44b5-ba64-61a33d4f7157">

the frequency of feeder bus services. Increasing the number of buses
to make this possible will shorten waiting times but will add little
to revenues, since the total number of passengers taking the service
will remain largely the same. So, more buses, more drivers, more
fuel but no similar increase in revenues because it is essentially
the same pool of passengers. They now have to wait shorter times
and enjoy less crowded journeys, but it is essentially the same
pool.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e38acbcc-0de5-4fcc-b0a5-8bae3d351bab">
                  <a name="budget__id-e38acbcc-0de5-4fcc-b0a5-8bae3d351bab"><!--a--></a>Without the Government
stepping in, these significant service level improvements would
only have been achievable if fares have been raised sharply. The
550 additional buses mean significantly higher costs – not only
to purchase the buses, but also because more than 1,000 drivers
would need to be hired and paid a good wage, as Mr Seng Han Thong
and NMP Mary Liew have pointed out. Fare revenues of the PTOs would
have had to go up by about 12% to 13% – which translates into an
increase in passenger fares of about 15 cents per journey – if the
PTOs had to achieve this on their own. How much is 12% to 13%? In
the last five years since 2006, fares went up by 0.3%. So, 12% to
13% is quite a significant leap compared to what we have seen in
the last five years. That would have been the only way which we
could have achieved these service level improvements if the Government
had not stepped in.</p>

the matter is that the $1.1 billion Government package, or $110 million
per year, is a subsidy for public transport commuters, and not a
subsidy for the PTOs. It will improve service levels for commuters,
not the profits of the PTOs.</p>

is expected to cover the losses on the 550 buses – in other words,
the additional costs, net of revenues. Of the $1.1 billion package,
$280 million is budgeted for the purchase of the 550 buses over
the next five years, and $820 million to cover the net operating
costs over the 10 years. This is based on the best estimates currently.
However, we will be monitoring and scrutinising the PTOs' actual
costs for both the purchase and running of the buses. Should their
losses turn out to be lower than expected, the Government funding
will be reduced correspondingly. So, one way or another, there are
no profits to be made from the 550 buses. </p>

buses complements the $60 billion we are putting into the expansion
of the rail system. It will take several years for these new rail
lines to come on
stream or all of them to come on stream. That is why we are stepping
in now to add bus capacity and quickly improve the daily experience
of commuters. It is what commuters want, and we have assessed that
it is worth the public investment. Both the $1.1 billion over the
next 10 years for bus capacity, and the $60 billion that we are
putting into the rail system, are worthwhile public investments.</p>

package and independent of this Government package, regular and

                  <strong class="ph b">Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong>:
Thank you, Sir. The Deputy Prime Minister said earlier that the
Workers' Party has shifted its position on foreign workers. Sir,
this is incorrect. Nowhere, either inside or outside this House,
have we said that Singapore does not need foreign workers. The main
complaint of the Party as well as people outside this House is that
foreign workers and foreigners are taking away Singaporeans jobs
and are depressing wages of Singaporeans. To clarify further, he
refers to our manifesto. Our manifesto stated that we have to carefully
calibrate foreign workers in relation to different levels of industries.
We also said that we welcome foreigners who can add value to Singaporeans.
So, nowhere have we said that we do not need foreign workers, or
we do not need foreigners to help Singaporeans. That is the first
clarification I want to make. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-85c1b02e-e826-4a08-959c-ed9097942d6b">

Minister said that there is no need to go into individual industries
and the current levers or controls − the dependency ratio as well
as the workers' levy − are sufficient at that sectoral level. Sir,
I am not convinced. I am of the view that if you want to do productivity
successfully, we need micro-management, and not just macro-management.
Each industry has its own feature and its own difficulty. Foreign
workers are a life line to them, at least it is now. So, I am not
convinced that we should just use a micro lever to manage and achieve
the productivity growth and the targets we want. </p>

is this. The Deputy Prime Minister referred to my speech on First
World countries' social safety net, which he says he is very worried
about. It means also the kind of level of tax. I suppose the Deputy
Prime Minister knows very well that the First World countries are
also basically looking at how to ensure that their own citizens
are well looked after, whether in terms of healthcare or retirement.
So, these are things that we are looking at today. Of course, I
understand the Government is particular about outcome and the challenge
exactly to this Government is: can we have the outcome of the social
safety net in the Western countries, in the First World countries, without
the same level of tax that we can have?</p>

                  <strong class="ph b">Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>:
On the Member's last hope, I suggest he write a novel on this. It
will sell very well in the West. But let me address his questions
in turn. First, the Workers' Party has said, I remember vividly
the debates and I know what is in its manifesto, the Member did
feel that we had let in too many foreign workers at the lower skill end. His
recent comments, however, in this debate, expressed grave concern over
how fast we are tightening our Dependency Ratio Ceiling for work
permit holders, and did recognise that, even at the lower end, this
has to be a very careful balance, and that, I think, shares our
perspective. I hope this sting he had taken out of his earlier criticisms
is not just a political strategy because we know that it is sensitive
to his background among SMEs and so on about having to restructure
but also recognises the more basic reality, which is, that the growth
of foreign workers in Singapore has not only benefited SMEs but
has also benefited Singaporeans' incomes. I have showed the data three
years in a row: low-income Singaporeans, middle-income Singaporeans,
what has happened. Yes, there will always be competition in individual
jobs. But, overall, when we look at the dynamic that is created
in our economy, Singaporeans have benefited and have benefited more
than other countries have – almost every country that is shown on the
chart. So, it has been a successful strategy and that was the reason
why he was wrong in criticising the Government for a strategy of
allowing companies to stay competitive and grow, using foreign workers.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1618</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9811a918-0f6c-47d8-91e3-50ddc79be245">
                  <a name="budget__id-9811a918-0f6c-47d8-91e3-50ddc79be245"><!--a--></a>Second, on micro-management.
This is a practical issue. I think the Member made the suggestion
with the best of intentions. When you meet businessmen, they will
often ask you, "Why not, give me a bit more. My business is one
that I really cannot attract Singaporeans. It is too far, they would
not come; the work is too dirty." How did businesses in Germany,
the Mittelstand, become what they are today? It is by constant upgrading.
Why are they able to beat lower cost competitors in China? It is
by constant upgrading so that a dirty job became a cleaner job,
more skills, more knowledge. So, our challenge, as Mr Lim Swee Say
said yesterday, is that restructuring is unavoidable, the alternative
is even more painful, let us work with the SMEs to help them restructure. There
is no easy solution to this. I think the Member made it with the
best of intentions. But I pointed out that the result of that approach
will be faster foreign worker growth, lower productivity growth
and, thirdly, some inequity between firms, some unfairness between
firms, which I am sure he did not intend. But that would be the
outcome of that strategy.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bd3a5bde-816f-4739-9d8b-ee07b4c13332">
                  <a name="budget__id-bd3a5bde-816f-4739-9d8b-ee07b4c13332"><!--a--></a>Third, on the issue of
First-World safety net. The truth of the matter is that this has not
just been an aspiration of First-World governments to provide this
high level safety net for their citizens. It has inadvertently been
a trick on future generations. They have postponed the bill to future
generations precisely at the wrong time, at a time when the working
population is getting smaller relative to the older population.
Some people knew it, but went about it because that was in the nature
of single-term democratic politics where you do not look beyond
what happens in one term. And many people did not know about it.
Populations were fooled, and now populations are paying the price, which
is why it is not just a matter of financial crisis they are going
through, but it is social crisis that is going to last for many
years. So, let us avoid getting anywhere even close to that.</p>

                  <strong class="ph b">Mr Cedric Foo Chee
Keng (Pioneer)</strong>: Sir, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister
about the funding of buses. It is quite reassuring to hear him say
that it is really for the benefit of commuters and not the shareholders
of SBS Transit and SMRT. But the projection that they will make
losses as a result of this incremental injection of buses and incremental
operating costs is an assumption. Ridership can change in many ways.
As networks are
added, we may have more people travelling on it, and we may be very successful
as a tourism hub. Would the Deputy Prime Minister ring-fence this
particular injection and the profit and loss from this particular
injection, and adjust for it as necessary?</p>

                  <strong class="ph b">Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>:
I thank Mr Cedric Foo for his question. In fact, this is what I
would say: we expect them to make losses based on all existing parameters.
If we are lucky and somehow the system is re-engineered so that
the losses are less than expected or, most unlikely, but if they
turn a profit, that would not come from the Government. None of
the $1.1 billion would be reduced as their losses are reduced, and if
they make a profit, it all comes back to us. So, none of the $1.1
billion will go towards profits for the public transport operators.
It would be ring-fenced, their accounts would be scrutinised, and
we would be paying according to what the costs actually are. There would
be a review at five years to check the parameters for the agreement.
There is no reason why we would want to subsidise the profits of
public transport operators. There is no reason why we want to do
it. We are doing this to help consumers. This is a subsidy to consumers
so that, as we are waiting for the major expansion of our rail system,
we can improve service levels on a daily basis.</p>

Incorruptibility has long been portrayed as a key facet of good

We perform relatively well in Transparency International's (TI)

least corrupt in 2011, behind New Zealand, Denmark, Finland and
Sweden. In 2010, we were number one with New Zealand and Denmark. Between
2004 and 2009, we were ranked between third and fifth. We do not
fare as well in the Transparency International's Bribe Payers' Index
(BPI), which measures the perceived likelihood of companies from
a selected country, in this case, Singapore, paying bribes abroad.

surveys suggest that Singaporeans and Singapore-based companies
are better behaved in Singapore but were less likely to do so when
overseas. Some of our largest business and trading partners do not
fare very well on Transparency International's CPI and BPI. The
maxim "when in Rome, do as the Romans do" appears to have traction
with Singaporeans who do business overseas. Oftentimes, the convenient
excuse is that there is no other way to do business in less well-regulated jurisdictions.
The influx of foreigners and new immigrants into Singapore, some
of whom may be used to a culture of buying favours, might result
in their adopting similar practices here. </p>

the paradox of corruption is that its incidence and impact are increasing
despite greater awareness of and action against it. With more Singaporeans and
Singaporean businesses venturing overseas, they are often more exposed
to questionable ways of doing business, including engaging in corrupt
practices, as an expedient way of doing business. The clear and
present danger of all these developments locally and overseas is
that we might "import" such an expedient attitude into Singapore. When
that happens, it means that such actions are regarded as part and parcel
of doing business. This "desensitisation" of corruption is a slow
disease. Corruption, it is to be noted, represents the dark side
of trust – it is based on and sustains a perverse form of trust. </p>

helps to inculcate the values of integrity and responsibility in

co-curricular activities and Learning Journey programmes. Since
1998, the CPIB has actively engaged secondary school and junior
college students through the Learning Journey programmes. These
help shape the perceptions and attitudes of young Singaporeans so that
they will continue to reject corruption and promote a clean and
corruption-free society. The CPIB also engages undergraduates at
our local universities. Prof Tan may know that SMU students have
been hearing directly from experienced CPIB investigators in their
"Corporate Crime" and "Ethics and Social Responsibility" courses. The CPIB also collaborates
with institutions, such as the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy

                  </span>:
Sir, Singapore's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has picked up slightly
to 1.20. That it has gone up is good news but this is still way
below the replacement level of 2.1, and certainly a big area of
concern. Yet, Budget 2012 does not seem to have taken this into
consideration.</p>

started in 2001, almost $2 billion in Baby Bonuses have been given
out. While it can be argued that the scheme did, indeed, have a
positive impact, it is almost negligible. Since its inception in
2001 and enhancements in 2008, there has been no significant improvement
to the declining birth rate. It has been shown that low fertility
arises from factors which include more people remaining single,
people marrying later in life, as well as having children later
in life or even not having children. I propose efforts to tackle our low TFR
focus on factors like these and less on quick fixes like bringing
in young immigrants.</p>

been calls from the public for help from the Government, to help
make raising families in Singapore more affordable, like providing
additional paternity and childcare leave, and building more subsidised
childcare facilities and achieving a better work-life balance. </p>

of the father's involvement in a child's growing up years, as Acting
Minister Chan Chun Sing himself mentioned in a Conference for Social
Service Practitioners in July 2011. Research has shown that children
do better mentally, socially, emotionally and academically when
their fathers are involved in their lives. </p>

well - fathers' absences are linked to higher rates of delinquency
and psychological problems in the children. An AWARE-led survey conducted
between October 2010 and January 2011 found that 91% of over 1,000 respondents
wanted to have mandated paternity leave, ranging from at least six
days to as many as 14 days. The survey also found that 75% of the
fathers would apply for paternity leave to spend time with their
children, if there was that option. Given that there is both reason
and demand for paid paternity leave, I hope the Ministry can consider
supporting my proposal for legally mandated paternity leave. In
addition, the Ministry could grant the flexibility for parents to
apportion their paternity and maternity leave according to their
needs. In the 2010 COS debate, I had also suggested that the fourth
month of maternity leave could be gender neutral that can be taken
by either parent. This is something, I hope, the Government can
consider; I know, not this year, but perhaps in future.</p>

that allowing fathers to spend more time and build stronger bonds

paternity leave. We start small – two days will do. It is a symbolic

what is the optimal population size for long-term sustainability?
Currently, we already have 3.2 million Singaporeans, 0.6 million

without further increases? Do we really need continual population
growth? Without immigration, given our low fertility rate that is way

Sir, in last year's COS, I spoke about raising the fertility rate
in Singapore. I think the Government can make it more affordable
to raise children. I would like to ask PMO whether more support
can be given to parents to encourage more births, given that it
has been three years since the Marriage and Parenthood package was
last reviewed and enhanced in 2008. Since then, the total fertility
rate (TFR) has slipped from 1.28 in 2008 to 1.2 in 2011, although
the total fertility rate in 2011 was higher than the record low
of 1.16 in 2010. With this promising uptick, our population enhancement
and procreation policies need to be improved. Can the Government
study and review all factors that can convince our younger people
who are seemingly too busy with work life and everything else to
start families or to have more children?</p>

the birth rates are low due to the interplay of expensive housing, family
insecurity, job insecurity and low real income, a stressful education
system, overload infrastructure and reduced public space as well
as shrinking flat sizes. Young people today worry about getting
their flats and security of jobs since the economic cycles are getting
shorter and the pressures of education for children in an increasingly competitive
environment. Will PMO consider restructuring all Government benefits,
eg, housing, monetary
incentives, Edusave, even education policy as a whole and marketed to
encourage young couples to get married earlier and have children
earlier? Beyond fiscal measures, can the Government look into the
broader areas of providing the younger generation with a greater
sense of long-term economic security and improved physical conditions
to encourage them to start families?</p>

have not given up hope that the TFR decline can be reversed. Statements
made by agencies, such as HDB, about new flats being small because
families are getting smaller, would only serve to be self-fulfilling
prophesies. If we truly believe that marriage and parenthood are
strategic to Singapore's future and interest, the Government must
send the right signal and create the right environment to improve
our TFR.</p>

Sir, there are increasingly more cases of Singaporeans marrying
foreign partners. Many of these couples find themselves faced with
an uncertain future and frustration after marriage. Marriage to
a Singapore citizen does not automatically qualify a foreigner for
long-term stay or permanent residency upon marriage or even after
they have children. Each application is evaluated based on its own
merits, and many of these foreign spouses do not get to enjoy medical
benefits, childcare, housing subsidies, etc. </p>

their Members and appeal for special waiver from the ICA to speed
up applications for long-term stay or PR applications. In the long
run, some of these marriages may breakdown. Does the Government
have plans to provide greater support for these foreign spouses,
given that there has been an increasing trend of Singaporeans marrying
foreigners?</p>

need to tackle the frustration faced by these couples from the onset.
Before they marry, it is imperative that they have a better understanding
of the family support system, financial management and cultural
differences here in Singapore. Let them learn about the various
citizenship issues and what to expect for a long-term stay in Singapore.</p>

2011, it is now mandatory for minor couples who wish to marry to
attend marriage preparation programmes. The purpose is to help young couples
better prepare for marriage. I believe such premarital counselling
will be useful for Singaporeans and their foreign spouses. Can the
Government consider extending options of premarital counselling
services and marriage preparatory courses to them as well? If need
be, can the Government also fund the counselling sessions and courses
to encourage couples who wish to make use of the services to do
so? In this case, I believe we can better prepare such couples to
take note of the potential challenges they may face as a married
couple. In this way, we will have better and more stable marriages.</p>

Sir, in a recent reply to a question on whether the Ministry would
grant permanent residence more easily to the foreign spouses of
Singaporeans, especially those who have children who are Singaporeans,
the Prime Minister replied that there is no such automatic policy.
The Prime Minister also said
that the citizens who sponsored their foreign spouses for PR status
may need to show that they are able to support them financially.</p>

duration of marriage may be important factors to consider in the
grant of PR status to foreign spouses, the condition that the citizen
must first prove that they are able to support their partner is
a bit unusual. This is because once their spouses become Permanent
Residents, what is there to stop them from seeking employment? Even
when these foreign spouses are on Long Term Visit Passes, they are allowed
to work, as highlighted by the Prime Minister, in this Chamber.</p>

review this pre-condition. As long as these citizens are working and

criteria that ICA may have.</p>

stay on, take up citizenship and have children. But, unlike the
many PRs who are here mainly for economic reasons, foreign spouses
of Singaporeans have every reason to make this place their permanent
home because their partners are already deeply rooted here, to begin
with. In my Meet-the-People Sessions, I have met a number of residents
who are disappointed with the many rejection letters they received
from ICA. Some citizens with foreign spouses and Singapore children
have become disillusioned with the immigration policy. I can understand
their frustration. On one hand, we want more babies and foreigners
to grow our population; on the other hand, it is so hard for these
Singaporeans to secure the PR status for their spouses even when they
have children who are born Singaporeans. It is hard for Singaporeans
with foreign spouses to live with the separation anxiety all the
time. I urge this Government to review the immigration policy on
foreign spouses with a compassionate and forward looking yardstick.</p>

Sir, just based on the past nine months interacting with residents
and helping them file appeals, I have seen consistent requests by
Singaporeans to appeal for either permanent residence or Long Term
Visit Passes for their foreign spouses. For some of these applicants,
they have made repeated applications and appeals over several years
but to no avail. What is of concern is that a substantial proportion
of these couples have children who are Singaporeans. But because
of the inability of the foreign spouses to get either a PR or Long
Term Visit Pass and, hence, the inability to stay in Singapore for
longer durations, the family is spread apart, with the child or
children usually living with their mothers who are more often than
not foreign spouses. It pains me to see such young children growing
up in a family that is not intact because of a policy that we have
instituted. We ought to look beyond the Singaporean applicant's
immediate financial contribution ability, and let us instead look
at how his contribution can be realised through his Singaporean
children who may not even have the opportunity to contribute to
Singapore if we continue this policy the way we have. </p>

                  </span>:
Sir, in 2010, there were a total of 24,363 marriages. Of these,
6,176 were between a citizen and a non-resident. This represents over
a quarter of all marriages in Singapore. In most cases, the couple
would naturally expect that the foreign spouse would be allowed
to live in Singapore and later start a family here. But it does
not always work out that way. What happens in most cases is that
the foreign spouse would be issued a social visit pass which can
range from 30 days to a year. Some are even required to leave Singapore
before their passes are renewed, or without assurance that it will
be. Their applications for Permanent Residence will take a few years
to be approved, if at all. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f336692d-21e5-47e5-a38b-335f45896b5b">
                  <a name="budget__id-f336692d-21e5-47e5-a38b-335f45896b5b"><!--a--></a>It is not a satisfactory
situation. The problems are compounded because many of these marriages
involve Singaporean men and women with low incomes. The new couples
are uncertain about their future. Because ICA does not reveal the
criteria for granting a visit pass or PR, the couple is never certain
when it will be granted or at all. While foreign spouses can work
on a long-term visit pass, they find it difficult to be employed
because of their uncertain status. When the spouse is asked to leave Singapore
and return to renew their passes, it adds to the family's expenses.
The couple cannot buy a new flat from HDB because at least two people
in the family nucleus must be citizens or permanent residents to
qualify. As it will now take the foreign spouse longer to obtain
PR, the situation will remain difficult for some time. If the foreign
spouse is a lady, she will not enjoy subsidised medical care, and
so it will be more expensive to plan and start a family.</p>

factors create an imposing obstacle against such couples marrying,
settling down and starting a family in Singapore. If we are encouraging Singaporeans
to get married and have children, why make it difficult for them
simply because they choose to marry a non-Singaporean? Foreign spouses
belong to a very different category from the foreign workers the
Government is trying to reduce our dependence on. In fact, they
are quite the opposite because they are here not for commercial
reasons but for the long term. They are also part of a national
agenda we want to advance. We want more Singaporeans to marry and
have children and deepen their roots in Singapore. Singaporeans
who marry foreigners have the same hopes and dreams as other Singaporeans.
The Government should help them make this dream come true, particularly
those with low incomes and who likely have more limited options.
It is in keeping with the "inclusive" theme of the Budget.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-48a5f38c-f1be-4b27-af3b-df11a45df32e"><!--a--></a>What are the reasons for
our caution? Is it the fear of marriages of convenience? If so, this
must be the minority of marriages, and surely this can be addressed
differently. Our approach appears to be to flush out marriages of
convenience by making it as inconvenient as possible for Singaporeans
with foreign spouses. I hope the Government will do something to
help. I suggest that instead of issuing social visit passes, we institute
a more permanent pass for foreign spouses. For convenience, I shall
call this the "marriage pass", not a pass of marriage. Under a marriage
pass, the foreign spouse should be allowed to live and work in Singapore
as long as the couple remains married. The marriage pass should
allow the couple to purchase a new HDB flat, and entitle the spouse
to subsidised medical care. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-eb5051bc-167a-4020-af98-ca70de9f3f5f"><!--a--></a>There are a number of advantages. It gives
certainty to the couple. It makes it easier for them to own a home
and start a family. And if administered properly, it will also enable
the Government to grant fewer PR or citizenship and only to very
deserving cases as the marriage pass is a viable alternative to
foreign spouses in a genuine marriage. </p>

marriages will in fact be reduced as the spouse's right to remain
in Singapore will depend on the continuity of the marriage, and
getting a PR is less assured. As a check against abuse, there could
be various conditions placed on the marriage pass. For example,
it could be mandatory that children born under the marriage would
have to apply to become Singapore citizens. Also, where the couple have
purchased an HDB flat, they could be made to disgorge the profits
from the sale should the marriage pass be terminated, and the flat
sold within a certain period. I hope the Government will consider
the suggestion to make it easier for Singaporeans to marry foreigners.</p>

Sir, the Government's population policy has created anxieties among
Singaporeans. In fact, even new Singaporeans and PRs I have spoken
with have expressed their concerns that the Government has increased
the population base too rapidly. We all know the side-effects of
an increased population especially in creating a strong integrated
society. I have three issues to seek clarification on our population
policy. First, I would like to ask the Prime Minister what is his population
size target and at what rate he expects to build the population
through immigration. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cceaae07-3aac-4dfb-a235-26157ac4a1eb">
                  <a name="budget__id-cceaae07-3aac-4dfb-a235-26157ac4a1eb"><!--a--></a>Second, I am concerned
about recent reactions, especially over the social media towards
the new immigrants and foreigners here in Singapore. Singaporeans
have always been welcoming especially since we are mostly second-
or third-generation immigrants. So, the issue of integration is
an urgent one and we do not want to undo the good job we have done
in building a strong and cohesive Singapore society. Can the Prime
Minister share with us the progress made on the integration front? </p>

my grassroots leaders have raised a valid concern that many of our
local Government scholarships, including prestigious ones, are being
offered to foreigners and PRs. Like my grassroots leaders, I, too,
feel that we need to reserve all major Government scholarships for
Singaporeans, as is practised in many countries that we know of.
We can have other categories of scholarships that can be offered
to foreigners with clear requirements for them to become citizens
if they take these up. Can the Prime Minister please comment on
this? </p>

                  </span>: Sir, the rapid
population growth mostly by way of immigration in the last decade,
has caused discomfort among our citizens. Singaporeans are unhappy
about the congestions they experienced at public amenities like
the trains and buses, the squeeze in housing demand due to inflow
of foreigners, the competition in schools and workplaces and the
increasing lack of space for themselves.</p>

are also concerned about the changing social make-up of our society
as well as our ability to integrate the new arrivals. There are
enough incidents at the neighbourhoods and at the workplaces to
remind us of this. Last August, Singaporeans got heated up after
it was reported that an immigrant family from a particular country
objected to the smell of curry their Indian neighbours were cooking. More
recently, the offensive remarks by a foreign NUS scholar also caused
a stir.</p>

to satisfy ourselves with is whether Singapore is nearing its physical
and social limits in terms of our population growth. Even with significant enhancements
to our public infrastructures, how much more can our population
grow in the next two decades? Are Singaporeans prepared for more
immigration if we are not able to reproduce ourselves in sufficient
numbers? Our population grew more slowly last year at 1.8%. What
are the implications of slower population growth in Singapore? Our
future population policy will impact every citizen in this country.
This is one policy where the Government can be more forthcoming
in sharing its plans and vision. For example, what was our projection
of Singapore's population in 2030 or what will our population be
like at steady state? I hope PMO can share and consult widely on
this policy issue and work towards forging a national consensus
among Singaporeans on this very important long-term issue.</p>

you, Mr Chairman. I would like to thank Members for their questions
and suggestions. Let me start with a brief overview of changes in
our resident population in the past year. In 2011, 30,922 babies
were born to Singapore citizens, slightly more than in 2010. We
also took in 15,777 new citizens. 18,000 to 20,000 citizenship applications
were granted each year in previous years. A similar number were
granted citizenship in-principle in 2011. However, new citizens
now have to go through the Singapore Citizenship Journey which helps
new citizens better appreciate our history, norms and values. This
process takes about two months to complete. Hence, about 4,000 applicants
who began their citizenship formalities in late 2011 will be granted
citizenship only in early 2012. We took in 27,521 new Permanent
Residents, or PRs, last year. The size of the PR population has
remained relatively stable in the last few years. </p>

the bedrock of our society, enabling our Singaporean values and
way of life to be passed on from generation to generation. Mr Seah
Kian Peng, Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked for additional
support to encourage marriage and parenthood in order to raise our
birth rates. I welcome all these suggestions. I am always thinking
of new ways to improve my own KPIs. We will study them but, as Mr
Seah said, perhaps not this year but in the future.</p>

like in other developed societies, especially East Asian urbanised
ones like Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong, have come together with rising singlehood,
later marriages, and married couples having fewer children. We have invested sizeable
resources to support Singaporeans in getting married and having children
and these have just been put in place in recent years. So, I think
we should wait and see the impact of these major measures that have
been taken. Our Marriage and Parenthood package was raised from
$500 million in 2001, to $800 million in 2004. And in 2008, it was
doubled to $1.6 billion a year. This is a comprehensive package comprising
a broad range of measures such as the Baby Bonus, childcare and
infant care subsidies, maternity and childcare leave, as well as
tax benefits for parents. Beyond the Marriage and Parenthood package,
the Government has also invested heavily in education, healthcare
and housing to create a pro-family environment. And we will do more,
particularly in the pre-school segment. Ultimately, it is the values
and social attitudes of Singaporeans in their 20s, 30s and 40s which
will determine whether they decide to marry and have children. To
support and encourage them, we will continue to fine-tune our policies
and measures. </p>

cash gift of up to $6,000 for the first to fourth child of every
family, we also introduced the Child Development Account, or CDA,
in 2001. Since 2001, the Government has provided co-matching deposits
in the accounts of over 200,000 children, amounting to close to
$1 billion. Deposits are matched by the Government up to a cap ranging
from $6,000 to $18,000 per child, depending on the birth order of
the child. The CDA savings can be used for the developmental needs
of the children and their siblings, such as childcare, kindergarten
and healthcare. Currently, the CDA savings account can be used from
birth till the child is six years old. After that, the remaining
amount is transferred to the Post Secondary Education Account for
use when the child proceeds for studies in an approved post-secondary
education institution, such as one of our local universities, polytechnics
or ITEs. Many children have substantial savings in their CDAs at
age six, while their parents still face many needed expenses for them.
We will thus enhance the way that parents can use the CDA to better
support the needs of their children during these important growing
years.</p>

the age when the CDA savings account can be used, from up to the
age of six previously, to up to the age of 12. With this, parents
will have six more years to use the CDA funds for the child and
his siblings. Second, we will expand the scope of approved uses
for CDA. This will now include expenses at pharmacies, opticians
as well as providers of assistive technology devices, such as hearing
and visual aids for children with disabilities. This will give parents
more flexibility in using CDA funds for expenses directly related
to raising their child. We will implement the changes to the CDA
in the second half of 2012 and more details will be announced by
MCYS later.</p>

immigration framework, it has become more difficult to qualify for
PR or citizenship. There is, however, still the option of applying
for other immigration facilities such as work passes, social visit
passes, dependant's passes or long term visit passes. Mr Ang is
quite correct to say that more Singaporeans are marrying non-citizens.
In 2010, 30% of marriages involving citizens were between a citizen and a foreigner.
This is up from 23% in the year 2000. We do not fully understand the
sociology and stresses within these marriages but we will study
them. We will also study suggestions of marriage counselling, but
a number of these marriages are forged overseas, before we have
any opportunity to step in to do counselling or give any form of
advice. While foreign spouses do not automatically qualify for citizenship
or PR, most of those who do not, will qualify for a Long Term Visit
Pass, or LTVP. Many of those on LTVP do eventually become PRs or
naturalise as citizens after they have been married for some time,
and their marriages are stable.</p>

Mr Hri Kumar Nair, Mr Muhd Faisal and Mr Ang -- asked if the Government
could do more to help foreign spouses of Singaporeans, especially those
with Singaporean children. I do agree that we can do more to help
such families build more stable and stronger foundations. We sympathise
with these families. But we have also seen the other side of the
problem, where the foreign spouse who has received PR suddenly divorces
and leaves the Singaporean citizen spouse. We have also seen Singapore
citizens who have asked the immigration department to get the ex-foreign
spouse to leave Singapore. We have seen instances of these, and
so we would like to see that the marriages are stable and have been
in existence for a substantial period of time before we give longer
term immigration facilities, which place an obligation on Singapore
and Singaporeans to support this person for the long term. But I
do agree that we can do more. </p>

to the family of a Singaporean with a foreign spouse who has not
yet been given PR or citizenship, we will introduce a new scheme,
known as the Long Term Visit Pass Plus or LTVP+ from 1 April 2012.
First, the scheme provides foreign spouses of citizens with greater
certainty of stay. The LTVP+ will be for a duration of three years
in the first instance, and up to five years for each subsequent
renewal, instead of the current shorter periods of typically one
year. Second, LTVP+ holders will receive healthcare subsidies for
inpatient treatment at restructured hospitals, pegged at a level
close to that for PRs, that is, about the same rates as PRs even
though they have not yet been given PR. Third, it will be easier
for LTVP+ holders to work to supplement the family income. They
will only require a Letter of Consent from MOM to work, which can
be easily obtained through online application. To qualify for LTVP+,
factors, such as the length of marriage and whether there are citizen
children in the family, will be considered. More details will be
announced by ICA later today.</p>

broader population challenges we face, and what these mean for our
future. We will soon have to confront the twin effects of our low
fertility and our ageing population. 2012 is a demographic turning
point. Our first cohort of post-war Baby Boomers, that is, those
born between 1947 and 1965, will start turning 65 years old from
this year. Live births in Singapore peaked at around 62,500 in 1958.
From now till 2030, Singapore will experience an unprecedented age
shift, as over 900,000 Baby Boomers, more than a quarter of the
current citizen population, retire from the workforce and enter
their silver years. At current birth rates and without immigration,
more than one in four citizens will be aged 65 and over in 2030.
The median age of our citizens will rise to 47 from 39 today.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-52a79e92-3173-45ff-a760-6ac9d0d2aaa5"><!--a--></a>Today, there are currently
about seven citizens in the working-ages from 15 to 64 years, to
each citizen aged 65 and above <em class="ph i">(<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=019_20120301_S0021_T0005.pdf"">Refer to Chart 1 on Pg1700 *</a>)</em>. By 2030, the number
of elderly citizens will triple to 900,000, but they will be supported
by a smaller base
of working-age citizens <em class="ph i">(<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=020_20120301_S0021_T0006.pdf"">Refer to Chart 2 on Pg 1701 *</a>)</em>. This is a result of the declining
trend in our birth rates which have been below the replacement level
over the last 35 years. By 2030, there will only be 2.3 working-age
citizens to each citizen aged 65 and above <em class="ph i">(<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=021_20120301_S0021_T0007.pdf"">Refer to Chart 3 on Pg 1702 *</a>
                  </em>). You can see the difference between
where we are today and where we will be in 2030, if our present
fertility rates remain and there is no immigration.</p>

and with fewer entering the working-age band, the number of citizens
of working-age will start to shrink. Today, for every citizen retiring,
say at 65 years old, we have about 2.2 entering the working-age
band, that is, the working-age citizen population is still growing <em class="ph i">(<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=022_20120301_S0021_T0008.pdf"">Refer to Chart 4 on Pg 1703 *</a>)</em>. Within the next decade, this
situation will start to reverse, and the pool of working-age citizens
will stop growing, and then start to shrink. By 2030, for every
citizen retiring, we will only have about 0.6 citizens entering
the working-age pool <em class="ph i">(<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=023_20120301_S0021_T0009.pdf"">Refer to Chart 5 on Pg 1704 *</a>)</em>. Without immigration, we will
face a shrinking workforce and the prospect of a shrinking economy.
This challenging situation is compounded by the need to support
a significantly larger elderly population at the same time. The
effect on our citizen population will be dramatic. Post-2030, our
population will start to decline sharply, and our median age will
rise steadily <em class="ph i">(<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=024_20120301_S0021_T0010.pdf"">Refer to Chart 6 on Pg 1705 *</a>)</em>. The median age of our citizens
will rise to 53 in 2050 from 39 today. </p>

happening in Japan. Japan's population has been in decline since
2005. Between 2000 and 2010, Japan's workforce shrank by 0.3% a
year and will decline even more sharply in the coming decades. By
2060, Japan's population is projected to shrink by a third from
the current 128 million to 87 million. These are the grim realities
Japan faces as it grapples with the effects of a fast ageing society.</p>

the challenges of an ageing population and a shrinking citizen workforce.
Our population policies will be guided by our overarching aim to
build an enduring nation and home for Singaporeans. We will work
hard to foster a supportive environment to encourage more Singaporeans
to get married and start families. Singapore must remain a good
home, where opportunities abound for our children. </p>

to point out that Singaporeans have always been welcoming towards
new citizens who can contribute and integrate well into our society,
especially since most Singaporeans are themselves second or third
generation immigrants. Indeed, in this House we have Members who
were not born in Singapore, and are now Singaporeans and fully contributing
members of society. And I am sure the overwhelming majority would
have at least one parent or grandparent not born in Singapore, even
amongst Members of this House. Over time, Singaporeans have taken pride
in our unique heritage, and the shared values and norms that we
have evolved over several decades as a nation. Quite naturally,
we expect that our new immigrants should adapt to our values and
norms, and we get upset if they have not yet done so. However, I
do agree with Mr Singh that we should not let recent reactions towards
new immigrants and foreigners undo the good job that we have done
in building a strong and cohesive society out of people from many
lands. </p>

that most of our new immigrants adapt well to life in Singapore,
and have good relations with their Singaporean neighbours and colleagues. With
time, our new citizens will become familiar with Singapore's norms
and culture. With goodwill and patience on all sides, we can reach
out, build a common sense of identity and work together towards
a shared future. The National Integration Council will continue to look at
ways to enhance relations between locals and new immigrants and help
new immigrants better adapt to Singapore's culture and norms. On
scholarships, PSC scholarships are only given to Singaporeans.</p>

As we do so, we will engage Singaporeans and ensure that the views,
aspirations and concerns of our people are considered. The National
Population and Talent Division (NPTD) in the Prime Minister's Office
is comprehensively examining our population goals and policies.
In the course of the year, NPTD will work with other agencies, engage
stakeholders and members of the public through dialogues and online
channels to discuss these issues holistically, including the size
and composition of our population. These will impact on issues such as
land use and infrastructure planning, as several Members, including
Mr Seah, have referred to.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Heng Chee How</strong>
                  </span>: The first
cut is on re-employment in the public service. The Civil Service
had taken the lead in implementing re-employment since July 2011,
six months ahead of the re-employment law taking effect throughout
Singapore. What has been the outcome of this seven-month experience
of system-wide implementation within the Civil Service? What percentage
of civil servants are now re-employed? How does that compare to
the situation before the system-wide implementation? Were there cases
where re-employment was not offered? If so, what were the reasons?
What problems surfaced as implementation became system-wide? How
does the Civil Service approach re-employment balance between the
need for consistency across a wide service and the need for sufficient
flexibility for entities to take into account the reasonable factors
when re-employing? Would the Civil Service take into account the private
sector's experience and practices in re-employment to refine its
own approach over time?</p>

               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6b4aa791-3d5f-4f6d-af9d-8abc46bdf4ea">
                  <a name="budget__id-6b4aa791-3d5f-4f6d-af9d-8abc46bdf4ea"><!--a--></a>Sir, the second cut is
on medical benefit in re-employment. Older civil servants are generally
on the comprehensive co-payment inpatient medical benefit scheme
(CCS). A smaller number are on the co-payment of ward or CPW scheme.
Newly employed civil servants are on the Medisave–cum-subsidised
outpatient medical benefit (MSO) scheme. When a civil servant is
re-employed at age 62, he is emplaced on the MSO scheme, and in
that scheme he gets 1% of his pay credited into Medisave subject
to a cap of $70 a month and he can use that to buy medical insurance.
By the age of 62, many, if not most, would not be insurable on account
of pre-existing illnesses. On the other hand, if they had bought
insurance on their own earlier, while on the CPW or CCS schemes,
they would have over-insured themselves and paid unnecessary premiums. The
re-employed civil servants are asking to be allowed to continue
on CCS up to the age of 65. The CCS pipeline, I understand, is about
20 years long − that means 20 cohorts of civil servants before everyone
becomes MSO. And I would like to ask the Civil Service whether there
would be any help that it can extend to these re-employed civil
servants on account
of their moving away from the CCS onto the MSO and thus not being insurable.</p>

lower income public servants. The public sector continues to employ
persons in the daily-rated and Division IV categories. Many of these
have been working in the public sector for years and decades. They,
like those in the private sector, would also want to see sustained
improvement in their real wages. I would like to ask for an update
on how many public sector employees fall within these two categories, namely,
daily-rated and Division IV categories and how many public sector
employees are also supported by the Workfare programme and what
has been done over the past several years to improve their employability
and earnings. I would also like to ask the Government what additional
measures would be considered to enable these lower wage public sector
employees to increase their job value and earn a better income on
a sustained basis.</p>

officers are on the MSO medical benefit scheme. For outpatient treatment,
the Public Service Division (PSD) provides a co-payment annual cash
budget of $350 regardless of pay and for treatment at the private
clinics the limit is $10 per visit. As for inpatient treatment,
the PSD provides 1% additional Medisave contribution based on the

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Pritam Singh</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, the
first cut is on PSC scholarships for minority students. During the
last general elections, I raised the issue of the relatively low
number of PSC scholarships awarded to minorities relative to their
numbers in the overall population. In the July/August 2011 copy
of <em class="ph i">Challenge</em>, a bi-monthly publication of the Public Service Division,
the Chairman of the PSC, Mr Eddie Teo, acknowledged that the Commission nudges
itself when it finds too few non-Chinese applicants. However, in
view of the disproportionately
low number of minority scholars from 2002, an informal policy of nudging,
I feel, may not be enough. I am not asking for an affirmative action
programme or quotas for minority students, but for the PMO to look
into ways to encourage Malay, Indian, Eurasian and other minorities
to actively apply for PSC scholarships. In particular, the PMO can
look into working with ethnic self-help groups like MENDAKI and SINDA
and even the Eurasian Association in the larger way. In addition,
it may be worthwhile for the self-help groups also to track the
total number of minority applicants for PSC scholarships with PMO's
assistance if it is not doing so already.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1637</p>

quoted as saying in the <em class="ph i">Challenge</em> article that some may not want
to join the public service. This ought to represent an opportunity
for the self-help groups to work together with the PSC to encourage
more minority students to apply for Government scholarship, especially
since public service is a noble career.</p>

the only way to ensure a strong minority community. Not every bright
Indian, Malay or Eurasian student may achieve the minimum requirements necessary
to qualify for PSC scholarships. SINDA, MENDAKI and other self-help
groups have an overarching duty to look after all students regardless
of their educational profile. But drawing a connection between the
number of minority applications and successful recipients of PSC
scholarships would be a useful indicator of how far the minority communities
have come along in the nation-building journey.</p>

my next cut under Head U − the Ombudsman. During his Presidential
campaign last year, President Tony Tan noted that the ombudsman
was an institution that ought to be looked into. The office of the
ombudsman was first proposed to the Government by the 1966 Wee Chong
Jin's Constitutional Commission, and in 1994, then backbencher and
current Law Minister K Shanmugam also raised it in Parliament. The
role of an ombudsman is to investigate complaints about the unfair administrative
decisions or actions of a public agency, including delay, rudeness, negligence,
arbitrariness, oppressive behaviour or unlawfulness.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1c691ef2-9b60-4b88-8924-6f3601d39128">
                  <a name="budget__id-1c691ef2-9b60-4b88-8924-6f3601d39128"><!--a--></a>An ombudsman does not
have the power to make decisions that are binding on the government.
Rather, the ombudsman makes recommendations for change as supported
by a thorough investigation of the complaint. A crucial element
of the ombudsman is its independence from the executive or administrative
branch of government. There are many variations of the ombudsman
office around the world. Singapore can and should find a variation
that suits local needs and conditions. An ombudsman with a well-defined
role and clear mechanism for action can be beneficial for Singapore. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-99d224f1-2f2c-4c0d-af75-f5ddcd32bcef"><!--a--></a>Sir, Singaporeans today
are well educated, well travelled and well informed. This invariably
leads to higher citizenry expectations when it comes to political
and corporate governance. Higher expectations are not necessarily
negative developments for they signify growing interest in local
politics and the national agenda. The establishment of an ombudsman
will address higher citizenry expectations in two ways. First, it
will signify the Singapore Government's acknowledgement and respect
of a maturing Singapore polity's desire for a variety of institutions
that can reflect the concerns of the ordinary citizen. This will
serve to build trust between society and State. Secondly, it will develop
local civil society by empowering institutions. While many would
agree that capable
and honest leaders are vital for good governance, the signs of a
mature and self-sustaining society are decentralised and independent
institutions.</p>

ombudsman would also be in keeping with the Prime Minister's vision
for an open and inclusive society and, most certainly, in tandem
with Budget 2012 which has also been characterised as an inclusive
one. An ombudsman is not designed to serve as a check on the Government.
That is the Opposition's role. An ombudsman should not use its office
or mission to disrupt the work of the Civil Service. It should not
mischievously aim to embarrass Government agencies and offices or
erode public confidence in the Civil Service. The need for an ombudsman,
Sir, is not based on any inadequacies of the Singapore Government,
but rather on the fact that Singaporeans and Singapore society have
evolved. Singaporeans are now more politically mature. With maturity
comes the need for empowerment. Empowerment is necessary for a sense
of ownership to develop. An ombudsman would be a step in this direction.</p>

Sir, in January 2012, this House debated the White Paper on Salaries

I will touch on two principles, namely: (1) Salaries must be competitive
so that people of the right calibre are not deterred from stepping
forward to lead the country; (2) The ethos of political service
entails making sacrifices and hence there should be a discount in
the pay formula.</p>

Public Service has been very much in the news with high-profile media
reports on alleged illegal or unethical behaviour by public servants.
These have affected the image and reputation of the Public Service

have been asked about the robustness of the selection system for
officers in leadership roles.</p>

that the three principles of Ministerial pay must evolve if they
are not to lose their relevance, legitimacy and impact. First, the
principle that salaries must be competitive. Competitiveness of
pay is both a loaded and contested concept. It puts at the forefront the
question of what is the market value of a public sector leader.
And nestled within that is the mantra of "top dollar for top talent".
I am aware that even as our political leaders and top civil servants
are paid well, they are paid "by reference to the market" rather
than at market value. Public sector pay also lags rather than leads private

that for high-calibre Singaporeans today, public service is but
one option among many. However, can we consider making a shift in
the discourse to "fair pay" rather than "competitive pay"? The notion
of competitive pay is too infused with market and managerial logic.
This makes the public sector all too vulnerable to concerns and
criticisms that it is ultimately about a "race to the top" where
pay is concerned. But it is compounded by the popular public perception
that the public sector is too insulated from the discipline and
incentives that drive private sector performance. In fact, I fear
that the public would rather a "race to the bottom" in terms of
pay. Fair pay is a universal value that we can all identify with.
Fairness is the language of Budget 2012. A focus on fairness recognises
that we should not discriminate against good work, even in the public
sector.</p>

in comparing public sector pay with private sector pay, the whole
notion of "competitive pay" will only maintain the abiding focus
on one's market value. Keeping up with private sector pay is almost
an exercise in futility. Further, a balance needs to be struck between
competency, material rewards and integrity. They are not mutually
exclusive. There need not be a Faustian bargain between the value
of and the values of public service. It is crucial for our public
sector leaders to have a nuanced understanding that the craft of
government they practise does exist for more than just its own sake. </p>

to the principle that the ethos of top political service entails making
sacrifices and hence there should be a discount in the pay formula.
Sir, can we instead steer the narrative towards how we, as a society,
can nurture the ethos of public service and encourage the sense
of duty and obligation to serve the larger good? "Sacrifices" sound
almost too altruistic. </p>

need to imbue Singaporeans with a strong sense of duty and obligation
to serve. Duty and obligation comes across positively as "life-giving"
rather than somewhat fatalistic idea of sacrificing. In essence,
the market for virtue certainly could be strengthened, particularly
for the public sector. In so doing, as a society, we are striving
to protect and strengthen the best values, practices and traditions
of the public service so as to continue to earn the confidence and
trust of Singaporeans. </p>

the public service itself that has to be the staunchest advocate
and promoter of its ethos, ethical standards and aspirations. This
will help it compete for Singaporeans with talent, drive and integrity.</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
there are about 76,000 civil servants of which about 0.3% are from
the Administrative Service, which is about 300. Their accelerated
promotional prospects as well as their much higher salary scales
have caused some unhappiness amongst
many civil servants. Sir, in 2007, when we debated the revision
to the salaries of the civil servants, I had expressed reservations
about pegging the salary scale of the senior civil servants' salary
to that of the top private sector salary earners. I was concerned
as to the kind of message we are sending to the rest of Singapore
when we pay such top dollars to the officers in the Administrative
Service. </p>

by paying such high salaries, the Government is inadvertently sending
the wrong message to the rest of Singapore that we promote elitism
within the ranks of civil servants. Do we give the impression that
Administrative Officers do not have any role to play in nation-building
and that the value of their services can all be computed based on
dollars and cents? What about the other civil servants, many of
whom put in hours and hours of hard work and made huge sacrifices just
to make sure that the essential services of the country continue
to run smoothly? </p>

many of our Administrative scholars are brilliant and deserve a
fair and reasonable compensation for their services. However, I
am of the view that it is timely for us to carry out a review of
the Administrative Service. We should ensure that the Administrative
Service continues to remain relevant; and it does not promote elitism
or divide the country in today's political climate.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, for
any organisation, the ability to integrate and coordinate amongst
its different parts to produce a good experience for the customer
is key to its success. This is the same for government. Seamless
and caring government is a hallmark of successful government. Hence,
the whole-of-Government approach is both important and necessary.
Where the ground experience has proven to be otherwise, it is usually
due to silo mentality among public sector agencies where the citizens
get pushed from pillar to post, or a "no man's land" mentality where
no one seems to be in charge of a particular subject matter, or
less than customer-centric approaches when coordinating plans. I
would like to ask for an update on the state of whole-of–Government
coordination and implementation. From the civil service perspective,
what lessons have been learnt over the past several years of implementing
such an approach, and what is the mechanism to share such lessons
across public sector or agencies for organisational learning and
improvement?</p>

Sir, in 2004, the "No Wrong Door" policy was introduced, as public
officers were empowered to participate in continuous improvement,
service excellence and public engagement. It is in line with PS21
aims to nurture public officers who are motivated, engaged, enterprising
and innovative. This policy helps deal with misdirected feedback
and must cross cover agencies' issues efficiently and effectively.
There are many day-to-day examples which I can quote, for example,
between LTA and SLA, between NEA, AVA, Town Councils and HDB, and many
others.</p>

cause anxiety and frustration on the ground. Explanation and communications
seem to be lacking in these cases. I hope some of these examples can be covered as
teaching elements in the "No Wrong Door" course (code: OANWD1), run
by the Civil Service College.</p>

once we have all these basic fundamental principles put right, our
public service would have lived up to its objective of delighting
customers, engaging the citizens. In going the extra mile, we can
not only meet their expectations but also exceed them. Thus, the
"No Wrong Door" policy certainly needs enforcing. Every door must
be the right door.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
would like to thank the Members for their interest, and support
for the Public Service. This year's Budget has committed to building
a fair and inclusive society, and the Public Service will play its
part as a responsible employer. Mr Heng Chee How asked for an update
on re-employment in the Public Service. The new Public Service guidelines
on re-employment for retiring officers took effect on 1 July 2011,
six months ahead of national legislation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-71e6c855-c0b4-4fae-b8f8-b75c0bfa2421">
                  <a name="budget__id-71e6c855-c0b4-4fae-b8f8-b75c0bfa2421"><!--a--></a>Even before 1 July 2011,
the Public Service was already re-employing many of its retired
officers. In the first half of 2011, 385 officers or 74% of those
who retired were re-employed. In the second half of the year after
the guidelines took effect, 448 officers or 81% of those who retired
were re-employed. This is a seven-percentage point increase. Of
the 107 officers who were not re-employed from 1 July to 31 December
2011, 48 did not meet the qualifying criteria, such as the minimum
performance requirement. Fifty-two chose not to be re-employed.
The remaining seven officers were not re-employed due to reasons
such as poor health and lack of suitable positions. Agencies have
the flexibility to re-employ officers who did not meet the qualifying
criteria. In the second half of 2011, 22 such officers were re-employed
as they were assessed to be able to continue contributing to the
organisation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ace83d15-a8cd-4179-adfe-af938bfbc18a">
                  <a name="budget__id-ace83d15-a8cd-4179-adfe-af938bfbc18a"><!--a--></a>In general, the implementation
of re-employment has been smooth as they were the result of extensive
consultation with public sector agencies and unions. Our older officers
have generally kept an open mind about the re-employment options
presented to them. There were some appeals from officers who did
not meet the qualifying criteria. The national legislation for re-employment
has just taken effect on 1 January 2012, and PSD will monitor the
implementation of re-employment in the private sector, and see how
we can learn from best practices there. </p>

medical benefits for re-employed officers. When public sector agencies
offer re-employment, this is seen as a fresh episode of employment. This
allows for flexibility in job arrangements, to take into consideration
officers' preferences and availability of suitable positions in
the organisations. As such, re-employed officers are placed on the
prevailing medical benefit scheme available to those entering into
new employment contracts, that is, the Medisave cum Subsidised Outpatient
(MSO) scheme. </p>

MSO scheme receive an additional sum of 1% of their monthly salary,
capped currently at $70 per month, in their Medisave Account. This
sum is meant for the purchase of MediShield or Medisave-approved
medical insurance. Since October 2006, PSD has made arrangements
for a panel of insurance companies to provide Medisave-approved
medical insurance coverage at discounted rates to public officers and
their dependants. Some 98% of MSO officers have taken up such insurance
plans. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5ad2bff7-5069-4acd-9caf-2c87beda63c9">
                  <a name="budget__id-5ad2bff7-5069-4acd-9caf-2c87beda63c9"><!--a--></a>Older civil servants on
the Co-payment on Ward medical scheme or Comprehensive Co-payment
Scheme should also take up medical insurance early. While these
two schemes provide
good medical coverage while the officer is in service, non-pensionable officers
will cease to have these medical benefits after retirement. Officers
should therefore plan early to take up medical insurance to make
sure of coverage after their retirement. </p>

also work with insurance companies to examine the feasibility of
having appropriate medical insurance packages to cater to these
non-pensionable officers who wish to have medical coverage only
after they retire. The insurance companies will have to assess the
viability and cost of the proposal based on commercial considerations. </p>

for a review of the Civil Service medical benefits. The Civil Service
reviews its medical benefits periodically to ensure that they are
adequate. Our past reviews have shown that the provisions of the
MSO scheme have been adequate when compared to the private sector.
As part of our regular reviews, PSD will take another look at the
MSO scheme, and see whether any adjustments need to be made. We
will also engage the unions as part of this process. The review
should be completed in the second half of the year. </p>

for the development, employability and wage growth of the Division
IV officers and daily-rated employees in the Public Service. As
at the end of last year, there were 3,761 Division IV and daily-rated
employees, or about 3% of the total public sector staff strength.
The Civil Service has a Training Incentive Scheme to encourage officers
to upgrade themselves. Officers may receive cash incentives for completing
specific work-related National-level Training Programmes, and Ministries may
also customise their own training schemes to develop their officers.
The employability and earnings of these officers are also improved
through job re-design. Last year, the National Environment Agency
re-designed the jobs of more than 600 daily-rated employees. The
revised work scope resulted in better career advancement. Their monthly
salaries were also increased by 4%.</p>

officers are in the Operations Support and related schemes. To ensure
that salaries remain competitive, the monthly salaries of these
officers were increased by approximately 5% in February 2012, and
this benefited about 2,300 officers. From 1 April 2012, the Public
Service will also re-employ all eligible Division IV officers at
their last drawn salaries at the point of retirement, and this will
benefit about 590 officers retiring from 2012 to 2015.</p>

Prof Eugene Tan's points on promoting the ethos of public service
and his reflections on the debate which we had here recently on
Ministers' salaries. During the debate on Ministers' salaries, the
Prime Minister explained that establishing an appropriate salary
framework is important to ensure that we have the leadership needed
for our future. The Government agrees with the three principles
for determining salaries of political office holders that were proposed
by the Committee – competitive salary, ethos of public service embodied
through sacrifice and clean wage. And these three principles were
also endorsed by both sides of this House.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-37e6cc49-53d0-4e29-8dc3-730f81fdb857"><!--a--></a>I agree with Asst Prof
Tan that we should encourage and nurture the ethos of public service
among Singaporeans so as to groom future public service leaders.
The idea of duty and doing something for your country and your people
− these are important things which will inspire young people. Asst
Prof Tan also reflected on how to determine a fair wage. He was
uncomfortable with the idea of sacrifice. The whole process of determining
a fair wage was a very difficult one, which we asked the Committee
to help us to do. And the Committee, with the assistance of HR consultants,
assessed what the fair wage would be for a job which is equivalent
to that of a Minister, given the calibre and experience required
of Ministers, the responsibilities and impact of their jobs and the
scope of decisions that they were expected to make. And then the
Committee applied a discount to reflect the ethos of political service
which was not just a principle put forward by the Committee but
also endorsed by this House and expected now by many people in our
society. </p>

his views on applying some of these principles to the Public Service
and how we might develop a competitive or an appropriate pay framework
for the Public Service. The Government's policy is to pay competitive
salaries that follow but not lead the market. An important point
that the Committee on Salaries expressed was that public officers
"are professionals and hence should not be subject to the same degree
of sacrifice as political appointment holders". And the Government agrees
with this. The principle of paying salaries that are competitive
relative to their market benchmarks is applied to all schemes of
service in the Civil Service. </p>

carry out a review of the salaries of Administrative Service officers,
the judiciary and statutory appointment holders to ensure that the
salary framework remains fair and competitive for those officers
who do very important jobs for us. This will ensure that the Public
Service can continue to get a steady flow of able and committed
people to help staff the key appointments in the Public Service
and organs of state. I expect that this review will be completed
and ready for implementation in six to nine months.</p>

Service. The Public Service needs strong and capable leaders to
work with the elected government to formulate and implement policies
for Singapore's long-term success. Such leaders are expected to possess
outstanding leadership qualities, uphold public service values and
provide whole-of-Government perspectives in tackling complex issues.
The Administrative Service inducts and trains a steady pipeline
of high-calibre officers for top leadership positions in the Public
Service. And this is a system that has worked well for Singapore and
it is a key element in ensuring that we have a Public Service of
high quality to serve Singaporeans. Anyone, both from within or
outside the Public Service, can apply to join the Administrative
Service. Of the 190 appointments to the Administrative Service in
the past 10 years, more than 90% started from other schemes of the
Public Service. These include the management executive scheme, the
uniformed services and the economists, teaching and foreign services.
And of the 43 permanent secretaries and statutory boards CEOs who
are in the Administrative Service, 22 were selected to join the
Administrative Service later in their careers, after they had established
themselves in their previous schemes of service. </p>

Service officers are suited for the wide-ranging and cross-sectoral
work expected of Administrative Service officers. And some officers
may be better suited, or prefer, to specialise or to work in specific
Ministries or agencies. Training and leadership development opportunities
are also offered to all good officers. For instance, the key milestone
programmes at the senior level offered by the Civil Service College
are extended to both Administrative Officers and officers from other schemes
of service. Selection and training help us to promote and reinforce
the ethos of public service. And we expect all our public officers,
and not just Administrative Officers, to demonstrate the values
of public service − Integrity, Service and Excellence. And this is
reflected in the way that we evaluate, reward and promote our officers.</p>

for the setting up of an office of the ombudsman. Sir, in principle,
the idea of having such a function is a good one. Indeed, there
are already many avenues for members of the public to raise complaints
if they feel that they have received unfair or unreasonable treatment
by Government agencies or if they want to report poor public service
delivery or improper behaviour or wrongdoing. I appreciate his comments
that he does not feel that there are inadequacies in the Public
Service today. Citizens, who feel aggrieved by Government decisions,
already write directly to the public service agencies in-charge
of the policy. There are processes for such grievances and appeals
to be carefully considered. </p>

Members who help their constituents make representations to the
relevant authorities. I am sure that Mr Pritam Singh must have received
some visits from his constituents and must have written some of
these letters himself. Members also raise pertinent concerns during
Question Time in Parliament to be addressed by the Minister-in-charge
or the Prime Minister. Members of the public can also lodge complaints
on unsatisfactory public service delivery, or hopefully send plaudits to the quality
service manager in each public agency. Beyond the individual agency,
they can send complaints to REACH, the Government's feedback unit
that proactively engages citizens and promotes active citizenry,
or the Public Service 21 Office at PSD which coordinates service
quality efforts across the Public Service. </p>

last month, there are already many channels to report wrongdoing
in the Public Service. Apart from reporting to the head of the department
or agency, a member of the public can report the matter to the permanent
secretary overseeing the Ministry or indeed to the Minister. Alternatively,
he can make a report to the Head of Civil Service or the Public
Service Commission. Corruption cases should be reported to the Corrupt
Practices Investigation Bureau. </p>

write to the media or express their views through the social media
and new media. This is something that did not exist in 1966. There
is thus no shortage of official or unofficial channels for citizens
to lodge their complaints. In a sense, there is not just one ombudsman
– everything centralised and embodied in one person and one agency
− but many who collectively serve the same function. Therefore, our
view is that we do not need to create a separate office of ombudsman
in our system of government. I was doing some background research
on the subject and I was struck by how remarkably similar Mr Pritam
Singh's speech is to a 23 September 2008 article on the Internet
called "Time for an Ombudsman in Singapore". Almost word for word. </p>

the points on service delivery and whole-of-Government coordination
raised by Mr Heng Chee How and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef. The challenges
in service delivery usually occur where no clear agency is in charge
or where the problem needs to be dealt with by several agencies.
And I do empathise with the frustrations that members of the public
may face from time to time. The dual role of being a Minister in
our Government system is that he is also a Member of Parliament, so
I do face some of these frustrations myself when representing my
constituents. So, you know that everyone is dealt with very fairly.
We all have our fair share. </p>

the "No Wrong Door" policy in 2004. When an agency receives a query
that is not under its charge, it must identify the right agency
or agencies to look into the issue and help to coordinate a response.
This has helped to resolve a good number of issues. However, there
are still situations that are poorly defined and fall through the
cracks and the Public Service can do better in finding solutions
to these. I freely acknowledge that. To improve on the "No Wrong
Door" policy, the Public Service Division will pilot a First Responder
Protocol. Under this protocol, the first agency that receives the
feedback, if this agency has some domain expertise, must diagnose
the problem and draw the required expertise from across the agencies
to coordinate an effective response. This agency must then close
the loop with the member of public who raised this issue in the
first place so that he knows some action is being taken.</p>

pilot the First Responder Protocol in the area of handling feedback
about animal-related issues, with Agri-food and Veterinary Authority
being the First Responder. Depending on the lessons from the pilot,
the First Responder Protocol could eventually have broader application
across more service delivery areas and agencies. There is also a
group of issues where, quite frankly, we will find it hard to meet the
expectations of members of the public. People will have different
views on, for example, whether a bird singing in the morning is
noise or a happy reminder of nature. And some members of the public
want public agencies to act against neighbours or sometimes even
family members with whom they have a private disagreement. In these cases, we hope that
members of the public understand that it may not be possible for the
Public Service to meet their expectations.</p>

I want to reassure the Members that the Public Service is working
hard to coordinate solutions to address the needs of the public,
I would also like to urge the public to also be reasonable in their
requests. Let me cite a few examples of some requests that our officers
on the ground have dealt with patiently and with good humour. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1646</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3c02cddc-e462-485e-98e0-723fba6bafb6">

of the public dropped four books at a HDB counter and told the officer
to return them to the National Library Board because there is a
"No Wrong Door" policy [<em class="ph i">Laughter</em>]. On another occasion, a
resident in Jurong called the National Library Board call centre
to ask for the weather conditions in Ang Mo Kio. Well, in both cases,
the public officers did help. The HDB officer dropped the books
off at the library on her own time while the NLB officer called
a colleague at Ang Mo Kio to check and told the caller that "the
weather is very hot" [<em class="ph i">Laughter</em>]. I am not saying that such
stories are rampant but we should all take a reasonable and even-handed
approach. Policies like the "No Wrong Door" policy are meant to
address real and pressing needs, and the time and resources taken
to deal with unreasonable requests means that someone else's needs are
being put on hold. This is surely not how we want our public officers'
time and taxpayers money to be utilised. </p>

also proactively identify service delivery issues that require a
more structural or long-term solution. One such area is the cleaning
of public spaces, which is under the responsibility of various agencies
such as the National Environment Agency for public roads and the
PUB for drains. </p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman, Sir, over
the last few years, Singaporeans have experienced the impact and
effects of climate change in Singapore. The weather in Singapore
has become more unpredictable. The ambient air temperature is rising,
and extreme downpour of rain has caused flooding in many parts of
Singapore. Thus, there is no need to spend too much effort to increase
the awareness of Singaporeans on climate change. Everyone knows
that climate change is affecting Singapore and Singaporeans. What
we need to do is to work out a strategic plan to fight climate change
effectively in Singapore.</p>

has contributed to climate change and global warming. Many studies

gas emissions. In fact, buildings and their electrical appliances

ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by vehicles: first, reduce

green buses. May I ask the Minister what is Singapore's long-term strategy

and disappointment with incremental political progress but little
real impact on the climate. The negotiating process itself has come
under great scrutiny from various quarters, including the poorest
nations and small countries who blame their needs are often overlooked
or neglected in the fight among the major economic powers.</p>

Mr Chairman, as a low-lying urbanised island city-state, Singapore
is particularly vulnerable to the potential impact of climate change,
as mentioned by the speakers before. Now, moderate rise in sea levels
around us will have a significant impact on our nation. While we
therefore need to be aware of the dangers of global warming, we
also need to ensure that we do what we can to slow its rate and mitigate
its impact. Beyond the immediate dangers posed by rising sea levels
and climate change, there is also the economic impact which results.
For example, a change in weather patterns could result in rice harvest
in rice producing countries being adversely affected with rice costing
more to import into Singapore. It is, therefore, not just a physical
threat but also one with very real economic consequences. </p>

key cause of climate change − the build-up of greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide − and significant amounts
of time and effort have been spent internationally negotiating reductions
in greenhouse gas emission levels. As a party to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, as mentioned by Dr Lam,
could the Minister please elaborate on what Singapore is doing to
reduce its carbon footprint and to encourage Singaporeans generally
to do so?</p>

being taken to encourage Singaporeans to adopt a greener way of
living? And while the Government seeks to grow the economy, it should do
this with the mindset of a responsible global player and promote
growth in a sustainable manner with one eye always being kept on
the impact from a climate change perspective in such growth. Could
the Minister elaborate on how the Government intends to promote

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
I would like to thank Dr Teo Ho Pin, Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Charles
Chong for their questions on climate change. The world's climate
is changing and the unusual number of extreme weather calamities
may be a prelude to what is to come if no action is taken. As Members
have highlighted, Singapore is a low-lying island and we are vulnerable
to the effects of climate change. We must prepare ourselves for
this challenging future. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f6dd8dfa-d410-49c0-9b0c-825e9efa1abd">
                  <a name="budget__id-f6dd8dfa-d410-49c0-9b0c-825e9efa1abd"><!--a--></a>Singapore has long strived
to achieve the twin goals of growing the economy and protecting
the environment. We have switched from fuel oil to natural gas,
the cleanest form of fossil fuel, for most of our power generation.
We are also possibly the only country to cap vehicle growth and
price vehicle usage in accordance with congestion and the impact
this makes on our living environment. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-119bfb69-4eaa-45d6-a4fd-b534d7dee0b0">

scarcer, we will need to accomplish more with less. We can achieve
economic growth in a sustainable manner by development and deploying energy-efficient
and clean technologies. Investments and capability development in
this area will give Singapore a competitive advantage. This will
help contribute to our economic vibrancy, even as we reduce our
carbon footprint over the long term, which Dr Lam asked about. </p>

to enhance our resilience towards climate change. For example, we
have made plans to protect our coast and to improve our drainage. Singapore's
coastal reclamation sites were previously required to be at a minimum
level of 1.25 metres above the highest recorded tide level. This
has now been raised by an additional one metre to safeguard against
projected sea-level rises by the year 2100. We also build our expertise in climate science
and modelling and study the adverse impact of climate change on
us. So, we will be investing capabilities in these areas.</p>

about our measures for engaging the public, private and people sectors
in combating climate change. Our vision for Singapore is a climate resilient,
global city that is well positioned for green growth. Our national
Climate Change Strategy and plans will be set out in greater details
in a document called the National Climate Change Strategy 2012 (NCCS
2012). As part of this preparation work, the National Climate Change
Secretariat, together with the agencies under the Inter-Ministerial
Committee on Climate Change, conducted consultations with a wide
range of stakeholders from September 2011 to January 2012. Various
channels were used to reach different segments of the public, including
an online consultation portal, focus group discussions and public
forums. The public forums were held in partnership with the five
Community Development Councils (CDCs) to reach out to grassroots
leaders and residents on how they could play a part to address climate
change, and I would like to thank Dr Teo Ho Pin, Dr Lam Pin Min
and Dr Amy Khor for chairing the forums organised in their respective
CDCs. I also commend Dr Teo for his Town Council's efforts to save
energy, fight climate change and also save money for those living
in his Town Council.</p>

have asked about what progress we have made to achieve the goals
listed in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint. Progress has been
made towards the targets listed in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint
which fall into the broad categories of energy efficiency, water
consumption, recycling, air quality, and green and blue spaces.
In the area of energy efficiency, we have implemented programmes
that target the household, industry, transport and building sectors.
For example, the National Environment Agency has introduced a number
of programmes to provide assistance to companies to encourage them
to design energy-efficient facility, conduct energy audits, train
energy managers and invest in energy-efficient equipment or technologies.
The National Environment Agency has implemented the Mandatory Energy
Labelling Scheme for household air conditioners, refrigerators and
clothes dryers which are energy-intensive electrical appliances.
Since September 2011, Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS)
were also set for household air conditioners and refrigerators which
remove the most inefficient models from the market by prohibiting
the sale of appliances that fall short of a specified minimum energy-efficient
level. They help consumers avoid being locked into the higher operating costs
of inefficient appliances. MEPS also encourage suppliers to bring
in more energy efficient appliances as technology improves. </p>

from 165 litres per capita in 2003 to 153 litres in 2011, PUB implemented
initiatives such as the mandatory water efficiency labelling scheme.
This scheme was introduced in 2009 to help consumers make more informed
purchasing decisions and encourage suppliers to introduce more water efficient
products into the market. This scheme covers water fittings, such
as taps and mixers, dual-flush low-capacity flushing cisterns, urinal
flush valves and waterless urinals. We can go into this further
if you want. As part of the scheme, suppliers are required to label
the water efficiency of their appliances on all displays, packaging
and advertisements. </p>

to a greener Singapore, the Government will introduce new policies
and legislation, including those which will help consumers make
informed choices. Several of these measures will be announced by
the Ministries under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate

MOT will introduce a new Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme to
encourage car buyers to switch to vehicles with lower emissions.
Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) will raise
the Minimum Energy Performance Standards for air-conditioners and
refrigerators, as well as extend it to lighting. Ministry of Trade
and Industry will work with MEWR to extend the Grant for Energy

                  </span>: I would
like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for introducing the new
LTVP Plus. I think marriage pass is a better term. Could I ask for
clarification on its implementation?
First, as I understand it, this pass plus will only be offered after
the married couple have been living in Singapore for some time.
That would mean a time lag or delay before that facility is available
to them, and therefore hold back their family plans. Would the Deputy
Prime Minister consider compressing this? The second clarification
is, as I understand it, they are eligible to purchase a public flat
only after they have a child. That also may create issues of timing
because after they have a child, which I presume may take some time,
they will then go into the BTO queue and get a flat maybe three
or four years down the road, which means only getting their first
home perhaps six, seven, maybe eight years after marriage. Again,
would the Deputy Prime Minister consider compressing the time frame
so that they can purchase a first house as soon as possible and
start a family as soon as possible?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, we are taking a step-by-step approach. Such families previously
would have qualified for a Long Term Visit Pass, with very few other benefits
associated with it. We are now looking at a sub group of these families
who are not yet ready for PR or citizenship, but we would like to
extend to them more benefits so that they can stabilise and build
stronger family foundations on the way to PR or citizenship. But
it is not just something which the Government does, it is something which
the families and couples too have to work at themselves to improve
their financial situation, to make sure they can support themselves
and their family, and to make sure that the marriage itself is stable,
before they take further steps.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e76e763a-a1ff-4193-82fc-1a993aa24290">
                  <a name="budget__id-e76e763a-a1ff-4193-82fc-1a993aa24290"><!--a--></a>So, the LTVP is a step
to help them stabilise their family, strengthen their foundations. It
will provide medical benefits for hospitalisation, which can be
a major cost for them. This will also cover childbirth, if they
have not had a child yet. It will also provide the opportunity for
the spouse to work. And when the spouse works, the spouse does not need
to have a work permit. The employer will not have to pay the foreign
worker levy, and the foreign spouse will not be counted against
the employer's foreign worker quota, if that is applicable to that
employer. So, these are considerable benefits beyond what is currently
available and we hope that this will help families to settle. I
am sure that there will be many more things that they would want,
but I think that we should graduate this as the families stabilise.</p>

not yet been put on the cards. We are studying all the alternatives,
but compared to other countries, we are severely disadvantaged with
regard to alternative energy possibilities. Even if we covered the whole
island with solar panels, we would not be able to generate enough
electricity for ourselves. It would contribute a small percentage
of the energy we need – a worthwhile effort, but it will not be
a substitute. We will continue to push solar energy as far as we can
go. Many of our new HDB flats have been built with solar panels.
Wind and tidal waves also have limitations. I would say that nuclear
energy is an option which we cannot rule out. We will continue to
study it, but we see it as a very long-term possibility. Nuclear
plants will have to be a couple of orders of magnitude more stable,
safer than they are today before we will feel comfortable having
a nuclear plant in Singapore.</p>

and several Members have actually come up with a few suggestions
on marriage and parenthood. Let us look at all of them. This is
an area which has not made much progress, but it is not for want
of trying. We have instituted a variety of measures over the years.
We have very generous monetary support schemes for families. We
have introduced extended maternity leave. For paternity leave −
something I know Mr Seah is particularly keen on − there are pluses
and minuses. We would have to study the impact, and the experience
of other countries. The experience of other countries on paternity
leave has been mixed. For shared leave, most of the time, it is
the mother who has taken the leave rather than the father. There
are also implications like cost to businesses. So, we have to study
this very carefully. As I have said to Mr Seah – and in his own
words – we will study them carefully, if not for this year, maybe
for later years.</p>

was a major disruption of the North-South MRT Line. Much has been
said about the causes, and the matter is now the subject of an inquiry. We
will in due time learn more about what happened and why, and so
I will not dwell on these matters.</p>

our eyes to another serious issue. There did not appear to have
been an emergency response plan, and if there was one, it was inadequate,
or poorly executed. I am particularly concerned by the chaos that
ensued in the aftermath of the incident. Many people were stuck
in pitch darkness in the tunnel with little ventilation. The electrical
back-up which was supposed to work did not. The train drivers, who
were best placed to take immediate action, were for some reason,
not able to make announcements. The evacuation took a long time
and there was great confusion. The public were still entering the
station thinking that train services were still running. People
leaving the station were not sure what to do and where to go. The crowds
spilled onto the streets, looking for alternative transport. </p>

train disruption. What would have happened if it had been a fire or
if it had been a terrorist attack? There is no doubt that it would
have been horrific. We can have inquiries, meetings and discussions

challenge we face.</p>

ourselves on our record on law and order. We are regarded as one
of the safest countries in the world to live, play and work. But
that is generally in the context of crime prevention and enforcement.
The law and order challenges we face today are different. One of
the greatest risks we face is terrorism. It has not disappeared
with the elimination of Osama Bin Laden or other prominent terrorist
leaders. It may not be as dramatic as airplanes flying into buildings
or terrorists wielding Kalashnikovs running through our streets.
But incidents of sabotage, such as bombs on buses, fires in confined
places, derailment of trains will do just as much damage. Not just
the loss of life and property, but loss of confidence in our agencies
and Singapore as well.</p>

threats? We have conducted a number of exercises to train our Homeland
and Military forces, but the SMRT incident has demonstrated starkly
that there are other areas to address. Chief among these is whether
public transport operators,
owners of buildings and other organisations in charge of places
where large numbers of people congregate or pass through, have adequate
and workable plans to deal with emergencies, have trained their
staff to execute these plans and, just as importantly, whether such
plans are known to, and coordinated with, public agencies such as
the police and SCDF, which will at some stage be responding to the
crisis as well? Is there even a plan or protocol as to when and
what stage the private body should involve the Government agencies? </p>

the first response to a crisis will determine the extent of the damage
or loss to human life. In this regard, it is critical that the organisation
on the ground, whether the public transport operator or the building

able to do so, or is it the case that we will only find out when
a crisis occurs?</p>

Government whether it has plans to audit the emergency plans of
private and Government organisations to see if they are robust,
not just on paper but in practice, and ensure that there will be
effective coordination with public agencies. Does the Ministry of
Home Affairs have a minimum standard for crisis management for significant
institutions and if it does not, is MHA satisfied with allowing
them to determine their own plans?</p>

in place, a theoretical plan can fail quite dramatically when put to
the test. However, paper exercises and rehearsed plans are insufficient.
For example, all buildings are required to conduct fire drills regularly,
but people do not take them seriously. The drills are announced
in advance, and many go for tea breaks or schedule meetings elsewhere
before the alarm is sounded. It gives new meaning to the phrase: "you
know the drill". I accept it is highly disruptive to conduct surprise
drills or to inject greater reality into our security exercises.
No one will be grateful for the inconvenience, and it may even be
dangerous where the plans turn out to be inadequate. </p>

important to ignore or leave to public and private organisations
to work out on their own. I believe that the Government should have
a system to audit the plans of significant organisations to determine
not only that they have adequate and comprehensive safety and evacuation
plans, but that there is proper coordination plan with public agencies,
in particular, the police and the SCDF. It should also include a
proper communications plan − something which we do not do particularly well.
It will be impossible to audit everyone but, at the very least,
high traffic areas such as train stations, bus interchanges, shopping
malls, sports and performance venues. The comments by the auditors
can be integrated into the crisis plan such that any lapses can
be rectified and improvements tested during the next audit. This
would develop into a set of Standard Operating Procedures where
each party knows what they and others are expected to do.</p>

us a lesson in crisis management at relatively little cost. I hope
that something concrete will be done to ensure that we are able

Mr Chairman, our security agencies have done an admirable job in
protecting Singapore from the scourge of terrorism. The non-occurrence
of any terrorist act within our shores in recent history does not
mean that the threat of terrorism has receded, still less, disappear.
Internationally, the blows inflicted on Al Qaeda organisation have
clearly taken away some or much of its capacity to carry out large
scale acts of terrorism like the 2001 destruction of the World Trade
Center. However, it has spawned hosts of small terrorism, which
because they are small in size, are not linked to any central organisations,
are harder to detect and stamp out.</p>

taken against the leading figures of the JI organisation have handicapped
though not destroyed its ability to wreak havoc. However, like a
virus, it continues to evolve. So, for example, a recent report
in <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> told of an offshoot organisation
called the JAT, which is active in Indonesia. Terrorist bombings still
continue to occur within our neighbouring countries. So, the threat
has certainly not gone away but merely evolved.</p>

Sir, as Mr Alvin Yeo and Mr Hri Kumar have highlighted, the threat
of terrorism is still an imminent one that Singapore faces even
many years after the noteworthy attacks on September 11. Although
we have been spared major incidents, it does not mean that we are
immune to such threats or attacks. And there is evidence that Singapore
continues to be vulnerable as it has been described as a significant
target by various groups in Southeast Asia. Our Home Team officers have
been doing a good job at keeping our nation safe and keeping these
threats in check.</p>

other organisation, continue to innovate in a bid to exploit loopholes
in our security. In addition, there have been cases of self-radicalisation,
where the individuals
concerned are harder to detect because of an absence of links to
known threats, but are nevertheless potentially just as dangerous.</p>

Sir, the September 11 attacks of more than 10 years ago have significantly
changed our traditional views of security and safety. We will do
well not to under-estimate the proliferation of new threats from

these threats. And we have to constantly review and revise the efficiency
of these measures.</p>

the 2005 London bombings, we launched in Singapore the Community
Engagement Programme. This is a Programme which seeks to bring together
key members of our community from across a broad spectrum of society.
The objective is to strengthen the bonds in our community and build
resilience from within the Singapore society to better handle threats
of terrorism and other external threats. The principle is, if we
have a cohesive society with a common philosophy and vision, then
these strong communal relations will give us the best defence against
extremist and divisive threats.</p>

network across various stakeholders of society has, over the past
five years, been built around the Community Engagement Programme.
However, the pace at which the world is changing means that our
society is constantly facing new challenges and stresses that will
test our social fabric. It is increasingly difficult to anticipate
all possible threats. One example is in the new media arena where
the Internet allows for the rapid propagation of potentially irresponsible

people sometimes act without a sense of accountability, without
thinking through the consequences of their actions.</p>

Mr Chairman, the Police has done a wonderful job of dealing with
the more serious crimes. As Member of Parliament, the most common feedback
I get in relation to Police issues is more in relation to minor
non-seizeable offences. In this regard, I welcome the additional
resources that are being allocated to community policing. The question
I have is whether or not this will mean that the Police will become
more willing to investigate and, perhaps, even take more serious
action in non-seizeable offences. Now, these include things like
nuisance, noise pollution which may
seem trivial but for the victims themselves, it is obviously an
emotional and distressing thing. I had many residents come to me
and say, "I can't sleep, you know, night after night. Noises there
all time. I called the Police, nothing happens." So, I would like
to ask the Minister whether these additional resources will mean
a greater willingness to look into and deal with non-seizeable offences.</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, the announcement of Next Generation Frontline Policing in November
last year was a positive move in strengthening the Police as "A
Force for the Nation". While the overall crime rate has been declining, Singaporeans
can continue to look to the Police for protection against serious
crime.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d0855fda-15da-436f-811f-a4424678156c">
                  <a name="budget__id-d0855fda-15da-436f-811f-a4424678156c"><!--a--></a>However, Singaporeans,
especially heartlanders, also look to the Police to act effectively
and efficiently in various areas, ranging from human noise pollution
in the heartlands, irresponsible motorcyclists riding on the pedestrian
pavements and thefts to robbery, loanshark harassment, and drug
peddling. These are all issues that affect the lives of ordinary
people on a day-to-day basis and probably happening as we speak.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f5c93db1-e986-4013-a862-c9b95de65750">
                  <a name="budget__id-f5c93db1-e986-4013-a862-c9b95de65750"><!--a--></a>Sir, while the total number
of unlicensed moneylending and loanshark harassment cases has fallen
by about 2.1% in the year 2011, we must not under-estimate the fear
and emotional trauma that victims feel, particularly the family
members and those who are innocent. In such instances, increased
police visibility on the ground would give Singaporeans greater
confidence and further deter potential harassments. The same applies
to other categories of crime.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aaa53a3b-4ffd-43b6-8a00-7d815b8e85f8">
                  <a name="budget__id-aaa53a3b-4ffd-43b6-8a00-7d815b8e85f8"><!--a--></a>This is why there has
been great anticipation and great expectations since the announcement
on Frontline Policing. First, its implementation will be critical
as its success or failure will have a significant impact on public
confidence. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9eb0dec0-39a0-418c-a181-6c30a8a5ac92">
                  <a name="budget__id-9eb0dec0-39a0-418c-a181-6c30a8a5ac92"><!--a--></a>Hence, could the Ministry
explain how the model will be implemented and if it will be rolled
out to areas identified to have greater crime prevalence first?
Sir, I think it is necessary to implement this soon, prioritised
by needs and stress test the model in areas with higher crime prevalence
before the model is fully implemented nation-wide, so that public
feedback can be taken into account and operational refinements,
if any, can be made. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-248adb95-42be-4880-840d-df77f8685c3c">
                  <a name="budget__id-248adb95-42be-4880-840d-df77f8685c3c"><!--a--></a>Sir, there are two very
important thrusts in the upcoming Frontline Policing. One, community
partnership; and two, leveraging technology. In the Frontline Policing model,
technology will be deployed to reinforce Police's efforts. For instance,
by installing CCTV networks at key entry and exit points at HDB
blocks and multi-storey carparks. This will certainly help to deter
crimes and collect crucial evidences to assist Police investigations.
However, the CCTV network is still limited in its reach. It cannot
be installed at every level of the flats and neither can it be installed
at every corner of our neighbourhood. Nor do we want it that way
because that would be a massive infringement on privacy. Therefore,
a strong community partnership is an important complement.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2d93efd2-34b6-4773-b38f-c467b19de8f4">
                  <a name="budget__id-2d93efd2-34b6-4773-b38f-c467b19de8f4"><!--a--></a>In fighting crimes, members
of the community often act as the first line of defence, helping
with surveillance, providing tip-offs and even to apprehend culprits
in some instances. Therefore, would the Ministry consider further
leveraging on technology to facilitate the quest to cultivate strong
community-police partnership? For example, with the proliferation
of smart phones, capturing photos or videos of crimes in action
can be accomplished with relative ease. Members of the public can
then send these directly and instantaneously to the Police via smart
phone applications. This will encourage community vigilance yet
protect members of the public from potential harm, for instance,
arising from direct confrontation with thugs. It can also aid the
Police in identifying suspects, who may have run away by the time
they arrive at the scene.</p>

applications is but a suggestion for the Ministry to consider. The
larger point, however, is that besides working on public education
and community outreach, we should also work on leveraging technology
to strengthen the community-police partnership. If criminals know
that the community is constantly watching and playing a key role
to assist the Police, I am confident that we will achieve even greater crime
deterrence and security within our neighbourhoods.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Desmond Lee (Jurong)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, Sir, last year, the Ministry of Home Affairs announced
that the Police force would be embarking on the Next Generation Frontline
Policing model. Based on the details announced so far, this involves
the establishment of local crime fighting units at the neighbourhood
police centres, deployment of more officers to patrol communities
and neighbourhoods and greater community liaison and networking,
quite apart from leveraging technology to fight crime.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-52eb958e-048f-44bd-93bb-f7b82303c47c">
                  <a name="budget__id-52eb958e-048f-44bd-93bb-f7b82303c47c"><!--a--></a>I welcome this, Sir. Having
deeper local knowledge, stronger local presence and more extensive
local networks will give the Police much stronger crime prevention
and crime-fighting capabilities. More importantly, having officers
on the beat will give residents a sense of assurance, a sense of
security. Apart from deterring the occasional serious crime, such
as housebreaking and robbery, this will also benefit communities
by keeping away undesirable elements and reduce public nuisances,
such as drunk and disorderly conduct. I hope it will also help tackle
the scourge of loansharks.</p>

the Ministry of Home Affairs. First, how many additional police

                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, Sir, I will touch on the Police, auxiliary police and
private security industry in turn. First, the Police. In 2008 the
Ministry embarked on a human factor study which showed that certain
areas of Police work were especially taxed. MHA has been assuring
us that they are expanding. The latest parliamentary answer on 17
February says that it has added 2,000 officers since 2008 and will
be adding another 1,400 this year. We all know that the demands
on SPF have also increased. We need new neighbourhood police centres,
specialists to investigate casino crime, better security for public
transport, and so on. The New Generation Frontline Policing model
just announced was explained to require more resources. So, the
questions remain: is it a case of back to square one despite the
additional officers? How many of the additional officers are NSmen
rather than regulars, which will affect their deployment responsibilities?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-31d2b8fd-3d49-4e87-a107-d0affe31e637">
                  <a name="budget__id-31d2b8fd-3d49-4e87-a107-d0affe31e637"><!--a--></a>Secondly, the auxiliary police. Could
the Ministry confirm how many officers are serving in the auxiliary
police forces collectively and whether there are plans to expand the
auxiliary police forces? It was reported online that auxiliary police
were aggressively recruiting in Malaysia. Does the Government stipulate
the minimum criteria for recruitment since these auxiliary police
will carry firearms and have Police powers, and are they also subject
to psychological testing as with the regular Police?</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1661</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-15f69230-ecd2-4ce6-95da-fdd7d4bd4df5">
                  <a name="budget__id-15f69230-ecd2-4ce6-95da-fdd7d4bd4df5"><!--a--></a>Finally, the unarmed private
security industry. There appears to be a tremendous shortage of
security personnel judging from the job vacancies in newspapers
and feedback from security business owners. Though there may be
nearly 30,000 holding security officer licences, how many are still
actively working in the industry? A previous parliamentary answer
in 2010 cited that 71% were active based on employers' notifications.
Sir, it seems quite normal for CDCs to refer jobseekers to go for
security training. I know of specific instances where some of those
referred are not in good health but I understand that they need
to work. On the other hand, I have come across some able-bodied
persons who were not able to get the clearance to work in this industry
due to past criminal record. I completely agree with the need for
Police screening of potential security officers. I am also aware
that some people with old criminal records were cleared to work
in the industry which is a good thing for rehabilitation. Could
Ministry clarify its stance towards the past criminal records for
those wishing to work as unarmed guards? Are there guidelines about
the types of offences which would disqualify applicants or how old
the records need to be before they can be cleared to work in the industry?</p>

conditions, could the Ministry clarify which provisions of the Employment
Act have private security employers been exempted from and whether
the situation is expected to be permanent?</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
newspapers have been the main way of reporting news and information
for many years. Later, we had the radio and the television. While
that has helped the advancement of society generally, there are
serious risks which come with the easy dissemination of information.
Modern society has over time worked out sensible rules for the media
to abide by so that it will be a tool for enlightenment and progress,
and not one which divides and destroys.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ebd5e772-b23b-493b-a90e-b7d20485030f">

to Singapore but have been developed in many other countries, including
the Commonwealth of nations, from which we inherited much of our
laws. For example, we have rules on <em class="ph i">sub judice</em>, where the
media is not permitted to discuss and speculate on pending court
actions or criminal charges so that the pre-trial will not be prejudiced.
We also have defamation rules, which protect the freedom to express
an opinion honestly held, but not the propagation of lies. Responsible newspapers
apologise or print clarifications when they get the facts wrong,
or print responses to an opinion which is not shared. These rules
advance the cause of accuracy, transparency and accountability,
and provide a framework where people can live and prosper in a healthy
environment.</p>

of these rules and conventions were developed in the age before
the Internet. The Internet represents a platform for everyone to
share information with, and express their views to others. This
facility is no longer the domain of traditional media. That is a
good thing in many ways. However, today, many people, particularly the
younger generation, turn more to the Internet for news and information,
and not only from sites maintained by the established news agencies
or reputable journalists. The rules, convention and discipline which
have been built up for many years do not apply or are difficult
to enforce, and there are serious consequences to this.</p>

Internet or people's right to express their honest views. There is
much good in this but just as society has developed rules and norms
for traditional media, we need to think about doing the same for
the Internet.</p>

After the announcement of the investigation into the conduct of
the former heads of CNB and SCDF, there was much discussion on the
Net about what they did, and that is to be expected. However, what
also happened was that people began speculating on the identity
of the women who were involved. Pictures and profiles of various
women were circulated. Can you imagine the immense pain and distress
of the women who had been wrongly identified? How would you feel
if that was your mother, your wife, your sister, your daughter,
being so freely discussed and dissected? What is their recourse?
They can sue for defamation, but who do they sue? The messages and
photos would have been circulated to many people, making it difficult
to track down who is responsible. If the posts are anonymous, as
many of them are, how do you go about identifying the perpetrator?
The woman would have to apply to
Court to compel the different hosts of the sites or the Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) to disclose the identity of the individuals
behind the posts, but that may not yield any meaningful results.
And how many people have the resources to take such arduous and expensive
action? It is unfair to the ordinary man in the street that his

a framework of laws which balances the right of an individual to

the laws must be clear enough to prevent abuse, and not be used
as a means to stifle legitimate speech. That is a difficult balance, but,
right now, where the Net is concerned, there is a complete imbalance.
We may even have to set up a specialised agency to help members
of the public who have legitimate grievances. The Internet is an
important tool for advancement, and when used properly, provides
a platform to do much good. But we should all want it to be used

                  </span>: Cyber harassment
is the intentional and repeated cruel or hurtful behaviour that
is carried out over electronic medium including SMS, e-mails, blogs,
chat rooms, discussion boards, instant messaging and social network
websites. In an article, as early as 2008, Stephanie Gwee from <em class="ph i">The
Straits Times</em> actually pointed out that Singapore had the second
highest rate of cyber bullying after the US. This was in the wake
of the tragic suicide of Megan Meier who was a teenager who committed
suicide after harassment on MySpace by the mother of a classmate.
What was worrying is that cyber harassment actually seems to be
a big problem amongst the young, as I think Mr Tong acknowledged
earlier. I think in that survey, about 35% of students, as cited
in the article, were victims of cyber harassment.</p>

harassment is an old businessman familiar to many Singaporeans,
the "<em class="ph i">Ah Long</em>". One of the <em class="ph i">Ah Long'</em>s favourite methods
of harassment is using SMSes. The common thread with cyber harassment
is that the victims of cyber harassment obviously suffer in very
real terms but the perpetrators often are difficult to detect. My
question is: does the Ministry of Home Affairs have any plans to
both detect and protect the victims of cyber harassment? </p>

or committing it. My questions are: first, how prevalent is youth
involvement in unlicensed money lending and what steps are being taken
to address potential temptation or deception of youth to commit
unlicensed money lending activities? Second, how effective have
increased penalties for harassment been in deterring aggressive

                  </span>: Sir, loan
shark harassment strikes terror not only in borrowers but also family
members and innocent neighbours and buyers of flats from such borrowers.
The ability of loan sharks to get to the front door of any HDB flat
and then splash paint or padlock the doors or gates or even set
fire, directly and deeply undermines the public sense of security.
We must get rid of this scourge. The law against illegal money lending
has been strengthened. I note from the media, more frequent reports
of police operations against loan sharks as well as arrest and prosecution
of loan shark runners and the occasional smashing of syndicates.
I would like to ask for an update of the loan sharking situation
in Singapore, the total arrest numbers in comparison with those
of the past few years and whether the stronger law has led to actual
stiffer penalties for loan sharks and their runners. I would also
like to ask the Ministry what additional measures and penalties
are being contemplated to further hit the loan sharks and dent their
ability to terrorise the community.</p>

Sir, I congratulate the Police for making more arrests pertaining

there remain more than 13,000 illegal money lending, loan shark
harassment cases last year. On average, more than 36 cases a day.
Could MHA share how many of the arrest cases in 2011 involved youths
and if there was a rising trend involving young people? Secondly,
how many of those arrested were the masterminds of the loan shark
syndicates? Thirdly, what is the national strategy to combat loan

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit
Timah)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, since the opening of the casinos, the
Government has reiterated that it has put in place a comprehensive
slew of social safeguards to minimise the ills of casino gambling.
Some of these include casino entry levies, entry ban for minors
below 21 years old and casino exclusions orders. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4de81180-76a2-4329-a771-1eefca0c7df5">
                  <a name="budget__id-4de81180-76a2-4329-a771-1eefca0c7df5"><!--a--></a>These are certainly good
infrastructural measures but they must be continually tightened
and refined to counter some of the novel negative repercussions
brought about by the casinos. One interesting trend that has come
to light is that an increasing number of bosses have been using
foreign workers in their employment as proxy gamblers. Some of these
bosses have exclusion orders blocking them from entering the casinos.
This adds a new dimension to the issue of the efficacy of exclusion
orders. Where foreign workers are concerned, much of the discussion
thus far has been centred on minimising the ills of casino gambling
on the foreign workers themselves. However, this new trend has shifted
the spotlight from the workers to the employers, some of whom do
not even consider themselves as offending any moral principles in manipulating
vulnerable employees who are here to eke out a hard living to support their
own families back home. What makes the situation even more contemptible
is that if the workers end up losing money beyond a set maximum,
these losses may sometimes
be recovered from the workers' pay. The inherent nature of gambling
which makes losses almost inevitable means that foreign workers
could thus have their incomes greatly reduced each month. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-3844a438-2fb1-4afe-beae-b648d5576f1d"><!--a--></a>Can the Ministry of Home
Affairs take steps to deter such unconscionable practices and ensure,
for example, that employers who flout these rules are appropriately penalised
for their actions? The Ministry must take a firm and proactive stance
on this: first, to convey a strong normative statement to the public
that it recognises the grave ills posed by gambling to Singapore
society and, more specifically, the moral abhorrence of this trend;
and second, to convey a consistent message that it is a caring and
compassionate Government who acknowledges that an essential component
of its responsibilities lies in protecting the welfare of all who
contribute to Singapore's nation-building – whether as citizens,
Permanent Residents, or foreign workers.</p>

gambling addictions fuelled by the two casinos could spur many debt-ridden
gamblers to turn to loan sharks or unlicensed moneylenders as a
last resort. It is absolutely necessary that the Government does
all it can to suppress illegal money lending and the whole slew
of associated social problems, which are thoroughly far-reaching
and which include family violence, broken families, and emotional
and mental stress brought upon both adults and children. Although
amendments have been made to the Moneylenders Act to make it easier
for loan sharks to get prosecuted, will the Ministry provide some
concrete facts and figures as to whether the revised legislation
has had any impact on the incidences of borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders
in recent months, that is, has it deterred the incidences?</p>

as loan sharks are likely to jump at "the lucrative opportunity
of baiting more borrowers trying to gamble their way to prosperity".
It is a vicious cycle as hard-core gamblers who are trying to get
out of huge debts chalked up from previous gambling spates take
out loans from these loan sharks in the hope that their potential
winnings would cover the losses − only to incur even more losses.
As long as such demand for an easy loan exists, it will be difficult
to put a complete stop to such loan sharking activities. Are there
additional measures – beyond enhanced penalties and stricter enforcement
– that the MHA or even the MCYS can put in place to combat the problem
holistically, such as working with community organisations and more aggressive
publicity and education? In conclusion, such extra vigilance is
also necessary to guard against organised crime groups such as drug,
vice, and money laundering syndicates taking root in Singapore.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Christopher de Souza</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, Sir, last year marked the start of a serious discourse
on the state of human trafficking in Singapore and the adequacy
of our legal framework and enforcement activities to tackle the
very serious issue. The Singapore Inter-agency Taskforce on Trafficking
in Persons to intensify the coordination of anti-trafficking initiatives
between Government agencies here is a positive start. A National Plan
of Action to tackle both sex and labour trafficking is currently
in the process of being developed, and will detail strategies to
reduce the incidence of human trafficking in Singapore, minimise
exploitation opportunities by traffickers, and heighten our national response
to trafficking cases. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e65ced48-28ad-410a-975f-db0de3b13442">
                  <a name="budget__id-e65ced48-28ad-410a-975f-db0de3b13442"><!--a--></a>Even as the Government
works on prevention by strict border enforcement and thorough immigration
checks as well as the prosecution of human traffickers, much more
can be done with respect to the protection of victims. At present,
MCYS and MOM fund shelters and dormitories that offer accommodation,
medical care and counselling services. I would like to ask the Ministry
what other concrete plans they have in mind to improve these victim
care and support programmes. Taiwan, for example, has set up 19 shelters
to look after victims under the administration of various government
agencies, and the government has worked with NGOs to manage the
shelters and provide victim support services. Perhaps our Government
could look into partnering local NGOs or enhancing support for existing
schemes as a means of managing the needs of the victims. But, in
a way, helping victims is already too late an intervention. We need
to ensure that traffickers are extremely deterred from trying to
place women and children in Singapore, which brings me to the issue
of legislation. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4862d02b-8279-4e30-ac1c-7e86e2753987">
                  <a name="budget__id-4862d02b-8279-4e30-ac1c-7e86e2753987"><!--a--></a>The Ministry has said that it will consider
whether increased enforcement powers, enhanced victim care provisions
and harsher sentences will do the trick. By doing so, it is an acknowledgement,
and rightly so, that new legislation indeed plays a pivotal role in
enhancing our ability to fight human trafficking at the borders.
How will the MHA ensure that traffickers are deterred and, if caught,
punished harshly? </p>

nature of human trafficking – which was acknowledged by the Minister,
Mr S Iswaran, in a previous debate we had in this House – how will
MHA work with other ASEAN countries to ensure the incidence of human trafficking
within ASEAN is significantly reduced? </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Teo Chee Hean</strong>
                  </span>: Thank
you, Mr Chairman. Allow me to thank hon Members for their views
and questions. Over the years, robust laws, effective enforcement
and concerted outreach have reduced crime, strengthened communities
and kept security threats at bay. Our crime rate has fallen for
the sixth consecutive year, with 2011 being the lowest in 20 years.
The 2011 Quality of Living Survey by Mercer ranked Singapore as
the safest city in Asia and among the top 10 safest cities in the
world. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-438d5b20-a926-4349-85cf-b5c97d4c8fc3">
                  <a name="budget__id-438d5b20-a926-4349-85cf-b5c97d4c8fc3"><!--a--></a>A safe and secure environment
is essential for our social well-being and is fundamental for economic
growth. A better educated population and a growing economy have
created more opportunities for the next generation of Singaporeans, lowering
the propensity for crime and criminality. This is a virtuous circle
which we should strive hard to maintain.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-66f99690-99af-451a-8718-b1646651fa56">
                  <a name="budget__id-66f99690-99af-451a-8718-b1646651fa56"><!--a--></a>But there is no room for
complacency. Our safety and security landscape is likely to change
over the medium to long term. I will outline three key areas which
we need to deal with to keep Singapore safe and secure. These issues
reflect underlying themes in the questions raised by Members, such
as Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Alvin Yeo. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-28ee3118-0e39-4398-a0f3-7135077c494b">
                  <a name="budget__id-28ee3118-0e39-4398-a0f3-7135077c494b"><!--a--></a>First, terrorism, which
continues to be a prime concern. Globally, the terrorism landscape
is becoming more fragmented. Since 9-11, Al-Qaeda has been weakened, with
the elimination of key figures, such as Osama bin Laden in Pakistan
and Anwar Al-Awlaki in Yemen. But the Al-Qaeda franchise remains
visible and potent, and its ideology remains alive. We have seen
attacks by Al-Qaeda affiliate organisations as well as self-radicalised
lone wolves. The methods and means of terrorism can be married with
any deviant violent ideology. In July 2011, the Norwegian lone wolf
attacker, Anders Brevik, single-handedly killed 77 people and injured
many other young people in one day of bombings and shooting, demonstrating
how much damage can be caused by one person, and how difficult such
attacks are to detect and stop. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-51ca27c7-d8cb-4ce3-97bc-cf2e90e982ea">
                  <a name="budget__id-51ca27c7-d8cb-4ce3-97bc-cf2e90e982ea"><!--a--></a>In our region, counter-terrorism
efforts have disrupted the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network, but the
terrorist threat has taken on new guises. JI remnants and other
terrorist organisations continue to be active. In February 2010,
a jihadist training camp in Aceh was discovered. Last year, there
were multiple attacks against mosques and churches in Indonesia.
On 14 February this year, just one day after coordinated bomb attacks
in New Delhi and Tbilisi, there was a failed terror plot in Bangkok
where several bombs exploded prematurely causing five casualties.
This followed the earlier arrest in Bangkok on 13 January of a Hezbollah
suspect linked to a cache of over 4,300 kilograms of urea and 38
litres of liquid ammonium nitrate. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-47f20e69-29a3-447f-badf-b05fe4d46578">
                  <a name="budget__id-47f20e69-29a3-447f-badf-b05fe4d46578"><!--a--></a>We thus need to remain on our guard, continue
to secure our borders, harden our infrastructure and maintain a
swift and effective capability to respond to security threats. Intelligence
coordination and cooperation are also critical, and have allowed
us to arrest three Singaporean JI fugitives in recent months, who
had evaded capture since 2001. We also partner the community and
religious leaders to counter extremist ideologies, a topic that
Dr Janil Puthucheary asked about. For example, the Religious Rehabilitation Group,
a voluntary group formed by Muslim religious scholars, helps to
rehabilitate terrorist detainees, and advise the Muslim community
on the falsehoods of jihadist ideology. These measures, together
with the Internal Security Act that allows us to take decisive action
early to neutralise threats and pre-empt attacks, are part of our
holistic approach to preventing and countering the threat of terrorism.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-3932bec4-8d6f-45a4-a5d9-2631708fb9e7"><!--a--></a>Non-traditional security
issues have also come to the fore. Last year, the earthquake and
tsunami in Japan, followed by the Fukushima nuclear power plant
incident, highlighted the importance of good crisis management,
strong social resilience and self-help. At home, the SMRT breakdowns
in December last year also highlighted the need for contingency
plans to be regularly updated and tested – something which Mr Hri Kumar
commented on just now. I agree with Mr Hri Kumar that the Government
must provide an overarching framework for emergency preparedness
and response at the national level. But it is critical that facility
owners and operators be responsible for first-line response capability
within their respective domains and premises, to prevent incidents,
and mitigate and minimise consequences until national emergency responders
arrive. The Government will assist them through the setting of standards, conducting
training, and inter-agency exercises to test and refine coordination procedures
and plans. More stringent requirements, including regular audits
and reviews, are in place for higher-risk premises. There are also
well-established mechanisms, such as the Safety and Security Watch
Groups, through which private sector entities frequently engage
with Government agencies, such as the Singapore Police Force (SPF)
and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). During Exercise Northstar VIII
held last November, I had the opportunity to see first-hand more
than 1,200 personnel from 18 Government agencies and 27 companies
coming together to prepare themselves against multiple incidents
taking place in the maritime domain and on Jurong Island. Those
who participated are now better prepared should an incident occur.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d0e753b7-1920-45fc-95ca-0f11221b90b6">
                  <a name="budget__id-d0e753b7-1920-45fc-95ca-0f11221b90b6"><!--a--></a>Ultimately, our home-front
security must be a collective effort of the Government, private
and people sectors. We must all work closely together so that we
can deter, prevent, respond and recover from terrorism and other
threats to our homeland and our society.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e4f76b54-01c8-41b4-8659-de6384f012a8">
                  <a name="budget__id-e4f76b54-01c8-41b4-8659-de6384f012a8"><!--a--></a>Second, transnational
crime. Improvements in transport and communications have made it
easier for people, goods and funds to move across borders. Unlicensed
money-lending and drug trafficking syndicates in Singapore no longer
operate solely within our jurisdiction. The kingpins are located
abroad, making detection and arrest more difficult. Cyberspace provides
a fertile ground for criminal activities, such as illegal drug transactions
and money laundering. While crime reported in both casinos comprised less
than 1% of overall crime for 2010 and 2011, the risk of criminal
infiltration and organised crime groups remains, and we must not
let our guard down in striving to stamp out crime in our casinos. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3e3cff27-2076-4c4b-8a6a-ed73e26a0e38">
                  <a name="budget__id-3e3cff27-2076-4c4b-8a6a-ed73e26a0e38"><!--a--></a>Technological advancements have also changed
the complexion of crimes. While the incidence of "traditional crimes"
like house-breaking and theft has gone down, commercial crime has
been on an upward trend since 2009. More people are also falling prey
to Internet scams. Criminals are quick to exploit technological
advances to come up with innovative ploys, ranging from "kidnap"
and "lottery" phone scams to "Internet love" scams. The total amount
cheated from such scams nearly doubled from $4.7 million in 2010
to $9 million in 2011. We will need to intensify efforts to raise
public awareness and help people protect themselves from the next
cheating scam.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-98ec4ea2-0f86-40a7-9421-b9d2103b15b4">
                  <a name="budget__id-98ec4ea2-0f86-40a7-9421-b9d2103b15b4"><!--a--></a>The recent ATM skimming
case is another good example. The foreign syndicate was able to
skim card information from local ATMs to make unauthorised transactions overseas.
Our enforcement agencies were able to respond swiftly and arrest
several suspects in less than two weeks. But these crimes can quickly
evolve, and there was a second stream of illegal withdrawals recently.
This is a timely reminder that our Home Team agencies need to keep
up-to-date with technology, while working with the industry to ensure
that the industry's systems remain robust. </p>

national borders and, indeed, will exploit them. Hence, we must
work closely with other countries. The Police and Central Narcotics
Bureau work closely with their counterparts in neighbouring countries
and beyond, to exchange information about crimes and criminals,
and mount joint operations. At the regional level, Singapore participates
actively in various ASEAN meetings to coordinate efforts against
cross-border crime and carry out joint training to share best practices
with our ASEAN partners. </p>

is INTERPOL's new Global Complex for Innovation which will open
in Singapore in 2014. It will carry out innovative research and development
and build new capabilities, such as data forensics. Law enforcement agencies
around the world can obtain real-time access to criminal data, and
work more closely together when fighting new types of crime, including
cybercrime. Our law enforcement and security agencies and those
in the region will be able to readily tap on INTERPOL's cutting-edge
technologies and practices right here in Singapore.</p>

of our society. Our society has become more diverse in its demographic
profile and social attitudes. We have young couples who may have spent
a number of years abroad, who value privacy and personal space,
and they may live next door to retired couples who like a more communal
living environment. And next door to them, could be recent immigrants,
who may not have fully adapted to Singaporean social norms. Compact
living in a dense, urban environment has brought on new stresses
and strains, and incidents of friction within the community. There
is a greater tendency to call on the authorities to deal with what
are essentially disagreements between neighbours about what constitutes
good neighbourly behaviour – such as noise, cooking smells, pets,
and so on.</p>

also feel that they should be allowed to express their views in
an unfettered way. On the other hand, when remarks or acts denigrate another
culture, nationality or religion, members of the public and those
groups who are the target want action to be taken against the perpetrators.
We should also not go beyond the bounds of decency or promote or
create public disorder.</p>

Hri Kumar asked whether existing laws are adequate to protect Singaporeans
against such inappropriate or wrongful Internet behaviour. While the
Penal Code covers offences, such as criminal intimidation in both
the physical world and cyberspace, there are currently no specific
laws protecting persons from cyber-harassment, bullying and other
anti-social acts on the Internet. My Ministry is working with the
Ministry of Law and the Ministry of Information, Communications
and the Arts to review this, and will consider the laws needed to
address such situations. The United Kingdom, Australia, India and
all the states in the US already have laws to protect persons from
cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking or cyber-harassment. </p>

we will also consider enhancing civil remedies for those affected
by wrongdoings which are not criminal in nature. For example, an
aggrieved party should be able to protect himself from falsehoods
spread on the Net when suing for defamation and obtain a timely
injunction to order the removal of any offensive statements on the
Internet, given its viral nature. </p>

profile and values in our society, we are also observing that social
attitudes are evolving. For example, some young people today may
have the mistaken view that recreational use of drugs is not harmful
but is simply a lifestyle choice, and that they can avoid somehow
becoming addicted. When coupled with the resurgence of drug supply
in the region, should such an attitude become prevalent, it will
make our fight to keep Singapore drug-free more difficult. We have
thus set up a task force on drugs led by Minister of State Masagos
who will speak more about the issue of drugs later in this debate.</p>

is the elderly who may be more prone to certain crimes, such as
snatch thefts or cheating. Some will also need clear space along
the common corridors for wheelchairs and stretchers, and not just
for daily movement, but also for fire evacuation or for an emergency
ambulance crew to rush a critically ill person to hospital. Not
only do we need lift upgrading to make our HDB blocks barrier-free,
but we also need uncluttered corridors so that these do not become
an impediment instead.</p>

also cause us to rethink the way we look at domestic safety and
security concerns. One way of dealing with crime is to build fences
and walls around our precincts and blocks, cordon off HDB void decks
and create gated neighbourhoods. But doing so does not only keep
undesirable people out but will also lock ourselves in and separate and segregate
communities. This will fundamentally change the way we organise
our communities and change our social fabric. We have been able
to enjoy our open style of community living where people mix easily
in our housing estates because we have strong communities which
work hand-in-hand with an effective police force who maintain safety,
security and trust in our neighbourhoods. This is something we should
value and retain.</p>

our community engagement model in tandem with the changing environment

we can build on - our society's strong support for law and order,
no tolerance for criminality, social resilience and a strong community
spirit. These foundations will allow us to strengthen our consensus
to keep our nation safe, secure and harmonious.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-f6a17ffd-4fa1-4cce-87c7-9bbc05d98039"><!--a--></a>The foregoing discussion
sets the stage and guides the Home Team's plans for the coming years.
To meet these new challenges, we must strengthen our capabilities
in four key areas: enhancing organisation and systems, investing
in our people, exploiting technology, and partnering the community.
I will elaborate on each in turn.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cff0acee-23f8-4034-a37d-e8e59ecdfea5">
                  <a name="budget__id-cff0acee-23f8-4034-a37d-e8e59ecdfea5"><!--a--></a>Let me start with organisation
and systems. To enhance our legislative and policy levers so that
we can investigate and enforce effectively, we will table an Organised Crime
Act by the end of this year, to enhance powers to deal with crime
syndicates. We want to send the strongest possible signal that we
will not allow organised crimes to take root in Singapore. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-762ce6a8-692a-43a8-8525-149f21985f97">
                  <a name="budget__id-762ce6a8-692a-43a8-8525-149f21985f97"><!--a--></a>We will also review the
Casino Control Act holistically to ensure our casinos remain free
from criminal influence while addressing concerns on the need for
social safeguards. The review is expected to be completed by the
latter half of this year. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e8e0c48f-7502-431e-b368-ab9bd483ff6d">
                  <a name="budget__id-e8e0c48f-7502-431e-b368-ab9bd483ff6d"><!--a--></a>The transnational nature
and increasing complexity of crime make preventing, detecting and
tackling crime more challenging. We will, therefore, strengthen
our capabilities and better integrate our systems, especially in
intelligence, research and forensic capabilities, across the Home
Team agencies. This will allow our officers to pool together information
and expertise across the different agencies. For example, we need to
examine financial flows, telecommunication records and the movement
of people across national borders to combat illegal cross-border
syndicates, including drug syndicates.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ec6bdf95-a229-40f6-a793-4c414f463dd6">
                  <a name="budget__id-ec6bdf95-a229-40f6-a793-4c414f463dd6"><!--a--></a>The changing demographic
profile, attitudes and community needs also require us to adjust
our policing strategy. Our frontline police officers play a vital
role in working with the local community to address the community
safety and security needs. In our revamped Community Policing System
(COPS) model, we will deploy additional officers on the ground to
engage the community more actively and tailor crime prevention and crime
fighting more closely to local needs. Second Minister Iswaran will
share more details on the COPS model with Members shortly.</p>

resourcing and structure in emerging areas of need. One area is
commercial crime. We will re-structure the Commercial Affairs Department
and resource it adequately so that they can tackle the growing sophistication
of commercial crimes and help to safeguard Singapore's reputation
as a world-class financial and commercial centre.</p>

incidents. Singapore is one of the busiest seaports in the world.
Our International Cruise Terminal will open later this year, and
our Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal by 2013. To meet these new demands,
Singapore Civil Defence Force will take over marine fire fighting
and rescue functions from the Maritime and Port Authority with effect
from 1 April this year and will beef up its assets and personnel.
This will create a unified command and control structure, allowing
SCDF to provide an integrated response for both land and sea emergencies
in fire-fighting and shipboard rescue. </p>

we raised starting salary levels for Diploma holders and introduced
a new Sign-On Bonus ranging from $8,000 to $10,000 for Diploma holders joining
the Home Team. Frontline police officers will get an allowance to
recognise the skills required for these challenging jobs, just as
other Home Team frontline officers currently receive. </p>

the Home Affairs Uniformed Service and ICA schemes, we will further
strengthen the link between pay and performance. With effect from
July this year, some 14,600 officers will move from a system of
fixed annual increments to merit increments based on their performance.
Our officers can also expect 10% to 15% increase in their monthly
pay then. </p>

is also redesigning its jobs and creating more senior officer posts
to meet our needs for better trained and able officers at the frontline.
This move will also allow good officers who have demonstrated capabilities
and leadership to advance into the senior officer cadre. Police
will move from the current proportion of one in six senior officer
posts to one in four senior officer posts by 2015. </p>

has also been expanding the range of educational sponsorship and
upgrading programmes available to serving officers, including working
with local polytechnics and universities to offer security-related
diploma and degree programmes. Over 110 degree sponsorships were
awarded in 2011 and we plan to increase this number this year, and
in future years. </p>

our officers have the right skills to tackle both traditional and
emerging challenges. The Home Team Academy aims to build a common
ethos and camaraderie among Home Team officers across the different
agencies. It runs milestone courses to bring together Home Team

operations training programmes to enhance inter-agency coordination
in incident management and response. </p>

argued passionately for improving the service conditions and pay
for security officers. Ms Sylvia Lim has also asked about service
conditions. We have been recruiting more officers in the Home Team
and will continue to do so to meet new operational demands, such
as COPS. The increase in manpower stated in this House refers to
regular officers and not National Servicemen. The salary and allowance increases
I have just announced will recognise the work of our officers better,
and also help with our recruitment and retention efforts. The current
leave clearance rate is healthy, with police officers consuming
a median of 19 days of vacation leave in 2011. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-008cfe93-8bb7-4348-abe6-636845e94ca4"><!--a--></a>There are 6,000 auxiliary
police officers; and 35,000 unarmed security officers, out of 60,000
licensed unarmed security officers. The private security industry
also plays an important role in complementing the work of our homefront
agencies. We have a framework for security screening which takes
into account various aspects in assessing suitability, including
a person's criminal records. Both the gravity of the previous offence and
the amount of time the person has remained clean are taken into
account. All Malaysian applicants must obtain a Certificate of Non-Criminal
Conviction. Overtime in the security industry has also been identified
as an issue by the unions, MOM and MHA. We are working with MOM,
the unions and the security companies to improve the working conditions
of security officers, which would at the same time increase the attractiveness
of this sector to Singaporeans.</p>

out, technology is an important enabler. MHA will invest more of
its budget every year in research and development and technology.
There is a natural limit to how many more Home Team officers we
can recruit. We must thus make better use of technology to help
our officers do their work more efficiently and effectively, cutting
down time-consuming low-value work, and using their skills and abilities
to the full. </p>

we can do to exploit the potential of cameras. The police will, therefore,

enable our officers to be more effective and serve the public better

is this strong partnership model which has enabled us to achieve

the prison service to provide rehabilitative services to inmates
and ex-offenders. Our Police Volunteer Special Constabulary officers work

am heartened to know that we have such a strong corps of good men
and women who put their lives at risk, and work tirelessly to fulfill
our shared vision of a safe and secure Singapore. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr
S Iswaran)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, let me first thank Members for the
various questions and suggestions they have raised, in particular
with respect to community policing, unlicensed moneylending, casino
regulation and other matters pertaining to crime. I will seek to
address them in turn, within the overall framework that has been
highlighted by the Deputy Prime Minister, which is to strengthen
our capabilities for a safe and secure future.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5fb9ae07-3532-4614-9b0e-428c5f51c443">

rate in Singapore remains low. It fell to 606 crimes per 100,000 of
population last year – a decrease of 7% from 2010. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6c62b749-2b5b-42b2-90b5-c670bf1827ce">
                  <a name="budget__id-6c62b749-2b5b-42b2-90b5-c670bf1827ce"><!--a--></a>But we do not take this
for granted. The safety and security we enjoy today has been built
on three key pillars – strong laws, stringent enforcement and community partnership.
We can ensure the continued safety of our homes and our communities
by investing in capabilities and efforts that strengthen these pillars. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3e81d725-ee4a-47fb-9b4f-dc43b3c29967">
                  <a name="budget__id-3e81d725-ee4a-47fb-9b4f-dc43b3c29967"><!--a--></a>One important example
of this effort is the new Community Policing System, or COPS for
short. We assume that this acronym will resonate with Members and
with members on the ground as well. Our frontline policing model
is one that has been with us for some time. Neighbourhood Police
Posts and Neighbourhood Police Centres have been a part of our community
landscape since the 1980s, and they have been the key components
of our policing strategy. Our model though, for frontline policing,
must evolve with demographic trends and changing needs in the community,
while harnessing technological developments. Our aim is to ensure
that our Police's ability is enhanced to prevent, deter and detect
crime, so that we are better positioned to deal with future challenges
to keeping our neighbourhoods safe. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-06c8fa63-c3c7-4b55-b9b3-0c09d739e1ba">

transition to the new COPS model this year. This transformation
will encompass systems, people, technology and partnerships. First,
we will reorganise our Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs) to enhance
their crime-fighting and community liaison capabilities. A Crime
Strike Force will be established at each Neighbourhood Police Centre.
Today, our crime-fighting capabilities largely reside at the six
Land Division Headquarters. The advent of the Crime Strike Force
will bring the Police's crime-fighting capabilities closer to the
community through its network of NPCs. Our officers will be better
able to develop greater familiarity with the local terrain which,
in turn, will enhance their effectiveness in fighting crime in the local
area. What you see is the uniform and the bicycles that they will
be using [<em class="ph i">hon Members were shown a slide</em>]. It is rather fetching. </p>

current Community Liaison and Preparedness Team at each NPC into
a full-fledged Community Policing Unit. This will enable our Police
Officers to broaden and deepen their involvement in community partnership
projects. Community Policing Officers will also be assigned to specific
needs, and will conduct foot and bicycle patrols. This will allow
them to cultivate a more extensive network of relationships with
community stakeholders. So, this will become an integral part of
the community as the Police enhance their efforts on the ground. </p>

about the roll-out plan. Bukit Merah East NPC and Tampines NPC will
be the first two to be reorganised in May this year. Six other NPCs will
follow suit in the later part of the year, and we target to complete
the reorganisation of all NPCs by the end of 2015, so over the space
of the next four to five years.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0ac3dc12-926e-4625-ad03-8634e57144a0">

West NPC and Punggol NPC will be operational later this year, which
will bring the total number of Neighbourhood Police Centres to 35 island-wide.
There will also be a new Police Land Division Headquarters in Woodlands, which
will commence operations in 2015. These new facilities will allow
the Police to better serve the expanding population in the northwest
and northeast of Singapore.</p>

If these organisational and system changes are to be effective, we
agree wholeheartedly with Mr Desmond Lee that we need people – in
the right numbers and of the right quality. The expectations are
greater of our officers, the needs on the ground are more diverse
and the tasks are much more complex.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6a51386e-ef9e-4791-97d4-4ef2178ae14b">
                  <a name="budget__id-6a51386e-ef9e-4791-97d4-4ef2178ae14b"><!--a--></a>Specifically, the Police
will recruit a total of 450 additional officers over the next few years
to support the roll-out of these additional capabilities in the
Neighbourhood Police Centres. This is an average of 13 more officers
per Neighbourhood Police Centre. And this increase will complement
any other redeployment that the Police will do in support of this
initiative. That should address the point that Ms Sylvia Lim has
raised in terms of how we would have additional resources. This
is the point raised by Mr Desmond Lee as well.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-12a54091-3b08-4c76-816d-5e4ce544c6cd">
                  <a name="budget__id-12a54091-3b08-4c76-816d-5e4ce544c6cd"><!--a--></a>We also need to ensure
that we can attract, train and retain more high-quality officers in
the Police Force. The Deputy Prime Minister has covered a wide range
of HR initiatives within the Home Team, including the introduction
of an allowance for frontline policing work. This new allowance
recognises officers who have attained the requisite proficiency
in a key set of frontline policing skills, such as conflict resolution,
community engagement
and partnership. NPC officers will be among the 2,600 Police Officers
who would be eligible for the $200 a month allowance. To give you
a sense of proportion, this is about 10% of the starting pay for
a Police Junior Officer.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-789977df-2dc2-4bd9-add6-dbd6698a92ae">
                  <a name="budget__id-789977df-2dc2-4bd9-add6-dbd6698a92ae"><!--a--></a>Technology can be an important
force multiplier that complements our efforts to attract more and
high quality Police Officers. We, therefore, aim to leverage more
on the latest technological developments, where they are feasible.
In particular, our experience has shown that police cameras can
effectively aid investigations and deter crime. Hence, we will work
with the Town Councils and HDB to install police cameras in all
10,000 HDB blocks and HDB multi-storey car parks by 2016. The police
cameras will be installed at key points of ingress and egress, such
as ground-floor lift lobbies and stairwells. While the cameras will
not be monitored live, the images that they record can be used to
help solve crime.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1677</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b6b94462-44f7-46b0-aa53-c0c4e5c253b4">

in May 2012 covering 300 HDB blocks and multi-storey car parks across
Singapore. The Police will proceed to install these cameras with
the explicit support of the Town Councils because they will be located
in areas which are under the management of the Town Councils. We
will also use technology to enhance the Neighbourhood Police Posts
(NPPs). It could facilitate round-the-clock automated services for
residents, while allowing the redeployment of Police Officers from
desk-bound duties to other tasks, such as patrols. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-73c128e7-28b0-418d-bca0-03c6872a2ca9">
                  <a name="budget__id-73c128e7-28b0-418d-bca0-03c6872a2ca9"><!--a--></a>Because the NPP is a concept
developed to serve the community, we are involving the community
in this redesign effort. For example, last week, Police conducted
a contest among tertiary students to design the NPP of the future.
Teams from the ITE, polytechnics, and the universities participated
quite actively. That is the team from the National Technological
University, which was one of the two winners [<em class="ph i">hon Members were
shown a slide</em>]. The best ideas from the winning designs and
other submissions will be incorporated in the redesign of the NPP.
The redesigned Neighbourhood Police Posts will be piloted at Radin
Mas and Marsiling in the second half of 2012. </p>

profiles of these areas, these pilots will allow the Police to evaluate
the feasibility of the design, and to seek feedback from residents.
This will help further refine the strategies before the full roll-out
to other NPPs in Singapore. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f7d8b5ad-593b-4dcd-8363-513dc037fa61">
                  <a name="budget__id-f7d8b5ad-593b-4dcd-8363-513dc037fa61"><!--a--></a>Mr Vikram Nair has asked
if the initiatives under COPS will also be helpful in addressing
complaints about nuisance and other non-seizable, non-arrestable
offences. Collectively, these new initiatives are aimed at enhancing
the NPC's ability to fight crime, in general, in the community.
Even with the additional resources, our Police Force will be lean.
Hence, Police's attention should remain focused on their core functions
– to fight crime and maintain public order. </p>

non-seizable offences, the Police will take action when there is
a material impact or harm to the public interest. If that is not
the case, then the Police will seek to endeavour to bring about
an amicable resolution between the parties concerned, or otherwise
help guide them to make the relevant reports to the magistrate and
allow the law to take its course from there.</p>

which many Members have spoken about. Community support and involvement
is invaluable to the work of the Police Force. And, together, we
are able to achieve a lot more, as has been demonstrated in the past.
A good example of this has been the "Delta Citizenry" which was
an initiative in Clementi. It was started in 2010, and it has recruited
a total of 590 members thus far, which is to help report suspicious
activity to the Police, in particular. With the help of these volunteers,
the Police have been able to reduce the number of five preventable crimes
− robbery, housebreaking, motor vehicle theft, snatch theft and
outrage of modesty − in the Clementi area by about 39% in 2011.
We thank the community leaders and volunteers there for their partnership
in helping to keep Clementi safe.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1678</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a58b0254-e649-4366-9fd0-87751e3db208">

positive examples like this. Today, there are 2,600 Neighbourhood
Watch Groups and 525 Citizens on Patrol groups across Singapore.
The new Community Policing Unit will continue to work closely with
these volunteers, and reach out to partner more residents in addressing
local safety and security concerns. </p>

Pei Ling has asked about how we can use social media to reach out
more, to mobilise residents. Police have, as Deputy Prime Minister
has mentioned, used Facebook and also Twitter, YouTube and iPhone
apps to better connect with the community. These channels are used
to regularly also push out crime prevention messages and to appeal
for information to assist in police investigations. The Police will explore
new means to engage the public, such as "live" e-Townhall meetings
with community partners and residents, as part of their strategy
going forward.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c1870e6b-bf14-4b92-af6a-f87de5cedfc3">

                  <a name="budget__id-fb897e82-62eb-4566-be36-91deb2f90613"><!--a--></a>Sir, let me now turn to
the issue of unlicensed moneylending (UML) which Mr Ang Wei Neng,
Mr Arthur Fong, Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Vikram Nair have spoken
on. Sir, as all Members who have spoken have observed, this is a
scourge, and it is a scourge that can cause deep distress to those
who are affected, not just the borrowers, but their families as
well. And certainly, there should be no let up in the activities
and actions that we take to deter such illegal activities.</p>

question, the number of unlicensed moneylending and related harassment
cases fell by 21% or 3,492 cases in 2011.The trend is there and
this has been the case for the last two years. During the same period,
the number of arrests for such activities rose by 31% to 1,981 arrests
in 2011. This is the second consecutive year that the number of
cases has fallen while the number of arrests has risen. Police also
cracked down on 10 UML syndicates last year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-23fb3be0-acfb-425e-85dc-f0a5107ddd53">
                  <a name="budget__id-23fb3be0-acfb-425e-85dc-f0a5107ddd53"><!--a--></a>The improvements that
we have observed can be attributed to three factors. First is the
increased penalties provided under the amended Moneylenders Act
2010, which has led to stiffer sentences being meted out by the
courts. Secondly, effective enforcement by Police officers on the
ground through operations and patrols as well as the deployment
of mobile camera sets where appropriate has had an important moderating effect.
Third, the close partnership with the community has provided Police
with valuable intelligence leading to the arrest and conviction
of a number of UML harassers. Last
year, 10% or 190 arrests for UML-related activities were made with
the assistance of the public.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8385fb03-51b8-49f9-8f80-92e300772926">

Police will continue with stringent enforcement and this will be
complemented by our efforts to grow capabilities in three areas
to better fight unlicensed moneylending. First is to increase the
number of mobile CCTV sets available for deployment in affected
areas. This is in addition to the police cameras being installed at
HDB blocks under the new COPS scheme. Second, Police will launch
a public education and awareness campaign to highlight the risks
associated with borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders and, ultimately,
to deter would-be borrowers. Police are also working closely with
partners, such as MCYS and the National Council on Problem Gambling,
on this effort. Third, we will work more closely with the community
to fight UML harassment. The enlarged Community Policing Unit in
our NPCs will allow Police officers to work more closely with community
partners on localised efforts against this problem.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1679</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-8b993deb-fb8d-4901-aac1-d6ab87b66db6"><!--a--></a>We will also be placing
greater emphasis on two areas of concern. First, there were 97 harassment
cases last year which involved arson, the use of fire, up from 38
cases in 2010. While the use of fire is still relatively uncommon,
less than 1% of all cases, we take a stern view of this harassment
tactic and will press for heavy deterrent sentences in such cases.
As an example, in July 2011, the Courts sentenced one such harasser
to seven years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3d31f859-771f-428f-b416-ebf50715691b">

that has been raised by Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Ang Wei Neng in particular,
more youths aged 19 years and under have been arrested for involvement
in unlicensed moneylending and harassment activities, with 336 arrests
in 2011.These youths formed 17% of the total UML-related arrests
last year, up from the average of 13% from 2007 to 2010. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6d065a56-3264-43a3-97a5-fcde1b25cc5a">
                  <a name="budget__id-6d065a56-3264-43a3-97a5-fcde1b25cc5a"><!--a--></a>In most cases, their involvement
was unwitting, such as the distribution of flyers without really
knowing what the content was about. But there were also instances
where they knowingly took part in unlicensed moneylending or harassment
activities. While it is a serious offence for adults to recruit
a young person to commit UML or harassment acts, equally, the youths
must also be held accountable for their actions if they knowingly
engage in crime. Therefore, where their actions are of sufficient
gravity, seriousness, Police will charge the youths in court. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-ac14141d-cadb-49f8-bbd8-40029a12d212"><!--a--></a>But we will also complement
this with greater emphasis on educating youths not to engage in
UML activities or to see this as a form of easy money. Minister

                  <a name="budget__id-cd1bf7ff-63ef-4f01-845f-ce647cfb883e"><!--a--></a>Sir, let me now talk about
the Casino Regulatory Framework. Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr
Vikram Nair raised questions pertaining to the casinos and the Integrated Resorts.
The Home Team agencies are mindful that casinos are potential targets,
if not attractive targets, for criminals and have been keeping a
close watch. The situation has been under control, with crime reported
in both casinos comprising less than 1% of overall crime for 2010
and 2011, the point that Deputy Prime Minister made.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f9e7a927-af4c-48a1-8411-cf466997d6d6">
                  <a name="budget__id-f9e7a927-af4c-48a1-8411-cf466997d6d6"><!--a--></a>There is some concern
that the advent of the casinos may have caused more gamblers to
turn to loan sharks. We cannot establish a clear causative link
between the casinos and the trend in UML cases. Indeed, if Members
look at the data earlier, it shows that the number of UML cases had fallen
since 2010, the year the casinos began operations. And that is because
there are multiple factors at play, not least of which are the economic
condition, Police enforcement actions, etc. So, it would be premature
for us to draw a definitive conclusion about the impact of the casinos
on unlicensed moneylending activities. Nevertheless, we take this
seriously and we will continue to keep a close watch and take action
if there are any signs of an emerging undesirable trend or causative
link.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-ffb86450-1e81-418d-83c2-eb3181ffdbf1"><!--a--></a>We share Mr de Souza's
concern on proxy gambling. The casino operators are working closely
with Government agencies and are taking proactive steps to identify patrons
who could be proxy gamblers. The particulars of these possible proxy
gamblers will be reported to the authorities. The Government will
take decisive action against any errant employers found engaging
in such illegal deployment of foreign workers for the purposes of
proxy gambling. And there are many avenues through which such action can
be taken. </p>

be reviewing the Casino Control Act. Our agencies have gained much
experience over the last two years in regulating the casinos and
managing their presence in Singapore. In addition, given the dynamic
nature of the industry, it is imperative that we plan ahead in anticipation
of new challenges. </p>

will be undertaken in consultation with the relevant stakeholders,
will fall into four main areas:</p>

law enforcement and investigation levers to continue to keep crime
out of the casinos. </p>

gaming regulation and operational requirements, to give the Casino
Regulatory Authority (CRA) a more calibrated range of levers in
regulating the casinos and their activities.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bd0d333a-d5da-416e-af41-06b876053dc7">
                  <a name="budget__id-bd0d333a-d5da-416e-af41-06b876053dc7"><!--a--></a>Third, we are working
with MCYS to strengthen social safeguards to continue to protect
vulnerable groups from the potential harm of casino gambling. It
is a topic that has been in the media, and also MCYS has spoken
at length about it</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c8b64467-4413-4b3e-8e3b-50ef84d4331a">

clarify the Casino Control Act to ensure that there is a process that
will ensure that the non-gaming attractions, which the Integrated
Resort operators have committed to, continue to be of international
standards.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5a5c94e7-1fc0-420b-bbdd-49e3d8975d4e">

amendments to the Casino Control Act aim to ensure that the casinos
remain a net benefit in the longer term for Singapore and Singaporeans.
To this end, we will also deepen the CRA's capability and expertise
to regulate the casinos and fight casino crime.</p>

the issue of trafficking in persons. He has observed that the Government
has set up an Inter-agency Taskforce on Trafficking in Persons (TIP). </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-a0dec2a5-8b6a-4dd5-849f-15807bdef907"><!--a--></a>We have also sought public
feedback, starting about three weeks ago, on our National Plan of
Action. In particular, the plan of action covers prevention, prosecution of
perpetrators, protection of victims, partnerships, and enablers
to enhance Singapore's capabilities to fight trafficking in persons.
We want to thank all who have contributed
their ideas, and we will be incorporating some of this feedback
into the National Plan of Action before it is launched later this
year.</p>

about the review of trafficking and related offences in legislation.
We will review existing laws to ensure that Singapore's legislation adequately
addresses the complexity of TIP crimes and that penalties are commensurate
with the gravity of the crimes committed. This is an on-going process and
more details will be revealed in due course.</p>

Prime Minister Teo spoke about the introduction of the Organised
Crime Act later this year. This Act will complement our review of
TIP legislation to ensure that both enforcement powers and penalties
are adequate to deter and punish trafficking syndicates.</p>

we have close working relationships with our regional counterparts.
There is also active dialogue and cooperation at various ASEAN regional platforms
which cover both TIP and the broader scope of organised crime. </p>

about victim care and what we are doing. Today, MCYS works with
NGOs to provide shelters for victims and potential victims. As part
of the process going forward, we will review the adequacy of these
facilities and we will also take reference from international best
practices. But as these are early days yet in the process, it would
be premature for me to comment on specifics, but it will again be
a part of the process going forward.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-07d1d6a7-5410-495e-a6c1-dfaa7c77d7ff">

to Assoc Prof Dr Fatimah Lateef's question about the Police's efforts
in tackling some of the more unique challenges in Geylang. Firstly,
Police has set up a dedicated taskforce in 2009 to conduct daily
enforcement operations in Geylang against soliciting. Apart from
enforcement actions, there are several other measures in place.
For example, Police have imposed strict licensing conditions for
entertainment outlets and other establishments.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-374e5287-a9ce-4122-b479-dba931e6d9fa">
                  <a name="budget__id-374e5287-a9ce-4122-b479-dba931e6d9fa"><!--a--></a>In addition, the Ministry
of Home Affairs and Police have been working closely with other
agencies, such as the Hotel Licensing Board and URA, to take action
against errant hotel owners who allow vice-related activities to
occur in their premises.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7ea0f580-9fd5-45b4-87ca-fa19eef1cf6a">
                  <a name="budget__id-7ea0f580-9fd5-45b4-87ca-fa19eef1cf6a"><!--a--></a> Police officers have
also accompanied other enforcement officers, such as NEA, URA, LTA
and Customs, during their inspections for statutory violations to
help address the disamenities caused by the crowds. This is part
of the multi-agency effort that Assoc Prof Fatimah was referring
to. So, we want to assure Assoc Prof Fatimah that the Police will
work closely with her and the other relevant stakeholders to address
any other areas of concern that she has as part of the efforts to
maintain law and order in Geylang. </p>

by saying that I have outlined some of the key initiatives we are
undertaking within the Home Team to strengthen our capabilities

done so by being vigilant and looking out for their neighbours,
taking efforts to protect their own property and also living harmoniously
with their neighbours or helping one another in an emergency. The strongest
capability we can build in the long run is a resilient and united
community, and we
hope that all members of the community will join the Home Team as

Sir, I was heartened by the Deputy Prime Minister's announcement
earlier today about the Long-Term Visit Pass Plus scheme, but it
is not clear what impact it will have on one particular group which
I am concerned about, and that is Singaporeans with past criminal
records who have foreign spouses. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1682</p>

Minister if there is a specific policy that Singaporeans with criminal
records would automatically have their applications for Long-Term
Visit Passes for their spouses rejected. If rejection is not automatic
based on past records but subject to ICA's discretion, then what
are the factors that ICA takes into account in exercising that discretion?</p>

from my MPS cases, that some Singaporeans with past criminal records
have had difficulty in getting Long-Term Social Visit Passes for
their foreign spouses. The applicants tend to be male, in their
30s or 40s. Typically, they do not have high educational levels.
This cut is actually prompted by three cases in MPS in respect of
which I have been sending repeated appeals to MHA. One of them is
a Chinese man. At first glance, when you look at him, you will know
that he was once a "<em class="ph i">pai kia</em>". He is covered from head to
toe in colourful tattoos; even his head is tattooed. But his record
has been clean for many years. He has turned over a new leaf. He
has found a stable job and is trying to make a new life for himself
with his wife from China. He has been applying for a Long-Term Social
Visit Pass for her but has been consistently rejected. Another is
also a Chinese man. He works for a VWO in the social service sector. He
has a very elderly mother whom he looks after. He has a Vietnamese
wife, and he, too, has had his applications rejected. The third
one is an Indian man. His wife is from India. He works as a cook.
He also has had his applications for a Long-Term Social Visit Pass
rejected.</p>

records were several years ago and they have kept clean records
since. They have all obtained jobs. They may not be very well off,
but they appear to be able to support themselves and their wives.
Denying them Long-Term Social Visit Passes denies them the chance
for personal happiness and to start families of their own. Having
to send their wives back to their home countries every few months not
only adds to their expenses, but also puts them under stress and
anxiety. Rejecting their applications is really contrary to the
Yellow Ribbon Movement. Not only that, the thing is that having
their spouses here in Singapore actually helps to stabilise them
and gives them a new purpose and direction in life. </p>

Social Visit Passes should not be given indiscriminately and care
should be exercised when there is a criminal record. But if they
are genuine cases, I ask that they be examined on their merits and
also that MHA and ICA will be more flexible in granting Long-Term
Social Visit Passes to spouses of Singaporeans with past criminal
records. </p>

youths have seen a decline in 2011. This perhaps reflects the good
work that the agencies have done to prevent, deter and rehabilitate
youths from crime. Yet every youth engaged in crime is still one youth
too many. Gangs and drugs continue to be an issue and we should
not let our guards down, especially with regards to recalcitrant
youths who engage in serious crime and/or re-offend. </p>

for the tragedy at Downtown East is a case in point. I further quote
Minister of State Masagos who said recently that allowing youth
gangs to flourish will turn members from occasional social misfits
into those who are associated with organised crime. In this light,
what tougher measures would the Ministry be considering to deal
with gangs, drugs and youth crime as well as to rehabilitate youths
who have committed offences? Would the Police consider a specialised
Youth Offenders Unit? Crime, especially amongst youths, is both
an economic as well as a lamentable social loss.</p>

Minister for Education and Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi)</strong>
                  </span>:
Sir, crimes involving young persons will direct the nation's attention
to the presence of youth crime. But youth crime is not a new phenomenon.
Last year's sensation was the death of a young teenager as a result
of a youth gang attack at Downtown East, as mentioned by the Member,
Mr Alex Yam. Prior to this, every now and then, news would report
of youth involvement in secret societies. But unlike secret societies
of the old, apparently, the young secret society members do not
conform to a code of conduct. So their behaviour may be very difficult
to fathom. Young people's involvement in secret societies manifests
itself in many forms. They range from the mere participation in
gang activities to bullying, to recruiting new members in schools
and, as we heard earlier from the Minister of State, about their involvement
in unlicensed money-lending activities.</p>

this anti-social behaviour to manifest and grow. While the number
of crime involving youths has fallen to less than 2,000 cases last
year from 2,200 in 2010, the type of crime involving persons as
young as 14 years old is a cause for worry. The Ministry announced

Chairman, in recent years, there has been a spate of youth crimes,
from gang fights in Downtown East and Bukit Panjang to the involvement of
youths in loan shark syndicates and, most recently, Internet-based
extortion. The Police, schools and community partners have been
working closely together to address these and implement intervention
strategies. New measures have also been introduced to enhance powers
of the Police and the Courts to counter youth gang formation, recruitment
and congregation as well as impose restriction orders or even curfews
on recalcitrant youth offenders. However, it has been an uphill
task and youth crimes continue to be committed. </p>

that there were more than 3,200 arrests related to drug abuse by
the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) in 2011, followed by a report
about a 48-hour drug raid by the CNB in the heartlands of Singapore
which resulted in 89 arrests in mid-February this year, have raised
concerns about the seemingly increased incidence of drug abuse in
Singapore, especially among youths. It was found that there were
225 new drug abusers who are below the age of 20 years old in 2011,
up from 155 such abusers arrested in 2010. This is a 45% increase
in just one year. Although the absolute numbers are still relatively
small, I feel that just one new youth drug abuser is one too many.
Having increasingly more youth drug abusers is a reflection of the
lack of awareness among our young towards the dangers of drug use
and abuse, and possibly, insufficient initiatives on our part to
tackle this. Can the Minister update the House on the current drug
situation among youths and what are the plans to address this?</p>

share Dr Intan's concern over the drug abuse situation in Singapore.
Drugs and substance abuse remains a problem in Singapore, in spite
of the many efforts at controlling and curbing it. Drug abuse ruins
families and lives. In the Central Narcotics Bureau's most recent
annual report just last year, some worrying trends are showing up.
The number of arrested abusers in our prison remains more than 6,000
and, I understand, is climbing. The worrisome attitude of young
people towards the abuse of what is considered as "soft" drugs,
such as "ice", has been on the rise over the past 14 years. The
CNB reported an increase of more than 45% of youths below the age
of 20 arrested for the consumption of "ice". </p>

trend of drug abuse in Singapore, going forward, what does MHA plan
to do to prevent the situation, especially among the young, from worsening?
What rehabilitation programmes are there to prevent recidivism among these
young persons as well as the older drug abusers from turning chronic?
I would also like to know whether the older and hard-core drug addicts
released from detentions have any influence over younger people
who may be attracted to such addicts.</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, drug abuse destroys lives and families. In CNB's 2011 Drug
Situation Report, there is a chart that shows the number of drug
abusers arrested in Singapore falling from 1994 to 2005, but then
rising steadily thereafter. A number of arrests in large raids also
took place this year, as mentioned by Dr Intan earlier. All this
is set against the backdrop of a very serious global drug problem.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c4848097-bf31-45bd-b6f0-b98cf602dcb3">

to Singapore's no-nonsense zero-tolerance approach to drug trafficking
and consumption, many countries, particularly in the west, have
medicalised the
problem and moved away from trying too hard to curb demand and supply.
These countries treat drug addiction as a disease, and their main
strategy is to employ public health harm reduction strategies to
tackle or minimise side effects associated with drug use, such as
crime, drug overdose and infectious disease transmission. Some strategies include: </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-08c1f32e-b8c9-4720-9860-67b2c794fb9c">

exchange programmes in the US, for instance, where clean hypodermic
needles are given to drug addicts to reduce HIV and hepatitis transmission. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1685</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-6e5dec1f-37bc-42a7-bb49-aaa83353e5ec"><!--a--></a>(b) Supervised and injection
facilities are another, such as those in Europe, Canada and Australia,
which allow drug addicts to inject to consume drugs in a hygienic environment
with access to medical support and counselling. By drawing addicts
to such centres, they also aim to minimise public nuisance. </p>

established in a number of European countries, such as Switzerland,
where addicts are clinically prescribed drug replacements, such
as methadone or buprenorphine hydrochloride or even heroin to maintain
their addiction but to try to reduce incidence of crime.</p>

there is a strict cap of 70 years. I recently met a 69-year-old
gentleman who has been a driving instructor almost all his life.
He is fit and healthy and does not look his age at all. He asked
why he and his elderly colleagues must be forced into retirement
as they are still perfectly fit and healthy. I would, therefore,
like to ask MHA to consider lifting this altogether or at least raising
the age cap, so long as driving instructors pass medical and other
proficiency tests. This will be consistent with the objective of
encouraging our seniors to remain actively engaged in the workforce.</p>

MHA review the effectiveness of the enhanced school zone on road
safety around our schools? The current flat red paint on the road
did not and will not deter cars from speeding around school zones.
The speed limit for these zones is not prominently displayed. Many
drivers are not aware or are ignorant of the enhanced school zone
rules. Enforcement of road safety rules in the school zone is also severely
lacking. The current penalty for traffic offences around school
zones perhaps should also be
reviewed, just like many other countries where traffic offence penalties are
doubled around school zones.</p>

(Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman, Sir, I
will now touch on the issues raised by Members on traffic, youth offending,
and drug abuse. We share Dr Lim Wee Kiak's concern about road safety around
schools. From 2007 to 2011, the number of accidents in which there
was a fatality or injury in school zones was 171 out of about 40,000
reported accidents island-wide. There were no fatal accidents of
children below 12 in school zones over the same period, until the
accident in January this year, which resulted in the death of a
10-year-old student outside his school. However, any accident is
one accident too many, especially in a school zone. We sympathise
with the bereaving family. As Traffic Police's investigations are
currently ongoing, we are unable to comment on this specific case. The
findings will be made known in due course. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d883f6b5-e450-4395-906c-87b3c1cd2585">
                  <a name="budget__id-d883f6b5-e450-4395-906c-87b3c1cd2585"><!--a--></a>Having said that, we take
road safety issues seriously, more so for our young road users.
Errant road users who behave without due regard for the safety of
others will be firmly dealt with. Currently, there are options to
impose stiff punishment if circumstances warrant it. We will consider
Dr Lim's suggestion to have enhanced and mandatory penalties imposed
against errant driving and riding conduct within school zones. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b10ba982-9d0c-48c3-82f0-9c1820b543dc">

is not sufficient. All of us road users must play our part by respecting
traffic rules, and exercising due consideration for others who share
the roads. Drivers should slow down when approaching a school zone
and keep a lookout for young children using our crossings. Parents
should also help promote road safety among their children – making
sure that children alight from vehicles in a safe manner, and educating
them to be especially attentive when using the roads.</p>

my Ministry could consider raising the age limit for driving instructors
aged 70 and above. Driving instructors are serving in a demanding
vocation. They need to be physically fit and mentally alert to protect
the safety of road users as well as their trainees. We recognise
that some driving instructors aged 70 and above may be able to discharge
their responsibilities competently. Traffic Police will review the age
limit of driving instructors. Our main consideration will be to
ensure that overall road safety is not compromised. </p>

Between 2007 and 2010, the number of youth arrests remained stable at

2011. The most common crimes committed were shop theft or about
28%, and rioting or about 12%. Specifically, the number of youths
arrested for rioting, which can broadly be used as a proxy of youth gang violence, also
decreased from 531 arrests in 2010 to 399 in 2011. Overall, 84%

concerned with specific incidents of youth-related violence in the
last two years. Although these cases alone do not suggest that our
youth crime situation or youth gang situation is worsening, it is
important that we send a strong message that brazen acts of violence
and intimidation will not be condoned. Police will not hesitate
to take offenders to task, and prevent young people from getting deeper
into a life of crime.</p>

Gangs (WGYG) was formed in December 2010. Based on its recommendations,
I announced a slew of measures in November last year, covering greater
investment in diversion and rehabilitation, increased co-ordination amongst
stakeholder agencies, and enhanced anti-gang legislation to disrupt
youth gangs. As we tackle issues around youth gangs, there are other
evolving youth-related issues that we face. For example, Second
Minister Iswaran had spoken about the increasing number of youths
arrested for offences related to unlicensed moneylending (UML) and
I will touch on it later. We are also beginning to see an increasing
number of young drug abusers arrested.</p>

in place effective structures to tackle youth crime, Police has established
the Youth Offenders Unit, effective 1 March 2012. The Youth Offenders
Unit will coordinate and drive youth crime-related policies and
programmes with partner agencies, and monitor trends on youth offending.
The Unit will also oversee public education and outreach efforts
to youth. The new Unit will enable Police to pull together holistically
its strategies, policies and programmes on youth offending and youth
crime.</p>

arrested are sent for appropriate intervention programmes. These
range from pre-court diversionary programmes such as the Guidance Programme,
to Court-ordered options such as probation and residential rehabilitation
in the Juvenile Homes, to sentencing at the Reformative Training
Centre (RTC), and ultimately also Prisons. </p>

youth offenders are placed on programmes, including certified skills
training courses and psychological intervention programmes, to address their
anti-social thinking and attitudes towards violence. In addition,
their families are involved in the rehabilitation process as we
believe that strong family support is integral to their eventual
reintegration back to the community.</p>

Group on Youth Gangs believes that more can be done. About one in
three youth offenders re-offend within two years of release from
the RTC and Prisons. Youth offenders often present multiple risk
factors, such as violence and anti-social thinking, which contribute
to criminal behaviour. To address this, Prisons will be developing
Specialised Treatment Programme (STP) modules to more effectively address
these risk factors. Prisons will also continue to monitor the effectiveness
of their psychological treatment programmes to ensure that they
adhere to international standards, and share these with other correctional
institutions.</p>

to youth offending reflects the complexity of this problem, which
cannot be resolved through structures and systems alone. Underpinning all these
efforts is the recognition that families too play an important role in
the life of our youths, and in the transmission of sound values
to the next generation.</p>

as a community, all play a role, too. During my work in the WGYG,
I met ex-gang members who had made the decision to turn their lives
around, and there was one particularly memorable case. Mr Royston
Khoo had joined a gang when he was only 13 years old. After being
involved in various gang fights, he was eventually arrested at age
16, and was referred to the Streetwise Programme (SWP). During the
programme, he went through counselling, group work sessions and community
service. For Royston, the programme made him grow closer to his
family and he began to realise how much hurt he had caused others.
The desire to lead a more meaningful life led him to start volunteering
at his SWP agency, Youth Guidance Outreach Services, at the age
of 18. I am happy to say that he is now a full-time social worker
there, successfully giving back to society. This shows how critical
community support is in helping youth-at-risk reintegrate into society. </p>

youth crime, we also share Mr Hawazi Daipi and Dr Intan Azura's
concerns about drug abuse among youths. Before going into the details,
let me begin with the broader drug situation. Firstly, the global
and regional trends. Drug use continues to be a serious global problem.
On the supply side, drug traffickers and organised criminals form
a complex web of transnational networks, fuelling a global criminal
enterprise and escalating demand for drugs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9e734d47-0035-4f04-81f4-853795ac4422">
                  <a name="budget__id-9e734d47-0035-4f04-81f4-853795ac4422"><!--a--></a>Closer to home, Southeast
Asia has seen soaring production, trafficking and consumption of
amphetamine-type stimulants, such as Ice and Ecstasy, and a resurgence
in opium cultivation and heroin trafficking. In fact, from 2010
to 2011, seizures of heroin and methamphetamine or "Ice" by the
Central Narcotics Bureau increased by 48% and 151% respectively. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-305f5de4-7612-466f-9a3e-dedad42ee8c7">
                  <a name="budget__id-305f5de4-7612-466f-9a3e-dedad42ee8c7"><!--a--></a>Secondly, domestic trends.
Such developments pose a serious threat to our stability and security.
The drug abuse situation is an area of concern. Drug abusers arrested
is on a rising trend, increasing from 2,537 abusers arrested in
2008 to 3,265 abusers arrested last year. Malays and Chinese made
up the majority of those arrested last year, at 48% and 33% respectively.
Of the arrests in 2011, repeat abusers made up two-thirds of those arrested
and new abusers the remaining one-third. While the numbers are much
lower compared to the peak of the drug problem in the 1970s, we
should not be complacent, and instead take decisive action before
the situation worsens.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d752ab67-6cb2-44b5-b639-bbd37763348c">
                  <a name="budget__id-d752ab67-6cb2-44b5-b639-bbd37763348c"><!--a--></a>Looking ahead, we are
particularly concerned about the large number of about 3,000 repeat
abusers expected to be released from Long-Term Imprisonment (LT)
from 2012 to 2014. LT abusers are often more likely to relapse into
drug abuse. Based on the 2009 cohort, the two-year relapse rate
of LT abusers was 36%, compared to 24% for the overall cohort. </p>

only harms them, and as Mr Hawazi inferred, inflicts pain on others
as well. To feed this expensive habit, many repeat drug abusers
turn to crime, including drug trafficking. Indeed, 79% of those
in prison have a drug antecedent, and more than 95% of those in
long-term imprisonment for drug consumption have some form of criminal
antecedents. Thus, the large number of releases over the next few
years could result in more arrests in the future as well. To address
this, we have allocated additional
manpower to CNB and the Prison Service to step up supervision and
aftercare of those being released from long-term imprisonment.</p>

Mr Hawazi's concern that repeat abusers pose the danger of contaminating
others within society. Given repeat drug abusers' close networks
with drug suppliers and other drug abusers in Singapore, they can
easily influence others, especially young and vulnerable persons,
to experiment with drugs.</p>

modified reporting arrangements for all young drug and inhalant
supervisees. Previously, all supervisees, regardless of age, reported
at the Police Land Division closest to their homes. As of 1 January
2012, CNB's Supervision Division at the Police Cantonment Complex
has been converted to a dedicated Young Persons Reporting Centre,
with all supervisees aged 21 years and below reporting there. With
this change, we aim to reduce opportunities for young supervisees
to be influenced by older and more experienced drug abusers, and
by each other.</p>

number of youths below 20 years of age, arrested for drug abuse,
has shown a steady upward trend in the past five years, increasing
from 79 in 2007 to 257 in 2011, as noted by Dr Intan. About 30%
of these youths were students. Many first-time youth abusers use
drugs to cope with problems, or take drugs "for fun". </p>

the changing attitudes amongst the young, and the perception that
taking "party drugs" is an acceptable lifestyle. Our worry is that
synthetic drugs have increasingly become a common option for young
drug abusers. Among youth abusers arrested in 2011, 65% had abused
methamphetamine, or commonly known as "Ice". Amphetamine-type stimulants,
such as Ecstasy and Ice are highly addictive, and can lead to psychiatric
disorders where abusers may hallucinate or become violent. Indeed,
the abuse of Ice has toxic effects and will cause extensive damage
to the brain.</p>

in 2010 to 1,577 in 2011. Compared to 1994, when 3,295 Malay drug
addicts were arrested, this can still be considered as a good situation,
but our community must not fall into a slumber and see this as a
total victory. In fact, Malay addicts still make up 48% of the total
number of addicts arrested in 2011. </p>

showing an increase in the number of new addicts. In fact, more
Malay addicts from the younger age group were arrested for the past
few years. With the community becoming more prosperous and values
keep changing, we have seen a change in the attitude towards drugs,
where these young people are beginning to feel that they can take
drugs "recreationally". Furthermore, they are also more affluent
and can afford to indulge in such activities. </p>

level of alertness towards the dangers of drug abuse. We do not
want the same episode, like what we saw in the 1970s, repeating
itself where drug addicts distribute and sell drugs freely in certain
places. Because drug addiction was so prevalent, everyone in the
community will surely know someone who was a drug abuser. I still
remember my neighbour, who was found dead in the Padang because
he took the MX pill, which was popular at that time. A strong stance
towards drug abuse must be emphasised. If the trend of drug abuse
is not halted, we would see an increase in the crime rate, families
breaking up and a bleak future within our community. </p>

harm reduction policies. Countries that pursue harm reduction try
to address the drug problem by viewing drug consumption as a medical

needles and sanitised cubicles for abusers to take drugs. However,
harm reduction policies often end up sending the wrong signals that
drug abuse is an acceptable way of life. These countries continue

helping inmates transit from incarceration to reintegration within

tighter supervision and enhanced community support. Given that the

the necessary treatment and support and, hopefully, reduce re-offending. </p>

Rajah that families are indeed the pillar of support for ex-offenders.
This, though, generally refers to an existing family unit from which
he has been receiving or can get support. It is quite different
when he sets out to build a family by getting married, especially
soon after release. An offender just out of prison has many issues
to deal with and an environment he is not familiar with anymore. </p>

Ministry will be more flexible in granting Long-Term Visit Passes
for foreign spouses of Singaporeans with past criminal records.
We are cognisant of the latter's needs, but we are mindful that
should a marriage not work out or the husband reoffends, the spouse
who is a foreigner will not have relatives in Singapore to turn
to nor jobs to sustain herself or her children as many are generally
low skilled. ICA, therefore, evaluates every application for a Long-Term
Visit Pass carefully, based on a variety of factors, such as the
sponsor's ability to financially support the family and sustain
the marriage, whether there are Singapore Citizen children from
the marriage, and duration of the marriage. </p>

11,500 foreign spouses of Singaporeans were granted Long-Term Visit
Passes annually. This represents a success rate of 85% over the
applications received, and includes applications from those who
have had criminal records before, but had qualified. But for ex-offenders
who demonstrate a strong commitment to keep a clean record and remain
in stable employment, we will review how we can better facilitate
such applications and help these families. For the cases mentioned
by the Member, I hope she can share with us these and we will look
further into them. </p>

easy to implement the initiatives that I spoke of. For example, the
Singapore Prison Service and her community partners face difficulties
in contacting some inmates' family members and also in getting more

to support those who genuinely want to change. We will continue to strengthen and expand
these initiatives so that we can help more inmates and their families.</p>

their friendship has extended beyond the prison walls and they are currently

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I have
three clarifications. First, it is in relation to the private security
industry that Deputy Prime Minister Teo touched on earlier. He mentioned
that there was a total of about 60,000 licensed holders in the security
industry. Can I just confirm with him that this figure includes
not only agency guards but also inhouse security, for example, those
working in hotels? Second clarification related to that is he mentioned
that out of these 60,000, about 35,000 were active. Does this indicate
that actually there is quite a high attrition rate from the industry
since out of 60,000, only 35,000 are active, which is about 58%?
Is the Ministry concerned about the attrition? Perhaps, more importantly,
does it indicate wasted training costs that went into those that
did not continue?</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-751dfeb2-51e9-42a2-a2fb-dd98375c6f5b"><!--a--></a>Second group of clarifications
concerns the Auxiliary Police recruitment criteria. Deputy Prime
Minister Teo just now mentioned that there was a need to show that,
for example, Malaysians do not have any prior criminal convictions.
Is there any other criteria which the Government sets for recruiting
of AP officers, whether it is in terms of education or going through
other testing? And the last clarification is about unlicensed moneylending
for Minister Iswaran. He mentioned earlier that there was a lot
of youths involved in being runners for such businesses. Is there
also any indication that there are foreigners involved, particularly
foreigners on social visit pass, being used as runners?</p>

criteria for recruitment of APOs, there are criteria beyond the need
