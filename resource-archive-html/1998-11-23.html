<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chng Hee Kok -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for National Development what is the

number of applicants for Housing and Development Board flats  on

the  waiting  list and if there are any plans  to  change  HDB's

building programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development (Mr Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National

Development):  Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 31st August 1998, there

were 108,500 applicants on the waiting list under the

Registration for Flat System (RFS). Of these, 42% were first-timers and 58%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



upgraders.  Compared with 145,700 applicants in June  1997,  the

waiting list has dropped by 26%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB reviewed its building programme in August this year.

It  will build 22,000 flats in non-mature estates in 1999 as the

number  of  new  applications  has declined  in  recent  months.

Together  with  replacement  flats  for  the  Selective  En-Bloc

Redevelopment Scheme and studio apartments, HDB has planned  for

a building programme of 28,500 flats for 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will continue to monitor the demand and adjust the

building  programme  accordingly.   It  will  also  ensure  that

applicants  are invited to book their flats within a  reasonable

time period.

<div align="center"><b>(Revision of sale price)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for National Development

whether  the Housing and Development Board will revise the  sale

price  of  new  HDB flats in view of (i) the drop in  values  of

resale  HDB  flats and private properties, and (ii) the  present

economic conditions, in general.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (for the Minister for National</b>

<b>Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is committed to

provide  affordable  housing to Singapore  citizens,  especially

first-timers  and  low-income  families,  despite  the   current

economic conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB considers several factors in setting prices of new flats.

The  main  one is affordability. HDB prices new flats such  that

90% of Singaporean households can afford at least a 3-room flat,

and 70% at least a 4-room flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB also takes into account individual attributes of the flats

such  as location, proximity to MRT/LRT stations, the view  from

the  flats, and special design features and finishes. New  flats

tend  to  have better designs and finishes, and are  located  in

towns with better facilities and infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB does not consider the prices of private residential

properties when it sets

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>

prices of new HDB flats. However, it does factor in current  HDB

resale market prices, because resale prices are an indication of

how  willing  and able Singaporeans are to pay  for  HDB  flats.

Prices  of  new  HDB  flats  are  below  the  market  values  of

equivalent flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present prices, new HDB flats continue to be heavily

subsidized. The overall sales proceeds do not cover their  total

development costs. The loss incurred by HDB has to be funded  by

a Government grant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, in view of the drop in

prices of resale flats, does the HDB take into consideration the

so-called market subsidy in setting its price?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, we have debated this before in the

House.   I have to remind the Member for Hougang that the prices

of new flats are heavily subsidised compared to market prices of

equivalent flats in the market today.

<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, the

Parliamentary Secretary  - and we have heard this before - talks

about  heavily  subsidising HDB flats.  Does  the  HDB  publish,

every time they embark upon a construction, the cost to the  HDB

of the construction of that particular estate or block?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, HDB has just released their Annual

Report  and  the  CEO of HDB conducted a press  conference  last

weekend.  May I refer Members to the financial review pages  and

they will get all the relevant statistics.  In particular, may I

refer  the Member to the balance sheet and the income statement.

The income statement  shows quite clearly the losses incurred by

the Government in the sale of new flats and this figure was also

highlighted by the CEO of HDB.  For the year 1997/98 it amounted

to  $591  million.   This is something like  60%  of  the  total

deficit incurred by HDB, which was about $1 billion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not asking for

figures in the annual statement of the HDB.  I am asking whether

it  would not be a good thing if the HDB publishes its cost  for

every development and say at what prices they are going to  sell

the apartments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the development cost of each

individual  block is not published but if the Member  wishes  to

know the development cost of a particular block or precinct,  he

is  welcome to file a Question in Parliament.  The reason why we

do  not  publish  these  figures  is  that  every  precinct  has

different  characteristics.  New precincts have got markets  and

roads  at  different stages of construction.   But  the  selling

prices  of new flats are published and made known to the  people

who  are  asked to select the flats.  But these figures are  not

state secrets.  If he wants to know the development cost we will

let him know.  But we incurred a great loss because of the total

development cost.  I think Members confuse development cost with

construction  cost.  Over the last one year,  construction  cost

has  indeed gone down, but the land cost has not gone down  that

much.   If  you  talk  about flats built today,  ie,  ready  for

selection and to go in for occupation , they were bought by  the

Government several years back.  At that time, the land cost  was

very expensive and the construction cost was equally high.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD RESALE FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review of levy)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development if

he  will review the levy imposed on various types of Housing and

Development  Board resale flats in view of the current  economic

situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (for the Minister for National</b>

<b>Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to clarify that the

resale  levy  is not imposed on HDB resale flats.  If  a  person

sells his first direct purchase HDB flat and buys a resale  flat

in  the open market, he does not pay the resale levy. This is an

important point.  The resale levy is applicable only for lessees

who  have  already enjoyed the first Government subsidy  (either

through the purchase of new HDB flats or the purchase of  resale

flats  using  the  CPF  housing grant) and  intend  to  purchase

another  flat directly from HDB.  In other words, he intends  to

take a second bite of the subsidy cherry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the resale levy is to ensure that the

second housing subsidy is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>

smaller than the first housing subsidy, which is something I  am

sure  all  Members  will agree. The Government  understands  the

needs of 3-room flat dwellers to upgrade to a bigger flat. Thus,

it has structured the resale levy such that a lessee who sells a

smaller  flat, such as a 2-room or 3-room flat,   pays  a  lower

levy. Conversely, the levy imposed on the sale of a larger flat,

like a 5-room or Executive flat, is higher than the 3-room or 4-room flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resale levy has effectively helped HDB to manage the

demand  for new flats from upgraders. As the objective to reduce

the  amount of subsidy for purchase of second flat from  HDB  is

still  valid,  my  Ministry does not see a need  to  review  the

resale levy now.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Is the Parliamentary Secretary not

aware  that all Government departments are reducing their  fees?

Can the same principle not be applied to the resale levy?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I think the Member did not hear me

correctly.   If   you sell your first flat which  you  purchased

from  the HDB some years ago, at least five years ago,  and  now

you  want to buy a resale flat, you do not pay the resale  levy.

You  only pay the resale levy when you queue up and buy the next

flat  direct  from  HDB.   Resale flats have  indeed  fallen  in

prices.   So  as a percentage of the smaller selling price,  the

absolute  amount of the resale levy is already  smaller.   Apart

from  that,  people who are eligible to sell today have  already

occupied their flats for at least five years.  For those who are

eligible  to apply for a second flat, they would have stayed  in

the  flat for 10 years.  In other words, they would have  bought

their flats either in 1988 or 1993.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the price of a 3-room flat from HDB was only $44,000.

In  1988,  the price of a 3-room flat from HDB was only $41,000.

Today,  the  resale  price  of a 3-room  flat  is  approximately

between $150,000 and $180,000. If you do a simple sum, there  is

a sizable capital gain, ie, $150,000-$180,000 minus the $40,000-odd  and multiply that by 20% resale levy, which he need not pay

until he gets the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>

new flat.  Of course, if he chooses this option he has to pay  a

5%  interest annually.  In other words, my short answer is  that

no, we are not going to lower the resale levy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, despite his explanation, I do not understand the

logic behind his argument that the prices of new flats have also

gone up.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that HDB  has

also  moved  towards market pricing?  Is that not the direction?

If  that is the case, what is the basis of still maintaining the

levy as imposed?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, because the selling prices of new

HDB  flats  are still lower than the resale flats in the  market

today.   Yes,  resale prices have fallen by about 25%  from  the

peak  in  1996  and  we have consequently adjusted  the  selling

prices  of new flats.  But there is still a big gap between  the

price  of a new flat and the price of an old flat.  In  view  of

the substantial market subsidy, the resale levy should stay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, in view of the relatively lower resale

prices  of 3-room flats and the relatively higher prices  of  4-room  flats,  in comparison to the market price now,  would  the

Parliamentary Secretary consider waiving the resale levy for  3-room  flats and help those who apply directly to HDB to  upgrade

to 4-room HDB flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the resale levy for a 3-room flat is

only 20%.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> It is money.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Yes, correct, it is money and money is

hard-earned.  But maybe the Member for Hougang did not hear  me.

The  resale  price  for a 3-room flat today is  about  $150,000-$180,000.  The original selling price of a 3-room flat for those

who  are  eligible  to  sell their flats today  was  only  about

$44,000.   If you do a simple calculation, the capital  gain  is

huge  with  over  $100,000.  Out of the $100,000  capital  gain,

which is tax free, you just pay 20% to the Government.  You need

not pay this amount until you get your new flat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> How about comparing the selling price of a

4-room  HDB flat now and $40,000, as mentioned by you, 20  years

ago?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I have the figures here too. For 4-room flats, in 1988, HDB sold them at $65,000. In 1993, 4-room

flats were sold at $109,000.  Today, in spite of the downturn, 4-room  flats are still being snapped up - in fact, they  are  the

most popular units in the market - at $250,000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am talking about those who sold

their  3-room  flats and bought 4-room flats.  I am  asking  for

waiver of the levy for 3-room flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I think we are going off tangent

here.   These are upgraders.  Your sympathy should lie with  the

first-timers,  should  you not?  If we  encourage  upgraders  to

upgrade all the time, then the first-timers will be left behind.

So  we are talking about people who have already taken the first

bite  of  the subsidy cherry.  Why are we crying for people  who

have  got  a  big bite of the cherry already?  When  a  3-roomer

sells  his 3-room flat and applies for a 4-room flat, the 4-room

is  sold  at a heavy subsidy too, but the subsidy is now smaller

because  of the 22.5% resale levy.  I think he did not  get  his

perspective right, Mr Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Despite all that, is the Parliamentary Secretary

willing  to  review the levy charges if the resale  prices  drop

further?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Government policies are

never  static.  We always review policies as situations  change.

I thank the MP for Tanjong Pagar for his advice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in

view of what he has just said, is it the Government's policy now

to  discourage people from upgrading, people who  want  to  move

from  a  3-room flat to a 4-room flat if they think that the  3-room flat is inadequate?  Is that the policy now?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the word "discourage" is not quite

right.   We  give  preference to first-timers, people  who  have

never  had  the  first bite of the cherry.  For people  who  are

living  in  3-room  flats today and want to  upgrade  to  4-room

flats, we understand their aspirations.  That is the reason  why

4-room flat prices are benchmarked very affordably.

<div align="center"><b>BUY BACK SCHEME OF 3-ROOM HDB FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Stepping up of purchase)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development

if  the  Housing and Development Board (HDB) will  step  up  the

purchase of 3-room HDB flats under the Buy Back Scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (for the Minister for National</b>

<b>Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Selective Buy-Back of 3-room

Flats  Scheme  was introduced on 19th May as  one  of  the  four

measures taken by the Government to help low-income families own

HDB  flats.  Eligible low-income families with household  income

not  exceeding $1,500 per month can purchase the 3-room buy-back

flats at heavily subsidised prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, some of these flats bought under the scheme

are  also  offered  for  sale to lessees affected  by  SERS  and

tenants  affected by Relocation Exercises, and  for  letting  to

rental applicants under the Transitional Rental Housing Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will continue to buy 3-room flats from the open market

under  the buy back scheme to cater to the demand from the  low-income  families and the housing needs under the  other  various

schemes.  Based on the current demand, there is no need to  step

up the purchase of such 3-room flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is it true that the HDB purposely

refuses to buy back 3-room flats in opposition wards?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no truth in the

allegation,  as  HDB actively buys back all  good  3-room  flats

because we recognise that there is always a group of people  who

need 3-room flats even though their aspirations may be 4- or  5-room flats.  So there is no truth in that statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, what are the criteria for the HDB

to  decide whether to buy back a particular unit of 3-room  flat

from a particular area?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The first criterion will be price. If Mr

Low  Thia  Khiang's  residents are selling  a  3-room  flat  for

$250,000, then

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>

the  answer is no straightaway.  But if the price is reasonable,

then the next criterion is whether the 3-room HDB flat would  be

of  use to somebody else, because we cannot keep empty stocks of

3-room  flats around.  These are taxpayers' monies.  So we  must

buy  a  flat  which is reasonably in demand.  But  we  give  the

benefit  of the doubt to the future buyers.  In other words,  we

think  that  there  will be a demand for  this  particular  unit

bought back from the market.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, is the Parliamentary Secretary willing to

consider  under  the buy back scheme, particularly  those  cases

that are upgrading, to enable them to move up to a 4-room flat?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> There is a huge demand in the resale

market.   Members  must  have read in the  newspapers  that  the

resale  demand for this year has shot up to about 50,000  units.

So  there is no shortage of demand.  The cases that we  hear  of

people  having  difficulty in selling their 3-room  flats  boils

down  to  price  and  location.  For  location,  we  can  always

discount  it and sell it at the right price.  There is always  a

clearing price for everything.  Does he not agree?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> I do not think I can agree because it depends on

what  price you set.  It depends on whether there is  a  willing

buyer and willing seller.  May I ask, if there are upgraders who

are,  in  fact,  stuck for more than a year  and  they  need  to

upgrade to bigger flats, could HDB consider  such cases?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if Dr Vasoo knows of

such  cases, could he please write to the Ministry and  we  will

look at them carefully.

<div align="center"><b>AMNESTY FOR DISMISSED FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether

the Government will offer recently dismissed foreign workers who

have  overstayed in Singapore a period of amnesty to report  for

repatriation to their home countries.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng</b>

<b>Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, foreigners whose

work  or visit passes have expired must leave Singapore and  not

stay  on  illegally  here.  Singapore is a  small  country  with

limited  resources.   We  cannot  afford  to  allow  people   to

disregard   our  laws  and  stay  on  illegally,  because   such

overstayers would impose a strain on our social system,  leading

to law and order problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has no intention to grant an amnesty to

foreign workers who overstay.  It would send the wrong signal to

potential immigration offenders that they will be forgiven  when

they commit immigration offences in Singapore.  This would erode

the  deterrent  effect of our immigration laws  and  enforcement

action,  and  lead to a more severe overstaying problem  in  the

longer run.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, if a work permit

is now cancelled in this present economic downturn, is there any

grace period allowed at all for the person who turns himself in?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Let me inform Mr Tay that since

he  filed the Question in July for the August sitting - I  think

there was a spate of publicity about workers whose employers  no

longer  require them to work in Singapore and their work permits

were  cancelled;  some of the workers did  not  know;  they  had

accommodation  problems and workers were on the  streets  -  the

Ministry of Manpower together with the Ministry of Home  Affairs

and  other  agencies  have worked together  to  tighten  up  the

procedures, so that the workflow is now better.  If a worker  is

no longer needed in Singapore, steps are taken to repatriate him

as expeditiously as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, has the Minister of State overlooked

that  the question relates to dismissed workers.  I raised  this

sometime ago.  What is the Government's policy when the  workers

are  made  illegal by the company dismissing them  before  their

time is up and who have claims against the company for back  pay

or  for other payments?  Does the Government allow them to  stay

in  Singapore to pursue their claims and recover what  they  can

recover from the company or are they sent packing home?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, this area has also been

looked at.  MOM has also looked into processing the claims  more

expeditiously.    They  have  strengthened  their   conciliation

processes, so that it now takes a shorter time for these  claims

to  be considered.  And if the workers are still not happy, they

can  go for adjudication before the Labour Court.  In the  event

that  the  worker  still wants to take his claim  to  the  civil

court,  he  will  be  given enough time to  file  his  claim  in

Singapore and instruct counsel.

<div align="center"><b>ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION SUMMIT IN MALAYSIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Outcome)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry

how  the outcome of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit

in  Malaysia  will  affect  the region's  recovery  and  further

development.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  APEC has taken a useful step  forward  in  Kuala

Lumpur  to  revive  the  crisis-hit  economies  of  East   Asia.

Leaders  at the Summit committed to pursue a cooperative  growth

strategy to put the region back on a recovery path.  They  urged

individual  member  economies to play  their  part  by  adopting

growth-oriented,   prudent  macro   economic   policies.    They

supported  on-going  work to recapitalise  and  restructure  the

financial  and corporate sectors, attract private  capital  back

into  the  region,  and  strengthen the international  financial

architecture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the Leaders agreed that an expanded G22 forum

should  co-ordinate  efforts  to  strengthen  the  international

financial  system.  They instructed their Finance  Ministers  to

develop  related proposals for implementation.  They proposed  a

taskforce  to  examine  the  scope for strengthening  prudential

regulation  of  financial  institutions,  promoting   safe   and

sustainable  capital flows.  They called for work  on  improving

crisis  management, including orderly debt workout  arrangements

with the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US$30 billion financial package proposed by Japan, the multi

lateral  initiative announced by Japan and the US in conjunction

with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  the  World  Bank,  the

Australian Economic Governance capacity building initiative, and

Singapore's   initiative   to   provide   technical   assistance

programmes at the IMF-Singapore Regional Training Institute will

also contribute to the region's recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, the KL Summit also endorsed programmes to

strengthen the basis for sustained growth of the region, in  the

areas  of  human  resources development, small and  medium-sized

enterprises,  electronic commerce, economic infrastructure,  and

science and technology industry cooperation.

Overall,  the  Kuala Lumpur APEC Summit will contribute  to  the

recovery of the region, and to building a prosperous and dynamic

APEC community.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Minister whether the failure to

agree on the early voluntary liberalisation scheme would have  a

negative  impact on the otherwise positive agenda he  has  given

us?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I think that the signal to the market is that

APEC  is  on  track  in terms of trade liberalisation.   Granted

there  were  difficulties in finally concluding this package  of

nine sectors because of political problems in Japan over the two

sectors  of  fisheries and forestry, nevertheless,  all  the  16

participating economies have agreed that this is a package  that

they are willing to work on and this is to be then submitted  to

the  WTO  in  Geneva to try and bring more economies  on  board,

especially the European Community.  Therefore, this  is  a  good

stepping stone to further trade liberalisation.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs

what is the rationale for Singapore's opposition to the proposal

that  ASEAN member states should be free to express concern over

any  action  of the government or people in other member  states

even if such action is taken or directed against its own people.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in reply to the Member, let me say  that  he  is

misinformed.   Singapore  has never opposed  the  right  of  any

individual  ASEAN  member to express  its  views  on  events  in

another ASEAN member country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we had opposed at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Manila

this  year  is  the  suggestion that ASEAN  should  abandon  the

principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of  member

states.  That is an established principle of international  law,

enshrined in the United Nations Charter and which is also  found

in ASEAN's Treaty of Amity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I assure the Minister that I

have not been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>

misinformed.   He  says  that  it  is  ASEAN's  policy  of  non-interference.  May I ask him, if you are providing  economic  or

humanitarian aid to another country, does it not also amount  to

involvement in the country's affairs?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If by Mr Jeyaretnam's suggested definition

that  it  is  intervention, I think all members of  the  UN  are

interfering in the internal affairs of everybody.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister aware that the UN also

interferes  when  there is a large scale  suppression  of  human

rights and even killings?  Is he not aware of that?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not see the

relevance of that question to the question he has asked.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister answer the question? Is

that  interference or not, if the United Nations goes in to stop

any violation of human rights?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we can have an esoteric

debate  on what the United Nations does, but I still ask how  is

that related to the question he has asked.

what  were  the  specific requests made by the  Malaysian  Prime

and  the  request for greater help and co-operation reflect  the

change  in  the Malaysian government's attitude to  restore  and

improve ties with Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Prime Minister during his

recent  meeting  with the Prime Minister of  Malaysia  in  Kuala

Lumpur,  whether the question of water supply to  Singapore  was

raised.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  have  your permission to take Questions 9, 10 and 11 together

as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Thank you. The essence of what Prime

Minister  Mahathir and I discussed has already been reported  in

the newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Mahathir sought Singapore's co-operation to

raise funds to help Malaysia meet its financial needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Mahathir also reaffirmed Malaysia's

commitment  to provide water to Singapore beyond 2061  when  the

<br><br>1962&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Agreement expires.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Malaysia's request, Singapore submitted its draft

Agreement  on  Water  to the Malaysians on 14th  November  1998.

Malaysia  in turn sent its draft loan agreement to Singapore  on

20th November 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials from both countries are now negotiating the two

agreements.  It is, therefore, premature to go into the  details

today.   But  as they are major agreements between  two  states,

they  will  be  tabled  before  our respective  Parliaments  for

approval  after Dr Mahathir and I have signed them.  However,  I

must caution that negotiation is still in progress and we cannot

assume yet that we will reach agreement on the details.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two proposals are win-win because Singapore will

provide  or  raise funds for Malaysia on very favourable  terms.

These  funds  will help Malaysia meet its financial requirements

and  overcome  its economic challenge.  In turn,  with  the  new

water  agreement, Singapore's long term supply of water will  be

secured.  Water from Malaysia is also a cheaper alternative than

desalination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting between Dr Mahathir and I to discuss bilateral

co-operation does represent a change in attitude on  both  sides

towards  restoring and improving bilateral  ties.   There  is  a

greater  chance  now  that  such improvement  in  ties  will  be

sustained,  especially  if  we  conclude  the  loan  and   water

agreements.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Prime  Minister whether it is possible for him to disclose  some

broad outline of the nature of the two agreements that are being

discussed,  for example, the amount of loan that  the  Malaysian

have   now  stated in their agreement and is there any  proposed

period in the water agreement  that we would like to ask for?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have explained just

now, negotiation is in progress.  I do not think it is wise  for

me  to go into details of the two agreements.  The main point is

that  once  the agreements are signed, they will be  tabled  for

approval by Parliament.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> I would like

to  ask  the Prime Minister whether Singapore has been asked  to

provide  funds directly or provide guarantees, or is  it  to  be

raised  through  private institutions, or whether  we  are  also

looking  at  the resolution of bigger issues like  the  CIQ  and

release of CPF funds belonging to West Malaysians.  Is this part

of the comprehensive agreement that we now have in place?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, the exact nature of the

financial  assistance which we will give to  Malaysia  is  being

discussed.    It  can  be  a  direct  loan  from  the  Singapore

Government.   It can be Singapore Government buying  bonds  from

Malaysia.   It  could be a guarantee.  These are  matters  being

discussed at the moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CIQ issue is separate. It is not part of this

discussion.  We have decided, when I met Dr Mahathir,  to  defer

discussion  on the CIQ and the Points of Agreement  to  a  later

date.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> From the reports,

it  was quite clear that the US is not very happy with Malaysia.

It  was  also reported that the US is probably trying  to  block

some loans to Malaysia because they said the loans would only be

given to those IMF-backed countries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chuang, could you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Yes. I would like to ask the Prime

Minister  whether  our  help to Malaysia  would  jeopardise  our

relationship with USA, especially when they are not in favour of

helping Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know how the US

would  react  on this particular issue, but here  we  take  into

account  our own national interest, and our interest in  helping

the  Malaysians.  I myself do not expect the US to object to our

assistance to Malaysia in this particular case, because  we  are

getting  something in return, which is of tremendous  importance

to us over the longer term.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, instead of providing loans to the

Malaysian Government, if Malaysia is prepared to sell the  piece

of  land  at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, would the Government

consider buying the land from Malaysia and help them in terms of

financial assistance?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if Malaysia is keen to

sell  that piece of land to Singapore, it has to put it  on  the

market and interested buyers would have to tender for the  piece

of  land.  I do not know how much the land would fetch.  It  may

or  may  not  be  sufficient to meet the needs of the  Malaysian

Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Prime Minister, given that

there  is  a  possibility of obtaining water more  cheaply  than

desalination,  does  this  mean that  if  the  deal  is  signed,

desalination  would not go ahead, and that pending negotiations,

there will be no progress on desalination?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have decided to go

ahead  with the desalination plant, and we will go ahead.   This

is  a pilot plant which will yield about 30 million gallons  per

day  and it is useful for us to have this plant so that we  know

how  it  works.  As I cautioned just now, we do not know as  yet

whether the discussion now will lead to fruition.

<div align="center"><b>INVASION OF MALAYSIAN AIR SPACE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Threat of retaliatory action)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and

Minister  for  Defence  whether there  is  any  apparent  threat

arising  from  recent statements by Malaysia that  it  will  not

compromise  on  any  invasion of its air  space  and  will  take

appropriate action if necessary; and (b) whether the Republic of

Singapore   Air  Force  has  any  safeguards  in  place   should

retaliatory actions take place.

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Matthias Yao Chih)</b>

<b>(for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I believe the hon. Member is referring to a number

of  statements over the past month made by the Malaysian Defence

Minister, Datuk Syed Hamid Albar. On 26th October and  again  on

10th  November  this year, Datuk Syed Hamid told  the  Malaysian

Parliament  that the RMAF would mobilise its fighters  "to  take

appropriate  action" if there was any intrusion into  Malaysia's

airspace by the RSAF.  Datuk Syed Hamid was also quoted  by  the

Malaysian  press as having said, on 2nd November, that  although

Malaysia  had  the  right  to fire missiles  at  aircraft  which

intruded  into  its  airspace, it preferred  to  apply  pressure

through  public  opinion.  He cited the case of a  South  Korean

airliner  that was shot down by a Soviet Union military aircraft

after  it  strayed  into Soviet airspace  -  an  incident  which

resulted in a huge loss of innocent lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia had, in official protests, alleged that there

were  seven  intrusions by the RSAF since  18th  September  this

year,  when  Malaysia  revoked the arrangements  and  agreements

which  allowed  the  RSAF  access  to  Malaysian  airspace.   No

supporting information was provided to substantiate any  of  the

allegations.   Singapore   categorically   rejects   all   these

allegations   as   being   completely   without    basis.    Our

investigations showed that three of the cases involved  aircraft

of   other  countries.  Two  of  them  were  transiting  through

Malaysian airspace with proper diplomatic clearance given by the

Malaysian  authorities while the third was a civil aircraft.  In

another three cases,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>

there  were  no  RSAF aircraft flying at the  times  and  places

stated  in  the  Malaysian  Third Person  Note.  The  last  case

involved an RSAF Fokker 50 maritime patrol aircraft coming  into

Changi Air Base, but the aircraft did not overfly or circle over

the  Navy  Recruit  Training  Base as  alleged.   Singapore  has

already  responded officially to Malaysia to conclusively  rebut

the allegations.  We have also asked for substantiating evidence

if  Malaysia insists that the intrusions did occur.  It  is  not

reasonable   to  keep  on  repeating  the  allegations   without

providing any details to substantiate them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore recognises that Malaysia, like any other country,

has  the  right to take actions to defend itself against hostile

action  and  to  protect its sovereignty.  As I have  explained,

there  were  no  intrusions by RSAF aircraft  in  the  instances

alleged  by Malaysia.  The RSAF is extremely careful  about  not

intruding into the airspace of other countries.  But it  is  not

possible   to  guarantee  that  there  will  not  be  accidental

infringements, especially when Singapore's airspace is so  tight

and  we  share  a  common  border.   Sometimes  adverse  weather

conditions cause aircraft to stray off-course. And no air  force

in  the  world  can guarantee that its pilots  will  never  make

navigational errors.  Earlier this year, there was one  instance

when  RSAF aircraft accidentally strayed into Malaysian airspace

- and we apologised to Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, threats to scramble RMAF aircraft to deal

with  RSAF  intrusions  and assertions of  the  right  to  shoot

missiles to bring down intruding aircraft are, to say the least,

most  unfortunate - particularly when reference  is  made  to  a

fighter  of the former Soviet air force shooting down a civilian

aircraft  that  had  been misidentified.   Such  statements  are

especially  unfortunate considering that Singapore and  Malaysia

are  friendly  neighbours interested in cooperation  for  mutual

benefit  as  the two Prime Ministers have recently  underscored.

We should be trying to clear up any misunderstandings instead of

making   statements  which  raise  tensions  and  increase   the

likelihood that a dangerous situation might arise.  As  Minister

Syed Hamid himself has stated, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>

is  dangerous  to "play games" in defence matters  as  doing  so

could lead to a very dangerous consequence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate that we would like to

have  good  defence relations with Malaysia.  We  are  ready  to

resume defence interactions when Malaysia is ready to do so  and

at a pace the Malaysians are comfortable with.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> I would like to ask the Minister

of   State  whether  he  would  consider  asking  the  Malaysian

Government  to  withdraw, change or clarify  its  position  with

regard to the recent expression of better relationship.  How can

we  go  on  with  cooperative efforts  when  these  threats  are

existing at the moment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> I think the Member has to raise this

in the Malaysian Parliament, if he can.

<div align="center"><b>RETRAINING PROGRAMMES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Participation rate of workers)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Harun A Ghani</b> asked the Minister for Manpower what

is the progress of various retraining programmes and whether the

participation rate of workers in need of upgrading their  skills

is satisfactory.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  have  a  wide range of retraining programmes  to  help

different  groups  of  workers to upgrade  their  knowledge  and

skill.   The Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) is one of  the

key programmes to provide unskilled and low skilled workers with

training leading to national skill certification.  The focus  of

the  SRP is on skill upgrading to enhance employability  of  the

workers.   SRP support is extended to companies that send  their

workers  for  the modular skill training programme by  the  ITE,

which  leads  to  the Certificate of Competency,  NTC3  or  NTC2

certification  or  for certificate programmes conducted  by  the

polytechnics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as at end October, the total number of workers

committed for training under

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>

the  SRP stood at 10,500.  This is more than half of the  target

of  20,000  workers that the NTUC aims to achieve  by  the  next

Labour  Day.  Of this number, over 2,800 workers have  completed

their   training  and  another  3,300  workers   are   currently

undergoing training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation of workers in the SRP has been boosted as a result

of  the sector-driven approach that has been recently adopted by

the  NTUC.  In the hospitality sector, 59 hotels have signed  up

to  retrain a total of 2,000 workers.  These workers would  have

been  vulnerable  to  retrenchment,  but  the  SRP  provided  an

opportunity  for  hotels to upgrade their skills  at  affordable

cost during this lull period.  The SRP for the marine sector was

launched  just  this  month, with 13  companies  committing  500

workers   to   be   trained.   The  SRP  for  a  third   sector,

telecommunications  sector, will be  launched  next  month,  and

another  500  workers  are expected to be retrained.   The  NTUC

plans to launch the SRP in at least another 12 more sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the economic downturn, many companies have cut

back  on  their training budgets.  Despite this, the  number  of

workers  being  scheduled for training under the  SRP  has  been

growing at an encouraging pace.  This is an indication that  the

SRP  is  making good progress, and has contributed to preserving

jobs  and  making workers more employable during these difficult

times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important feature of the SRP is that whenever possible,

training  plans are worked out with the participating  companies

for  their workers.  This is critical to the success of the  SRP

as  many  workers  lack the basic secondary education,  or  even

basic  literacy  and  numeracy skills, to qualify  for  training

leading to skills certification.  For this group of workers, SRP

support is extended for retraining programmes such as the  Basic

Education  for  Skills  Training (BEST) and  Worker  Improvement

through  Secondary  Education  (WISE).   Training  under   these

programmes  will  continue to help workers to  gain  certifiable

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BEST and WISE programmes are important segments of our

retraining

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>

effort.   BEST  was introduced in 1983 to equip workers  without

any   formal  qualifications  to  PSLE  level  in  English   and

Mathematics.  To-date, the programme has reached out to  216,000

workers.  The 1998 enrolment figure is 22,000 which is about the

same  as  the  1997 enrolment.  WISE was launched  in  1987  for

workers  to  upgrade English and Mathematics to GCE  `N'  level.

Since  its  launch,  the programme has reached  out  to  130,000

workers.   The  1998 enrolment figure is 16,000  which  is  over

1,000 more than in 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to highlight the progress of worker training

supported by the NTUC Education and Training Fund (N-ETF), which

was  launched  on  1st  October this year.   The  Government  is

providing a grant of $9 million to the NTUC to match funds of $3

million being raised by the labour movement.  The NTUC Education

and Training Fund supports the training of union members who may

not  be able to benefit from training support by their employers

but  are prepared to invest in their own skills upgrading.   The

target set by the NTUC was to train 10,000 workers in the  first

year.   As at end-October 1998, NTUC has already received  2,600

applications.   This  is  an indication  that  there  is  strong

interest in retraining among the union members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, there is a range of retraining programmes in

place  aimed  at  various segments of the  workforce,  including

those  who  do not have any formal qualifications.  Despite  the

economic  downturn and reduction in companies' training budgets,

the  enrolment  figures  indicate  that  these  programmes  have

continued  to  maintain a healthy level  of  participation.   My

Ministry will continue to encourage and support participation in

these  programmes  as  part of the initiatives  to  enhance  the

employability of our workers.

that they intended to seek work within the next two years. About

one  in  two persons in this group indicated that they preferred

part-time work for one reason or another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry's Employment Service Department (ESD)

provides  employment  assistance to Singaporeans  and  Permanent

Residents looking for jobs, whether it is for full-time jobs  or

part-time jobs. As at 31st October 1998, there were some 900 job

seekers  registered with the ESD, who were looking for part-time

or   flexible  work.  However,  there  were  only  64  part-time

positions posted with the Department as at that date.  About  40

of these vacancies have since been taken up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time employment is not prevalent in Singapore. The

June 1998 Labour Force Survey reveals that only 3.1% of employed

persons are working part-time.  While many economically inactive

persons such as housewives favour part-time work, employers  are

still  not  keen  to recruit part-timers.  The current  economic

downturn has resulted in loosening the labour market.  This  has

made  it  more difficult to promote part-time and flexible  work

arrangements.  Once the economy recovers and demand  for  labour

picks  up,  employers  will have to review  their  position  and

consider part-time workers as a valuable supplementary workforce

to meet growing demand.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, could

I  ask  the Minister for the 900 job seekers, what kind of  jobs

were they looking for, please?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have the

specific  details for all the 900 job seekers.  But, in general,

these were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>

people  who were looking for part-time jobs at the lower  level.

They  were not highly-skilled workers.  They want part-time jobs

perhaps  in  the  retail sector, restaurant, business  or  other

commerce areas.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Could I have the assurance of

the  Minister  that  the Ministry will step up  its  efforts  in

identifying more of these part-time jobs and then publicise  the

information and job-matching services?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will try our best to

help  those who want to look for part-time jobs.  But, as I have

said  earlier  on,  during this economic downturn,  with  rising

unemployment,   very   few  employers  are  over-anxious   about

recruiting  part-time  workers to meet their  requirements.   In

fact,  they  have  a wide choice of full-time job  seekers.   So

during  this  period,  our  focus  will  be,  in  fact,  on  the

retrenched  workers  and  those  who  want  to  seek   full-time

employment.   As  and when the economy recovers and  the  labour

market  tightens up again, I think employers will have to change

their  mindset  and  be more prepared to engage  part-timers  to

supplement the full-time workforce.

<div align="center"><b>(Review of rental policies)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  if he will consider (i) reviewing the  Housing  and

Development   Board's  rental  policies   for   commercial   and

industrial premises to allow tenants greater flexibility to sub-divide  and  sublet their premises for compatible  multi-purpose

usage  and cost saving purposes; and (ii) relaxing the  rule  on

HDB shop-cum-dwelling units to allow owners and tenants of these

units  to  use  the  dwelling  space for  compatible  commercial

purposes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (for the Minister for National</b>

<b>Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>

HDB does provide flexibility to its tenants in the subletting of

their  commercial  and  industrial premises.   At  present,  HDB

allows  its tenants to sublet up to 50% of their premises.   The

present  rule is liberal enough and should be of help to tenants

who have excess space.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to shop-cum-dwelling units (that means, shops

on  the ground floor, and another unit on the upper floor),  HDB

does  not allow dwelling units to be used for other purposes  as

this  is  generally not catered for in the design of the  units,

and  the surrounding infrastructure and facilities.  It may also

cause increased disamenity to the residents in the area.

<div align="center"><b>PREMISES OCCUPIED BY VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Waiving of 1999 rentals)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development  if his Ministry will  seriously  consider

waiving the 1999 rentals of premises under its charge which  are

occupied  by  voluntary organisations to  ease  their  operation

burdens  so  that staff and volunteers can focus on services  to

the needs of the vulnerable instead of spending their energy  on

raising funds to keep the operation going.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (for the Minister for National</b>

<b>Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB lets out void deck

facilities   at  concessionary  rentals  to  voluntary   welfare

organisations.  The current rentals for these organisations  are

already  low and below cost recovery.  Instead of giving  rental

waiver  for  such  facilities, the  Government's  policy  is  to

provide   explicit  operating  subsidies  to  voluntary  welfare

organisations  to  help  ease  their  operation   burden.    The

Government  is  already subsidising this  at  50%  of  operating

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem is not rent but salaries of

professional workers in the VWOs.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CHILDCARE AND BEFORE-AND-AFTER-SCHOOL-CARE SUBSIDIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Increase)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Community Development, for the next difficult 12 months, if  his

Ministry will (i) increase childcare and Before-and-After-School-Care  subsidies for families who are faced with reduced  income;

and  (ii)  provide  temporary financial  support  to  vulnerable

groups  such  as  single parents who cannot work full-time,  yet

cannot  earn  sufficient money to upkeep their families  and  to

families with main breadwinner imprisoned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah

Tarmugi):   Mr  Speaker, Sir, currently a subsidy  of  $150  per

month  is  given to working mothers who have children in  child-care  centres.   Normally they would lose their eligibility  for

these  subsidies when they are no more working.  But the  Member

may  be  pleased  to know that our current practice  now  is  to

extend the child-care subsidy for a three-month grace period  if

the mother is looking for a job.  In view of the difficulties in

the  job  market  now,  my  Ministry  will  review  the  3-month

extension period with a view to lengthening it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other schemes to help families with young

children needing child-care.  For example, there is the  Centre-based Financial Assistance for Child Care (CFAC) Scheme for low-income  families administered by the National Council of  Social

Service.   This scheme provides financial assistance  of  up  to

$200  per month depending on family income.  This is in addition

to  the child-care subsidy provided by Government.  Even if  the

mother is currently not employed, she is still eligible for  the

CFAC assistance as long as she is seeking employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Before-and-after-school care centres, or BASCs, they

are  operated  by voluntary welfare organisations  (VWOs)  which

generally keep their fees at an affordable rate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-income families, ie, those with gross monthly household

income of less than $2,500, are eligible for the Ministry's BASC

fee subsidy of up to $150 a month on a sliding scale.  A family,

which  is  eligible for the maximum subsidy of $150,  needs,  in

fact,  to pay only about $52 in BASC fees, or about $42 if their

child attends a school-based BASC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of temporary financial support, as you

know,  MCD  has  a  Public Assistance Scheme which  can  provide

financial assistance to the family which has no means of support

and  no  one  they can turn to for help.  A family, whose  sole-breadwinner is temporarily incapacitated or has lost a job,  can

apply  for interim financial assistance to tide the family  over

this very difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families, whose sole-breadwinners are unable to work full-time to earn enough for the family, can also be referred to

other Government agencies or Voluntary Welfare Organisations for

supplementary  assistance such as waiver of school  fees/medical

charges, food rations or additional monetary assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member that there are a range of

schemes  to  help  needy families through  this  very  difficult

period  and  at all times.  Adjustments to the schemes  will  be

made,  if  necessary, in accordance with the prevailing economic

circumstances.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> May I clarify with the

Minister: are you saying that single-parent households will also

benefit from all these schemes, not just low-income families  or

vulnerable families?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Single-parent households, if they are

low-income  and if they need the assistance of the  Ministry  in

any  form,  not only in terms of finance but also  in  terms  of

schooling for their children and others, would be given help.

what is the progress of his Ministry's efforts in revamping  the

education system; (b) whether his Ministry has been implementing

this  on a pilot basis in primary and secondary schools and,  if

so,  whether there are any specific results; and (c) what is his

assessment  of the revamp in terms of preparing our students  to

confront the new challenges of a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K.</b>

<b>Wong) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our

education  system has served us well over the years.  Today,  we

have  a  fundamentally sound system where quality  education  is

delivered  to  all  our  pupils,  not  just  the  best  and  the

brightest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry therefore does not intend to revamp our whole

system  radically.   What we seek to do is  to  re-position  and

refine   the  system  to  develop  our  young  to  meet   future

challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three key trends have emerged for the future:

globalisation,  rapid technological change and transition  to  a

knowledge  based economy.  Given these trends and the challenges

facing  Education, we have to realign the focus of our education

system  towards  developing the full  spectrum  of  talents  and

abilities  of  every child, and not just in  terms  of  academic

achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-positioning of the education system aims to put in

place  ways to identify and help each child to maximise  his  or

her  talents and abilities and harness their potential.  As part

of  the process, we have identified six strategic areas of focus

for  the  next  five  years.   These  are,  first,  designing  a

responsive education structure.  We want to be able to  identify

the talents and abilities of our students early, ---

<div align="center"><b>COMMITTEE ON SINGAPORE'S COMPETITIVENESS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House endorses the strategies and policies set

out   in   the   Report   of   the  Committee   on   Singapore's

Competitiveness,  contained in Paper Misc. 3  of  1998,  as  the

basis for strengthening Singapore's competitiveness.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May last year, the Committee on Singapore's

Competitiveness   (CSC)   was  formed   to   critically   assess

Singapore's  economic  competitiveness  over  the  next  decade,

taking  into  consideration  global trends  and  development  of

existing  and  emerging  competition.  The  CSC  was  tasked  to

identify  problem areas and propose appropriate  strategies  and

policies   with   a   view  to  maintaining  and   strengthening

Singapore's  competitive position.  The Committee has  completed

its  work and released its Report on 11th November 1998.  Copies

of the Report have been circulated to hon. Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the CSC first began its work, the focus was on the

next  ten  years.  The onset of the regional economic crisis  in

July   1997   has,  however,  altered  the  economic   landscape

significantly.  Given our open economy and significant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>

linkages with the region, Singapore too has not been spared from

the  contagion  despite  our sound economic  fundamentals.   The

sharp    currency   realignments   have   also   weakened    our

competitiveness.   The  scope of the CSC  Report  was  therefore

expanded  to propose measures to help the economy cope with  the

crisis.   The  Report hence includes both short-  and  long-term

recommendations to improve our competitiveness.

<br><br><i>Short-term Measures</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the regional crisis has significantly

impacted  our economic performance.  Between 1st July  1997  and

21st  November  1998,  the  S$ to  US$  exchange  rate  and  the

Singapore  stock market have fallen by 12% and 30% respectively.

The GDP growth rate year-on-year has slowed from 7.8% in 1997 to

6.2%  and  1.8% respectively in the first and second quarter  of

1998.   Third quarter growth was -0.7%, the first decline  since

1985.   On  a  quarter-on-quarter basis, the  economy  has  been

shrinking for two successive quarters.  For the whole  of  1998,

Singapore's GDP growth is expected to be around 1/2-1%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses have been hit, some sectors more than others,

and  more than 20,000 workers have been retrenched in the  first

three   quarters   as   a   result.    The   seasonally-adjusted

unemployment rate has risen sharply from 2.3% in June to 4.5% in

September this year.  The coming quarters will be difficult  for

Singapore.  We will continue to face weaker demand for our goods

and services from the region which is struggling to recover from

the  severe economic crisis.  The slowing momentum in the US and

the  EU will dampen demand further.  As external demand accounts

for  more  than  two-thirds of our total demand,  1999  economic

growth  is  expected  to remain weak.  MTI's preliminary  growth

forecast for 1999 is between -1% and 1%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key concern is that the sharp currency realignments have

eroded our cost-competitiveness.  Our relative unit labour  cost

(RULC)  has  been rising gradually but steadily over the  years.

When  the  region was prospering, our rising RULC was a  concern

but not a critical problem.  Now

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>

economic  conditions have changed drastically in the region  and

we  are competing for a global economic pie that is growing more

slowly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from EDB indicated that some companies were facing

pressures  to  pare  prices  or  relocate  production  to  other

countries  because  of the cost differentials between  Singapore

and  the  regional countries.  Our total exports to the US  have

fallen by 8.2% in the first 9 months of this year while all  the

other  regional  countries still managed  to  register  positive

export  growth  to  the US.  This is due  largely  to  the  weak

performance  of our electronics industry.  Our market  share  of

electronics  exports  to the US has dropped  from  9.3%  in  the

second quarter of 1997 to 7.3% in September 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the short term, the key concern for Singapore is how to

restore our competitiveness, help our companies to tide over the

crisis  and  minimise  further job  losses.   We  also  need  to

continue   attracting  investments  to  create  new   jobs   for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides raising productivity which takes time, there are

two main approaches to restore cost competitiveness in the short

term.  One approach is through currency depreciation.  While MAS

has  been  managing the S$ more flexibly in view of the regional

crisis, competitive devaluation is not recommended.  A weak  S$,

in  the context of an open economy heavily dependent on imports,

will  translate into larger imported inflation.  This  would  in

turn erode any competitive gains from a currency devaluation.  A

depreciating currency would also erode confidence in the S$ as a

store  of  value, impact our position as a financial centre  and

diminish   the   value   of  S$-denominated   assets   held   by

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other approach which the CSC has recommended is to

reduce  business  costs  directly.   This  addresses  the   cost

competitiveness head-on, without the disadvantages brought about

by  competitive  devaluation.   The  Government  took  the  same

approach to tackle the 1985 recession, with great effectiveness.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June the Government accepted the CSC's recommendation of

a  $2  billion  package of off-budget measures which  have  been

implemented.  Since then the economic situation has deteriorated

further and the contagion has spread to Russia and Brazil.   The

CSC  has recommended that the Government should now implement  a

much  larger  cost  and  tax cutting  package  worth  about  $10

billion,  equivalent  to  about 7%  of  our  GDP,  to  help  our

companies  compete during this difficult period.   All  the  key

components  of  business  costs should be  addressed,  including

wages,  foreign worker levy, rentals, charges for services  like

electricity,  telecommunications  and  port  services,  vehicle-related  overhead costs, as well as Government  taxes.   Here  I

refer  Members to pages 3 and 4 of the CSC Report which set  out

the details of these recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures should be implemented expeditiously to

regain  our  competitiveness, minimise further  job  losses  and

position  our  economy to face intense competition  as  regional

competitors  struggle to export their way out of their  economic

difficulties.   Besides the cost-cutting package,  the  CSC  has

also  recommended measures to improve credit availability,  seek

out  markets  beyond  the  region, attract  more  businesses  to

Singapore and build up our capabilities.

<br><br><i>Long-term Capability Building Measures</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we must not lose sight of the need to

address  longer-term challenges and take steps now to strengthen

our competitiveness beyond the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to take into account the long-term global trends

which  will  have  an  impact on Singapore.  Continued  economic

liberalisation,  globalisation and  rapid  technological  change

will  shape the competitive economic environment of the  future.

These  global  forces will not wait for the economic  crisis  to

blow  over.   We  need to take cognisance of these  changes  and

adjust  our  strategies  and  policies  now  to  build  up   the

capabilities to enable us to thrive in this future world.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sound economic fundamentals, stability and cohesiveness

will  enable  us to do so.  We do not face the serious  domestic

structural  problems that some other countries  are  preoccupied

with.   We  have ample resources and our people are skilled  and

well-trained.  We must therefore use this window of  opportunity

now  to  enhance  our capabilities to widen  the  gap  with  our

competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC's vision is for Singapore to develop in the next

ten  years  into an advanced and globally competitive  knowledge

economy, with manufacturing and services as the twin engines  of

growth.   In  a knowledge economy, the basis for competitiveness

will  be  the capabilities and intellectual capital  to  absorb,

process and apply knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To realise this vision, we require to strengthen our

capabilities while managing cost competitiveness.  The  CSC  has

identified  eight strategic thrusts.  These are  promoting  high

value-added  manufacturing and services as the twin  engines  of

growth  to  serve global needs;  strengthening and  diversifying

our   external  wing  and  incorporating  a  global   dimension;

building  world-class companies;  strengthening  our  small  and

medium-sized    local   enterprises;    developing   human   and

intellectual  capital as a key competitive edge;  leveraging  on

science,   technology   and  innovation;   optimising   resource

management;  and facilitating by the Government to  enhance  our

business environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has managed to weather the crisis

relatively  well so far.  This is the result of  our  consistent

focus  on  getting  our fundamentals right - a stable  political

environment,  strong tripartite co-operation,  fiscal  prudence,

careful    financial   supervision,   investment   in   economic

infrastructure, and a good education system.  These are national

assets  which  we must jealously guard and continually  nurture.

With  our strong fundamentals and our steadfast adherence to  an

open-market  philosophy, this crisis has in  fact  enhanced  our

international standing in contrast with the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the regional economic crisis has created serious

immediate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>

challenges, as well as added an urgent dimension to our  efforts

to  transit  to  a knowledge economy.  Regional  economies  will

emerge leaner, fitter and more cost-competitive after they  have

restructured their economies.  This means we have to  accelerate

the upgrading of our economy so that we are even more productive

and ready to soar when the region recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC had an extensive discussion of this problem over a year,

with valuable inputs from hundreds of people, both in the public

and  the  private  sectors,  both locals  and  foreigners,  both

practitioners and academics.  I wish to thank all  of  them  for

their  contributions.  The proposed strategy  and  the  specific

recommendations  of  the  CSC  are  comprehensive  and  mutually

reinforcing, covering both the short term and the long  term.  I

recommend  them  to  the  Government  for  adoption  and  prompt

implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the acceptance of the CSC recommendations

will  require a united response from all Singaporeans to  accept

painful  cuts  in  CPF  and wages.  The world  is  watching  how

Singapore is responding to the crisis.  Let us give a clear  and

resounding  signal  that  as a people we  will  do  whatever  is

necessary to compete,  thrive and emerge stronger than before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of

this  motion  tabled in the name of the Minister for  Trade  and

Industry, Mr Lee Yock Suan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that this House will strongly endorse the

strategies  and policies set out in the Report of the  Committee

on  Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC).  I note with satisfaction

that  the CSC, except for the Chairman and Deputy Chairman  (who

are  both  Ministers for Trade and Industry),  comprises  mainly

members  who are from the private sector.  Views were diligently

collected from a wide segment of private sector members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to commend the two Ministers for Trade and

Industry and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>

Committee Members for preparing a comprehensive report  that  is

brimming with new and creative ideas and suggestions.

In  order for our GPC for Finance, Trade and Industry to  gather

feedback  from  the  ground  and  industry  members,   we   held

discussions with representatives of the Singapore International,

Chinese  and  Indian  Chambers of  Commerce  and  Industry,  and

representatives from the Singapore Confederation of  Industries,

the  Singapore Hoteliers Association and the Singapore Retailers

Association. Our GPC members and I would like to thank them  for

their  contributions.  We shall relay some  of  their  important

comments to this House during the course of this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore's economy is officially in recession as

we  have negative growth for the third quarter 1998, and perhaps

quite  surely  for the fourth quarter 1998.  The CSC  Report  is

timely  as  it  sets  out  the  key strategies  for  Singapore's

survival in the immediate and long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to ask is: is this $10 billion rescue

package that the CSC has proposed sufficient to pull us  out  of

the  recession?   The Government has previously announced  a  $2

billion  off-budget measures in June 1998.  We know now that  $2

billion  is  not  enough.  The new package is now  $10  billion.

This  amount would be more effective than the earlier $2 billion

but the question still remains:  is it enough?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key issue which I would like to pose is whether

this  package is in fact expansionary or deflationary.   Central

to  the  package are the wage and CPF cuts totalling $7 billion.

This is the people's money that they are asked to contribute  by

tightening their belts and bear with CPF and wage cuts.   Hence,

while there is a $7 billion saving for the private sector,  this

is  dampened by a similar $7 billion drop in consumer  spending.

Moreover,  the  impression is that Government's contribution  to

the  $10 billion package is only the remaining $3 billion, which

is 30%.  The equation looks rather unbalanced as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>

the   people  are  bearing  the  main  burden  of  70%  and  the

Government's  share appears to be 30%.  We feel that  Government

can do more, and use more of the reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has total reserves amounting to about $120

billion.   Since  the start of the recession,  many  individuals

have  dipped  into  their own reserves to  weather  this  "rainy

period".   Hence, we must accept that the Singapore  economy  is

not  only  in  the rainy period but perhaps in  a  storm.   Many

Ministers  and Government leaders have said this  is  the  worst

economic crisis that they have ever seen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is time to draw upon our national reserves. We have

already  decided  that Singapore can spend $5  billion  to  help

Indonesia and I do not know how much we would draw upon to  help

our neighbours like Malaysia.  But what about helping ourselves?

If the Government were to spend just 5% of the total reserves to

help  Singaporeans, the amount to be used would be at  least  $6

billion.   If you want to be more generous and use  10%  of  the

reserves, this would be a very large $12 billion.  I feel it  is

time  for Government to be bold and decisive. Having the correct

measures and strategies, and using our reserves wisely, will  be

consistent with the effective, efficient and level-headed  image

of  the  PAP  Government.   Hence, I  would  like  to  urge  the

Government  to  be bold to draw more from our reserves  to  help

Singaporeans now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed CPF and wage cuts would take up about $7

billion  from the local economy in the form of lower  disposable

income  of the people.  The $7 billion is about 5% of our annual

GDP.   Based  on a simple arithmetical computation,  that  means

that  the  GDP could well contract by 5%.  If we add the  ripple

effects  of  the  loss of $7 billion in consumer  spending,  the

impact  on  the  economy will have a higher  multiplier  effect.

Assuming  that  the multiplier effect is double,  then  the  GDP

could  even  shrink  by  a total of 10%.  If  this  deflationary

effect  is  to  take  its  full  course,  this  could  be  quite

worrisome.  Hence, counter-stimulating measures must be taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a recession, the contractionary effect of the CPF

and wage cuts is very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>

undesirable.   People will stop spending and  the  economy  will

contract.   The  local retail and commerce sectors  are  already

facing  bad  business.  The mood will be further depressed.   It

will cause the economy to spiral downwards much faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is imperative that the Government should introduce

concurrently  economic  boosting  measures.  One  area   is   by

introducing  cuts in Government tax, rates and fees.  The  first

objective is to substantially reduce business costs.  The second

objective  is  to  put back money into the people's  pockets  to

mitigate  the drop in their disposable income due to their  loss

in wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in theory, although $7 billion is taken out of

circulation  from the people's spending, it is  hoped  that  the

Government  will  put  back  $7  billion,  if  not   more   into

stimulating the economy.  This sum of course could in fact  come

from  the savings of the employers in their business costs.   It

can also be a combination of other measures like government cuts

in industrial rentals, port charges, utilities, taxes and levies

as well as in the form of pump priming by the Government through

projects such as infrastructure development, roads, schools,  IT

programmes and R&D spending.  The public's expectation  is  that

the Government should contribute an equivalent, if not more,  or

at  least equal to the CPF and wage cuts, which is $7 billion of

this total package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in difficult times. It is crucial that the Government,

employers and employees work closely together, hand in  hand  to

overcome this formidable economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am generally in support of the proposed level of CPF cut

of  10%  and the 5-8% of wage cut.  I feel any deeper  level  of

cuts  would  have  too  severe  a contradictory  effect  on  the

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a word of caution, I would like to urge that employers in the

private  sector  do  their  part  in  preserving  jobs  and  not

overdoing the pay cuts of their employees.  Companies  that  are

doing well and maintaining profitability should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>

avoid that basic wage cuts or year-end bonus cuts.  At the  same

time,  employers  should also avoid using this  occasion  to  be

opportunistic and thereby deliberately reducing too  excessively

their workers' annual pay package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate the effect of the proposed 10% CPF cut, I would like

to  suggest that a 5% cut can be applied to the Ordinary Account

and the balance 5% be applied to the Special Account. This would

alleviate by half the impact of the drop in available funds  for

homeowners  with outstanding mortgages.  A 5% cut in  their  CPF

Ordinary Account will be more manageable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the Government should nevertheless introduce some

measures  to  help those who are badly affected  and  unable  to

continue   servicing  their  existing  housing  loan  repayments

arising  from  the drop in the CPF contributions.   The  schemes

proposed  should  be able to help not only  those  who  are  HDB

homeowners, but also those who are private residential owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One scheme I would like to suggest is to allow taxpayers to

claim  for up to a certain amount, say, $10,000-$50,000  yearly,

depending  on  how  generous is the Government,  as  tax  relief

equivalent  to  the  interest payable  due  to  the  outstanding

housing  mortgages. This tax relief has been introduced in  Hong

Kong.   I  suggest that, to be equitable, both HDB  and  private

homeowners  be  allowed to enjoy this relief but only  for  loan

mortgages taken for owner-occupied homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know it is taboo or sacred cow to suggest that Government

allow   Singaporeans  to  draw  on  their  CPF  savings   before

retirement.    Many   people  are  now   in   severe   financial

difficulties.  Their CPF savings of course are meant to be  used

for  old  age  or retirement.  However, I feel that for  special

cases,  only on a case-by-case basis, the Government  can  allow

Singaporeans  who  are  out  of job because  of  severe  medical

problems  and  very desperate of funds with no savings  left  to

draw from their CPF savings now.  If need be, even to allow them

to withdraw from the CPF savings of their immediate relatives if

they are in such desperate straits.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the proposed wage cut, I feel that the lower level

workers should not be made to suffer any basic wage cuts.  There

may  be  some  cuts  in their annual bonuses, depending  on  the

performance  of  the respective companies.   But  for  low  wage

earners,  a cut of even $10 maybe very painful and difficult  to

manage as they are already living from hand to mouth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I support a graduated scale of 5% cut for the mid-level

employees and a 7.5% cut for the senior and top executives.  For

the Ministers, as they have to lead by example, I consider a 10%

cut,  at  least  a 2.5% larger cut than the top civil  servants,

would be quite adequate.  It may be hard on the Ministers but as

national leaders, they have to lead by example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> MPs as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Yes, MPs as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amounts and rates of reduction in Government-related fees

and  charges have not been specified in the CSC Report.   To  be

complete, it is necessary for the Government to also specify the

targeted reduction in various rates and fees.  In fact, so as to

achieve  the  overall  savings in business  costs  by  15%,  the

Government should set definite rates of cuts to be made  by  all

statutory  boards  and departments, such  as  in  port  charges,

industrial  rentals, utilities and telecommunications.   Without

setting  the  desired quantum for each fee item, I feel  we  may

find  that  the  desired target of 15% cut in  overall  business

costs may not be achieved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC has also suggested that the foreign worker levies be

reduced.   It  has proposed that the reduction be  from  $50  to

$100.   This  amount, I feel, is too low.  To be bold,  I  think

that the Government should consider a 50% cut in the interim  2-year period for such foreign worker levies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I also feel that the Government should allow a 50%

cut in maid's levy for an interim 2-year period.  This reduction

will help many Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>

and  companies, particularly the middle-income families who have

maids,  to have more disposable income, which will help them  to

offset their loss in CPF and wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to pick on an important issue

raised at page 130 of the CSC Report.  The CSC has proposed that

group  tax  consolidation  be  allowed.    This  will  encourage

companies  to  grow  through new ventures  and  ease  cash  flow

constraints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this economic downturn, many companies will encounter

losses, including those incurred by their subsidiaries.  This is

particularly  so for property developers but applicable  to  all

companies.   Under  present income tax rules, holding  companies

are  not  allowed  to  offset the  losses of their  subsidiaries

against their profitable ones, even though they are owned by the

same  group.   This  rule is particularly  unfair  for  property

developers  as  it  is  a Government requirement  to  impose  on

successful  tenderers of Government land sales to form  separate

companies to own land sites purchased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I wish to declare my interest as a director of a property

development company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of losses incurred during this recession, companies are

facing  huge  write-offs and provisions for losses.   Yet,  they

cannot  enjoy  any  tax offset against the profitable  projects.

Normally,  if  all the investments or projects  (that  is,  both

profitable and loss-making ones) are put into one company,  they

will enjoy the tax offsetting.  The Government does not want  to

allow tax leakages by allowing group offsetting, especially  for

overseas projects.  But I feel that for cases of definable local

projects   and  investments,  and  also  for  new  ventures   in

Singapore,  R&D  projects  and other new  investments  that  are

likely  to incur losses, the Government should consider allowing

for group tax offsetting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxpayers are given a 5% tax rebate during this year's Budget

announcement.   This  rebate  we  now  see  is  too  low.    The

Government  can consider introducing reductions in corporate  or

personal income tax cuts.  Otherwise, I would like to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>

suggest  that the Government consider allowing the  tax  rebates

for  Year of Assessment 1998 and 1999 to be higher, say,  15-20%

for  tax  rebate.  If we recall, Dr Mahathir,  who  is  now  the

Finance Minister of Malaysia, has allowed a total tax relief for

taxpayers in Malaysia in 1998.  The idea of a larger tax  rebate

is  to  encourage  our   taxpayers and companies  to  have  more

disposable income.  Hopefully, some of this money will flow back

into the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CSC Report has focused on the business sector. Rightly

so,  as  we need to formulate plans for the immediate  and  long

term,  concepts  and strategies for Singapore  to  survive  this

current recession and remain competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report contains 168 pages. It is a very thorough and

well-researched report.  Many sections are devoted to  long-term

strategies, some of which my other GPC Members will comment on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel strongly that a total review should be done to help

everyone in Singapore.  There should be constant monitoring  and

feedback.  Besides the business sector, we should not forget the

individuals.   The  total economic rescue  package  should  also

include  help  for the individuals, especially  for  the  poorer

segments  of  the people.  A comprehensive rescue  package  will

help  garner  total  support from the entire  population.    The

chances  of success will be enhanced.  Let us take heart.   With

effective measures and determination in the implementation,  let

us   work  closely  together  to  pull  ourselves  out  of  this

recession.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me, first,

congratulate  the  CSC for the comprehensive  way  in  which  it

prepared  the  Report,  and also the rapid  way  in  which  they

changed  horses mid-stream to deal with the economic  crisis  at

hand.   The short-term packages, personally, I have no  quarrel.

In  fact,  the  CPF wage cut has all been announced  before  the

Report was published.  But I only hope that the Government  will

also consider the assistance to be given to mortgage houseowners

in  order to alleviate the problem when the CPF is cut.   And  I

also hope that Government Ministries and departments

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>

will respond equally fast to reduce charges in equal measure  to

keep tab with the wage reduction that the people will suffer  in

return.  In fact, those of us in the private sector have already

done so.  Many of us have already cut the bonuses almost by 80%-90%, and some companies have already decreased wages by about 10-15%.   As regards availability of capital, I do not think it  is

an issue.  I think our banks have very sound fundamentals and if

the projects are bankable, there will be no lack of finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to comment today, rather than on the short-term measures which I think other Members will have a field day,

is  to  comment on the future competitiveness section which  the

CSC  Report has delved on at length.  I think the three elements

that were mentioned in the Report are very important.  First  of

all,  the  strengthening  of the external  wing  post-recession;

second, the human and intellectual capital that we have  got  to

build  up; and, third, the optimal resource management  that  we

must exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singaporeans must realise that there is a basic shift in

the  economic  climate  in Singapore, and  it  is  not  just  an

economic  crisis.  This economic crisis, in fact, is a  wake  up

call  for us.  Our competitiveness has been eroded since  before

the  recession.   It  has  progressively  gone  worse,  but  the

regional crisis has brought it out into stark perspective, which

therefore  means that post-economic crisis the same issues  will

remain  with us, that of competitiveness.  If we at the  end  of

this  economic crisis are still as uncompetitive as before, then

I think we will be in dire straits.  Everyone of us  Government,

industries  and our people  must take this opportunity  to  make

ourselves trimmer and leaner to prepare for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Mexico last year and I found in Mexico most of the MNCs

were there.  They were there because Mexico was competitive  and

they  have  NAFTA  which  provides the  market.   So  a  lot  of

industries, especially electronic industries, some of  them  are

from Singapore, have moved to Mexico.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just came back from Europe over the weekend. I visited

Germany, France and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>

Austria.   Even in developed countries like Germany and  France,

they  are taking very drastic measures to revamp the industries,

to cut costs and they retrenched workers by the thousands.  Why?

Because  they  are  facing  competition  from  countries  within

Europe.   In  Austria, in fact, most of the big MNCs which  have

operations in Europe also have their plants there.  Some of them

even  put  their headquarters there.  The reason is because  the

Austrians'  wage  levels are lower than  most  of  Europe.   The

workforce is also intelligent and educated.  This is not only to

speak  of  Europe itself but Northern Ireland, for example,  and

Scotland.   Scotland and Northern Ireland together  account  for

45%  of  export of electronic equipment to EC.  So countries  in

Europe  and the US have other alternatives, not in Asia, but  in

Europe  and  in  their own continents.  If  we  are  to  attract

investments from these countries, then we must ourselves be more

competitive than countries in these continents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response is not just Government, because the Government does

not  make up the country.  The people make up the country.   The

Government  can have all the policies but if the people  do  not

respond, there is nothing the Government can do.  My message  to

Singaporeans is that we must adjust our abilities to meet  these

challenges.   We must acquire new knowledge and we must  respond

to  the  Government's call for retraining  on  new  ways  to  do

things.  All the people in the rest of the world are doing this.

If we are not doing that, we are in deep trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must also adjust our own living standards. We have

been  used  to years of high growth and high wage increases,  so

much  so  that we do not know what bad times are.  I think  many

people would not want to say this, but I will say this.  I think

we  have got to have some pain.  I think without pain, there can

be  no  incentive  to  improve.  I think  we  will  be  deluding

ourselves if we think that this recession will pass and everyone

of  us  will be better in the process.  We are not.   All of  us

will  suffer.   Some of us suffer less, some of us suffer  more.

The Government's duty

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>

is  to  help  those who cannot help themselves  and  make  their

suffering a bit more bearable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? It means that we probably have to eat into

our  savings  that we accumulated over the good years.   As  the

Prime  Minister  has said, instead of going  to  the  US  for  a

holiday,  go  to Bintan.  It is one-fifth the cost.   You  still

have  a  good holiday.  You still got some money left  for  your

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very dismayed when I read in the New Paper two weeks ago

that some children were saying, "I'm not going to take a cut  in

allowance,  because there is no recession yet."   This  kind  of

attitude, I think, has to change, because without the  pain,  we

are not likely to be galvanised into action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is in our favour? I think we still have a hardworking

workforce.   There is no denial about it and that has  been  our

selling  point all these years.  Our workforce has  been  ranked

number   one   or  two  consistently.   We  have   a   fantastic

infrastructure, equal to none.  Our educational institutions are

one   of   the  best,  if  not  the  best,  especially  in   the

technological  field.   So we can do a lot  of  things  to  help

ourselves.   The  question is whether we are prepared  to  avail

ourselves of this.  If our people can respond to the retraining,

to  the tightening of the belt and to live a frugal life instead

of  spending money on wasteful things and if we complement  this

with  the good fundamentals that the Government has put  out,  I

think  we  stand a very good chance in overcoming the recession.

That  is  not the problem.  The recession will be overcome  but,

more  important,  I think we should be able to face  the  future

stronger because we are dealing with a very fundamental problem,

that of surviving in the long term, not the short term.  For the

short term, all of us can do it.  But in the long term, we  have

got  to  be fit and able and the Government's duty is to  ensure

that we can do that and I hope that the people of Singapore will

come  together with the Government, change their lifestyles  and

work  towards the common good of bringing ourselves out of  this

recession,  leaner,  trimmer,  hungrier  and,  of  course,  more

productive.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

workers  shall  bear  the  brunt of  the  cost-cutting  measures

recommended  by  the  Committee on Singapore's  Competitiveness.

The  CSC has recommended a 15% wage cut from the 1997 level, 10%

of  which shall be from the employer's component of the CPF  and

the balance from the flexi-wage scheme part of the wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12th November this year, the National Wages Council

recommended  a  cut  of  5-8% of the  workers'  wages.   If  the

employers choose to cut workers' flexi-wage as high as 8%,  then

together  with the 10% cut in the employer's component  of  CPF,

the  workers can lose up to 15% of wages a month.   I  urge  the

Government to be slow in implementing these recommendations. The

workers already suffered once in 1985 when  Singapore went  into

a  recession.  At that time, the workers' wages suffered  a  15%

drop when 15% of the employers' CPF were cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported in the local press that for the first nine

months  of  the year, 20,000 workers were retrenched.   But  how

many  of  these workers are foreign workers?  I understand  that

MNCs  are  allowed  to hire as many as four foreign  workers  to

every  one  Singaporean  worker the  company  employs.   So  the

Minister  should make sure that the number of Singapore  workers

who  are  retrenched  is  significant  before  implementing  the

recommended wage cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my meet-the-people sessions in my constituency so far, I

do  not  have any resident coming to complain that he is out  of

job.  Employers should not be encouraged to jump the gun and cut

workers'  wages  prematurely, since there is  so  much  talk  of

cutting workers' wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC is in support of the 10% employers' CPF cut.

Instead of just recommending that 10% of the employers'  CPF  be

cut,  the NTUC should also recommend that the employees' CPF  be

cut  by an equivalent amount.  With the 10% employees' CPF  cut,

the  workers  can have more take-home pay.  This is particularly

important to single breadwinners in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>

family.  If there is only one spouse working in the family, that

family  often finds that it cannot make ends meet.   The  single

bread earner has to take on a part-time additional job which  he

may  not  be able to hold continuously.  The extra 10%  cash  in

lieu of a CPF reduction shall come in very handy.  Some will say

that in such a case, that worker will not have enough CPF in the

account to pay for his CPF monthly loan instalments.  In such  a

case,  I would say that the HDB as well as the Government should

give a helping hand. The HDB could restructure the mortgage loan

and  work out a longer repayment period.  If that does not  help

the  workers,  then the Government should step in  and  use  its

surpluses  collected  over the last 10  years  to  pay  for  the

workers' HDB monthly loan instalments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is reported to have accumulated $122 billion in

surpluses.  So setting aside $5 billion to help out our  workers

in  time  of  need is not asking too much of the Government.   I

would  say  that  the  Government owes a duty  to  the  nation's

workers  to  tide them over the next one or two years  when  the

recession  takes its worst toll.  The Government  can  charge  a

nominal  interest  rate of 2% and have the loans  secured  as  a

second mortgage after the HDB.  I am certain a scheme like  that

can  be worked out to help the workers since $5 billion is  less

than  5%  of the amount of the Government's surpluses  collected

over the years.  I wish the NTUC will support this suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the CSC has only recommended a reduction of the

levy  for  both  skilled and unskilled foreign  workers  in  the

manufacturing sector, but not for domestic maids.  I would  urge

the  Government  to  reduce the levy  of  all  foreign  workers,

including  domestic maids, by $100-$200 per month.  By  lowering

the  levy, employers shall pay less for foreign workers and this

should  be all right since foreign workers mostly work  in  jobs

which  local  workers are not willing to do so, for example,  in

the  construction  industry,  road works or  MRT  sites.   Local

workers shall thus not be deprived of their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the charges for electricity,

telecommunications and port services

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>

should be reduced.  I would further suggest that Singapore Power

stop  collecting  water conservation charges  and  also  not  to

collect  interest  and  penalties for late  payments  until  the

economic  crisis  is over.  The reason is that  electricity  and

water  consumers have placed sufficient deposits with  Singapore

Power in their accounts.  No interest is paid by Singapore Power

to  consumers  for  the use of their deposit  money.   Singapore

Power  can  use  the  interest earned from the  vast  amount  of

deposits placed with them by account holders over the past years

to offset the lost interest as a result of late payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the CSC that rentals for Jurong Town

Corporation  and Housing and Development Board land and  factory

rentals  should  be reduced.  I would further suggest  that  the

sale price of new HDB flats should also be reduced, since prices

of   building   materials  and  building  costs   have   dropped

significantly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also agree with the CSC that motor vehicle customs

duty and petrol diesel duty be reduced, and the 55% property tax

rebate  be  extended.  I would also support  the  suspension  of

stamp  duty  on  share transactions and to lower  corporate  and

personal income tax.  In these hard times, I would also call  on

the  Prime  Minister  and his Ministers to voluntarily  take  at

least  a  25% pay cut.  I understand that in the private sector,

many workers are suffering a freeze on their salaries and others

are  taking a 20% cut on their pay.  It is reported that company

directors  are  taking  a  50% cut  on  their  directors'  fees.

Singapore  Ministers are reputed to be the highest paid  in  the

world.  So a 25% cut on the Ministers' salary shall still  leave

them with a lot to live on comfortably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers are top leaders of the country and a significant

gesture on their part in these difficult times shall be a  great

boost  to the morale of the whole country.  The Ministers should

take  a  pay cut at this point of time.  An act like that  shall

jell  the  whole  nation, as they can  say  that  they  lead  by

example.   They  really show solidarity with the workers.   They

have a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>

genuine feel for the people. The Ministers have gone down to the

NTUC  and tell them, "United we stand." Such a pronouncement  on

the  part  of Ministers sounds hollow if they do not  share  the

sufferings  of  the  workers who are  expected  to  take  a  15%

reduction in their monthly wage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people also are complaining about the 3% GST imposed

on  all  goods and services. They want the Government to suspend

GST  for  the time being until the financial crisis is over.   I

hope the Government can give a positive response.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to comment on the CSC's vision for

Singapore  in the next decade.  It wants Singapore to become  an

advanced  globally competitive knowledge economy.  I  quote  the

CSC's Report:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We should be a knowledge economy where the basis for

competitiveness  will  be  the  capabilities  and   intellectual

capital to absorb, process and apply knowledge.  We should  have

a  strong technological capability and a vibrant entrepreneurial

culture that thrives on creativity, nimbleness and good business

sense. To develop into a knowledge economy, Singapore should  be

an  open  cosmopolitan society, attractive to global talent  and

connected with other global  knowledge nodes.  There should be a

critical mass of Singaporeans who are risk-taking entrepreneurs,

innovators  and arbitrageurs.  Together with the global  talent,

they will move Singapore ahead in the Information Age."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I entirely agree with this vision. In Japan they had this

similar  vision,  ie, to develop a knowledge economy   in  1992.

The  problem  in  Japan which hindered the  attainment  of  this

vision  was  their  culture  of  bureaucratic  leadership.   The

bureaucratic civil servants run the country.  It is said that in

Japan  the  measures adopted under bureaucratic leadership  were

aimed not at development for the future, but maintenance of  the

status quo.  Can Singapore attain a knowledge economy within the

next  decade?   I  personally  think  that  we  cannot  do   so.

Singapore is worse than Japan.  We do not only have a culture of

bureaucratic  leadership but we have in place  a  dominant  one-party  rule  that  is  bent  in  perpetuating  its  rule.    The

organisation  of  the  whole  of  Singapore  is  such  that  the

leadership  must  come from the party or the top.   In  the  CSC

Report, at page 118, it is mentioned:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The World Competitiveness Yearbook indicated that

Singapore  has  adopted a centralised, top-down  decision-making

approach in government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt that the PAP will change its style or form of

Government.   It  wants a firm control of the country.   On  the

other hand, the CSC envisages that in a knowledge economy "there

should  be  a  critical mass of Singaporeans who are risk-taking

entrepreneurs,  innovators  and  arbitrageurs".   In  the  first

place,  will the present PAP political system allow a  group  of

Singaporeans   a  critical  mass  of  leaders  who   can   think

independently and develop independently?  I do not think so.   I

make  this assessment after having been in politics in Singapore

for  22 years and an elected MP for 14 years.  Just look at  all

aspects  of  the Singapore society, whether it be  in  business,

sports, culture or social activities, you see a PAP Minister,  a

PAP  MP  or a PAP man in charge.  So nationally I cannot  see  a

critical mass of Singaporeans who are risk-taking entrepreneurs,

innovators and arbitrageurs to emerge unless, of course, we have

a  reformation,  a  material change  in  the  political  system.

Instead of a one-party rule, we have democratic pluralism, maybe

a  two-party system and the Government of the day behaves  in  a

more  traditional way, ie, to collect taxes,  maintain  internal

security,  external  defence, foreign  policies  and  leave  the

commerce and business to its private citizens.  It is only under

such  a  system  where Singaporeans are given more  freedom  can

truly great, great business leaders emerge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the CSC Report has missed one important issue, and

that  is, our relationship with our closest neighbour, Malaysia.

Malaysia  is  Singapore's most important trading  partner.   Our

water  supply  is also from Malaysia.  For the long  term  well-being  of  our economy, Singapore must enter into some  kind  of

economic  relationship with Malaysia which benefits both  sides.

I  have  suggested in this House that Singapore seek an economic

union  with  Malaysia.  The CSC Report  has  mentioned  that  "A

limited  domestic market poses a serious impediment to expansion

and  constrains investment in equipment, technology  and  modern

management methods."  If

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  can bring about an economic union with Malaysia,  the

problem  of  our small size or limited domestic  market  can  be

solved.   But  the ultimate aim of our economic union  must  not

only  be for the benefit of Singapore, it must be for the mutual

benefit  of both countries.  I call on the Government to  strive

for an economic union with Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  recall  a  conversation I had 10 years  ago  with  the  Chief

Executive Officer of a very huge Japanese multi-national because

I  wanted  to  understand the bottoms-up  philosophy  among  the

Japanese workers.  And he told me, "It is not as simple  as  you

think  because normally workers will be told what their  leaders

want and they will know what to do."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in these economic tough times, it is

heartening to learn that Singaporeans understand and accept  the

need  for painful wage cuts.  Dr Yaacob Ibrahim summed up  these

sentiments  very well in The New Paper of 18th  November  and  I

would  like  to  quote him here:  "The general feeling  is  that

people understand and accept that there must be wage cuts.  They

are  glad  to  have a job that pays less, than no job  at  all."

Yes,  isn't it better to have a job that pays less, than to have

no  job  at all?  But I would also like to stress that  what  is

very  important is that most Singaporeans today still hold their

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for us, Mr Speaker, the prudent policies and

financial  foresight of our Government have spared  us  from  an

economic  meltdown of Titanic proportions.  We  should  be  glad

that  our Government and people did not see our economy  as  the

Titanic's captain, crew and passengers did their ship  in  1912.

It  has  happened, it will happen again if we are  not  careful.

So,  therefore, it is worthwhile to recall that voyage  made  by

the   Titanic  and  its  maiden  voyage  that  was  filled  with

exhilaration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits were high, the air was heavy with excitement and

jubilation.   The  crew  and  the  well-heeled  passengers  were

fortified in their belief that they were on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>

the safest ship ever built in the world.  They all looked to the

ship  as unsinkable, just as many governments, corporations  and

people  in  this part of the world looked at their economies  as

though these economies were invulnerable.  The celebratory  mood

among  the passengers continued into the voyage and as the  ship

sailed  towards its destination, the passengers wined and dined.

They  indulged in pleasures without a care in the world  -  just

like  some governments, some corporations and people around  the

world, especially this region, preoccupying themselves with mega-borrowings and spendings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passengers on board the Titanic were enjoying themselves to

the  extent  that they were blinded to the fact  that  the  ship

could  be  in danger.  When warning signals became apparent  and

the  captain  was  told of them, he dismissed those  dangers  as

nothing  more  than nuisances, as he did not  believe  that  the

Titanic could be in trouble.  As the danger became more and more

apparent, the captain and the people on board still chose not to

heed  it  but  carried  on with their preoccupations.   Finally,

because  of  their over-confidence and slowness  to  react,  the

Titanic went smack into real danger - just like what happened to

many countries and many economies in this part of the world that

were caught unawares by the quick rises and falls of the markets

caused  by  the  way  money was transacted at  lightning  speeds

around the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, amidst this current regional economic crisis,

Singapore's economy has also been affected.  While we  have  not

emerged  unharmed, fortunately, we have not been seen  as  badly

hit  as our neighbours.  Hopefully, with the recommendations  of

the  CSC,  we will be able to avoid the worst and pick ourselves

up again as quickly as possible, and be in the front of the race

when others are still picking themselves up.  While figures show

that some 40,000 are expected to be retrenched by the end of the

year,  I think we are still relatively fortunate.  The estimates

are not very much higher.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>

Meanwhile, the CDCs (Community Development Councils) will do all

they  can to find as many jobs as possible, to ferret them  out,

so that they will be able to find alternative jobs for those who

lose  their jobs or are being retrenched.  For instance, in  the

case  of  Marine  Parade  district,  last  year,  we  helped  30

Singaporeans to find jobs; this year, in 1998 up to  now,  about

700 jobs.  So who says that there is no one Singaporean that has

lost his job?  Thanks here to Ministry of Manpower, NTUC, ADECCO

(ADECCO   is   a  private  international  employment  assistance

company),   and  MDIS  (Management  Development   Institute   of

Singapore).  In fact, these two private organisations have  done

more  than  their fair share.  What they have done  actually  is

also  to organise courses so that workers who choose not  to  go

immediately  into  another employment  can  also  choose  to  be

trained or retrained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I said at the outset that the most important

point  is  that  the majority of Singaporeans are  still  having

their  jobs.   And I think that this is a very important  point,

and  I attribute this to the kiasu attitude of Singaporeans  and

the  Government.  Contrary to common perception,  kiasuism  need

not  necessarily be bad.  Who says it is bad?  It  is  bad  only

when  it  makes the Singaporeans ugly - when they become greedy,

self-centred,  selfish, envious, discourteous  and  unkind.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  certainly do not want to be  like  what  the

economist,  Mr  E. F. Schumacher, said in his  book,  "Small  is

Beautiful".  Allow me to quote him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If human vices such as greed and envy are systematically

cultivated,  the  inevitable  result  is  nothing  less  than  a

collapse  of  intelligence.  A man driven by greed  or  by  envy

loses  the power of seeing things as they really are, of  seeing

things  in  their roundness and their wholeness,  and  his  very

successes become failures.  If the whole society become infected

by  these vices, they may indeed achieve astonishing things  but

they   become  increasingly  incapable  of  solving   the   most

elementary problems of everyday existence."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we must not allow selfishness, greed, anger to take

priority   over   more  important  and  serious   issues.    The

recommendations put up by the CSC, taken in the  right  attitude

and  casting self-interest aside, could, I believe, bring us out

of troubled waters and help us weather whatever storms that come

in future and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>

ride them out confidently.  Therefore, these recommendations can

be seen as worthy kiasu measures to ensure our self-preservation

and  success.   We should see the recommendations  as  something

that  is good for all Singaporeans.  And so I would like to urge

every  Singaporean  to  see  it  in  its  big  picture,  because

squabbling  and quarrelling must be avoided at  all  costs.   We

should  channel our energies into ensuring that we pull  through

these tough times and not wallow in them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, so far we are all right. If we had been

managed by a different band of less than capable people, then  I

think we would find ourselves in an entirely different position.

Yes,  we are small, and small is indeed beautiful, but only when

it  is  properly managed.  We have a combination of  both.   The

beauty  of being small in Singapore is that we can reach out  to

every  corner  of  Singapore and be kept up-to-  date  with  the

latest goings-on.  After all, we all do that, don't we?  We walk

our little corner of the island on weekends, we go from home  to

home talking to our residents, learning from them, listening  to

them,  finding out what they want, what help they need  or  what

help  they  don't need.  So, in a situation like  what  we  have

today,  we are able to confidently assess and describe  how  our

people  are  doing  and have our fingers on  the  pulse  of  the

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, take Mountbatten, we were concerned with how our

people are faring in this economic crisis, because they all have

been  moved from rental flats into 4- or 5-room flats, new ones,

expensive  ones too.  I guess we must have walked a few  hundred

homes  over  a couple of months and I am relieved to  know  that

many  of  them are still able to maintain their homes, they  are

able  to pay their SC&C charges, their monthly instalments,  and

so  on.   But this brings out a very important point.   Most  of

these  people who have moved into new flats, they are living  in

extended families.  You have your grandmother, your grandfather,

your father, your mother, your brothers, sisters, and so on, and

when  one  person  gets retrenched, the  others  chip  in.   The

strength and virtue of the extended family

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>

is  still  very  strong.  But there is a  present  tendency  for

families  to  break  out into nuclear families.   Therefore,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the challenge in the 21st century is to find  ways

and  means  to  see how we can keep family support  healthy  and

firmly  in  place, so that people will remain safe not  only  in

times of crisis but also in better times as well.

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin Hock)</b>

<b></b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion in the

name of the Minister for Trade and Industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 31st August 1985, Mr Lim Boon Heng and I moved a motion

in this House  to discuss and debate the state of the economy at

that  time.  13 years later, we are once again debating the same

kind of issues.  This should serve as a reminder to Singaporeans

that economic development and prosperity should not be taken for

granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me speak generally on short-term measures and

long-term  strategies.  In  this region,  the  present  economic

crisis  was  sparked  off by a financial turmoil.  It  is  quite

natural  that everyone is concerned with how to manage, regulate

and supervise over the short term capital flows.   But in nature

and  concept,  capital  flows  and trade  flows  are  different.

Measures  on capital flows, especially on speculative short-term

capital  flows, should not derail long-term objectives of  trade

liberalisation.  The plan for a free

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>

trade area, whether it is in the Asia-Pacific or in ASEAN,  must

be persistently pushed forward  for implementation as planned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in Singapore, the Committee on Singapore's

Competitiveness  (CSC)  Report  also  covered  both   short-term

measures  and  long-term  strategies.   But  the  two  types  of

measures  should  not  be  confused and  mixed   together.   The

Straits  Times  editorial on 13th November mentioned  that   the

long-term  and  short-term recommendations  taken  together  may

confuse the public.  This is totally unnecessary.  The Committee

was  established  in  May 1997  to review  Singapore's  economic

competitiveness over the next 10 years.  But two  months  later,

in  July  1997, the region was taken by surprise by a  financial

turmoil  which  turned into an economic crisis.  Therefore,  the

CSC had to recommend short-term measures to deal with the impact

of  this crisis on Singapore's economy.  To put it simply,  even

without  the  present regional economic crisis, we  should  also

study and take stock of our economic achievements in the last 12

years,  and  understand our strengths and weaknesses  so  as  to

formulate our economic development strategy for the future.   We

should understand and realise that even before this crisis,  the

relative  unit labour cost (RULC) has been rising,  and  we  are

gradually losing our competitive edge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the short-term measures, we must first reflect on the

problems, cope with the changes in order to tide over the crisis

(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Economic

competitiveness is decided by a number of factors, including (1)

cost;  (2)  productivity;  and (3)  the  exchange  rate  of  the

Singapore dollar against other currencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, let me raise three issues: first, productivity and

exchange  rate.  The Committee recommends cost-cutting and  also

emphasises  on  the  need  to  develop  human  and  intellectual

capital,  and  leverage on science, technology  and  innovation.

All  these measures expand our capacity building and improve our

productivity so as to strengthen our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>

long-term  competitiveness.   However,  the  Committee  has  not

clearly analysed and explained why the S$ depreciation is not  a

viable  option to deal with the current economic  crisis.   Some

academicians,  businessmen  and others  still  believe  that  S$

depreciation  is the easiest way out.  With depreciation  of  S$

currency,  we  may be able to avoid wage cut and  other  painful

market  adjustments.   But we must also  realise  and  face  the

consequences of S$ depreciation, for example, prices of imported

goods  and  services from equipment, spare parts  to  food  will

increase;  the value of our CPF savings and other assets  in  S$

terms  will  decline, and our position as a financial  hub  will

also  be  adversely  impacted.  I am glad that the Minister  for

Trade  and Industry had just mentioned this point in his speech.

But  when we talk to the community leaders, trade unionists  and

the  people, we must reiterate the explanation of this issue  on

S$ depreciation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is cost-cutting. In general, the unions

have  already  accepted the recommendations of the Committee  to

cut  wage  cost.  We should all remember that this  is  not  the

first  time that the CPF is cut; and this is also not the  first

time  that  the employees suffer a pay-cut.  The  CSC  has  also

recommended  that the Government should cut down non-wage  costs

such   as   rentals,   service  charges   on   electricity   and

communication, and port charges.  The private sector  must  take

similar  measures to cut cost.  They should cut  their  rentals,

interests, transport charges and other non-wage costs.  In terms

of  wage  cost,  for  companies which are not  doing  well,  the

management  should  make downward adjustment  of  the  directors

fees,  and the pay and allowances of management staff.   On  the

other  hand,  for  companies which are doing well,  they  should

continue  to  give their employees what they deserve.   In  this

area, we should consider two concrete measures: (1) when we  can

cut  down  the  variable  component  of  wage  and  salary,  the

magnitude  of the cut for the lower-income employees  should  be

less  than that of the managerial and executive staff;  and  (2)

the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>

should  consider  giving assistance package to the  lower-income

group,  eg,  in  the  form  of rental,  S&C  charges,  utilities

rebates, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unions, business community, Government and Parliament

unanimously  accept these cost-cutting measures,  this  resolute

decision  will  send  a strong signal to the  market  and  boost

investors'  confidence  on Singapore.  This  will  have  a  very

positive and decisive effect on our economic recovery.   Looking

around the world, very few  governments can propose reduction in

wages  and  welfare benefits of the employees without causing  a

boycott  and  protest from the trade unions, or even  causing  a

political turmoil. Our people of Singapore, especially the union

members,  understand  the  whole  macro-economic  situation   of

Singapore  and  the long term implications of our  economy,  and

they have gallantly agreed to make the necessary adjustments and

sacrifices.  The union members should be commended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current economic crisis has given rise to a sense of

anxiety (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), a sense of crisis, and the

expectation  of good Government leadership.  If we can  overcome

the present difficulties within a short time, the cohesion among

the  people will be strengthened and the bond between the people

and  the  Government will be further consolidated.  A few  years

later, when we look back at the current economic crisis, we will

say  that when it comes to the crunch, we the common people have

made  the necessary adjustments and painful sacrifices,  thereby

enabling  our  economy to recover, and that our  Government  has

once again led us out of the valley of economic recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue is tax cuts. The CSC has also recommended

that  the  Government  reduce tax rates or give rebates  on  the

personal  income tax, company tax and foreign worker levy.   Tax

cuts  take place after economic returns and are below the bottom

line, while cost cuts take place before economic returns and are

above the bottom line. Tax cuts will help stimulate investments,

encourage  hard  work  and strengthen the  propensity  to  save.

Strictly speaking, tax cuts are not cost

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>

cutting measures.  In tax cuts, some people, including Mr  Chiam

See   Tong,  seem  to  focus  their  attention  on  the  GST   (

).   They  proposed that the Government should  abolish  GST  or

reduce the GST rate.  In fact, GST is not part of business  cost

(apart  from some administrative costs).  Businessmen  are  only

tax  collection agents for the Government, and if  their  annual

business  turnover is less than $1 million, businesses need  not

collect GST, unless they volunteer to register as GST collection

agents.  Those who think that GST will add to business costs are

wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion on how GST would affect consumption expenditure

is  more  relevant.  But here, we must pay attention  to  a  few

points:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the import linkages, that is to say, most of our

consumer  goods  from  food to electrical  home  appliances  are

imported.  Secondly, our domestic market is very small.  Private

consumption  expenditure  accounted  for  only  40%   of   total

expenditure, whereas the Government consumption expenditure  was

only  9%.  Mr Leong Horn Kee said that the proposed CPF and wage

cuts  of  $7  billion  would lead to a loss  of  $7  billion  in

consumption  expenditure is incorrect.  Further, the GST rate is

only  3%.  In Europe, the rate is between 13% and 25%.  In Asian

countries  like  Japan, Korea and Taiwan, their consumption  tax

rates  are much higher than that of Singapore.  The other  point

is  that  when  GST was first introduced in 1994, the Government

had  cut  income  tax  and property tax,  and  gave  rebates  on

rentals,  S&C  charges   for  the  lower-income  families.   The

difference  between  GST  revenue  and  revenue  loss   by   the

Government  from the tax cuts and expenditure on the package  of

rebates is pretty narrow. In other words, GST is revenue-neutral

or  even  negative.  Based  on these reasons,  from  the  macro-economic perspective, the stimulative effect from a cut  in  GST

on our consumption expenditure cannot be substantial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, more attention must be given to our long-term

economic strategies.  The strategies should be to develop

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>

our full potential so as to launch into the next phase (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). If we cannot maintain our competitiveness, and if we cannot

catch  up  and  deal with the market and technological  changes,

then  the world will forge ahead and leave us behind.   The  CSC

has  recommended  a  twin-engine  growth,  ie,  to  develop  our

manufacturing and service industries together at the same  time.

It is a good and sound strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we must also develop our own MNCs. We

must   help our promising SMEs.  We must face one harsh  reality

that  our  economy is gradually transforming into  a  knowledge-based economy.  The labour intensive, low-value added industries

and  activities will eventually be phased out.   Jobs  that  are

related  to such industries and activities will also be lost  in

due  course.  Therefore, our employers, entrepreneurs, employees

and   indeed  all  Singaporeans  must  prepare  to   face   this

unavoidable economic restructuring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of our economic structure, two-thirds of our demands are from external sector. The sharp fall

in  external  demand is the main cause of our  current  economic

recession.   We  must develop overseas markets,  strengthen  our

regionalisation, and look out for new markets and new commercial

opportunities  to  stimulate demand and  diversify  the  demand.

These  measures  are  crucial and must be implemented.   On  the

supply  side,  education,  training, technology  and  innovation

would  expand  and  build  up  our  capacity  and  upgrade   our

capability.    I  agree  with  the CSC's  view  that  we  should

treasure our limited resources, especially land and talents, and

ensure that they are put to optimum use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Committee has also referred to the role of the

Government.   The  Government should  review  its  role  in  the

production  domain,  whether the Government  should  only  be  a

facilitator or should participate directly in production through

the  Government-linked companies (GLCs). The crucial point  here

is whether the GLCs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>

or  private enterprises can all withstand the test of the market

by making profits and getting the targetted returns.   As to who

owns these companies, it is of secondary importance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to side-track to comment on Mr Chiam See

Tong's  point made just now that the PAP has dominated virtually

every   field   in  Singapore  so  that  people   cannot   think

independently  and cannot develop themselves.   He  was  hinting

that this could be one reason why we are not able to develop our

entrepreneurs.  This reminds me of two points.  Firstly, let  me

point  out to him that the CSC members, apart from two Ministers

and  one  Minister of State, the others are not  linked  to  the

Government.   Secondly, in Hong Kong,  a  very  popular  tabloid

"Apple  Daily"  carried a report with a  big  headline  on  13th

November  1998: "Singapore is unable to produce a Li Ka  Shing".

However,  the newspaper was at least fair in pointing  out  that

Singapore   and  Hong  Kong  have  their  own   advantages   and

weaknesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whatever strategy we may select to develop

our  economy,  our  people, unions, business community  and  the

Government  should always stay together and move  ahead  in  one

heart (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). As the Minister for Finance

once  mentioned, our collective organisational  ability  is  our

competitive edge.  In this increasingly competitive  world  that

we  are living in, if we can maintain this competitive edge  and

keep  one  step ahead of our competitors, then our economy  will

continue to grow steadily, and our people will be able to  enjoy

a rising standard of living.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June this year, the Government introduced a $2 billion

off-Budget package to stimulate Singapore's economy.   Now,  the

Committee   of  Singapore's  Competitiveness  (CSC)  has   again

introduced a cost-reduction package with the hope that  business

costs  in  Singapore can be reduced by S$10 billion in the  next

year.  In

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>

other words, since June this year, the Government has introduced

altogether packages worth S$12 billion to help the businesses to

deal  with  the  imminent predicament they are  facing,  and  to

minimise  further job losses.  I personally feel  that  the  CSC

should  be  commended  for  being so  resolute  in  making  this

recommendation to reduce our business cost so that we could have

a proper direction for our economic development over the next 10

years and for giving us a series of strategies for our long-term

development.   The Committee does not recommend  devaluation  of

the  Singapore dollar to solve the problem.  This  is  indeed  a

very wise decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I heard Mr Chiam See Tong saying

that   despite   the  economic  crisis,  no  resident   in   his

constituency came to his meet-the-people session for  assistance

in  getting  a  job. I believe in the present  economic  crisis,

there is no lack of people who have lost their jobs, but they do

not go to Mr Chiam See Tong because they do not believe Mr Chiam

could   help them to secure jobs.  They would rather go straight

to  the Ministry of Manpower for help.  This is a more practical

thing for them to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now Mr Chiam See Tong mentioned that the Government should

not reduce the employer's CPF contribution.  I do not agree with

him.   In  his view, so long as we reduce Government taxes,  our

economic  problem  can be resolved.  The  problem  is  not  that

simple.   If  our  workers do not take a cut in  their  CPF  and

wages, then it will give the foreigners the impression that  our

workers  do  not  support the Government's effort  to  help  the

economy,  and they will have no confidence in us.  They will not

come here to invest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and the people should be united in one heart

during  this economic crisis and to send the correct signal   to

our foreign investors.  So I believe what Mr Chiam said just now

is  not correct.  It may be just a political stunt to please his

Potong Pasir voters.  Just now he said that there should  be  an

economic alliance between Singapore and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>

Malaysia.  I do not think this is feasible because no matter how

we  unite  with  Malaysia, it would not be as effective  as  the

larger  regional forum such as APEC.  I support the  CSC  Report

but I have a few suggestions for  the Government to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we should try to reduce more non-wage costs.

The CSC has recommended reduction in some non-wage costs such as

rentals, utilities, telephone bills and taxes, etc.  But I  hope

that  the  Government departments and the private sector  should

try  their  best to reduce more non-wage costs including   items

which are not mentioned in the Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I received this Report from the CSC, the first thing I

noticed was that   the book was very beautifully printed and the

paper quality is excellent.  On the one hand, the Government  is

advocating reduction in business costs.  On the other hand, they

seem to have forgotten that they should also try to save cost in

its operations.  You may notice that for this 186-page Report, a

thick  paper  of not less than 120 gm was used, with  two-colour

and four-colour printing and large font size, which are superior

to the textbooks used by our secondary students.  In my opinion,

the  production cost of this book can be easily  reduced  by  at

least  50%.   Therefore, I feel that Government departments  and

the  private  enterprises should not  spend  so  much  money  in

producing fanciful  annual reports.  They should be made  simple

and  extravagant high profile presentation should be avoided  as

it will increase their business cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest that when senior officers from the

public  and  private sectors go on official trips  abroad,  they

should  travel  by  economy  class instead  of  first  class  or

business class.   As for entertainment, I agree with Prof. Tommy

Koh's  view  that  the number of courses in our Chinese  dinners

should  be  reduced from eight dishes to six dishes.  This  will

save cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole package introduced by the CSC has been weighted

towards  helping the manufacturing and the retailing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>

industries  to reduce their business costs.  However,  there  is

one   thing  that  I  think  the  CSC  has  neglected,  ie,  the

advertising  cost.  Many manufacturers and retailers  have  been

using  the television or newspapers to advertise their  products

and  services.   According to a survey conducted by the  Temasek

Polytechnic recently, more than 32% of male Singaporeans  learnt

of news about new products or services through advertisements in

the newspapers and about 26% of female Singaporeans learnt about

sales and special offers through newspapers.  This clearly shows

that it is very important for the manufacturers and retailers to

advertise their products and services.  I suggest that  TCS  and

the  newspapers should also reduce their advertising fees during

these difficult times to help businesses cut their costs.   When

the  businessmen  calculate their costs, they naturally  include

the  advertising cost into their business costs,  and eventually

it will be the consumers who are paying for it.   Therefore,   I

suggest  that  for advertisements on sundry goods and  essential

daily  goods  by, say, NTUC FairPrice and other supermarkets,  a

discount   shall  be  given   in  the  advertising  fees.    The

advertisers  can then pass on their savings from the advertising

cost  to   the  consumers by offering these essential  goods  at

cheaper  prices.   This  will help to bring  down  the  cost  of

living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should not cut the salaries or CPF

contributions  of   the employees from the lower  income  group.

The  CSC  suggests that the total  wage cost be reduced by  15%,

ie,  10%  from employer's CPF contribution and 5-8% from  wages.

I  feel  that for the low-income employees, the reduction should

be  less.   And  for  the executive and senior  officers,  their

salaries can  be reduced by a larger margin.  For those who  are

living  in  1-  and 2-room flats, their average combined  family

income  is  only about S$800 per month.  So if we are having  an

across-the-board  percentage deduction  in  salary,  these  low-income families will suffer.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower income ordinary citizens may not be able to

enjoy some of the rebates on  property tax, foreign worker levy,

stamp  duty  for  share transfers and petrol tax,  etc,  because

these  items do not involve them in the first place.    Most  of

them  do  not  pay  any income tax anyway.  I  think  for  those

families whose combined income is less than S$800, we should not

reduce their CPF contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I propose that retrenched workers from the lower

income families should be allowed to withdraw part of their  CPF

savings  to  tide  over the difficult times. I  think  maybe  we

should  consider allowing retrenched workers from families  with

combined  income of less than $800 per month to  withdraw,  say,

S$150  per  month  from their CPF account for  a  period  of  12

months.  In other words, the maximum they could withdraw is only

S$1,800  but to them this may be the straw they can hold  on  to

tide over the difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should reschedule the instalment payments of

shopowners  and  hawker  stallholders.   Many  existing  tenants

bought  over their shops or stalls under the "Shop For Everyone"

Scheme  introduced by HDB some years ago.  With business so  bad

now, they are having problems serving their loan instalments.  I

hope  that the HDB would reschedule the loan repayment or  maybe

suspend  their payment for one year so that they could  continue

to pay after the crisis is over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many hawkers are also having the same predicament. I think

the  Government should also help them.  I also suggest that  the

Government  should consider reducing the rentals for  the  shops

and hawker stalls in the HDB estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we should provide capital assistance to our

promising  local  enterprises which have  the  potential  to  go

regional.  The CSC has recommended eight major strategies.  I am

in  particular agreement with three  of them, ie, to  strengthen

the  external wing, to build world-class local companies and  to

strengthen  our  base  of  small and medium  local  enterprises.

From  the  perspective of long-term development,  using  foreign

economies to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>

supplement  the  growth of the domestic economy is  a  practical

strategy.   At  the  same  time, while strengthening  the  local

enterprises, it will also provide the Singapore economy  with  a

new impetus for growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Government consider granting some loans or

financial  assistance  to  local  enterprises  which  have   the

potential to go regional.  For example, we may allow them to use

their   company's  shares  as  collateral  for  mortgage  loans.

Promising   local  enterprises may  have  the  potential  to  go

regional, but  they may not be able to secure bank loans  during

this  economic crisis.  Many banks which have previously granted

loans  to  companies or enterprises to invest  in  Malaysia  and

Indonesia  are  having  problems recovering  their  loans.  Once

bitten twice shy. The banks are having this phobia whenever they

hear that the companies are going regional.  Nowadays, when  you

talk  to  the banks about regionalisation, they are  simply  not

interested.   So if the Government could  give these companies a

helping  hand,  it  will help them to go  regional  earlier  and

faster,   and  will  go  a  long way  in  building  these  local

enterprises into  world class companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, more business information should be provided to

the   businesses  in  Singapore  at  this  time   where   prompt

international  business information is of utmost importance.   I

think  MTI  should be able to provide more ready information  to

our businesses.  This is more effective than conducting overseas

tours for our trade delegations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we should start to plan a second package to save

our  economy  from  future  crisis.   Some  people  are  of  the

impression that the present package of $12 billion to  help  our

local  enterprises  may  not  be enough  to  save  our  economy.

However,  if  the international economic situation  deteriorates

rapidly, the future will be most unpredictable.  If we wait  for

the  worst  to happen before planning  for a second  package  to

save  our  economy,  it will be too late.   I  think  we  should

prepare well in advance. I believe the CSC took more than a year

to come out with this Report.  Therefore, we should start now to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>

plan  a  second package as a contingency plan against any future

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I wish to seek a clarification from

the Member for Jalan Besar.  Can he please let me know whether I

heard  him correctly?  He said that I did not get people  coming

to  see me at my meet-the-people session because I could not get

jobs for them.  Is my understanding of what he said correct?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now I was referring to

Mr  Chiam's remark that no retrenched worker had come to see him

at his meet-the-people session for help to find another job.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I did not quite get his clarification.

Can  he please tell me whether my interpretation of what he said

was correct?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Peh has just explained to you.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> That I could not get jobs for people

who came to look for me.  If that were true, then I would object

to what he said.  That would be alluding to me to be incompetent

as  I am unable to do things for my residents.  I would like  to

remind  Mr  Peh that I am not a first-time MP.  Residents  there

have  elected me not once, twice or thrice, but four times.   It

shows that I have performed.  So on what basis is he saying that

I  cannot get jobs for my residents if they come to me?  I think

he  should withdraw that statement.  It is a slur on my  ability

to help my constituents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that

Mr  Chiam  See  Tong is a veteran  MP.  In fact, I respect  him.

Unfortunately, after all these years in Parliament,  Mr  Chiam's

Chinese  has  not improved much.  He did not understand  what  I

said just now.  Let me ask him very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>

slowly.   Mr  Chiam  See Tong, did you say  that  no  retrenched

worker  had  approached you at your meet-the-people session  for

help to find another job?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Of course, I did. I made a plain

statement  like  that  just to illustrate that  the  problem  of

unemployment  is not so serious in Potong Pasir.  There  are  no

people coming in a rush to ask for help to get jobs.  If they do

come,  and if there are complaints that I am unable to get  them

jobs,  then it is fair for Mr Peh to say, "Look, they have  come

to  look  for  jobs from you.  They do not want  to  come  again

because every time you fail to get them jobs."  I think that  is

fair  enough.   But  before  that  happens,  he  comes  to  that

conclusion,  which  is  a  slur on  my  competence  to  help  my

residents.  He should take back what he has said.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you for clarifying.

Since the residents in Potong Pasir did not make any request  to

Mr  Chiam See Tong as their Member of Parliament to look  for  a

job  when they are retrenched, the retrenchment problem  is  not

very  serious  in Potong Pasir.   As MP for Jalan  Besar,  every

week  I meet my people, and there are many constituents who come

to  me  for  help to look for a new job because of retrenchment.

But  the residents in Potong Pasir did not see him.  Maybe these

people went direct to the Ministry of Manpower to look for jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I am a first-time MP, but

I  would  like to make a reference to what Mr Chiam said earlier

about  wage cuts.  He said that our workers would have to endure

up to 18% cut in wages.  Let me just correct him because quite a

lot  of information has been given out to our workers during the

dialogue  sessions and speeches.  I think Mr  Chiam  might  have

confused  between  a  10 percentage cut in  the  employers'  CPF

contribution and a 10% wage cut.  What we are going to have is a

10  percentage  point  cut  in the CPF  contribution,  and  that

constitutes about 8.3% of wages.  With the proposal of  the  NWC

for  a 5-8% cut in other forms of wages, we could have up to 16%

cut in wages, but do not forget, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>

have to subtract from that figure a wage increase of between  2%

and  4% that we have enjoyed at the beginning of the year.  That

is  just  to correct the wrong impression that might  have  been

created  by what Mr Chiam said earlier.  So it is very important

that  we  get  our  facts right even if you have  all  the  good

intentions so that we do not confuse the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the union leaders saw the trend of increasing

retrenchments  over  the  past  one  year  or  so,  they   asked

themselves: Will it affect our members and, if so,  when?   What

will  be  the impact on their families? And what can be done  by

the three social tripartite partners to buck the trend?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that during the economic downturn our employers

in   general  asked:  How  to  cut  costs  in  order  to  regain

competitiveness?  When will we recover?  How can the workers and

Government help to achieve it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government on its part wants to ensure that the economy

remains  healthy, companies remain viable, unemployment is  kept

small,  and  hardship due to the loss of jobs is controlled  and

overcome.   Two key points in the mind of the Government,  I  am

sure,   are  that  Singapore  remains  stable  politically   and

investors' confidence towards Singapore is kept high and further

enhanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the union leaders and workers, I am glad

that  our  workers  are  pragmatic  and  responsible  enough  to

understand  that  they have to make short term  sacrifices,  for

longer term gains.  They have accepted the need for wage cuts in

order   to  save  their  jobs.   By  accepting  to  make   these

sacrifices, our workers have shown that they are willing to play

their  part to help ensure that their companies do not  need  to

close  down  and that Singapore remains an attractive investment

destination  in  order to create more jobs for  their  children.

This  is a case of our workers showing their willingness to take

a  smaller  share  of  the pie when the pie  itself  has  become

smaller.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, let me, if I may, recall and emphasise the

purpose of the cost-cutting exercise.  The objective is to help

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>

companies  remain  viable  and  competitive  and  not  to   make

companies to profit from wage cuts, including CPF cut, per se.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the economic crisis affects the bottom line of

employers, there will exist some companies which are not in  the

red,  and  which are still able to stay afloat and make  profits

even if there were no CPF cut.  I urge these companies to pass a

part  of  the  savings from the CPF cut back to  their  workers.

This  can  be done in a variety of ways, for example, through  a

one-off  year-end bonus, or variable monthly payment, or  simply

by  topping up their employees' CPF accounts.  This  will  be  a

much  needed  boost  for those who rely  heavily  on  their  CPF

savings to pay for their housing.  Alternatively, employers  can

pay   a   performance-related  incentive  to  encourage  further

improvement in workers' productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to caution that we should not

resort  to  returning the savings to meet short-term  objectives

only.  A larger part of the costs saved should be used to invest

in  skills  training  and retraining of  their  workers  and  in

developing  their  capabilities to meet future  competition  and

expansion.   Investment in human capital can only  rebound  with

positive results for employers.  Over the medium to longer term,

better  trained  workers  will  be  more  productive  and   more

knowledgeable,  which will enable them to contribute  better  to

the  companies.  It is easy to take a short term view and  think

only  of  survival  in these difficult times.  However,  I  urge

employers  to  take  a  long term view and  help  their  workers

transit smoothly to the knowledge-based economy.  In fact,  over

and  above  the savings from CPF cuts and other wage  cuts,  the

avenues  and  funds  for skills training and upgrading  are  all

there.   It is for employers to take advantage and to make  full

use  of  such  funds.  So both employers and employees  have  no

excuse not to take part in it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, unfortunately, those companies which continue to

face  financial difficulties despite wage and CPF cuts.  I  urge

these  employers to consider retrenching workers only as a  last

resort.  Why not use other innovative ways to cut

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>

non-wage costs?  For instance, employers can institute a shorter

work week, or mandate a compulsory clearing of annual leave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of creative

thinking.   Like  the  example of the Safe  Superstore  in  Sims

Drive,  which  was  quoted in The New Paper  last  Friday,  20th

November  1998,  by NTUC Secretary-General and Minister-without-Portfolio,  Mr Lim Boon Heng.  By doing some simple research  on

customer traffic at certain hours, the store managed to cut down

from  two  shifts to one.  This reduced manpower  and  utilities

costs.   There is an increasing number of companies in Singapore

which  have  been  relooking  into the  operation  and  business

processes.   There  have  been many examples  of  QCs  and  Work

Improvement  Teams which have helped save their  companies  more

than  a  million dollars.  So it is good for companies  to  look

into these areas to cut costs without first resorting to further

wage cut or retrenchment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put it bluntly, by agreeing to the CPF and other

wage  cuts,  our workers have actually agreed to  give  part  of

their  income  to  their employers.  The  Government's  plan  to

reduce  charges  is  also transferring  the  public's  money  to

companies.  These decisions have been made in good faith and for

our  common  good - the workers, the people, employers  and  the

state.   The  money  saved should thus be used  to  enhance  the

workers'  well-being - especially their future  employability  - and improve the companies' capability and competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thrust of my speech today is that we are in this

together,  and  each  of  us  - the  worker,  employer  and  the

Government - must play our part to help our country's economy to

recover.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While wage cuts are inevitable, it will not be fair to let

workers  shoulder the burden alone.  Employers  can  and  should

make that extra effort to do what they can to lessen the pain of

wage  and  CPF cuts on our workers.  Now that we have agreed  to

cut costs, let us not forget that human touch; that small act of

kindness and that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>

gesture  of consideration.  Let us take that extra step to  make

each  other's  journey a kinder and gentler  passage.   We  must

think  beyond this recession and for the longer run, I think  we

will  have to take a re-look at our cost structure and fine-tune

our  wage  system,  worker  training system  and  pre-employment

training  system  in  order  to  ensure  that  Singapore  remain

competitive.   When we work together even closer,  we  will  not

only  be  able to overcome the current economic crisis,  but  we

will make Singapore society even stronger.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, I fully

support  the  recommendations of the  Committee  on  Singapore's

Competitiveness, and I would like to add to some of  the  points

that have been discussed in the Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the development of entreprenuers. Many businessmen say

that we lack the entrepreneurship spirit seen in Hong Kong.   It

is  timely  for  Government to create the right  environment  to

enable  the  development  of an entrepreneurial  culture.   This

would  have  to  be  instilled early in the life  of  our  young

children.   We  should encourage and nurture them in  school  by

teaching them to be creative and understand that there  is  more

than  one way to approach problems.  We must teach them  not  to

fear  mistakes  but  to learn from mistakes.  More  importantly,

both the employers of the public and private sectors must change

the  present  working environment and stereotyped  mindsets  for

more open environment where free flow of ideas are expressed and

exchanged among all levels of the hierarchy.  We must not be too

quick  to penalise those who make mistakes which are not due  to

carelessness, negligence or ill-intentions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the business world, businessmen have commented that the GLCs

have  moved  beyond their core businesses and  have  diversified

into  other  businesses to the extent they are found  in  almost

every  trade.   Because  of  their  sheer  size  or,  at  times,

monopoly, entrepreneurs feel stifled and are sometimes unable to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>

compete  not because they do not have a better product or  skill

but  because  they do not have the financial muscle  to  compete

with  GLCs  when GLCs enter into the fray.  Instead of  stifling

competition,  GLCs  should  work  with  good  entrepreneurs  and

provide  the  environment  for them  to  succeed  on  a  win-win

formula.  Instead of competing with each other, GLCs should link

up  with  some  of  these local enterprises to  compete  in  the

international market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on world-class companies, I support the move to make

our  GLCs  into  world-class companies.  In  trying  to  recruit

foreign  talents to increase our skilled manpower resources,  it

is  important that we attract foreigners who are truly  talented

and  not  people of second or third echelons but top echelon  to

serve  these  companies.  Some have said that in many  countries

there  is  political  cronyism.  But in Singapore  there  is  no

political  cronyism  but  there is public  cronyism.   GLCs  are

favoured.  I think we must dispel this notion.  This is all  the

more important during the process of making our GLCs into world-class  companies.  We must be able to show them  that  it  is  a

level-playing field and dispel that misperception.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, managing our limited resources. As our manufacturing

industry grows and as our economy continues to expand,  the  use

of water will continue to increase.  We have already planned for

desalination plants and there are occasional campaigns  to  save

water.   But  it  is time that more forceful steps  need  to  be

taken.   We  should inculcate water saving habits in  the  young

children  in  schools.  They must be reminded that  water  is  a

scarce resource and perhaps we should teach them to use water as

if  they  were  living  in  a desert community,  so  that  their

generation will learn to appreciate the importance of water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, reduction of wage cost to increase our

competitiveness.  Mr Chiam has proposed that Ministers'  pay  be

cut  by  25%.  Yes, I think Ministers' pay should be cut  as  an

example for others to follow.  However, even if you were to  cut

the  pay  by 25%, I could not see how it could help to  increase

the competitiveness of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>

Singapore economy.  I think he has forgotten that the  main  aim

of  wage  reduction  is  to increase our  competitiveness.   The

performance  of  our Government leaders in this economic  crisis

has   been  sterling.   They  have  helped  Singapore  gain   an

impeccable  reputation.   I  think they  deserve  better.   Yes,

Ministers  and top civil servants should lead by  example.   The

wage  cut that will be advocated for the public sector, I  think

for  Ministers and civil servants, they should be at the top  of

the  range.  But it does not serve any purpose if we  cut  their

pay excessively without any good reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that the effect of wage cut be cushioned

for  those  from the lower-income group.  We have to  understand

their  needs  and ensure that they have a safety  net,  so  that

their  families will not suffer excessively.  Yes,  we  need  to

focus  on the bigger picture to stimulate the economy.  However,

we must also remember that there are many families out there who

will  face  increasing  financial hardship.   Government  bodies

should  make downward adjustment costs selectively, for example,

decreasing  transport cost.  Perhaps bus companies may  want  to

consider  decreasing  the  cost of bus stamps  for  school-going

children.   These  are measures that will help the  lower-income

families.  Perhaps when rebates are given to hawker centres  and

food  courts, there might be a mechanism for these to be  passed

back to the consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want a situation where the families face so much

hardship and are unable to get assistance that their spirit gets

broken  because of these setbacks.  For example, I have a family

in  my  constituency who has gone without utilities for  months,

and  when they came to my attention and we made several  efforts

to  approach them, and when we said that we would help them  get

their  utilities  (water and electricity) connected,  the  first

response was, "No, please don't do that, because I cannot afford

that."  It has come to a stage where they feel that there is  no

avenue for assistance.  I think we do not want them to reach  to

that  extent.   What we want to do is to help them regain  their

confidence and overcome their difficulties.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should consider increasing funding to CDCs

so that they will be in a better position to help these families

tide over their difficulties.  CDCs can become focal points  and

one-stop  assistance centres for families who are faced  with  a

barrage of unpaid bills and arrears from different agencies.  As

we  undertake  these measures to improve the competitiveness  of

our economy, we must let Singaporeans know that while we have to

look  at  the big picture, we have not forgotten the individuals

who  face  hardship.  Instead, we will help them overcome  their

difficulties.   Together,  we  will  work  towards  building   a

stronger and more resilient Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Report is

a  result of a lengthy deliberation involving the best  and  the

brightest minds in Singapore.  In terms of the depth of analysis

and  the rationale of its recommendations, there is actually not

much one could add to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we remove the emotional cobwebs surrounding the issue, the

basic  fact is that the cost of doing business in Singapore  has

gone  up  dramatically versus our competitor nations.  Yes,  our

infrastructure, our management expertise, our stable Government,

the  skills  of our workforce, etc, will allow us  to  charge  a

premium,  but only so much.  Therefore, we must reduce the  cost

to render ourselves more attractive to foreign investors.  There

are  only  two  ways  of  doing it.  One way  is  through  self-engineered   currency  devaluation.   At  first   glance,   this

apparently  is  a painless approach.  Dr Ow Chin  Hock,  in  his

speech,  earlier has already touched on much of the pitfalls  of

doing  this.  So I would not go into it in detail.  I just  want

to  say that in so doing, the cost of living inflation resulting

in  a  weaker Singapore dollar will have its greatest impact  on

retirees  who  are  living on their savings -  people  who  have

contributed greatly to the prosperity of Singapore in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach is through cost-cutting measures, as

recommended  by  the  CSC.  It is heartening  to  say  that  the

Singapore  Government  has  decided  to  take  the  correct  but

politically more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>

demanding  route of reducing our wage cost and Government  fees.

This  reflects  the  long-term perspective  of  the  Government.

Cutting wages of the wage-earners is always very painful.   This

requires  political  courage  as well  as  a  well-informed  and

responsible  population  who  understands  the  needs  of  these

drastic  measures.   I  am  glad to say  that  Singaporeans  are

responding  positively to these Government policies through  the

various feedback we have obtained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feedback Unit has conducted two sessions, one in English

chaired  by myself, the second in Mandarin, chaired  by  Mr  Ang

Mong Seng, the Member for Bukit Gombak.  In the English Language

session,  around  50  CEOs of small and medium  enterprises  and

multi-national companies attended.  From the comments,  I  could

easily classify those comments into two major categories,  based

on  the  perspective  of  the  participants.   The  first  group

comprises  those who are concerned with the external  demand  of

Singapore's  goods and services, and the second  group  involves

businessmen  serving  the domestic economy.   Not  surprisingly,

their  perspectives and comments differ dramatically.  For those

faced  with  external  demand and external  competition,  almost

everyone  lauded  the effort by the Government  in  recommending

this  package as appropriate and timely.  In fact,  the  foreign

CEOs  were especially impressed by the ability of the Government

to  put  forward such a comprehensive package.   In  fact,  they

lamented  that  such packages and measures are  unlikely  to  be

successful or even contemplated in their own countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These participants were convinced that those measures

recommended in the Report would help their business overcome the

current  crisis over the next two years.  They said  that  while

Singapore  does not suddenly become more attractive  to  foreign

investors,  at least the push factor of business migrating  away

from  Singapore has been reduced or eliminated.  In  fact,  they

looked  towards  the long term and expressed concern  that  cost

containment should not be a once off

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>

or  ad  hoc  process but should be an on-going process,  because

Singapore  is no longer competing with under-developed countries

but  with developed countries.  They expressed the worry whether

Singapore will revert to the past practice or behaviour of  cost

escalation once the current crisis is over.  For those CEOs  who

are in Singapore for their OHQ operation, they expressed concern

about other costs, other than wage cost.  For instance, one  key

factor is the high telecommunications cost.  If Singapore  wants

to  evolve  into a IT society or knowledge society,  or  develop

into  e-commerce, they felt that our telecommunications cost  is

pretty high.  And those with major manufacturing operations also

expressed  concerns  of high energy cost, especially  electrical

utilities costs.  Being CEOs, they all concluded that the  major

driving  force of escalating costs in Singapore, besides  wages,

is  actually the land cost in Singapore.  Therefore, these  CEOs

would like to understand what is the Government's plan as far as

land cost containment is concerned.  How do we contain land cost

in   Singapore   such   that  the  two  factors   I   mentioned,

telecommunications  and  electrical power  utilities,  will  not

escalate out of reach?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second category that I mentioned earlier, those CEOs

who  deal  with  domestic demand are basically from  the  retail

businesses.   In  fact,  they  are  very  concerned  about   the

diminishing purchasing power of Singaporeans after the  proposed

15% manpower cost reduction.  In light of the reduced disposable

income, they expressed concerns about how the lower income group

would weather the wage reduction.  Many proposed a reduction  of

GST  by  1%  to  2% or even the complete suspension  of  GST  to

stimulate domestic demand.  When we pointed out to them that  3%

is  a very small number and whether a $3 charge, based on a $100

purchase, would influence the decision to spend or not to spend,

their  response is that it is not a matter of money but a matter

of  confidence.  So despite many clarifications on  GST  by  the

Minister for Finance in the past, most still asked for the major

reasons why the Government is so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>

reluctant to consider a reduction of GST.  Perhaps, the Minister

should address this issue again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several participants commented that since manpower cost

constitutes  75% of this package while Government fee  reduction

constitutes  only 25% of the package, it would seem  that  wage-earners,  including workers as well as high-income earners,  are

being  asked  to shoulder a high proportion of the  `sacrifice'.

Many  would  like to see that the Government shoulder  a  higher

proportion  of  this `sacrifice'.  In fact, a  number  commented

that  maybe there should be a 50%/50% contribution, ie, 50% from

the  wage-earners,  50% from the Government.   The  participants

seem  to  be unaware that wage cost is close to 40% of  the  GDP

while the various charges by the Government only amount to  10%.

So  in  fact, they are unaware that the proposed 15%  reduction,

amounting  to  $25  billion,  is  actually  more  than  the  15%

recommended by the Government.  It is actually coming up to 20%.

So if we were to approach an equal proportion of 50/50, it would

mean  that  Government fees and other levies would  have  to  be

reduced by a whopping 60% or more in order to achieve this goal.

Surely,  there  is no way to do so.  On the other  hand,  having

said  so,  this particular message needs to be repeated  by  the

Ministers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I think the concerns of plunging

domestic demand is actually a very serious matter.  Many  retail

businesses,  small and large, might be forced into  difficulties

as   the  disposable  income  of  individuals  is  reduced.    I

understand  that  the CSC Report touches on the  possibility  of

reducing  company  tax or personal income tax.   Much  as  I  am

personally against unnecessary consumption, I think the  current

belt-tightening  by Singaporeans have actually  been  overboard.

So  I  would like to advocate a stimulative measure of  personal

income   tax  to  counteract  the  reduced  disposable   income.

Hopefully,  the  Minister can propose a  reduction  in  personal

income tax even before the March 1999 Budget debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the $10 billion package, or US$6 billion

package, is equivalent to a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>

cash injection into the Singapore economy.  It is very hard  for

individuals to visualise what is US$6 billion and how  large  is

that number.  But if we consider that in the recent report,  the

United  States, Japan and the World Bank will come together  and

propose  a US$5 billion package for the ailing Thai, Korean  and

Indonesian  economies,  perhaps we can  put  that  in  a  proper

perspective.   Singapore  is a small country  with  3.5  million

population, and yet we are going to inject close to $10  billion

a  year  into the economy for the next, hopefully, two  or  more

years.  So in that respect, I am very confident that our economy

will  turn  around  quickly in a V-shaped recovery  after  these

particular measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call of sacrifice by the Government to the people will

be  readily  heeded  if we can seize the opportunity  while  the

sense  of  crisis is still very much heightened.  The  sense  of

crisis  was at this highest point several months back  when  the

Straits  Times  Index  fell to about 800  points.   However,  as

interest rate eases and stock market prices recovered slowly  to

the  current 1,300 points, I believe the sense of crisis amongst

Singaporeans is slowly dissipating even though much work is  yet

to  be  done.  Therefore, grasping the timing is very important.

If  we can get the present generation of young Singaporeans  who

are  facing their first major crisis to take this pain  together

with  the Government, this would definitely strengthen the  bond

between   our   emerging   leaders  and   this   generation   of

Singaporeans.  And this bond will serve us well as we  ride  out

this  crisis and move confidently forward to claim our  rightful

place in the history in the 21st Century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I would like to congratulate the

Minister for a very comprehensive policy package.  I support the

recommendations of the CSC.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to  congratulate the CSC  on  its  Report.   It  is

attractive in more ways than one.  It is well written, pragmatic

and  comprehensive.  There are six proposals to  deal  with  the

crisis and eight proposals to sustain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>

competitiveness in the longer term.  As they make sound economic

sense, I agree with most of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight four main points. First, I would

like to discuss the cost-cutting measures; second, the long  run

vision;  third, the process of crisis management  in  Singapore;

and  fourth,  balancing  the  wage  and  CPF  cuts  with  relief

measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the cost-cutting measures. The economic crisis

represents  for us in Singapore a severe external demand  shock.

The  CSC  advocates  essentially four  cost-cutting  measures  - labour  costs, exchange rate, land prices and taxes and  levies.

The key issues, I believe, are, first, the magnitude of the cost-cutting  measures; second, the balance of the various components

of  the  package; and third, the timing of the measures.  Please

allow me to discuss each of these in turn.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.23 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the magnitude of the package. The key cost-cutting

measure is the reduction of labour costs by 15%.  The objective,

as  stated  in  the  CSC Report, is to bring our  relative  unit

labour  cost  (RULC) back to 1994 levels.  While  I  agree  that

labour  cost  reduction  is  a drastic  measure  for  a  drastic

situation, it would have been good if there was more explanation

of  why  the  Committee  thought that  15%  is  the  appropriate

measure.   First,  RULC  measures  only  unit  labour  cost   in

manufacturing  vis-a-vis that of the Asian NIEs.  However,  unit

labour  cost  in the overall economy has increased  even  faster

than  that  of unit labour cost in manufacturing.  For  example,

while  unit labour cost in manufacturing has risen by 27%  since

the  index was first compiled in 1988, unit labour cost for  the

entire  economy has risen by much more, 43%.  It would therefore

have  been appropriate if the Committee had compared the overall

unit  labour  cost  and  not  just  the  unit  labour  cost   of

manufacturing  to  that of other countries.   In  addition,  the

comparison is to the other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>

Asian  NIEs.  However, are they our main competitors these days?

In  what sectors?  And what weightage was given to each  of  the

other  three Asian NIEs so that only one graph was obtained  and

presented in the Report?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, while I agree with the fact that labour costs need to

be  cut,  I wish that more explanation were given as to why  the

Committee thought that 15% was the appropriate figure.   If  the

real  reason is that 15% was the figure achieved via the process

of  bargaining and compromise between business and labour,  with

the  15% reduction in business cost in electronics sector as the

benchmark,  then  I  accept  that it  is  actually  a  political

compromise.  I realise that, ultimately, the practice of  policy

is  an art, not a science.  Nevertheless, since it is stated  in

the  Report that it is to bring wage competitiveness back to the

1994  levels  and the RULC was used specifically, then  I  think

that  one  should endeavour to be as rigorous as possible,  when

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the exchange rate, I agree with the Committee that the

main   target  of  exchange  rate  management  should  be  price

stability.  Having said that, I believe that there is  room  for

some  flexibility in the management of exchange  rate  on  three

counts.  First, there is no risk today in the global economy  of

inflation.  In fact, it is the very opposite.  In Singapore,  we

have  been  experiencing not a positive inflation rate,  but  in

fact a negative inflation rate for four months since June.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, while we are a very open economy and import most of our

intermediate  products, there is still a domestic  component  to

costs, and an exchange rate depreciation would lower the cost of

the  domestic component in foreign currency terms.  For example,

it  has often been cited that our imported components constitute

a  large  proportion of our total output.  That  is  true.   For

example,   materials   constitute  63%  of   total   output   in

manufacturing   in  1997, but it is 63%.  Value  added  comprise

23.5%.   So  therefore even though it is true that the  domestic

component  in  terms  of  the intermediate  inputs  do  actually

comprise a large percentage there is still room to effect a real

exchange rate depreciation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to the extent that a nominal depreciation is not

entirely wiped out by inflation and wage increases in the  other

affected  countries,  then  for  them,  a  real  exchange   rate

depreciation  in  fact has been effected, thus increasing  their

competitiveness.   I  am  not  suggesting  that  we  engage   in

competitive  devaluation  vis-a-vis these  other  countries.   I

agree that this would prove counter-productive in the long  run.

However, I think that it is time and appropriate to adopt a more

nuanced  approach.  In other words, I agree with the CSC's  view

that   a   delicate  balance  needs  to  be  maintained  between

facilitating  recovery of the domestic economy on the  one  hand

and maintaining confidence in the Singapore dollar on the other.

I  would  therefore echo the call of the CSC itself for  greater

flexibility  and a wider band in the management of the  exchange

rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the issue of optimising resource management and

the  pricing of land in Singapore.  This is a policy too because

the JTC and HDB are major lessees of industrial land and zoning,

plot   ratios,   usage  and  other  regulations  are   important

determinants of land price.  In land scarce Singapore,  property

prices  and rentals constitute one of the main reasons for  cost

escalation  in the 1990s.  This was pointed out by Dr  Wang  Kai

Yuen  in his speech.  I therefore agree that land rentals should

be reduced.  I also support the CSC's call for an MTI-led multi-agency task force to develop competitive land pricing and zoning

policies  for our hub services.  However, I would  go  one  step

further  and  ask that the terms of reference of  this  proposed

task  force  to  examine  land pricing policy  in  Singapore  be

expanded to include not just hub services but all other  sectors

as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last cost-cutting measure advocated is that of Government

taxes  and levies.  It is here that I believe there is room  for

manoeuvring and some flexibility.  And this, I think is the  nub

of  the issue: is $10 billion enough?  There is room to do more,

if  needed.  I believe that budget considerations should not  be

the  main  consideration in this regard.  After all, the  budget

surplus  in  fiscal year 1997 alone was $4.2  billion.   On  the

other hand, in terms of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>

June  cost-cutting  measures, the estimated budget  deficit  was

only  $0.8 billion.  In other words, there is room for much more

expansion  in  this  regard even without  touching  Government's

reserves accumulated during pervious Governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe also that there is limited room for pump priming. And

I believe that this should be seriously looked into particularly

since  the wage cuts will result in a decreased demand.  I  know

that two-thirds of demand is actually externally driven.

But if we look at some figures, in terms of the Input and Output

Tables  of 1990 - I realise that they are outdated but  this  is

the  most  recent that we have - the 1990 Singapore Input-Output

Table states that for every dollar increase in final demand, the

value-added  multiplier for commerce is 81 cents; for  transport

and  communication, 67 cents; for seaport and related  services,

61  cents;  for financial services, 89 cents; business services,

88  cents.   For manufacturing, it is very low and  that  is  40

cents   out  of  every  dollar  of  final  demand  for   non-oil

manufacturing.  In other words, the pump priming  measures  that

can  be  implemented should be seriously examined,  particularly

since  there is anticipated fall in domestic demand  because  of

the wage cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the timing? Is the timing appropriate? The

question  here is whether the cut should actually be implemented

sooner  than  early  next year. The reason why  I  say  this  is

recently,  both the IMF and OECD have come out to forecast  that

positive  growth  is  expected in most  of  the  affected  Asian

emerging economies by the second half of next year.  If that  is

indeed the case, then it could be true that again, maybe by  the

second  half or the later half of next year, we could also  have

positive  growth in the economy.  If anything else, I think  the

depth  of  the  recession in Singapore would  be  for  the  last

quarter,  this quarter and the first two quarters or  maybe  the

third  quarter  of  next year, provided there  is  nothing  more

serious  in  terms of a fall in demand or a global deflation  or

recession in the economy, for example, if Japan fails to recover

or  China devalues and a whole lot of other reasons.  The global

economy is very uncertain.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is of course difficult to convince

workers  to  accept  a  wage cut if  the  economy  were  not  in

recession and I can imagine that it will be difficult  to  think

of wage cut earlier than now because of the fact that we have to

wait  for  the  third  quarter result of  -0.7%.   Therefore,  I

believe  that now that we are considering all these cost-cutting

measures, it is better to implement them as soon as possible  in

order  that  they can kick in as early as possible in  order  to

save jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is regarding the long run vision. I

suspect the CSC Report will be remembered for advocating the 15%

cut  in  labour cost more than for its articulation of a  vision

for  Singapore for the next 10 years or so.  While the immediate

survival  is understandably the paramount issue, we  should  not

lose sight of the longer term issues.  It would be desirable  to

re-visit  this  vision  again  when  the  economy  recovers  and

immediate  concerns  become  less critical.   Any  vision,  once

formulated, needs to be disseminated.  There needs to be a  buy-in  and greater ownership by the relevant parties, in this case,

the  business  community  and labour.   In  future,  Singapore's

economy  would  need greater and not less participation  by  the

relevant sectors, namely, business and labour.  A case in  point

is  the  objective  of  developing  a  vibrant,  entrepreneurial

culture  and developing world-class companies that we  can  call

our own.  How can we forge a better partnership between GLCs and

local  companies?  How can flexi-work hours be implemented which

will  help  working mothers and the aged?  These are all  issues

which can be deliberated in greater detail in the framework of a

public sector business-labour partnership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to propose that the CSC organise a

conference  on  the long-term vision for the business  community

and  labour sometime next year in order to extend the buy-in and

ownership of the vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some brief comments about the vision itself. One may ask:

what is new about the vision?  I believe that more than being a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>

completely new paradigm, the vision is a useful articulation  of

a  continuing trend towards greater technological sophistication

and  stronger  capabilities.  I believe that  one  of  the  main

highlights  of  the  vision  is the  fact  that  it  articulates

manufacturing  and services as twin engines of  growth  for  the

economy and, for the first time, we see services coming  to  the

fore  in  terms of the pro-planning approach of the  Government.

This is exactly in line with Singapore's likely future cost  and

capabilities profile.  I therefore agree with this  emphasis  on

manufacturing and services as twin engines of growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is regarding the process of crisis

management.  The economic crisis has revealed the importance  of

fundamentals, not merely economic fundamentals but political and

social fundamentals.  In this time of crisis, social capital and

the  legitimacy of the political leadership are crucial.  We  in

Singapore are fortunate that at a time of crisis such  as  this,

the trade unions and politicians can gain support for a wage cut

and  maintain social cohesion so that racial and ethnic fissures

do not appear.  There is no policy indecisiveness, no dithering,

no  stalemate,  as  we see, for example, in some  of  the  other

countries  around  us.  Instead, not only  has  there  been  the

ability  to  garner  the support necessary  for  the  short-term

measures, we have also been able to plan ahead and be pro-active

and    take   measures   necessary   to   sustain   our   future

competitiveness.  Here, we see, in some ways, good governance in

Singapore  in  action  and I believe that good  governance  must

surely be one of Singapore's most precious assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth and last point is regarding compassion. I would

urge the Government to help ease the burden of the wage and  CPF

cuts. Although interest rates have fallen in recent months  from

their   high  early  this  year,  many  households  would   face

difficulties in meeting housing loans, and the wage  cuts  would

mean  a consumption squeeze for many families.  I hope that  the

Government  would adopt a compassionate approach by accompanying

the  labour cost reductions with measures, including schemes  to

ease or defer mortgage payments and an increase

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>

in  educational  bursaries and textbook  allowances  for  school

children for families with financial difficulties.  I would also

argue for an income tax rebate to help alleviate the squeeze  on

disposable incomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One alternative to the proposed differentiated CPF cut that

has  been  advocated by my Parliamentary colleagues is  to  find

ways  to reduce the financial burden of the lower income  group,

for example, in terms of rebate for S&C charges, and so on.  The

private  sector  can play its part.  Banks, in  particular,  can

also  help  by  providing bridging loans for  those  who  bought

private properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to state that the CSC's Report

is  indeed  a  well-conceived Report that not only provides  for

immediate relief but also for a long-term vision.  I salute  the

Committee for being able to complement each of them by the other

and include them in one Report.  I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I support the motion as proposed by the Minister for Trade

and Industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into the details, I would like to congratulate the

Government,  the workers and the business leaders  in  Singapore

for  working as a team to tackle a very tough problem that  they

are facing by delivering this very comprehensive Report. We have

seen many examples of how a seemingly good infrastructure breaks

down  in times of crisis. If we look around us in Asia,  in  all

the  countries affected by the economic crisis, there has either

been  a  leadership  change  in  the  country  affected  or  the

countries  are  in  turmoil with political  and  social  reforms

taking place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a very stable Government with strong leadership to be

willing to take bold steps that have been suggested by the  CSC.

It also takes a committed and responsible business community and

citizens  to work hand in hand with the Government to  implement

some  very tough measures that we are talking about.  Sir, I  am

glad  that  we in Singapore are sending a very strong and  clear

signal to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>

the  rest of the world that Singapore consists of a strong  team

of  partners from the public, private and people sectors who can

work  in  synergy to solve our problems despite the difficulties

that we face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have identified the solutions, they would only be

effective  in  resolving  our  competitiveness  problems  if  we

implement  them  fast and decisively.  We have  done  a  lot  of

planning  and  talking in the past one year.  We  have  to  very

quickly  set the actions in motion. So I hope we would implement

the measures that we have identified immediately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recall that early this year when we were

debating  the  Budget  for  the  year  1998/1999,  many  of   us

highlighted  the perception gap between the way  the  Government

and the private sector perceived the state of the economy.  Many

of  us  had  projected a rapid decline in our economy while  the

Minister for Finance had in his speech talked about the recovery

and growth, especially in electronics and manufacturing sectors.

Based on how the Government viewed the economy, we implemented a

number  of conservative measures at that time.  Then we came  in

with  off-budget measures about four months later because things

turned  out  to be different as planned.  However, things  again

deteriorated   and   the   off-budget   measures,   being   very

conservative, did not do much to revive the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us look at the facts. While our economy is still

in  a  much  better  position if we  compare  ourselves  to  our

neighbours,  nonetheless, we have slipped into  a  recession  as

many of us had predicted early this year.  The worrying issue is

not just the recession but is also the rate of decline from 6.1%

growth  in  the  first  quarter to 1.6%  growth  in  the  second

quarter, and to a negative 0.7% in the third quarter.  The  rate

of decline is quite fast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point in bringing this out is that the mechanisms

we have in place are not accurately addressing the real problems

seen  by  the  business community.  Many of us  have  asked  for

bolder  measures from the Government, as far back as  July  1997

during  the 1997/1998 Budget debate.  Unfortunately, the outcome

was otherwise.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time round, it is a little difficult to assess the

impact of the measures that we have identified because we do not

have the details of the actions from the Government.  However, I

hope  they  will  take  our request into serious  consideration,

since  we have not been very far off in the last one and a  half

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must be more aggressive and not rely on

small  steps  or  piecemeal measures, like the $2  billion  off-budget  measures that we announced earlier this year.   That  $2

billion  in  my opinion did not move the economy even  a  little

bit.   We  must  learn from Japan's struggle for  the  last  two

years.   Japan also tried to take many piecemeal actions and  it

resulted in wasted efforts and wasted money with Japan's economy

still in trouble today.  So I hope this time we do not waste our

efforts and money and I hope we will be more aggressive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, the Government's share of the $10

billion  reduction  proposed is not  sufficient.   While  I  can

understand  that  wages  make up a  large  proportion  of  total

business  cost, I feel that the reduction in Government charges,

levies,  utilities and so on needs to be higher  than  the  15%.

Frankly, the 15% reduction in business cost falls short  of  the

business  community's expectation of 20-25%.  In fact, even  the

20-25% is not a cooked-up number.  In fact, I did a calculation.

For  the manufacturing sector, based on the real increases  that

have  gone on in the last three to four years, and based on  the

currency  depreciation in our neighbours we really needed  about

25-30%  of reduction to be competitive.  So 15% falls  short  of

our  expectation.   However, I feel that  the  $7  billion  wage

reduction is sufficient.  But the Government's portion needs  to

be  much  more and I am suggesting 30-40% reduction in  all  the

areas  that I have just mentioned.  While I understand that  the

real Government charges form a very small component of the total

business cost, but really, there are many "hidden costs" in  our

system of governance in Singapore.  Some of these are the  COEs,

the ERP, petrol tax, GST, worker levies, and many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>

more.   So although our official income tax is among the  lowest

in  the  world,  the  net effect of all the indirect  taxes  and

charges is significant to the bottomline of businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach of autonomous agencies in the Government

departments  and  statutory boards while,  in  principle,  looks

good, has resulted in `micro-managing' of our economy where  all

of  them  either want to make surpluses or profits individually.

Collectively, the impact on businesses can be very high.  So  if

we  look  at  the  charges  from all  these  agencies,  the  net

contribution  to  the  business  cost  is  more  than  what   we

officially  classify as business charges.  I feel  that  we  may

have  to make sacrifices in certain agencies where they must  be

allowed  to  have deficits or losses, as long as the  collective

result  to the Government's budget is positive, if that is  what

we aim for every year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that the Government spend between $5 billion

and  $7  billion to boost the economy, not just the $3  billion.

Of  course, we have seen numbers that if we go for $5-$7 billion

that  would mean a 50-60% reduction in Government charges  which

may  not be realistic.  So, what we are asking for down here  is

that  part  of it should come in real reduction in  charges  and

levies, and the rest of it could come in the form of pumping  in

some   liquidity   to  boost  local  consumption,   which   also

contributes to about 30% of our economy.  These can be in  terms

of more generous tax rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that we temporarily bring down the GST charges

from  3%  to  1%.  I am not suggesting a complete suspension  of

GST,  as  many business leaders have suggested to us, because  I

believe  that  we still have the right system in  place  and  we

should keep the machinery of the system going.  If we completely

suspend the GST, putting in the mechanism in place again in  the

future will be troublesome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the $3 billion or so that the Government

plans  to  reduce in terms of costs will come from  our  current

account.   I would like to suggest that we take this opportunity

now to dip into our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>

reserves.   Since  we were willing to do so for  our  neighbours

like  Thailand,  Indonesia and Malaysia, the  Government  should

seriously  consider  giving  some  of  the  surpluses   and  the

reserves back to Singaporeans who badly need it now.  It is  the

time to help stimulate domestic consumption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we are looking forward to substantial reduction in

rentals by JTC and HDB for industrial and commercial properties,

these  reductions  should not be in the form of  rebates.   They

should be permanent reductions if we really want to build  long-term  investor confidence in Singapore.  Rebates  will  go  away

after  some time and do not give a feeling of long-term thinking

on  the Government's part.  Given how much our land and property

cost  has  gone up compared to our neighbours in  the  last  few

years,  we need drastic reductions in rental, again to the  tune

of 30-40% reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, foreign workers form an important part of our economy. We

know  we cannot do without them.  While I understand and support

the  need to bring in mainly skilled workers, however we already

have  a  large pool of unskilled workers in Singapore.  It  will

take  some  time to either replace them or train them to  become

skilled  workers.   Since  they are already  here,  I  urge  the

Government  to  reduce the levies by 50% for  both  skilled  and

unskilled  workers.   For skilled workers,  the  cut  should  be

permanent.  For the unskilled workers, we can issue a time table

of  increases back to the original levels over a period of three

years.   In  this way, we will help many companies survive  this

downturn  while we compel them to make long-term plans to  train

their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of our small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are

affected  by  cash  flow  problems.  While  the  Government  has

enhanced  the  Local Enterprise Financing Scheme  (LEFS)  to  be

broader based and pumped in more money to it, unfortunately, the

banks   are  still  the  deciding  bodies.   Given  the   ultra-conservative  stance  of  our  banks  in  this  environment   in

Singapore, many companies are still finding it very difficult to

take advantage of the scheme.  I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>

like  to suggest that PSB or some other Government body  take  a

direct  approach  in  financing some of  our  viable  companies,

because they are finding it very difficult convincing the banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, traders also contribute substantially to our economy.

However, due to credit squeeze from our ultra-conservative banks

in  Singapore, they are not able to take  advantage of the still

attractive  trades that exist in South Asia, China,  Africa  and

Europe.   I  have  heard  of a number of  big  traders  who  are

planning to move and relocate out of Singapore to countries like

Hong  Kong  and  Thailand to carry out their trading  activities

because of lack of credit facilities in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest some form of Government supported trade

financing  scheme,  quite similar to the  LEFS.    Sir,  with  a

better  trade  financing  scheme, we  can  avoid  the  drain  of

expertise out of Singapore or even prevent the collapse of  some

still viable traders who are located here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far, I have focused on the immediate cost

competitiveness issues and the short-term action  plan  proposed

by  the  Minister for Trade and Industry through the CSC Report.

I  would now like to touch on the long-term strategies.   In  my

opinion, the strategies spelt out by the Committee are excellent

and  will without doubt get the whole nation mobilised  to  work

towards achieving the plans that we have set up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the longer term, I see the economic recovery coming in

a  few  stages.   First, we will have to focus on our  immediate

cost  competitiveness issues which I believe we  are  very  well

focused  on.   The second stage will be to build  upon  investor

confidence in Singapore and also in investor confidence  in  the

region.   This  is because a lot of investors, especially  those

from  the West, look at the stability of the region as  a  whole

and  they do not just look at Singapore as a country.  So if  we

can  bring stability and confidence in the region faster,  funds

will  flow in even faster.  The issue of confidence building  is

an urgent issue and I hope that the Singapore leaders can take a

lead to get ASEAN organised to speed up the recovery process.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third stage of recovery will have to be in finding new

markets  and boosting demand.  We cannot rely on our traditional

markets.   We  have learnt this lesson very well.  So  both  the

Government and the private sector can play an important role  by

exploring  new markets and regions.  I believe this has  already

been set in motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of strategic land pricing, I am glad that the

CSC  has  recommended  a new way to price  industrial  land  and

properties  and  to  benchmark increases  to  the  increases  in

countries  that are competing with us, as opposed  to  increases

according  to  the market rates in Singapore.   I  call  on  the

Government  to  learn  from its past mistake  in  this  area  by

putting  in  place measures that will prevent land  prices  from

escalating  so  drastically  in a short  span  of  time,  as  we

experienced in the last few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land prices do make a big impact when it comes to selecting

an  investment  site for a manufacturing facility,  although  we

have  heard leaders saying that it forms a very small  component

of  total  operating  cost.  But when it  comes  to  deciding  a

location to site a factory, it plays a major role.  In fact,  in

the  last  few years, I have experienced two occasions  when  we

were  trying  to  select a new manufacturing facility.   On  one

occasion,  the  land  cost played a major  role  in  causing  my

company to select Thailand as the site rather than in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On entrepreneurism, I fully support the strategy because I

believe  that if we have to compete as a global player, we  need

to  have  more knowledge-based industries and we cannot continue

to  rely on an asset based economy as we have done in the  past.

We  need  to  create an environment in Singapore  that  promotes

business  risk  taking and to encourage more  technopreneurs  to

emerge.   In  my opinion, the Government agencies that  we  have

today are very entrenched in just supporting the MNCs, while the

infrastructure  to  support  local technopreneurs  is  not  well

developed.   We  need mindset changes among  those  involved  in

these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>

agencies.  Local start-ups and people who are involved in  these

start-ups feel discouraged by the lack of support given to  them

and their projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to develop a culture of tolerance to failures and

to  give  people  second chances.  Sir, success  should  not  be

measured  by  straight 'As' alone.  How we  classify  and  label

people  at  such  an  early stage through practices  like  early

streaming in schools affects our children's self esteem and many

will  end up giving up and not willing to try again, as they  go

along  in life.  Society and Government's attitude towards those

without academic excellence needs to change and we must  have  a

broader  definition  of  "success" that  goes  beyond  material,

economic and academic measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area that needs to be looked at is the help for

entrepreneurs  who  need  to  raise funds  necessary  for  their

projects.  I call on the Government to further liberalise  rules

on  how  funds can be raised for start-up companies and unlisted

companies.    Singaporean   venture   capitalists   are   highly

conservative just as our banks are and we need more foreign ones

to  set  up funds here in Singapore, so that they can create  an

environment similar to the one in Silicon Valley in USA and  the

Hsinchu based Science Park in Taiwan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of developing more world class companies is excellent.

We  need  many more companies like Creative Technology  who  are

global  players. Sir, being small is not an excuse for the  lack

of  such  world  class companies.  We can learn from  the  small

European  countries like Finland and Switzerland who  have  many

world  class global companies like Ericcson and Nokia.  I  fully

support  the suggestion that the Government acts as  a  business

facilitator.   The  Government  should  indeed   only   play   a

supporting  role  and create space for the  private  sector  and

entrepreneurs  to  move  in.  So far, the  Government  has  been

crowding  some  parts  of the business environment.   Similarly,

Government-linked companies (GLCs) should not compete with local

private  companies in the domestic market.  Instead, because  of

their size and access

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>

to  substantial  funds, GLCs should bring their  competition  to

outside  Singapore and in addition, bring along with  them  some

SMEs  by  getting  them to do parts of a big  overseas  project.

This initiative has not been fully explored by our local GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I am happy that the Government is willing to

react  fast  to tackle the problem of our declining economy.   I

hope  that  the  measures implemented will be bold  and  I  hope

everyone  will  seriously implement them fast.   I  applaud  the

workers  for  their  understanding  for  the  wage  cuts.    The

employers  and the Government need to play their part  and  take

their fair share of actions so that together we will emerge as a

strong economy and as a country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br>4.56 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, under the

impact  of  the  regional  economic crisis,  many  companies  in

Singapore  are in danger of having to close down, and  more  and

more  people  are  losing  their  jobs.   This  has  forced  the

Government to admit that the business cost in Singapore is  much

too high, and that Singapore has lost its competitiveness in the

international market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) Report points

out  that  even before the currency crisis broke out,  Singapore

could no longer compete on the basis of business costs alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government's policy has all along been to adhere to the

so-called  "market economy" principle, and to allow the  various

business  costs  to  soar  unchecked. This  has  not  only  made

business  cost heavier, but has also caused the people's  burden

in  life  to  be getting heavier and heavier.  When  the  market

conditions  suddenly turn bad, the businesses which are  already

overloaded  with very heavy business cost will immediately  find

it  unbearable  and  face the danger of having  to  close  down.

Eventually, the workers will become unemployed, and their burden

in life will be  made even heavier.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, over the years, many businessmen have been

complaining  of  high  business  costs.   I  have,  on  numerous

occasions,  pointed out in this House  that with the  Government

continously   increasing  the burden of  the  people,  once  the

economy  unfortunately  turns bad, the people  will  find  their

burden in life unbearable.   But the Government  just  would not

listen to me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh said, "Because our business cost is too high,

we are losing our share in the United States' electronics import

market.  Before the start of the regional crisis, in the  second

quarter of 1997, Singapore's share in the US electronics  import

market was 9.3%.  In August this year, it has dropped to 7.4%".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, during the same period, Malaysia's share in the

US  electronics import market rose from 7.1% to 8.2%.  For China

it  rose  from  7.2% to 10.1%.  However, during this  period  of

time,   the renminbi did not suffer a huge devaluation like  the

ringgit and baht.  China has become more competitive, while  our

competitiveness   has   substantially   diminished.    Had   the

Government  made preparation for the people and  the  businesses

during  good times, and exercised some restraint in its  act  to

prosper the coffers by increasing the business cost here,  today

we may not have to face such drastic wage-reduction measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report recommends a total wage-cost reduction of 15% and

to  set  back  the  wages  to that  of  the  1994  level.    The

Government  immediately takes the cue and indicates that  it  is

accepting  the  CSC's recommendation by proceeding  to  cut  the

employers' CPF contribution by 10%.  The National Wages  Council

(NWC)  immediately responded by announcing that wages should  be

cut by 5% to 8%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am puzzled with the CSC's recommendation of 15% cut in the

total wage-cost to set back wages to that of the 1994 level.

First, the Report does not give a clear explanation as to why it

came  to  the  conclusion  that the total  wage-cost  should  be

reduced  by  15%.  Neither  did the Report  list  out  the  cost

structures of the various

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>

sectors in the economy nor produce convincing data to prove that

the  recommendation  for  wage cut is necessary  and  cannot  be

avoided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, although the CSC Report mentions that the currencies

of the other countries in the region have devalued substantially

since  July  1997,  resulting in Singapore  further  losing  its

competitiveness,   DPM Lee did not seem to think  so.   On  19th

February 1998, he said in Parliament, I quote :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English): "Luckily, we are competitive. Our costs are not

out  of  line.   If you measure exchange rates  against  the  US

dollar,  the baht, the ringgit, the rupiah and the won have  all

gone  down much more than the Singapore dollar.  This  has  made

these  countries  cheaper than us, in a way,   more  competitive

than us.  But the effect is smaller than these numbers suggest."



Then he went on to explain why he said so, and he concludes:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So overall, although the exchange rate of the Singapore

dollar has gone down much less than our neighbour's, I am  still

confident that our exporters can compete.  They have problems if

they are working in the region.   They have problems if they are

in  difficult businesses like disk drives. But it is not because

we are out of line and uncompetitive."



That is what DPM Lee said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): That being the case, why has the Government

suddenly  decided  to cut the wages of the workers  because  our

competitiveness is in trouble?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, although some people are worried that many companies

may close down and result in serious unemployment if our workers

do  not  accept  a  wage  cut,  the Secretary-General  of  NTUC,

Minister Lim Boon Heng, did not feel that we should worry  about

this  problem.   He was reported in the Straits  Times  of  16th

November 1998 as saying that Singapore had enough jobs for every

Singaporean  and  no one would starve because of  this  economic

recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if DPM Lee is confident that even when other

countries'  currencies  have been devalued,  our  exporters  can

still  compete  and the Cabinet Ministers are not worried  about

unemployment,  then why do we need to reduce our workers'  wages

and employers' CPF contribution?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report has recommended that the total wage cost be

reduced  by 15%-10% reduction in the employers' CPF contribution

and  5%  from  the wages.  The whole cost-reduction  package  is

worth  $10 billion, of which $7 billion will come from the wage-cost  and  $3 billion from non-wage cost.   Just now,  some  MPs

mentioned that it was fair.  Is this really fair?  The  Chairman

of  the NWC announced that labour, management and the Government

should  be  in  the  same boat to share the same  happiness  and

troubles.   But now we can see that when there is  trouble,  the

workers  are the first to bear the brunt. They  have to shoulder

70%  of  the sacrifice.  But when times are good, do the workers

enjoy  the profit on a 7:3 ratio?  Or do they just get  3:7?   I

shall leave it to everyone to make his own judgement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, in the present circumstances, to reduce the

workers'  wages and to ask the workers to bear 70% of the  cost-reduction  burden  is  very  unfair.   As  of  March  1998,  the

Government's  actual gross revenue was $27  billion,  which  was

some  $550  million  more  than  the  projected  revenue.    The

Government  should  take  the lead to substantially  reduce  its

charges  and  rentals  and not reduce  the  workers'  wages  and

subject them to much hardship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report has recommended that the wage level be

reduced  to that of the 1994 level.  This is a regressive  step.

The  cost of living now  is significantly higher than  in  1994.

But amazingly, the Government accepted this recommendation.  The

Government   seems  to have forgotten that it  has  promised  to

bring our standard of living to that of the Swiss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to newspaper reports, the taxation experts are of

the  view  that  there  is  nothing new  in  this  Report.   The

Executive Director of the International Chamber of Commerce  and

Industry  seems to want to see some meat left on the  bone.   He

pointed  out  that  although  the  report  recommended  a  total

reduction  in  the  wage-cost, it  did  not  give  any  specific

suggestion on how to execute it, apart from the CPF cut.   I  am

not an economist, but I must point out that this Report has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>

failed to give adequate grounds and data to prove that the total

wage-cost must be reduced by 15%.  We are asking the workers  to

accept 1994 wages to pay for 1998 cost of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government should not mandate a 10% cut in the

employers'  CPF contribution, or for that matter, the amount  of

wages  to  be  reduced.    With the economy  turning  bad,  many

workers  are already suffering a loss of income.   I  feel  that

wages of the workers will be automatically adjusted according to

the   market  situation,  and  the  profits  or  losses  of  the

companies.   What  the  Government  should  do  is   to   reduce

contribution  rate to the Special Account and Medisave  Accounts

of  the  workers.  And also it should reduce the employees'  CPF

contribution  so  that they could have higher take-home  pay  to

tide  over the difficult times.  Although wage-cost takes  up  a

bigger  part of our total business cost, I feel that by reducing

other  non-wage  business costs would also help to  achieve  the

target of reducing the total business cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to information given by the Ministry of Trade and

Industry, in the the manufacturing sector,  51% of its  business

cost  came  from  service  cost,  including  transportation  and

communications, utilities and rentals, and other  indirect taxes

such  as GST, import duty, property tax, etc.  Among the  labour

costs,  apart  from salaries, there is also the  foreign  worker

levy, SDF, training and welfare funds, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this time of economic depression, the Government should

take the lead and make use of the reserves accumulated over  the

years  to  help  reduce  business cost by  cutting  the  various

charges  and  taxes, in order that Singapore  would  regain  its

international competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the most important thing to do is to help our companies

look  for  and penetrate  into new markets.  At the  same  time,

stimulate  consumption  in  the domestic  market,  so  that  our

products  may  be  marketed, and there will be capital  to  roll

over.   If a company has no business, its products cannot  sell,

then even if business

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>

cost  is reduced, wages of the workers are cut, the company will

eventually  have to close down, and the workers will lose  their

jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I remember

when I was a little boy, I used to venture into the compound  of

a  certain   house  in the kampong where I lived.   This  family

reared  a  few hens and a pig.  I particularly enjoyed  watching

the  hens  laying their eggs.  What amused me was  the  rate  at

which different hens laid their eggs.  Some laid a lot of   eggs

while some laid not as many.  One day I asked the master of  the

house,  who  was a respected kampong elder, why it was  so.   He

smiled  and  told me, "The healthier hens, those well  nourished

and  better fed ones, naturally are  more productive and can lay

more  eggs.   The  under-nourished and sickly ones,  of  course,

cannot  lay  as  many  eggs. But, If I were to  slaughter  these

weaker ones, then I would not even get one single egg from them.

"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like what the Chinese say, "If there is no soil, there

are no flowers."  Without hens, how do we get eggs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same with our workers today. They have answered the

call  for a wage reduction.  They are prepared to accept a  wage

cut,  not that they derive any pleasure in doing so, but because

they  know  that this is a bitter pill they have to  swallow  in

order  to  help  their employers tide over the  difficult  times

ahead.   If  the company can survive, they can keep their  jobs,

and  they   can then have take home pay to support the families.

We  should not slaughter the hens to get their eggs.  Therefore,

our   opposition  party  members  and  their  employers   should

understand the plight and intention of the workers.  Our workers

have  made  short term sacrifices and we hope that the employers

will  respond in kind.  They should manage their companies  well

so  that  the workers' sacrifices will not be in vain.  The  10%

cut  in  CPF  is painful but cannot be avoided. We must  prepare

well in advance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are not prepared, Mr Low would ask why we did not see it

fit to be prepared.   When we are prepared, he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>

asked why should we do so.  We do so in order to ensure that our

workers would keep their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers have shown guts and determination. They are

prepared  to  take  a  wage  cut.   However,  the  higher-income

executives  should make even bigger sacrifices  by  accepting  a

deeper  pay-cut.   If possible, the lower-income workers  should

be   spared  the  wage  cut.    As  the  biggest  employer,  the

Government should take the lead.  I believe our Government  will

do   so.    Sir,   today,  our  workers  have  manifested   such

determination  and spirit of unity and their sacrifice  deserves

our  applause.  They must not be forgotten when the  good  times

return.   The  employer should do the same.  We should  not  act

like the Opposition Members.  We should not add more troubles to

our  workers. If we are pragmatic, adjust our measures,  we  can

still live a comfortable life in Singapore.  Our market economy,

according to Mr Low, is without restraint.  Our economy develops

without  restraint.  Therefore, we are in this plight.  However,

what  I learnt from the various reports, I see quite a different

picture.  Many economists agree that because the Government  has

made proper policies to guide our economy, therefore, we are not

like  other  countries in this region who suffer gravely  during

the economic and financial turmoil.  He said we are unreasonable

in asking our workers to meet  the 1998 cost of living with 1994

level of wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the figures carefully, we will find that various

types  of  daily  necessities have fallen in prices.   The  NTUC

FairPrice  has benefited from the off-budget measures and  these

benefits  are  passed  on  to  the  consumers.   We  hope  other

businessmen should not find any pretext not to do so.   Whatever

savings they get, they should pass them on to the consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make another suggestion that our public

transport  cost be lowered. According to estimates, out  of  the

total  cost  in operating public transport, 50% comes  from  the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>workers' wages. So, with a 10% cut in the employers' CPF contri-Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>

bution,  the operational cost should be reduced by at least  4%.

I  suggest that the public transport operators give a 5%  rebate

to  passengers who purchase farecards.  For every  $10  farecard

purchased, a  50 cent rebate should be given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC cooperatives have also announced a series of measures

to  help  the workers. For example, NTUC FairPrice has announced

price reduction to  some of the sundry and daily essential goods

in  its  outlets. This will help to lower the cost of living  of

the  ordinary  workers.    We  hope all  these  well-intentioned

measures  will  receive  similar  response  from  merchants  and

supermarket operators to see how prices can be lowered.  When we

are  facing  an  economic crisis, we need to have  a  spirit  of

unity.   We  should look for the root causes of our  malaise  to

find out how the employers, Government and workers can unite and

work together to solve the problems.  If we take a short cut, as

what  our  neighbouring  countries have  done,  to  devalue  our

currency  or to make use of our financial surpluses and  reserve

to  tide  us  over the crisis,  we will bring more troubles  and

pains  to our economy, although these measures may appear to  be

painless  and  superficially effective.   Therefore,  we  should

think   of  pragmatic  measures.   We  should  bear  some  pain.

However,  as long as we believe all these efforts and sacrifices

are  for  a  better tomorrow, then I think we are in  the  right

direction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification from the Member, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Member mentioned

the   hen-and-egg dilemma. In his speech, he said that the  wage

cut  was to prepare for a rainy day.  If what he said was indeed

true, then I shall question the motive of the cuts in employers'

CPF  contribution rate and wages.  Are the cuts  necessary  now?

Or  is there a political motive over the proposed cuts?  You cut

the wages and CPF contribution now and then just before the next

General  Election  in  the year 2002, the  PAP  Government  will

increase the workers' wages to show that this Government is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>

better  than those in the other countries.  When we were at  the

outset of the economic crisis, many of our leaders said that our

economy  was  very  strong and our fundamentals  were  firm  and

sound. However, these fundamentals seem to be pretty shaky  now.

If the Government has been very effective, then our workers will

not  have  to face this drastic wage cut now.  This is like  two

athletes  taking part in a 400-metre race.  Athlete A fell  down

at  the  200-metre mark, while Athlete B continued  running  but

collapsed at the 300-metre mark.  Although both athletes did not

complete  the  race,  Athlete B turned to Athlete  A  and  said,

"Look,  I ran 100 metres more than you did. Therefore, I am  the

winner."

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was not going into the

argument  of  whether we have hens first  or  eggs  first.   The

example I quoted was to illustrate the point that  we must  have

a  healthy  hen  in  order to get good  eggs.   The  recommended

measures are meant to prepare us for the worst.  Just now Mr Low

remarked  that in February this year, DPM Lee had  claimed  that

our  economy  was  quite all right.  I do not know  whether  our

Opposition  Members  are  in  the  habit  of  not  reading   the

newspapers.   The   economy  changes  every  week,  every   day!

Today's  situation is very much different from what it  was  six

months ago.  As a matter of fact, even in the second quarter  of

this  year, we still had a positive growth.  But, by  the  third

quarter of this year, we began to have negative growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the various economic reports, we can see that certain

countries were not seriously affected by the financial crisis in

the  beginning.  However, they are in a significantly  different

situation  now.   For  example, a worker told  me  that  at  the

beginning of the crisis, people called it the "tongyam  effect",

because  it  originated  in Thailand.  Soon  after  that,  other

countries in the region were affected, and it became the  "Asian

flu".   With  the  troubles in Russia and  Latin  America,  this

crisis  is going   globalised.  It has become a global  economic

crisis.   The  world of economics is dynamic. It is not  static.

Therefore,  we  say  that  the  across-the-board  wage  cut   is

necessary.  No doubt, some companies are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>

still  making good profit.  To them, I say, "Please do not  take

these wage-cut measures rigidly."   They can reduce the price of

their  services  or  goods to help the workers.   Therefore,  we

should  look  at the situation as a whole.  If we  look  at  the

situation  from  some  small micro-perspectives,  then  it  will

enhance our workers' anxiety, as they do not know what to expect

next.   We  should be united, work as a team, be pragmatic,  and

then we will have a better tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): We often hear that the Singapore political

leaders  are far-sighted, having good judgement, and  that  they

have  "helicopter views".  Therefore, they should be  paid  very

high  salaries.  According to Mr Yeo, things change  every  day.

Our leaders' judgement is also changing all the time.  How could

they lead us if their views and judgements are changing all  the

time?   They have taken pride in their extraordinary  quality  - their  helicopter  view.   How  do you  explain  these  frequent

changes  in judgement?   Can we rely on them to make  the  right

judgement  to  lead  us out of  doom?  If their  judgements  are

changing  all  the time, they are no different from  people  who

play shares at the stock market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Low does not

understand the  expediency of "suiting measures to the time  and

local  conditions".  We should make decisions according  to  the

situation here and now, to look for the most effective  measures

to  tackle our problems head-on.  This is exactly  where we  are

different from the other governments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think if the judgements were to be changed every three months, I

do not know how the Government formulates its policies.  When we

want  to take a long-term view, how are we going to say that  we

should be expedient and make changes whenever necessary?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not understand why

the Opposition Member holds the view that for one to be capable,

one  has  to  set rules and stick to them in spite  of  changing

circumstances, without making the relevant adjustments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>

For  example,  if you are driving a car along a  certain  route,

there is a puddle of mud ahead of you, do you drive straight  on

irrespective of the conditions of the road, or would you  swerve

to a side and go round the puddle?  What we should do is to make

accurate  judgement  with  regard to the  situation  before  us.

Identifying  the problem is important. But just identifying  the

problem  is  not  enough.  We must look  for  solutions  to  the

problems.  We cannot tell the people that the economic situation

has changed and then stay on with the past policies and measures

to deal with the present situation.  Can we do that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am talking about

farsightedness, long-range view.  You cannot say  that  you  can

see  things  only for the next two months.  Otherwise,  how  can

anyone say that our leaders are farsighted?  The question is how

you  make your judgement, and whether your judgement is  correct

or not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If our Government's

judgement is not sound, if they are not capable, then today  how

do  we  have a Singapore which is least affected by the economic

turmoil?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I support Mr Yeo's views.

As  in the game of Chinese chess, whenever you make a move,  you

have   to  take  the  latest  development  on  the  board   into

consideration.   One  wrong move, and the whole  game  is  lost.

Therefore,  we  look at it as a whole.  If we want  to  win  the

whole  game, then we must make every move correctly and  at  the

correct time.  I am confident that the PAP will win the game.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): When the economy is good,

the  PAP  Government will claim that they have won because  they

have  a capable leadership.  But when economy is in a bad shape,

they  blame it on external forces.  Now, you win the chess game.

Is  it  because  you are clever or because your  opponent  falls

sick?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The important thing is

whether  the  standard  of living of the  people  of  Singapore,

not  getting  better  every year even though  it  is  under  the

leadership of the PAP.  When the external situation is  bad,  it

will still be bad for Singapore.  So it is not more good years.

do   not  understand  what  was  the  main  point  of  Mr  Low's

intervention.   What  I  know  for  sure  is  that  90%  of  our

Singaporeans   own  their  flats  and  we  have   a   manageable

unemployment  rate  although everyone  says  that  the  regional

economic situation is very bad.  But we are considered not  bad.

On the Internet, someone remarked that in Singapore, the acronym

IMF stand for "I am fine."

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

the  effects of this severe recession are well known and  keenly

felt  in  all sectors of the economy.  Companies have borne  the

brunt of falling businesses, rising unemployment, increases  the

anxieties of the consumers.  In turn, the contraction of  demand

sets   off  another  cycle  of  business  downturn.   Some  have

criticised  the  Government for responding  too  slowly  to  the

recession.   On the other hand, the Government has  earned  high

marks  both  internationally and from a majority of Singaporeans

for  her steady and measured response.  On a macro level, we are

progressing  well  to  address  the  problems  thrown  up.   The

Government  has  instituted steps to prepare  and  persuade  our

people  to  accept the bitter medicine.  It has to be  taken  at

this juncture.  This is but the first step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic situation is regional but could be global

soon,  if  Japan does not stimulate its economy.  We  also  know

that  the  American demand is already flagging as is evident  by

the latest report on non-oil domestic exports.  We should not be

gloomy  and  just wait for changes in the region to benefit  us.

We know this will not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>

be  in the near future.  Even then, things will not be the  same

again  and  we, the people of Singapore, must stand together  to

define  and achieve relevant new roles in the future millennium.

Cost-cutting  measure  is  a temporary  step  to  help  business

survive  and  save  jobs.  Doing this alone  cannot  ensure  our

success  in the new environment of a global economy.   Continual

long-term  development  towards a creative  and  knowledge-based

economy has to be pursued vigorously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness has recommended six

strategic responses to the crisis and recommended five  specific

measures to deal with immediate challenges posed by the regional

crisis.  I do not propose to read out what is clearly stated  in

pages 2 to 5 of the Report.  I think the one item that has  made

the headline is item 20.a. of the Report and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Reduce total wage costs (including contributions to the Central

Provident  Fund (CPF) by 15% from 1997 level to bring  our  wage

competitiveness, as measured by RULC, [that is the relative unit

labour  cost] back to the level of 1994.  To achieve  this,  the

employers'  CPF  contribution rate  should  be  reduced  by  10%

points.   The  rest  of the cost reduction  should  be  achieved

through the flexi-wage scheme, by a reduction in the annual  and

monthly variable components of wages.  The public sector  should

take the lead in this;'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support this recommendation. It

will  affect all individuals with CPF accounts.  It will  affect

their  housing loans and mortgage payments.  And it will  affect

their  overall  old age savings.  It will mean  that  they  will

suffer  a drop in their take-home pay if there is a further  cut

in  the  variable  wage  component.   All  these  will  have   a

tremendous  effect on Singaporeans, especially  the  middle  and

lower-income group.  Added to this is the fear of  job  loss  or

retrenchment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC's recommendation had been hotly debated by many.

Some  good and useful suggestions have been made.  But one thing

is  for  sure, people are agreeable fundamentally to the various

tough measures recommended.  They differ only in the sharing  of

the  burden  over the three sectors - the employees,  Government

and  the private business.  Although it has been explained  that

the employee's share is in line with its proportion in the total

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>

cost, I think that there is a case for the Government to take on

a bit more of the burden.  It is not that the Government has not

done  anything.  It has already given property tax  rebates  and

taken other steps to alleviate various sectors in the $2 billion

off-Budget package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the labour movement, through NTUC union

leaders'   alertness  and  tireless  work,  not  only  persuaded

successfully workers' acceptance of wage cuts but work  speedily

to come out with a package to help reduce the pain.  The various

steps  taken  by  NTUC  to  help is commendable  and  should  be

highlighted.  The NTUC should be praised for taking  steps  like

cutting  the  prices of groceries, 122 items had about  9%  cut,

childcare  centres,  NTUC pharmacies, Denticare,  and  providing

about  $2  million  loan  grant scheme  for  students  who  need

textbooks, and food outlets.  In addition, I learn that NTUC  is

using  $12  million  to  help  NTUC Income  policy  holders  and

borrowers  to  pay premiums and housing loans.   These  measures

worth $23 million will help to soften the effect of CPF and wage

cut  to  lower-income Singaporeans.  Singaporeans, on the whole,

as  I said, should be thankful that NTUC has come out to provide

this  safety net for some of the domestic costs.  For those  who

lost  their  jobs,  there  are  many  agencies  trying  to  find

alternative   jobs  for  them.   These  include  our   Community

Development Councils, the Ministry of Manpower and, again, NTUC.

Workers who need jobs should not be too fussy.  They should take

up the jobs given to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always depended on foreign workers to clean the tables

at  our hawker centres, domestic help and construction work.   I

think  the  time has come for Singaporeans to do some  of  these

tasks and be less dependent on foreign workers.  Attitudes  must

change to accept these jobs as an honest and respectable way  to

earn  a living.  I have come across many retrenched workers  who

are  unable  to  meet  payments  in  utilities  and  conservancy

charges.   Yet, they are reluctant to accept lower paying  jobs.

There  are  twin problems facing them.  One is in  the  area  of

utilities and conservancy charges.  The other one is to meet the

daily household

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>

needs.  I have therefore proposed to my Bukit Timah CDC to  help

pay  part of their arrears in utilities and conservancy  charges

provided  they first accept available jobs and show a commitment

to stay employed.  This will go a long way to ease their worries

on  overhanging  debts.  Businesses have also responded.   Banks

lower  interest rates and reschedule loans.  Rentals are falling

everywhere and in every sector, although my feedback is that the

largest property players are not responding in a significant way

to  the  tenants'  cries for help.  I hope  this  perception  is

wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people at the business sector are stretched. But the

Government still has substantial reserves and this is  the  time

to  stretch that hand and use that umbrella for a while.   Limit

to  a  quantum  we can afford without seriously undermining  the

economic  foundation.  I ask the Government to  look  into  this

because a fair number of Singaporeans cannot reconcile the  fact

that they have to take cuts on their wages and CPF, and yet  the

Government is prepared to give billions of dollars of  loans  to

our neighbouring countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchment and wage cuts are a real blow to many Singaporeans.

There  are a few categories.  (1) Those who have been retrenched

and  cannot find another job easily.  Many are sole breadwinners

of  the family.  (2) Young couples have problems with their  20%

cash  payment for the new HDB flats.  Perhaps, we should  reduce

this  to  10% on a case-by-case basis.  (3) Those whose CPF  are

fully  committed to housing loans but have no disposable  income

left  to  make up for the shortfall of the 10% cut.  The present

unemployment figure of 20,000 and above will be growing.  Unlike

in  1985,  this economic downturn is going to be more  prolonged

and its effects will be worse, primarily because of heavier loan

mortgages and a higher cost of living.  In 1985, housing was not

so expensive and people's commitments were less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer term issue is how are we to compete with our

neighbours when recovery comes as costs of doing business in the

neighbouring countries

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>

are very much lower.  This is one big challenge we face: how  to

convince investors to want to come here and set up business  and

thus  create jobs for our people despite our higher costs.   Our

strong  Singapore dollar compared to the devalued  baht,  rupiah

and  ringgit is an obvious factor.  But we have no intention  to

devalue our currency.  The Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister

and  the  Minister  for  Trade and Industry  have  many  a  time

explained why and I do not think I can do any better except that

I  support this view that our imports are obviously cheaper with

a  stronger Singapore dollar.  Our measures to bring down  costs

will  definitely help.  But I think it is still  not  enough  to

counter  the  much  lower business costs in Thailand,  Malaysia,

Indonesia and Korea.  Either we move our business to the region,

as some are doing, or we stay and find niche businesses that the

others are not able to compete with us.  It is easier said  than

done.   But we hope the EDB team will scout the globe  and  come

back  with  businesses  that will capitalise  on  our  country's

manpower and skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC has made recommendations on the strategies for the

future  competitiveness.   In particular,  emphasis  is  in  the

manufacturing and services sectors as its twin engines of growth

and  these  are  correct  strategies.  We  must  avoid  being  a

property  economy as it is very unproductive.  The  emphasis  on

hub  services is a good move in the right direction.  We  should

build  Singapore  as a premier service hub in Asia,  emphasising

our  existing  hub services where we have achieved international

repute,  for example, financial services, international trading,

transport and logistics, exhibition management and tourism,  and

of  course develop new high growth hub services in health  care,

education,   media  communication  and  information   technology

services, e-commerce and direct marketing.  All these are in the

Report, and they are good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these recommendations by the CSC, page 118 of the

Report  calls on the Government to review Government regulations

and bureaucratic red tape.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>

Page  118  of the Report, item 12.b., lays down how to  minimise

the costs of compliance incurred by businesses, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We should consider setting up an Inter-Ministry Committee to

coordinate the formulation and implementation of all  rules  and

regulations  to  ensure that there is no  conflict  or  overlap.

This  Committee  should be an extension of the SIU.   Government

agencies can further increase their cooperation so as to improve

efficiency;'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was reminded, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I was the

Chairman of the Feedback Unit, there was a call for the  setting

up of an Inter-Ministry Committee.  Many similar calls were made

by  the  private sector then to see whether we could  coordinate

many  of  the issues that involve different Ministries  and  the

setting  up of an Inter-Ministry Committee was called upon.   It

never took off.  Now that the Committee has made such a call,  I

do  hope it will be implemented.  And I guess one reason for the

Ministry in not setting up this Inter-Ministry Committee is that

most  Ministries guard their turfs very jealously.  I think  the

Prime  Minister's  Office should take the lead  in  establishing

this Inter-Ministry Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we lose out in labour cost, we must make up through a

highly-skilled,  well-trained, disciplined and agile  workforce,

able   to   master  new  technologies,  especially   information

technology  and  new  skills.  We must always  be  prepared  for

change.   I agree with the Deputy Prime Minister when  he  said,

"Change  will  affect  not  just individuals,  but  also  entire

sectors of the economy."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way forward, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is to strengthen our

key  success  factors, that is, to build on our  strength,  good

infrastructure,  good communication links, good services,  clean

Government  and, of course, very important, political stability.

An  investor wants to make sure he gets returns for his  capital

investment  as quickly as possible.  Through today's  debate  on

the  CSC's  Report  and other sub-committees' reports,  we  have

shown  the  world  that Singapore is determined  to  better  the

investment  climate.  This will be a clear signal that  we  will

adapt  change  to meet the new business climate and Singaporeans

will be seen as a unique

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>

people,  ready to accept even pay cuts at a tremendous  personal

sacrifice  to  meet this challenge, a gesture  that  shocked  my

friends in the West and in Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is not the first time nor will

it be a one-off affair.  We did it in 1985 and I am sure we will

do  it  again, if need be.  Those who are watching how we manage

the  recession will marvel at our people's sacrifice.  They know

that  we  are  a  tough  people, that we  tackle  our  difficult

problems head on and that Singaporeans work and fight as a  team

when the going gets tough.  I support the recommendations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, after much deliberation for more than a year,  the

Committee  on  Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) presented  this

Report and its contents are down-to-earth and has touched a wide

spectrum  of issues.  It has comprehensively reviewed the  long-term  competitiveness  of Singapore in the international  market

and  put forward many truly feasible recommendations.  This  can

well  be said to be the compass to guide Singapore's economy  in

maintaining  its  competitive edge to  face  challenges  in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Report comprises two main components: short-term

measures  and long-term strategies.  As a Nominated MP  speaking

in  this solemn forum on national affairs as a representative of

the  industrial and commercial sector, I would like  to  present

our  views  and  raise some supplementary suggestions  from  the

angle  of  the  industrial and commercial sector.   This  is  my

obligation, as well as my duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me reflect to

this House the views of the industrial and commercial sector  on

the  short-term measures as recommended in this Report.  The CSC

Report  has  recommended  certain measures  such  as  wage-cuts,

reduction  in  foreign worker levies, land and factory  rentals,

Government  charges, etc.  As a representative of the industrial

and  commercial sector, I am most concerned with  business  cost

and therefore I will spend some time on this aspect.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our industrial and commercial sector, particularly the

SMEs, is facing unprecedented operational difficulties.  At this

critical  moment of life and death for companies and enterprises

in  Singapore,  the  suggested package of  $10  billion  or  15%

reduction  in  business cost is like sending a  pot  of  red-hot

charcoal in a snowy weather, something deserving our support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we feel that in order to assist our local

enterprises  effectively, particularly the SMEs, to continue  to

survive  in  this economic crisis, the business cost  should  be

reduced  by  at  least  20%.   Only then  can  we  maintain  our

competitiveness.    Under   the  present   economic   situation,

particularly at a time when our currency is much higher than the

other countries in this region, we feel that a 15% reduction  in

the  total  business  cost  may not be  enough  to  enhance  our

competitiveness in the international market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as early as the beginning of this year, based on

feedback from our members and businessmen in the industrial  and

commercial sector, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and  Industry

has recommended some cost-saving measures such as a reduction on

total  wage-cost, Government taxes, foreign worker levies,  land

and factory rentals, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent interview with Lianhe Zaobao, the Chairman of the

National Wages Council (NWC) Prof. Lim Chong Yah, said  that  in

order  for Singapore to be competitive, business cost should  be

reduced  by at least 20%.  Prof. Lim is a very serious economist

and  since he holds such a view, I feel that our request  for  a

20% reduction in our business cost is a reasonable one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the CSC Report has recommended an annual 15% reduction

on  the  total  business cost in five areas, namely,   wage-cut,

reduction in foreign worker levies, lowering of land and factory

rentals and  lowering of Government charges, and tax-cuts, apart

from recommending a 10%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>

reduction  in  the  employers' CPF  contribution  rate  and  the

foreign  worker levies to be reduced by $50-$100,  there  is  no

specific suggestion on the other areas.  It is indeed a pity!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the figures released by the National Wages Council,

the 10% cut in employers' CPF contribution would reduce the wage

cost  by  $4  billion.  By reducing 5% to 8% in the total  wage-cost,  there will be a further reduction of $2.5 billion  to  $4

billion.  By combining these two measures, the wage-cost can  be

reduced by a total of $6.5 billion to $8 billion or 13%  to  16%

of the employee's national total income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when announcing these guidelines,

the  NWC has also urged the employers to consider a smaller  cut

for  employees  in the lower income group and a bigger  cut  for

higher  pay  senior executives in cutting the  wage  costs.   Mr

Stephen  Lee,  President  of the Singapore  National  Employers'

Federation  and  Mr  Wee  Cho  Yao, Chairman  of  the  Singapore

Federation  of Chinese Clans Association, also appealed  to  the

CEOs and senior managerial staff, including company shareholders

and   directors,  to  lead  in  taking  bigger  cuts  in   their

remuneration.  We welcome this appeal and pledge to give it  our

full support.  At the same time, we hope that Government leaders

and  senior civil servants would also take the lead in having  a

bigger  wage  cut  to show they are prepared to sacrifice  along

with the people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a comment in the latest issue of the NTUC News, the

cost-reduction  package,  recommended  by  CSC,  totalling   $10

billion is made up of  15% reduction each from the wage cost and

non-wage  cost components in the total business cost.   Although

in  percentage terms, they are 15% each, in real terms the wage-cost  reduction  amounts to $7.5 billion but the  non-wage  cost

reduction  is  only $2.5 billion.  All the time,  we  have  been

emphasising the close tripartite relationship and cooperation of

workers, employers and Government.  DPM Lee has also pointed out

recently that this is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>

unique  feature  in our economy that gives us  our   competitive

edge.   We  feel  that  this very close tripartite  relationship

should  not  be undermined.  What we are worried  is  that  this

lopsided  arrangement, with the workers taking the bulk  of  the

cut,  may  cause them to be unhappy, thereby weakening our  such

strong tripartite relationship.  We are however relieved to note

the  clarifications by the leadership of the NTUC that the  wage

cost  and  non-wage cost reductions are of equal  magnitude  and

there is no question of unfairness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: does the reduction of wage cost and non-wage

cost  components  have  to  be the same?   Should  the  workers'

sacrifice  and the Government's cost-saving offers  be  matched?

We  are  of  the  view  that the Government being  the  national

resource controller and mobiliser should bear a larger burden of

social  responsibility.  So long as it is within its means,  the

Government should make bigger sacrifices than the workers.   The

non-wage  cost  reduction should be bigger than  the  wage  cost

reduction, and it should not be a 50-50 ratio between the two.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, when the Singapore economy was

performing  well,  like the private sector, Government  agencies

have  been making profits or at least not operating at  a  loss,

and  they  have  therefore accumulated lots of  assets  for  the

Government and the people.  However, when the country is  facing

an   economic  downturn,   the  Government  should  change   its

strategies  and make expedient plans to save the situation.   It

should reduce service charges and taxes so as to create a better

environment  for  the  business, and ensure  that  companies  in

Singapore  continue to survive and the workers'  rice-bowls  are

protected.   This  would  also  help  to  attract  more  foreign

investments   to   Singapore,   thereby   creating   more    job

opportunities for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese proverb which says, "Store your grains to

provide  for  the  lean  years".  In  the  ancient  agricultural

society,  whenever  there was a bumper  harvest,  the  authority

would store the grains in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>

warehouse, so that when there was a lean year and when you faced

famine,  the local government would open the warehouses and  use

the  stored  grains to feed the people.  Now that the  Singapore

economy  is  encountering a lean year, should not the Government

consider taking out part of its accumulated budget surpluses  to

help  the people?  When the other countries in this region, such

as  Japan  and Malaysia, proposed their packages to  save  their

economies,  they  did not ask their people to accept  wage-cuts.

But  in Singapore, we are asking our people to make such  a  big

sacrifice and the Government is only matching it with  an  equal

percentage of reduction in non-wage costs.  I think this is  not

convincing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its Report, the CSC made some recommendations for non-wage cost reductions. Basically, we agree with these

recommendations  but we feel that the non-wage  cost  reductions

can be more substantive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we suggest that the rebate given by

JTC  on land rents be raised to 30%, and the factory rentals  be

reduced by 25%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also request the HDB to reduce the commercial and industrial

property  rental prices to that of the 1990 level, and  we  hope

that Singapore Power could  pass its savings in operational cost

to  the  consumers by reducing the electricity tariffs. We  also

suggest  that  the  property  tax  rebates  for  industrial  and

commercial properties be raised from 55% to 65%, and the rebates

be  extended to cover residential properties as well.  This will

help  to  stimulate the property market.  The Government  should

also  review  the  annual value of these properties  quickly  to

reflect the current market value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate income tax should be reduced from 26% to 25%. Petrol

duties  should be reduced by 30%, and road tax should be further

reduced by 30%.  Port charges should be reduced by 20%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We commend the CSC for suggesting that the foreign worker

levy be reduced

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>

between $50 and $100.  But, we feel that it should be reduced by

at  least $200.  At the same time, the Government should cut the

foreign maid levy  down from $345 to $200.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also suggest that the ERP charges should be capped at a

maximum  of  $5  per day.  We feel that the LTA  should  further

reduce  the ERP charges so as to reduce the transportation  cost

to   help  particularly  the  commercial  sector,  and  also  to

stimulate growth in the retail industry.  We would, once  again,

urge  the Government to reduce the GST by 2% so that we pay only

1% GST.  This will stimulate consumption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Telecom should reduce the charges for commercial

telephone  lines by 30% and the residential lines by  20%.   For

mobile  phones,  the air-time charges should be  reduced  to  10

cents per call and the changes should only be levied on outgoing

calls.  We are of the view that Singapore Telecom should use the

cost   savings   from   wage   cuts   to   reduce   its   entire

telecommunication charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all the costs mentioned above are tangible costs.

Apart  from all these, there are also the intangible costs,  eg,

time  cost.  What is time cost?  Time cost is something that  is

caused  by  the  bureaucracy in the Government departments.   In

some companies, some officers have been deployed specifically to

deal  with correspondence with ministries, statutory boards  and

Government  agencies.   These  are very  complicated  and  time-consuming  matters.   Sometimes, you have to  wait  one  to  two

months for a simple application to be processed and approved  by

the relevant authorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to the businessmen, time is money. If

the processing procedure of official documents takes such a long

time, it is not in line with the PS21 spirit of high efficiency,

particularly in application processing.  DPM Lee Hsien Loong has

recently made an illustration to describe the difference between

Singapore and Hong Kong.  He

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>

said, "In Hong Kong, if there is no law to say specifically that

you cannot do a certain thing, then you can just go ahead and do

it.  But  in Singapore, if the law does not specifically provide

for you to do it, then you are not allowed to do it!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are about to enter the 21st century.

This  is going to be a brand new era.  It will be a sorry  state

of  affair  if  Singaporeans are still  stuck  in  the  backward

mentality  of "no law to say you can do it, then you  cannot  do

it".  This certainly does not encourage creativity.

Of course, we should not be like Hong Kong where "so long as the

law  does not say you cannot do, then you can do it".  We do not

want  to have that!   However, we should find a point of balance

between  these two extremes.  I feel that if the Government  can

change   old  mindset  and to be more  open-minded,   a  lot  of

unnecessary bureaucracy can be done away, and its efficiency can

be greatly enhanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey conducted on the 3rd November by the

Singapore  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  among  the

101  people who responded to the survey, 28% indicated that they

were prepared to use the savings from the cost-reduction package

to  discharge  the company's outstanding debts.  44%  said  that

they would use the money to seek and open new markets.  38% said

they  would  strengthen their marketing activities to  stimulate

sales  and  62% said that they would use the savings from  cost-reduction to keep their existing employees in employment.    36%

said  that they would pass on the savings to their customers  by

reducing  the prices of their products and services.   26%  said

that  they  would  use the money to invest  in  new  plants  and

equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government can make bigger reductions in non-wage cost, I

believe that the companies would be more active in responding to

the  appeal  of  the  Government and the NTUC  to  make  greater

efforts in the interest of their own survival and development to

improve on their operations, explore new source of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>

income, reduce wasteful expenditure and endeavour to reduce  the

prices  of  their  products and services.   By so  doing,  their

productivity  will  go  up,   their  sales  will  pick  up,  and

confidence  will  be  restored to the market,  thereby  assuring

workers of their job security and career advancement prospects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to

call  upon  all  the businessmen to lower the  prices  of  their

products and services by making use of the savings from the cost-reduction  measures, and thereby alleviating the burden  of  our

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other five short-term strategies recommended by

the  CSC,  that is, to prevent a credit crunch, to  sustain  the

confidence of our investors, to restructure our economy, to open

new  markets,  and  to look for new regional opportunities.   We

totally  agree  with  the recommendations but  the  question  is

whether  they  are feasible or not.  For example,  the  CSC  has

recommended a strategy to prevent a credit crunch by saying that

we  should expand our Local Enterprise Assistance schemes to our

SMEs,  so  as to give our promising companies more liquidity  in

their  capital.   This  is good.  But the  banks  are  now  very

cautious  and have tightened their credit facilities.   They  do

not  want  to commit themselves in providing more assistance  to

our SMEs.  This may contradict the recommendation of the CSC and

warrant our attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CSC Report has also proposed eight major strategies in

the long-term development of Singapore economy.  Let me give  my

view  on these strategies.  The CSC believes that, for the  next

10  years,   manufacturing and services should  continue  to  be

emphasised  as  the twin engines of growth to develop  Singapore

into   an   advanced   knowledge-based  economy    with   global

competitiveness.  Such  a vision is undoubtedly  wonderful,  and

very   attractive.   If   realised,   it  would  certainly  make

Singapore a paradise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific recommendation by the Committee is that our

manufacturing industry, including our local enterprises

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>

and  the  MNCs, should work together to produce high value-added

products  and  to  provide a base for related services  in  this

region.   As  for  the service industry, it should  develop  its

present  areas of service, to cultivate new areas and to develop

Singapore  into  Asia's No. 1 service hub.  The  Committee  also

suggests  that  the Government should appoint  a  lead  economic

promotion agency to review and champion the developments of each

service  industry with the support of other Government  agencies

as a total approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fully appreciative of the CSC for this specific

recommendation,   particularly the part that calls for a  review

of  the existing policies and the departments which provide  the

regulatory  framework.  We  feel  that  the  Government   should

immediately  establish an inter-Ministry task-force,  preferably

to  be  led  by  the  Prime  Minister's  Office,  to  conduct  a

comprehensive  review  on the bye-laws and  regulations  of  the

various  Government departments.  All those which are no  longer

relevant,  not conducive to business operations, or  unnecessary

over-lapping should be repealed and removed as soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, strengthening our external wing. We agree that we

should  help our companies to go regional because the  Singapore

domestic  market is much too small.  Opening of oversea  markets

will  beneft our local enterprises.  However, we hope  that  the

Government  could set up an Overseas Investment Risk  Fund.   In

this  way, when our investments in the overseas markets were  to

encounter   unfavourable   situations,  such  as  the  political

turmoil  in  Indonesia, then we would at least have  some  basic

protection and we would not lose every cent of our investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third long-term strategy is to build up world-class local

companies.  Our Government-linked companies are very  strong  in

resources.   They are in the best position to take the  lead  in

developing our local skills, venturing overseas, and  eventually

evolving into our very own MNCs.  But the question is: is  there

any part where our SMEs can play in the process?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>

We  hope  that Singapore will emulate the companies in Japan  or

Italy, such as Toyota or Fiat.  They go to various countries  in

the  world to open their markets and their local  SMEs were able

to   hitch-hike   on  their  successes.   The  Government-linked

companies  should provide opportunities for SMEs to  participate

in providing peripheral services.  They should not be completely

profit-orientated  and go for the kill in all their  endeavours,

such  as  speculating in the property market.  It was said  that

recently a Government-linked company even wanted to venture into

the  roast duck business.  Of course, there are many avenues for

investment.  But if you are using a cannon to hunt for sparrows,

then  you  are  wasting  your talents  and  resources  on  petty

undertakings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, strengthening our base of SMEs. The report

recommended that  we should help the SMEs to give full  play  to

their   potential  so  that  they  could  be  strengthened   and

eventually  developed into our future MNCs.  But  there  are  no

specific recommendations on how to go about doing it.   We  feel

that the Government should grant more concessions to our SMEs on

taxes,  skill  development opportunities and on the distribution

of  resources, so that they will not be stagnated at its present

stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully agree with the fifth long-term strategy on having

human and intellectual capital as a key competitive edge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sixth strategy of leveraging on science and

technology  and  innovation, we feel that  it  is  a  very  good

suggestion.    The  question  is whether  or  not  our  business

administration  concept can catch up with the express  train  of

information era, for example, whether or not we can  accept  the

concept  of  having  our  employees  working  from  home,  using

computer  network  and  other information technology  equipment.

Then, they will not need to go to office to work.  If we can let

30% of our employees operate from their homes, then we would  be

able to save a lot of office space, which means savings

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>

on  office  rents as well as transport expenses.  The  employees

will  save  a  lot  of time travelling to and from  office.   Of

course,  LTA  may  lose some revenue as the number  of  vehicles

passing through the ERP gantry points during peak hours will  be

significantly  reduced.   In any event,  if Singapore is  really

going to leverage on the cutting edge of information technology,

the  most  important  thing  is  to  change  from  our  outdated

industrial age  business administration  concept to fit into the

various policies based on the latest information technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh strategy is to optimise resource management.

Yes, we agree that we should make full use of our land resources

and  to  have  better  management of our  water  resources.   We

support  the recommendation to set up a committee or  agency  to

look  into  our land distribution and pricing policy. We  should

also  proceed to have the desalination plant as planned so  that

we  can  make full use of the abundant water resources from  the

ocean  around us.  I suggest that the relevant authority  should

perhaps  learn from the Chinese scientists and try to  introduce

the Chinese technology of desalination to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully agree with the eighth long-term strategy ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, your time is up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

today  we  meet under difficult circumstances.  Our  economy  is

technically in recession.  Many of my fellow workers  have  been

retrenched.   More  will lose their jobs, not because  they  are

incompetent  or  because the companies are  badly  run.   It  is

because we are victims of the regional economic crisis.  But  we

will  fight to regain our competitiveness.  That is why we  have

accepted  an overall wage reduction.  We in the labour  movement

fully  support  the  measures recommended by  the  Committee  on

Singapore's Competitiveness.  The CSC has not only proposed wage

cuts,  but  it has charted a more durable future for  Singapore.

It is a future where the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>

fortunes of one sector of the economy will not have too great an

impact  on  the  development of our economy as  a  whole.   Yes,

diversification  is the in-thing.  Over the  years,  our  unions

have  secured  better  wages and more fringe  benefits  for  our

members.   Despite  this,  we have been  able  to  attract  more

foreign  investments.  Why?  Because we have shown to be capable

and  productive  workers.   Regrettably,  the  currency  of  our

neighbours depreciated to a larger extent than ours in  relation

to the US dollar.  This has eroded our competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an employee in the electronics industry, I can sense the

sharp  downturn.   It  is  difficult to have  to  tell  workers,

"Sorry, you have to go on shorter work week or you have to  stay

away  from  work  for  a  while."   This  means  not  only   the

disappearance  of overtime, but also a pay cut in basic  salary.

It is even more heart-rending when you have to tell the workers,

"Very  sorry,  you  are retrenched."  Many of  those  retrenched

workers have given the best years of their lives to the company.

I   must  acknowledge  here  that  it  is  equally  painful  for

management  to  part with loyal and hardworking  employees.   To

their credit, some managements have gone all the way out to work

with unions to help these workers marked for retrenchment.  They

give us advance notice so that we can do two things:  to arrange

for  training  of  these workers and find alternative  jobs  for

them.   Other  companies have also been just as  helpful.   They

take  these retrenched workers on board, send them for  training

under  the  Skills Redevelopment Programme and give  them  every

encouragement  to do well, sometimes entirely in  the  new  work

environment.   Without such caring employers, our workers  would

have  to  face even more trying times.  But this is not  to  say

that   all  managements  are  reasonable.   Some  have   behaved

disgracefully and treated workers with little or no  compassion.

But by and large, our managements are an enlightened lot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the problems faced by retrenched

workers.  Those with families to look after and housing loans to

service  are  the ones who need to get jobs quickly.   But  what

kind of jobs are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>

available  in  the market?  Sometimes these retrenched  workers,

especially the older ones, face particular difficulties.  It  is

not  because  they  want  to pick and  choose.   Please  let  me

explain.  A factory operator may have a low education.   But  if

he  is laid off, can he find another similar post?  In the past,

yes.   Today, it is not that easy.  His low education,  his  low

level  of  skills,  his  age - these all  become  barriers.   Of

course, we can tell him to go for training to acquire new skills

but  this  is  easier said than done.  If he cannot upgrade  his

skills,  does it mean that he will face structural unemployment?

The  answer is yes, unless he can change his mindset and  accept

any job open to him.  Again, this is easier said than done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have 600,000 foreign workers in our midst. So even if

20,000  or  30,000 Singaporeans lose their jobs, we  should  not

have  any problems finding jobs for them.  No, we are not asking

for  every  retrenched Singaporean we should get a foreigner  to

make way for a Singaporean.  This is not the way things work and

this  is not the way we do it.  Foreign workers are here because

we  need  them.   Just  because we run into a  serious  economic

crisis  does not mean that we have to send them back  just  like

that.   The  point I am making is that there are jobs for  those

who  are retrenched and they can apply for them.  But these  may

not  be  the  kind  of  job that they want.   That  is  why  our

retrenched workers should reconsider the options.  Is it the pay

that  is a deterrent?  Is it the distance from home?  Is it  the

conditions of work?  Whatever it is, we must solve this problem,

otherwise we will be stuck with structural unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, employers can help by not turning people down

for  work simply on account of age.  Allow me to raise the  case

of  a  man.   He  is  52 years old and who used  to  work  as  a

storekeeper in  a fashion house.  He was retrenched.  He applied

for many jobs but was turned down.  He thinks it was because  of

his  age.   Even  when  he applied for a  job  in  a  Government

Ministry, the first question he was asked was to state his  age.

The man could not understand why his age was so critical when he

was applying for the post

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>

of  an  office attendant.  By the way, the man remains  jobless,

worried sick and he has to support his family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are no longer an economy with full employment. The

unemployment  rate  has risen to 4.5% in  September,  but  I  am

confident that we can have what it takes to overcome our present

difficulties.  Tripartism in Singapore is not a slogan.  It is a

reality.  So there is no need for us to be despondent.   We  can

and we will emerge from the crisis stronger and more resilient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, in the past, in good times when NWC announced the

guidelines,  food prices, especially cooked food, coffee  prices

and  transport charges went up.  I hope today in this  difficult

situation, when NWC has already announced a wage cost reduction,

the hawkers, the coffeeshop owners and the bus operators are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>

sympathetic enough to reduce their prices.

<div align="center"><b>REVAMPING OF EDUCATION SYSTEM</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Progress)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) what

is  the  progress  of his Ministry's efforts  in  revamping  the

education system; (b) whether his Ministry has been implementing

this  on a pilot basis in primary and secondary schools and,  if

so,  whether there are any specific results; and (c) what is his

assessment  of the revamp in terms of preparing our students  to

confront the new challenges of a knowledge-based economy.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system has served us well over the years. Today,

we have a fundamentally sound system where  quality education is

delivered  to  all  our  pupils,  not  just  the  best  and  the

brightest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE thus does not intend to revamp our whole system radically.

What  we  seek to do is to re-position and refine the system  to

develop our young to meet future challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three key trends have emerged for the future: globalisation,

rapid  technological change and transition to a knowledge  based

economy.    Given   these  trends  and  the  challenges   facing

Education, we have to re-align the focus of our education system

towards developing the full spectrum of talents and abilities of

every child, and not just in terms of academic achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-positioning of the education system aims to put in place

ways  to  identify  and help every child  maximise  his  or  her

talents  and abilities and harness their potential.  As part  of

the process, we have identified six strategic areas of focus for

the next five years.  These are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, designing a responsive education structure. We want

to be able to identify the talents and abilities of our students

early,  and to design educational programmes to cater  to  their

different needs.  We want to customise, as much as possible  and

within limits of our resources, the education being delivered to

each child;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, inculcate values and nurture thinking skills

through  the  formal  and  informal curricula.   The  three  big

initiatives that we have embarked on, namely National Education,

Nurturing  Thinking Skills, and Masterplan for IT in  Education,

are part of overall efforts to achieve this;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, creating a leaner-centred school environment. This

encompasses  MOE's  management of schools,  our  philosophy  and

principles, school leadership, school appraisal and ranking, the

role  of  the  community  in schools,  and  of  schools  in  the

community, and school infrastructural programmes;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, building a quality teaching service. The teacher

is  key to everything we do in Education.  We need to equip  and

continually  develop the teacher, to whom we entrust  the  heavy

responsibility of moulding the lives of our young; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, developing Singapore into an Education Hub. As a

critical  part  of Singapore's transition towards  a  knowledge-based  economy, we need  to position ourselves  as a talent  and

knowledge capital.  MOE's role is to develop Singapore  into  an

education  hub  through a two-prong approach: first,  developing

and hosting institutions that can provide an excellent education

for  Singaporeans, and second, to attract quality  talent,  both

local and foreign to these institutions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, MOE will provide excellent

administrative support to our schools and institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have embarked on the new initiatives in recent years.

After  some  initial adjustment problems, schools are  embracing

National Education and the introduction of IT. Education  is  an

investment  for  the  long-term.  We see  encouraging  signs  of

enthusiasm and change.  The real benefits will come only in  the

long-term,  when our economy remains resilient and  competitive,

and when our society remains cohesive and vibrant.

<div align="center"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVANTS' PAY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will

furnish  statistics  on  the  rates  of  increases/decreases  in

respect of civil servants' pay from 1988 to 1997.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b>



The average increase in the wage bill for civil servants for the

period  1987 to 1998 is 4.2% per year. Details are given in  the

table below.



<pre>

      Year      Wage Bill     % change over

                (million)     previous year

      1988       $ 1,840            -

      1989       $ 1,935          5.2%

      1990       $ 2,065          6.7%

      1991       $ 2,069          0.2%

      1992       $ 1,925          -7.0%

      1993       $ 1,969          2.3%

      1994       $ 2,244          14.0%

      1995       $ 2,252          0.4%

      1996       $ 2,487          10.4%

      1997       $ 2,629          5.7%

           Average                4.2%

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change in the wage bill is a function of many factors

such as the size and structure of the Service. For example,  the

proportion  of Division I officers in the Service  has  doubled,

from  17%  of the total population in 1988 to 34% in 1997  while

the percentage of Division III officers has dropped from 31%  to

25%,  and  Division IV officers, from 19% to 10%, over the  same

period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large increase in 1994 (14.0%) was due to a major

salary  revision exercise in that year. The salary revision  was

introduced in conjunction with the introduction of co-payment of

medical  expenses.  Civil Servants who accepted the new  medical

schemes  which  required them to co-pay  medical  expenses  were

given salary revisions averaging about 7%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in 1996 (10.4%) was also larger than normal

because  of the relatively bigger NWC wage adjustment (6.5%)  in

that year. In addition, there was also an increase in the number

of  Division I officers in 1996 by 16.5%, which is significantly

higher than the average increase of 9.3% per year for the period

1988  to 1997. The increase of  Division I officers in 1996  was

largely due to an increase in the recruitment of teachers.

<br><br><!-- Prof S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period May 1997 to October 1998, Singapore offered

a total of S$11.5 million worth of technical assistance to ASEAN

countries  under  the  Singapore Co-operation  Programme  (SCP),

which  is managed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The  areas

in  which  ASEAN  nationals  have been  trained  under  the  SCP

included English language, trade and investment promotion, civil

aviation, port management, productivity, community policing  and

search and rescue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Singapore ministries and agencies have also

<div align="center"><b>COURT ORDER MAINTENANCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Law

(a) from January 1997 to October 1998, how many ex-husbands have

evaded  Court  Order Maintenance; (b) what enforcement  measures

are in place to make sure ex-husbands pay up their dues; and (c)

if his Ministry will request the Central Provident Fund Board to

release  the  funds which the ex-husbands have and pay  the  ex-wives and children what they are legally entitled to.



<br><br><!-- Prof S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof S Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) From January 1997 to October 1998, how many ex-husbands

have evaded Court Order Maintenance?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evasion of Court Maintenance Order is taken to mean non-payment of maintenance orders in part or in whole when the

payments  become  due.  The  number  of  applications  for   the

enforcement of maintenance orders from January 1997  to  October

1998  is  5833. This figure also includes applications filed  by

guardians who are not wives against the parent(s) of children as

there is no separate categorisation of applications filed by ex-husbands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What enforcement measures are in place to make sure ex-husbands pay up their dues?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 71 and Part IX of the Women's Charter, when a

person  who has been ordered to pay maintenance fails to do  so,

the court may make one of the following orders:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 1 month

for each month of maintenance arrears;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) issue a warrant to levy;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) make a garnishee order against monies due or owing to

the respondent; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) make an attachment order against the salary or income

of the respondent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If his Ministry will request the Central Provident Fund

Board  to release the funds which the ex-husbands have  and  pay

the ex-wives and children what they are legally entitled to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, CPF savings can only be withdrawn when a member

satisfies the conditions for CPF withdrawal (eg. when he reaches

age  55  after  setting  aside  his  Minimum  Sum  and  Medisave

retention sum). Under section 24 of the CPF Act, CPF savings are

protected against any claims and debts as such savings are meant

to  meet  members' old age and medical needs. Hence, CPF savings

cannot   be   released   to  meet  the  ex-husband's   financial

obligations including his monthly Court Order Maintenance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where the Court confers in favour of the ex-wife a

proprietory  interest  in the ex-husband's  CPF  savings  and  a

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Drainage Department of Ministry of the Environment has

repaired  2.5 km of damaged drains in Sennett Estate since  1997

as  part  of  its  on-going  island  wide  drainage  maintenance

programme.   The  observation by ENV officers is  that  stagnant

water  in  the drains is often due to litter in the  drains.  Mr

Chiam can help to reduce this problem by encouraging members  of

the public in the area to refrain from littering.   Mr Chiam can

also inform ENV directly should he be aware of any damaged drain

in Sennett Estate that needs repairing.

if  he  will appeal to stallholders in hawker centres to  reduce

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rental rebates for hawker stalls are only given to those

hawkers  who are paying market rates. These are the hawkers  who

were  allocated stalls at market rates or obtained their  stalls

through the public tendering system. They represent about 9%  of

the total hawker population in the Government hawker centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are paying rents below market rates are not given

any rental rebates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food prices are best left to the hawkers individually to

set.  Hawkers are, however, required to display price  tags  and

sell  their food according to the prices indicated.  I  am  sure

hawkers will be prudent in setting their prices; otherwise  they

may  end up pricing themselves out of business, especially under

the present economic situation.

<div align="center"><b>RETRENCHMENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower if he will give an update on the number of persons  who

are  over  45 and who have been retrenched; and what  mechanism,

training programmes and types of job placement opportunities are

in  place  to enable these older persons to participate  in  the

economy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one third (36%) of the retrenched local workers in the

first  half  of  1998 were aged 45 and above.  Nearly  one-fifth

(19%) were aged 50 or older. In a softening labour market, older

workers   affected   by  retrenchment  would   experience   more

difficulty   finding  new  jobs  compared   to   their   younger

counterparts. The Ministry is concerned over this group  of  job

seekers.   We  have  been  urging  employers  to  refrain   from

discriminating against older workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as employment assistance is concerned, the Ministry of

Manpower's   Employment   Service  Department   (ESD)   provides

employment  assistance to Singaporeans and  Permanent  Residents

regardless  of  their  age. All the nine  Community  Development

Councils  (CDCs)  and  other  self-help  and  voluntary  welfare

organisations  also have employment assistance schemes  to  help

their  residents/members look for jobs. They are linked to ESD's

JOB  System  through the Ministry's LabourNet, which allows  on-line registration and job matching for job seekers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has also formed an Employment Facilitation Team

(EFT)  to  proactively  reach  out  to  displaced  workers   and

companies  still recruiting workers.  The EFT keeps  in  contact

with  industries and companies that have the potential to  offer

new  employment opportunities. EFT officers meet  with  industry

and  company  personnel to assess their employment requirements.

The  EFT  visits  companies  that  have  decided  to  carry  out

retrenchments  so  as  to  determine the  assistance  needed  by

affected  workers to obtain alternative employment, and  provide

any  necessary counselling. The EFT also organises industry  job

fairs,  often  in cooperation with the CDCs, in order  to  bring

together  job seekers and prospective employers at a  convenient

location.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to training programmes, the older and less-educated

workers who are forty years old and above are a target group  of

the  Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP). The SRP was  launched

in  December  1996 by the National Trades Union  Congress  as  a

tripartite initiative to enhance the employability of the  local

workforce by encouraging

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>

employers to undertake skills upgrading for their employees.  In

promoting training among the older workers, the aim is to extend

their   employability  by  10  to  15  years  in  their  current

companies,  or  for  suitable jobs in other companies.   Of  the

6,115  workers  who  either  have  completed  training  or   are

currently  being trained under the SRP, more than 2,800  workers

or 46% are aged forty years and above.

effectiveness.  The rates from 1988 are as follows:

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE'S WAGE COSTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower (a)

what  is  the  ranking of Singapore's wage  costs  in  the  Asia

Pacific  region and in the world; (b) what benchmark is  applied

in Singapore to determine whether wages are high, medium or low;

(c) what is the percentage that high wages occupy in Singapore's

total  wage costs; and (d) what is the percentage of highly-paid

executives in Singapore's labour force.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's wage costs are generally higher than other

Southeast Asian economies and the NIEs, but lower than developed

economies  such as Japan, USA and European economies.  According

to   the   World   Competitiveness  Report  1998,   the   hourly

compensation for manufacturing workers is US$6.70 in  Singapore,

higher  than  US$5.60  in Taiwan, much higher  than  US$0.90  in

Malaysia,  but lower than US$17 in Japan and US,  and  US$26  in

Germany.    The  picture  in  the  services  sector  is  roughly

similar.  The  annual  gross salary of a bank  credit  clerk  is

US$15,500  in  Singapore,  higher  than  US$7,300  in  Malaysia,

comparable  to US$16,400 in Hong Kong, but lower than  US$33,975

in US.  For top management, the salary gap between Singapore and

developed economies is however smaller.  The annual gross salary

of  a  CEO is US$178,000 in Singapore, higher than US$96,000  in

Malaysia,  marginally  higher than  US$167,000  in  Taiwan,  and

comparable to US$173,000 in US.  Please see tables 1, 2 and 3.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To determine whether wages in Singapore are high, low or medium,

one  way is to compare wages of people in equivalent occupations

with  other countries.   Within the domestic economy, we  should

also  benchmark  the growth in wages against  output,  that  is,

whether productivity growth has been in tandem with wage growth.

In recent years, productivity growth lagged behind real earnings

growth in Singapore.  While real earnings increased by around 4-5%  annually over the past 5 years, productivity growth  lagged,

at  1-2% in 1996 and 1997.  In contrast, in Taiwan, productivity

growth  outstripped earnings growth substantially. In  developed

economies,  although productivity growth rates were lower,  real

earnings   growth  was  even  more  subdued.   We   have   hence

correspondingly

seen Singapore's relative unit labour cost rising gradually  but

steadily  over  the years.  It has worsened further  since  July

1997  as  the depreciation in regional currencies was not  fully

offset by a rise in their nominal wages.   (Please see table 4a,

table 4b and chart 4).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the questions regarding the proportion of high income

earners,  7%  of full-time workers in Singapore earn  income  of

more  than $6,000 per month, based on MOM's Labour Force  Survey

1998.   The income share of this group of high wage earners  was

27% of total income earned by full-time workers.

<br><br><i>Public Transport</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1988 to 1997, two major revisions were made to bus and

MRT  fares.   The first revision took place in 1990  when  fares

were  revised after remaining unchanged for more than  6  years.

The  second  fare revision was 7 years later in 1997.There  were

also  two minor adjustments, in 1994 and 1995, when the  maximum

fare was raised by one fare stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase in bus and MRT fares over this period kept pace

with the general increase in consumer prices, and were way below

the increase in wage levels. (See Table 1 below).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi fares have increased faster than MRT and bus fares.

However,  although  taxi fare increases  exceeded  that  of  the

increases  in  the  CPI,  taxis remain  affordable  because  the

increase  in taxi fare is significantly lower than the  increase

in average wage levels.



<br><br><i>PSA</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For PSA terminals, local stevedorage is the single largest

charge  paid  by  container shipping lines for the  handling  of

local containers, forming up to 70% of total port charges.  From

1988  to  1997, PSA has reduced local stevedorage  charges  from

$160 to $150 for a 20 ft. container, and from $228 to $215 for a

40  ft. container. Discounts on local stevedorage have also been

given by PSA through customised agreements.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local importers and exporters do not pay local

stevedorage;  they  pay  freight  rates  and  terminal  handling

charges  which are charged by shipping lines. Both charges  bear

little  correlation  to PSA's local charges and  are  determined

primarily by the supply and demand of shipping capacity  calling

at  the  port.  Importers  and exporters  currently  enjoy  more

competitive   freight  rates  than  regional  shippers   because

Singapore offers a wider choice of shipping lines.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Education (a)

whether  the  National University of Singapore and  the  Nanyang

Technological University have given due emphasis to research and

development  activities;  (b) how much  has  been  allocated  to

research  and  development endeavours in  the  budgets  of  both

universities;  and  (c)  to  what  extent  these  research   and

development  efforts  have been translated  into  commercialised

products.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS and NTU are both committed to the promotion of research

and development activities.  They believe that the reputation of

a university rests not only on teaching but also on its research

excellence,  and that a strong research standing  attracts  good

academic  staff  and students.  The universities have  generally

focused their research efforts on niche areas, including  multi-disciplinary  research, in which they can  make  an  impact  and

which are of strategic relevance to Singapore and the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY97, MOE allocated the universities a budget of $94.5

million  to  be  used  on  research  activities,  including  the

purchase  of  equipment and recruitment of supporting  manpower.

This  is  almost  9%  of  the  total  budget  allocated  to  the

universities, and does not include the salaries of the  academic

staff   which   are  covered  under  the  universities'   normal

allocations.   The  universities also have  access  to  research

funding  from  other  sources, eg  NSTB,  MOH,  MINDEF,  various

foundations, and the industry.  In total, they obtained  another

$68.8 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some 19 national research institutes and research

centres  hosted  by our universities.  These institutions  focus

mainly  on research that has high national relevance.   NUS  and

NTU  also have faculty-based research centres which nurture  new

niche areas in research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our vision for Singapore to be a centre of

excellence in education, our universities, together with various

Government   agencies,  have  recently  initiated  international

collaborations   at   an   institutional   level.    Cooperative

arrangements have been formed with top institutions like MIT and

Johns Hopkins.  These seek to uplift the quality of research and

teaching  at our universities and to help them reach world-class

status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, the researchers in our universities

have   fostered  strong  links  with  industry  and   Government

agencies.   There  are also numerous projects conducted  jointly

with  researchers  from top institutions around  the  world,  eg

Stanford   University,   University   of   Cambridge,   Tsinghua

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of postgraduate research students has more than

doubled in the past 5 years from 1551 in 1994 to 3956 this year.

This  is due to the aggressive recruitment drives undertaken  by

the  universities to bring in the best students  from  Singapore

and  around the world.  Selected undergraduates are also exposed

to  research work through specially tailored programmes in order

to cultivate their interest in research at an early stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities have made concerted efforts to ensure that

their   R&D   works  are  commercially  viable  or  academically

relevant.    Both  have  institutional  outfits   that   promote

commercialisation and technology transfer, namely  the  Industry

and Technology Relations Office in NUS and the Innovation Centre

in  NTU.   Over  the  past 3 years, they have  been  granted  65

patents  and  have set up 20 spin-off companies.   Successes  in

commercialising staff research cover a broad range of areas from

waste  water treatment to orthopaedic implant products to sensor

systems.  Beyond commercially oriented research, there is also a

significant  level  of  basic  research  which  encompasses  the

breaking of new frontiers in knowledge and innovation.

<div align="center"><b>HELP FOR NEEDY STUDENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education (a) if his Ministry has set up a mechanism during this

economic  downturn to identify needy children who cannot  afford

to  pay for school fees, new textbooks and uniforms in 1999; (b)

whether  provision has been made to help out such students  and,

if  not,  where  can  parents find help; and  (c)  whether  such

information is made known to all schools.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education gives free textbooks and school fee

subsidies   to   students   who   need   financial   assistance.

Application  forms for the Financial Assistance  Scheme  can  be

obtained   from   schools.   Schools  also  provide   additional

assistance  from  their  School  Advisory  Committee  or  School

Management Committee funds on a need basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE publicises our Financial Assistance Scheme widely through

the  schools.   Principals also refer needy  pupils  to  welfare

organisations for other assistance, bursaries or scholarships as

necessary.  Further, information on where to get financial  help

has been widely publicised in the press. The Straits Times on 17

November  1998, for example, carried an article summarising  the

help  given  by  MOE  and  other  organisations,  together  with

information  on  the application procedure for assistance.   MOE

and  our  schools will continue to provide help to students  who

need assistance.
