<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962 it was necessary to seek supplementary

provisions   on   two   occasions.    The    First

Supplementary  Estimates of Expenditure  for  1962

were  considered and approved by the  Assembly  as

Cmd.  Paper  11  of 1962. The Second Supplementary



Estimates of Expenditure for 1962 were approved as

Cmd.  Paper  11  of 1963. The First  Supplementary

Estimates cover Head 49, Ministry of Culture,  and

Head 51, Defence Services in the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Heads in the Schedule are covered by

the  Second Supplementary Estimates. Under section

85  of  the  Constitution of the  State,  a  Final

Supply  Bill containing any such sums  which  have

not yet been included in any Supply Bill will have

to  be  presented to the Assembly. The Bill before

Members  is to cover the expenditures not  yet  so

included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

motion standing in his name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly pursuant to section 3 of the

Departmental   Titles  (Alteration)   Ordinance

(Chapter 55) resolves that the Schedule to  the

said Ordinance be amended by the addition under

the  headings of `Old Title or Name of  Office'

and  `New Title or Name of Office' respectively

the item shown in the following Schedule: -



<pre>

                            THE SCHEDULE



              Old Title or Name       New Title or Name

                 of Office               of Office



               Master Attendant       Director of Marine

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been proposed that an Order should be

made  under the provisions of the Malaysia Act  to

extend  certain provisions of the Federal Merchant

Shipping  Ordinance, 1952, to  Singapore,  Sarawak

and  Sabah  to  provide for the establishment  and

maintenance  of a Malaysian Shipping Register.  It

is  envisaged that the powers of the  Director  of

Marine  of  the  Federation  in  relation  to  the

Register should be exercised in Singapore  by  the

Director  of  Marine, Singapore, but  the  officer

exercising such functions is known in Singapore by

the title of Master Attendant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is before the House the Merchant Shipping

(Amendment)   Bill  and  one  of  the   amendments

provides for the change of the title of the Master

Attendant  to that of Director of Marine.  It  is,

however, anticipated that this Amendment Bill will

not be passed by the Legislative Assembly and come

into  operation before the Order relating  to  the

Malaysian Register is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary to provide for the

change  in  the title of the office of the  Master

Attendant by means of a resolution under section 3

of the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Ordinance.

Section  3  of  the  Ordinance provides  that  the

Legislative Assembly may, by resolution, add to or

amend the Schedule to the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly pursuant to section 3 of the

Departmental   Titles  (Alteration)   Ordinance

(Chapter 55) resolves that the Schedule to  the

said Ordinance be amended by the addition under

the  headings of `Old Title or Name of  Office'

and  `New Title or Name of Office' respectively

the item shown in the following Schedule: -

<div align="center"><h4>YANG DI-PERTUAN NEGARA'S SPEECH</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>



<br><br>2.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it is nearly two and a  half  years

since that evening in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



this  House in July 1961 when the Communists broke

off  from  the  united front with the  nationalist

Left  in  the  P.A.P. to  form  their  own  front

organisations  and  to fight against  and  prevent

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We meet today in the first business session of

the    new    Assembly   under   very    different

circumstances. The change that has taken place  is

a  basic mutation in the role and jurisdiction  of

this  House.  Many of the forms and  rituals  have

remained. But some Members may have noted that the

guns   did  not  boom  out  in  salute  when   His

Excellency  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara arrived  in

this Chamber to deliver His speech on the 29th  of

November.   It  did  not,  because   the   Central

Government ruled it to be so. They are in  control

of  the  Army  which  includes  the  two  Infantry

Regiments of Singapore, and their practice is that

no   ceremonial  salutes  will  be  given  to  any

Governor  of  Penang or Malacca or  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara of Singapore. In a small  way,  it

symbolises a shift in authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too those Members who were with us in the last

Assembly  will  have noted that the  Committee  of

Supply on the Budget has been reduced from five to

three  days  with their concurrence, as  they  did

not, quite rightly, raise any objections. For  the

matters to be discussed no longer include  a  list

ranging  from  Police, Prisons and Army  to  Civil

Aviation,   Meteorological   Office,   Posts   and

Telecommunications, Audit. These are  all  now  in

the  jurisdiction  of the Central  Government.  It

means,  in  effect,  that ultimate  power  is  now

vested  in  the  Parliament of Malaysia,  and  any

political  movement or Party that  wishes  to  re-order the state of our society will have to assume

authority for all Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, Sir, stated on many a previous occasion

that  there  can  be no Communist Singapore  until

there is first a Communist Malaya and that whoever

wishes  to  make  Singapore Communist  must  first

capture power in Malaya. Sir, an analysis  of  the

power  situation  which  has  existed  since  1948

between  Singapore  and  Malaya  is  now  formally

translated into the provisions of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



Constitution   of   Malaysia.   Now,   there   can

constitutionally  as  well as  practically  be  no

Communist  Singapore  until  there  is   first   a

Communist Government of Malaysia. I think that  is

a  sobering  reminder to Members of the Opposition

of the magnitude of the obstacles that lie between

them and their political ambitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed it is a truth, which has to be faced by

whichever  political movement that wishes  to  win

authority  and the right to reshape the  structure

of our economy and our society, that we must first

win  the  majority  of  the  number  of  seats  in

Parliament,   the  Parliament  of  Malaysia,   and

command  a loyalty of the administration  and  the

obedience of the Army and the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have so many matters, including

three-quarters of our revenue, still reserved  for

the  State Government does not alter the fact that

we  are  part  of  Malaysia and our  influence  in

Malaysia  will be determined not by the number  of

seats that Singapore has in Parliament but by  the

example that she can set for the rest of Malaysia,

an  example of the possibilities opening up vistas

of  progress  and  prosperity which  can  be  more

equally  shared  by all if similar  policies  were

adopted at the centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our influence over the deliberations of

Parliament   in  the  policies  of   the   Central

Government has yet to be felt. Much will depend on

what happens in the elections in Malaya next year.

Everybody concedes that the U.M.N.O. side  of  the

Alliance  can  and will win a clear majority.  But

everybody  is waiting to see what happens  to  the

vote  in the urban areas and in all the main towns

in  Malaya,  for  arising out of that  vote,  some

vital  decisions  will have to  be  made  both  by

U.M.N.O. leaders and by us in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fairly obvious that if it were possible for

the  M.C.A. to hold the towns in Malaya, then  the

present  structure of the Central  Government  and

the policies it pursues can go on unchanged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the towns decisively reject all M.C.A.

candidates,  then there must be a re-appraisal  by

U.M.N.O. leaders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



They will then have to decide whether they come to

terms  with  the leadership that can  command  the

loyalty  of  the  sophisticated  urban  population

- Chinese, Indians, Eurasians and others - or govern

without the partnership of the leadership  of  the

towns.  It is when this moment is reached sometime

next  year that the bits and pieces will fall into

their   proper  places  in  the  Malaysian  scene.

Thereafter,  the  facts of life in  Malaysia  will

have to be faced by all of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a struggle for authority to remould our

society  now  in the much bigger Malaysian  arena,

and  the  outcome of this struggle  is  final  and

conclusive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy is that in quite a number of these

towns  in Malaya there is no coherent constructive

alternative. Yet in spite of this, there could  be

a  massive protest vote registered not so much for

the   Communist  manipulated  Parties   like   the

Socialist Front, the Labour Party, Party  Ra'kyat,

but    a    vote   against   the   present   urban

representatives and their records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But meanwhile let us confine ourselves to the

immediate  issues in Singapore. In many  ways  the

issues  and the position of the Parties  are  much

clearer  to  everyone. The line that  divides  the

Government and the Opposition is between those who

are  for  Malaysia and our survival in  South-East

Asia  as  a  separate political  entity,  and  the

Barisan Sosialis, a front for the Communists  who,

for  their own selfish ends, have tried to prevent

Malaysia, and so prevent merger; and who even  now

after  the  creation of Malaysia, are still  anti-Malaysia and against the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a time in October, some six weeks

ago, when it looked as though with the creation of

Malaysia   the   Communists   would   accept   its

establishment and try to win within. But there are

increasing   signs  that  they  have  decided   to

continue their anti-Malaysia struggle, even though

this  means  that  they are more and  more  openly

identified with outside forces, like the Communist

Party in Indonesia, who are out to crush Malaysia.

National service they have condemned, and  in  its

place is their pious suggestion that we should beg

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



be   allowed  to  live  in  peace,  presumably  by

abandoning  Sabah and Sarawak to their fate.  This

is the line of treachery and betrayal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a line likely to win them popular

support.   I   think  they  are  caught   in   the

intricacies of their own international conspiracy.

The  line has been laid for them and they have  to

go  on plugging it even if it means losing out  in

popular  support  within Malaysia.  However,  they

will  try to win support by their exploitation  of

Chinese  educational issues, by  the  capture  and

control of trade unions, and manipulation of civic

organisations both in the city and  in  the  rural

areas. In short, the battle continues on the  same

old issues over the same old battlefields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the political complexion of this Assembly

today  reflects  more  accurately  the  respective

strength  of  ground  feeling and  the  respective

support for competing ideologies. We represent the

majority, who prefer the sometimes slower but less

drastic progress towards a more equal but  a  more

humane  society. They represent the  frustrations,

hatreds  and  bitterness of  a  minority  who  are

ideologically convinced that no government  but  a

Communist one can provide a permanent solution  to

our  economic and social evils. We who have  known

them  for so long know that they are very far from

giving up their struggle. Their top leaders  never

came  out in Singapore to be expended. It was only

the  second rank leaders put in the first line  of

the  open front struggle who have been sacrificed.

And  the  battle will go on relentlessly. We  must

continue from time to time to spotlight them every

now and again when they are up to mischief and  to

expose them. The Barisan must be shown to be still

a   Communist  front  exploiting  the   name   and

principles  of  the  democratic  system  with  the

purpose of destroying them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under our new Constitution, this

Legislative  Chamber will be more  concerned  with

the  constructive  aspect of government  - schools,

hospitals,  housing,  community  centres,   roads,

bridges,  drains,  parks, and, most  important  of

all, factories. For only the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



industrial  base  which we  are  now  forging  can

provide a better life for us all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last ten years of this Chamber so much of

the  time  of this House was preoccupied with  the

struggle for independence. It was inevitable  that

we   should  be  preoccupied  then  with  national

freedom  and  the  right  to  determine  our   own

destiny.  It was inevitable that in the Opposition

years  of 1955-59, I myself had taken up the  time

of  this  House on the problems of how we were  to

achieve  freedom. But I had hoped  that  with  the

attainment  of  full  internal self-government  in

June  1959  we would have begun to look  into  the

constructive side of government - how to  create  a

better society and provide higher living standards

for  all,  how to create higher social values  and

civic  responsibility. But that was not to be  so.

For  the  Communists, it was vital  that  progress

should  be  minimal. For the more we progress  the

less likely an eventual Communist victory. And  so

the  destructive debate went on about the  Police,

Prisons, defence bases and anti-colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubts that they will pursue these

issues in Parliament in Kuala Lumpur. But we would

be  foolish  to believe that because  we  are  now

independent, therefore the Communists  will  admit

that   there   is   a  duty   on   the   part   of

representatives of the people to construct and not

to  destroy.  They cannot admit that any  national

construction  is possible until all economic  ties

and military alliances with any Western bloc power

have been destroyed. And now since colonialism  is

no  longer there, they have to say that the  fight

must   be   against  new  colonialism,  or   "neo-colonialism" as they have chosen to call it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the division between this side of the House

and  the  Opposition  is deep  and  abiding.  They

represent  a minority, but a militant and  tightly

knit  minority determined to bring the  democratic

state down and establish a Communist regime.  Sir,

we  on  this  side of the House are privileged  to

have  been  chosen to represent the majority,  the

rest  of  the people who want Malaysia to live  in

peace  and to progress unmolested. We are a  Party

dedicated to democratic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



socialism.  But  it is our duty to recognise  that

the  only long-term basis on which national  unity

can  be forged and stability ensured is for us  to

bind  all those sectors of society who reject  the

soul-less creed of a Communist dictatorship as the

only  answer to our undoubtedly many social evils.

And  we are proud that in the process we have been

able  to  convince large sectors of the  community

- from  labourers  to  wealthy  merchants  and  the

professional  and middle classes -that  the  long-term answer to the Communist challenge lies in  an

honest  and effective administration, a government

whose social and economic policies can bring about

an  appreciable  and  a  visible  equalisation  of

opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would be breaking faith with the mass of the

people  who voted for us this time if we  did  not

recognise  that  we represent,  as  the  governing

Party, a broad cross-section of the community.  We

must recognise further that their aspirations  are

to  have  a  more equal society through  the  more

difficult   process  of  levelling  up   and   not

levelling  down.  In this city of pushful  people,

energetic  and hard working, largely of  immigrant

stock,  the  desire is that there should  be  more

opportunities for everyone to work harder  and  to

do  better  and increase the size of the  national

cake  as much as, if not more than, the desire  to

share the cake more equally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we would be doing a disservice to the

country  if  we  misled the people into  believing

that  just  because this last time the  Communists

were   defeated  they  would  thereby  remain   an

impotent  force. There are already signs of  their

picking  up  the  bits and pieces  left  of  their

organisation  wrecked by the  disastrous  policies

they  have  pursued.  And we  cannot  expect  them

always to be so accommodating in the next round to

continue  making false and erroneous  assumptions.

But  however skilful they are, they face this  one

crucial  test:  what  is  their  attitude  to  the

constructive  side  of nation building?  In  other

words,  however  much  they  can  play  up   anti-neocolonialism,  can  they  really  persuade   the

people that construction should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



set  aside, indefinitely until neo-colonialism has

been destroyed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to enumerate the four principal

targets  of constructive effort in the  next  five

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is industrialisation. A climate of

confidence   exists  both  in  the  stability   of

Malaysia  and  in  the  known  policies   of   the

Singapore  Government. The only factor that  could

upset  this climate of overwhelming confidence  is

if  confrontation were to hot up into  a  military

adventure. This is a factor beyond our control. We

can  only  hope that the major world  powers  will

always  have  their own interests to  preserve  to

ensure that there is no accidental conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one important factor within our

competence    to    ensure    the    success    of

industrialisation,  and  that  is  the  supply  of

skilled efficient workers who are not embroiled in

the  Communist  conspiracy of united  front  trade

unions, who are organised into unions designed  to

further  the interests of workers as such and  not

exploited  for political purposes by united  front

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second target is housing and the rebuilding

of  the  old city. We plan to build 60,000 housing

units  in  the  next five years. We are  confident

that  the target can be achieved in spite  of  the

temporary setback of Indonesian confrontation. And

there is every hope that when the 8.7 per cent gap

in  our national income is recovered in two  years

and  our industries begin to flourish, we may well

exceed  this target of 60,000 housing  units.  But

the  amount  by which we will exceed  this  target

depends  very  largely  on  the  growth   of   our

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the first phase of the rebuilding of

the  central city has begun. Outram Road  Gaol  is

being demolished to house eventually some 7,000 to

10,000   families.  And  if  building  by  private

developers,  which  is  again  dependent  on   our

economic progress, keeps increasing at the rate it

has done over the last three years, then it is not

unlikely  that in five years, one-quarter  of  the

old city would have been rebuilt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third target is education. It is already a

near miracle that we can now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



afford  to  have all children in primary  schools.

Forward  planning for construction of schools  and

the  training of teachers will keep up  with  this

ever-increasing  demand.  Our   next   target   in

education  is to increase the secondary vocational

schools  so that children who are more  suited  to

work  with  their hands and eyes than their  minds

will  not fritter away their years between leaving

primary school and getting their first job. And it

is  essential  that we build up a  whole  army  of

technicians  which  a  modern  industrial  society

requires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one special problem in education is how to

check   the   nation  from  being  undermined   by

Communist groups recruiting and training  in  some

Chinese  schools  and  in Nanyang  University.  In

Nanyang University the Communists may confuse some

people   into  believing  that  action  meant   to

restrict their conspiracy is a violation  of  some

sacred principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang University Council has hitherto

spurned  every Government grant to help  it  raise

its standards and put its organisation into shape,

largely  because the Communists have been able  to

manipulate  some  leaders of the Chinese  merchant

community  who have pretensions to greatness,  and

perhaps  to inherit the mantle of another  Chinese

patriot like the late Mr Tan Kah Kee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nanyang University with their financial

autonomy  leaving  them in an academic  morass,  a

situation  is developing which, if left  unchecked

within  five years, will make it more a University

of  Yenan than of Nanyang with young pro-Communist

graduates  and  student leaders  manipulating  the

entire  governing  Council of Nanyang  University.

Professors and lecturers on year-to-year contracts

renewable  at  will  by the  Council  cannot  have

economic  security,  let alone  academic  freedom.

Indeed,  the  problem  of  Nanyang  can  never  be

resolved  until the political abuse the Communists

make of it is exposed and stopped. Only a few days

ago,   the  Communists  manipulated  the  Nanyang

University   Students'  Union   which   issued   a

statement  declaring that the  University  Council

should discontinue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



discussions  with  the  Government  on   aid   and

reorganisation and refuse any financial aid unless

given unconditionally and without supervision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the duty of the Government to raise

academic  standards in Nanyang University  and  to

give  it  as  much assistance as it gives  to  the

University of Singapore. But it is also  the  duty

of  the Government to see that none of this  money

is  allowed  to  be expended on strengthening  the

intellectual  cadre  of  the  Communist  Party  of

Malaya.  And it is our duty to see that this  does

not   take   place,  whether  it  is  in   Nanyang

University  or, for that matter, in the University

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be satisfied that the authority and

discipline of the academic staff and of  a  proper

governing council of responsible people comprising

the   founders  of  Nanyang  University  from  the

various  States  of Malaya, the  Senate,  and  the

Government  that  provides  the  funds,   is   not

manipulated and controlled by the Communists.  And

Members will agree that it is not the business  of

our  Government to give money to help  train  more

Communist cadres to destroy the democratic  State.

But  we  must deal with this problem as delicately

as  the sensitiveness of the problem requires. But

in  the  end  the truth will be established,  that

there is a state of affairs in which a small group

of militant Chinese Communists from Chinese Middle

Schools  exploiting the egoism  of  some  merchant

millionaires   with  pretensions   to   fame   and

greatness have established their control over  the

University.  When  a professor  can  be  asked  to

explain  why certain students fail, then  academic

freedom  has not just been destroyed. Near anarchy

has set in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth target is the raising of social

standards. By social standards I do not mean  only

an  increase in our social and cultural amenities,

however important they are - unemployment benefits,

sickness  benefits, scholarships and bursaries  to

secondary   schools  and  universities,  community

centres,  television, or the National  Theatre.  I

wish  to emphasise higher standards of public  and

social conduct. This can be brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



about by a sustained process of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was inevitable that with new forms of popular

and  representative government, hawkers, squatters

and other social problems increase. But slowly  as

social    standards   and   civic    consciousness

correspondingly  increase,  hawkers  for  instance

begin to understand that they must stay out of the

main  traffic routes and that they must for  their

own sake maintain certain standards of cleanliness

and hygiene. Litter, rubbish, flies and mosquitoes

are  not  only the job of the Health Ministry  and

the  workers in the Cleansing Department, but  the

social responsibility of all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are realists enough to know that in trying to

achieve  these four targets which I have  sketched

in  broad  outlines  we must anticipate  that  the

Barisan   Sosialis  and  their   Communist   front

organisations will become more and more skilful in

their  tactics to obstruct and prevent Singapore's

success. In thwarting industrialisation, they  can

create  unrest  in labour unions and  a  sense  of

insecurity to prospective investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that they will also become more skilful

in  camouflaging  their tactics  of  blocking  the

clearance  of sites for housing, schools,  clinics

and other development plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the stage has been set for the next five

years.   We   can   and  we  will   succeed.   The

Constitution and responsibilities of this Assembly

have  been  changed, if anything, for the  better.

Whilst we as a State Assembly may not have so many

matters  to  look  after, we have  enough  of  the

constructive  side  to make  our  sittings  useful

occasions when progress can be reviewed and faults

remedied. It would be useful at these sittings  if

criticism of our shortcomings either in policy  or

implementation  were  aired  not   only   by   the

Opposition but also by our Back benchers.  It  can

serve   a   useful  purpose  in  bringing   public

attention to how things are done, how they can  be

done better, or why an apparent ineptitude has  in

fact a rational and valid explanation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have noticed, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

since  our  first sitting in October  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  through  its  Chairman,  has  issued  a

statement  in  which they clearly expressed  their

intention to downgrade the value of this  Chamber.

No  doubt  partly as a result of his  unprofitable

effort  in the last Assembly, the Chairman of  the

Barisan   Sosialis,   the   former   Member    for

Queenstown, has stated that what is more important

is  what  they  do  outside  and  not  inside  the

Legislative  Assembly  and  Parliament.  Obviously

they  have  come to realise that people  were  not

impressed  with the marathon speeches  and  futile

debates  we  had in the last Assembly,  and  quite

rightly  so.  But I believe that this Chamber  can

serve a useful function to spotlight the hopes and

aspirations of the people, to underline the duties

of  the  Government, to point out where it can  do

more,   and  finally  to  bring  about  a  greater

understanding of our problems and to  improve  our

effort to build a better Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must never be afraid of departing from

accepted  and  habitual practice  either  in  this

Chamber or outside. And it is for this reason that

I  invite  our own Back benchers to criticise  the

Government in this Chamber for what they  consider

to  be  shortcomings, even though this may not  be

the  practice  elsewhere. For all of  us  in  this

Chamber must realise that the mental attitudes and

responses  of the mass of the people outside  this

Chamber  are  very  different from  those  of  the

people  who elect representatives to the House  of

Commons in Britain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gathered valuable experience from our

difficulties  over the last ten years.  To  ensure

that  the democratic system prevails, we must  not

only  ensure that there is an honest and effective

Government  that produces results.  What  is  more

important is that we must also ensure that  it  is

able to keep in touch with the mass of the people,

to  produce those results in a form and manner the

people   generally  consider  desirable,  and   to

prevent the Communists from distorting the success

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



the  Government or subverting public loyalties  by

pressure and manipulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next five years, Members will see the

growth in my office of a special department  which

will help to create and build up a whole series of

grass-root  organisations  in  every  village,  in

every  street,  and in every major community.  All

those  active  in  the interests of  their  fellow

citizens  can find rewarding work and  recognition

in  Citizens' Consultative Committees. For in  the

end not only must we succeed in making Singapore a

better place, but we must also succeed in building

up  an organisational structure within the country

that  can  help strengthen the links  between  the

people and their Government so that the best  that

can  be done will be done in their interests. Only

in  this  way can we ensure stability and progress

towards a more enlightened and healthy society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following

Address in reply to the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara be agreed to: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore,  express our thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara for the speech which he  delivered

on  behalf of the Government on the 29th November,

1963.".



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech

starts  with the opening remarks of "a new chapter

in  the history of our people". It is indeed a new

chapter, not of so-called independence -because to

the  people of Singapore, the P.A.P. merger merely

means   a   change  of  masters  - but  of  Fascist

repressions carried out by imperialist agents  and

stooges  against political opponents  and  against

anti-colonial stalwarts; of Fascist violations  of

the  basic democratic rights and freedoms  of  the

people, of Fascist brutal assaults by fully  armed

police  on workers who carry out a peaceful strike

in defence of their basic right of association; of

arbitrary arrests and detentions without charge or

trial;  of  fresh  attempts by neo-colonialism  to

frustrate the hopes and aspirations of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



the  people; and of fresh attempts by self-seeking

politicians to mislead and deceive the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new chapter did not start on 16th September.

It  started  long  before  Malaysia  Day.  It  had

started when plans were being completed to  impose

neo-colonialist  Malaysia on the  people.  British

imperialism   had   resorted  to   open   military

suppression of the national uprising in Brunei  on

8th  December,  1962. Soon after,  there  followed

arbitrary   arrests   and   detention   of   those

uncompromisingly  opposed to  Malaysia,  first  in

Sarawak in December 1962 and then in Singapore  in

February 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, because of British backing, the

P.A.P. stooges  gave free rein to  their  Fascist

tendencies. They proceeded step by step to violate

all  the  basic democratic rights and freedoms  of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detainees were given inhuman and barbaric

treatment of prolonged solitary confinement.  Even

Assemblymen were arbitrarily arrested on unfounded

charges  and  unceremoniously  deprived  of  their

basic  human  rights. So-called  criminal  charges

were magnified and distorted out of all proportion

to  suit  the evil designs of the P.A.P. When  the

P.A.P. began   preparing  for  a  snap   general

election, the Barisan was denied even its right as

a  political  Party to hold open air rallies,  and

the  funds of S.A.T.U. unions were frozen  on  the

whimsical  excuse  that their  union  members  had

booed the Prime Minister at a mass rally!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the official proclamation of Malaysia,

when sovereignty over Singapore, Sarawak and Sabah

was  handed  over by the United Kingdom Government

to   the  Federation  Government,  the  stage  was

finally  set  for yet further repressive  measures

against   political  opponents   and   progressive

organisations and individuals in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need to remind the House of what is

still fresh in the minds of all in Singapore.  The

action  to revoke the citizenship of Mr Tan  Lark

Sye; the arrest of Nanyang students, graduates and

Barisan  candidates;  the sudden  banning  without

warning  of five rural and hawkers' organisations;

the  October  arrests of trade union  leaders  and

Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



Assemblymen;   the  brutal  assault   on   workers

carrying out a peaceful protest strike in  defence

of their right to join unions of their own choice;

the  banning of seven large unions of the S.A.T.U.

group;   the  Government's  refusal  to   register

S.A.T.U. after two years of de facto  recognition

by  the  Government  locally and  by  other  world

organisations internationally; the breaking of the

lawful  strike  at the Naval Base, etc.  All  this

bears  testimony  to the Fascist,  pro-colonialist

and pro-imperialist nature of the P.A.P. Yes, this

is  a  new chapter. It is a new chapter of  P.A.P.

Fascism  and  its  active collaboration  with  the

Federation   Government  in   repression   against

effective  opposition, under the protective  cover

of   British   imperialism   and   neo-colonialist

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is obvious to all that, though the

P.A.P. dares to be intimidatory and overbearing to

the  people  of  Singapore,  the  P.A.P. is  ever

servile and subservient to its imperialist masters

and their allies and agents in the Federation. The

people will not easily forget the citizenship sell-out  and the financial sell-out. More and more can

they  now  see  that  it  is  because  of  selfish

interests that the P.A.P. had gone out of its  way

to  promote Malaysia. For its slavish labours, the

P.A.P. was   given  full  support   by   British

imperialism in the unfair snap general  elections,

and  today the P.A.P. is once again in office. The

P.A.P. leadership must be well satisfied with  the

rewards  for  its  service to  neo-colonialism  in

South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the people? The 1.8 million, nay, 10

million  people  if  we  include  the  Federation,

Sarawak   and   Sabah,  who   now   face   extreme

difficulties in the days ahead? There is  economic

confrontation  but,  according  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara's  speech,  the  P.A.P. expects

industrial success and prosperity in spite of  the

setback in the trading sector!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that there will be more industrial

enterprise and we do not doubt that there will  be

foreign establishments that are ever ready to make

use  of  the  advantages of pioneer industries  to

further exploit the people in the country. But  it

does not necessarily follow from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



this  that  there will be industrial  success  and

prosperity  for the people. In fact, it  is  clear

that   with  the  present  dependence  on  foreign

investments,  there will be no genuine  prosperity

for the vast majority of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of those who depend on trade for their

livelihood?  For  the thousands and  thousands  in

Singapore who depend on trade for their livelihood

- and  Singapore lives by trade as admitted by  the

P.A.P.  - the  future will be bleak indeed,  unless

something  radical and drastic be done to  rectify

the errors immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget statement makes no bones about

confrontation being a severe blow and setting back

the  time-table  two  years. But  the  P.A.P. had

promoted  Malaysia and confrontation  and  brought

the  consequent  hardships, and  it  would  be  to

P.A.P. advantage  to  minimise  the  effects   of

confrontation   of   Singapore's   economy.    The

Government,   therefore,  refers   to   sufficient

reserves "to see us through to industrial  success

and  prosperity"! Let us ask: how "sufficient" are

the  reserves? What happens when the reserves  are

finished?  Where then is the so-called prosperity?

The  Prime Minister himself has warned the  people

of  indefinite confrontation. Yet how  the  P.A.P.

suggests to us that we can make up for the loss of

trade and earnings within two years! How does  the

P.A.P. reconcile these two statements?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the whole speech is nothing but another piece of P.A.P. propaganda. It talks of social revolution and the hoped-for P.A.P. achievements in the fields of education, health, housing, welfare and rural development and labour (which I shall come to by and by). It gives a one-sided account of its efforts and, confrontation

notwithstanding, tells the House that  there  will

still  be prosperity. But it also hastens  to  say

that,  since  control over defence,  security  and

foreign affairs, and overall financial and  fiscal

powers   are   in  the  hands  of  the  Federation

Government, therefore, the decision of our fate is

in  the  Central Government. In other  words,  the

P.A.P. says that it cannot be blamed if things  go

wrong  in  Singapore! And we all know that  things

are daily getting worse in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To absolve itself from blame, the P.A.P. says

that  it  is  doing everything  it  can  to  bring

prosperity to the people, and that because of  its

past   efforts,  there  is  prosperity  now.   If,

however,  the  P.A.P.'s  efforts  fail  to   bring

greater  prosperity, and if this prosperity  turns

to  misery and hardship, then it is not because of

the  P.A.P. State Government, but because  of  the

Central  Government! How clever of the  P.A.P. to

wash  its  hands of all blame! Any person  with  a

little    study    can   see   through    P.A.P.'s

machinations, which aim at absolving  itself  from

blame and passing the buck to the Federation!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is typical of P.A.P. politics, always

claiming   credits  for  itself  when  there   are

credits, and always passing the blame on to others

where there is blame! Hitherto all P.A.P. failures

have  been blamed on the Communist bogey. And  for

quite  some  time to come, the P.A.P. will  still

continue  to  blame the Communist  bogey  for  all

P.A.P. failures.  But from  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech  it  can be seen  that  there  is

already a shift in P.A.P. strategy. It is to  pass

the  buck  on  to the Central Government  for  all

P.A.P. failures in future, whenever the Communist

bogey  scapegoat cannot be very suitable. Thus  if

all  the  miseries and hardships  that  come  with

Malaysia and confrontation cannot be laid  at  the

door  of  the Communist bogey and the Indonesians,

then  they  will  be  laid  at  the  door  of  the

Federation Government! Clever P.A.P.!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already the P.A.P. makes a list of its so-called

past  achievements. Expansion and  development  of

the city that comes with natural growth, as it has

during  the  last  100 years of  British  colonial

rule,  is put up as P.A.P. achievements to beguile

the people, saying in fact that but for the P.A.P.

there  would  not  have been  such  expansion  and

development!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of the national income over the years is

similarly used by the P.A.P. as an index of P.A.P.

success when, in fact, the rate of increase  could

well have been greater if there had been political

stability in Singapore without the P.A.P.! Now the

P.A.P. wants the people to believe that  if  this

rising  national income should decline as a result

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



multiplyer  effects of Malaysia and  confrontation

(as it undoubtedly will decline) then the blame is

not the P.A.P.'s but the Central Government's!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not unexpectedly while the P.A.P. tries to give a

picture of growth and prosperity to sidetrack  the

people's  attention from loss of  trade,  business

and  employment,  it has completely  forgotten  to

mention the supposed avowed objectives of the  old

P.A.P.  - namely, the fight for a  more  equal  and

just  society. The P.A.P. does not deny  the  fact

that  there  are  poverty, social  injustices  and

inequality  all over Singapore. The vast  majority

of  the people in Singapore are very poor. Tens of

thousands are out of job. Thirty to forty thousand

young men and women leave school to look for  work

every year. What does the P.A.P. propose to do  to

help these unfortunate people? What plans has  the

P.A.P. to get rid of poverty, social injustice and

inequality? On all these most important  subjects,

the P.A.P. is singularly silent!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. states that "the main objectives of

economic  and social policies were all mapped  out

four  and a half years ago" when the P.A.P. first

took  office  in  1959. At that  time  the  P.A.P.

proclaimed to the whole world its declared  policy

to fight for a more equal and just society, for  a

socialist society. If the objectives of today  are

the same as those mapped out in 1959, then what is

the  programme  of  the P.A.P. Government  towards

these  objectives? There are words and words about

growth   and   prosperity  for  foreign   monopoly

capitalists. But where is the prosperity for those

who  are  abjectly  poor in the  midst  of  P.A.P.

plenty? What programme is mapped out for the  vast

majority  of  oppressed and exploited  workers  in

Singapore,  so  that they may get  rid  of  social

injustices,  social  inequality,  oppression   and

exploitation? So that they may really enjoy a fair

share of the fruits of their labour? So that  they

may enjoy their basic rights and freedoms? So that

all   may  enjoy  a  socialist  society  with   no

exploitation of man by man?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all this, there is not a single word! It is

quite  obvious  that  a socialist  society  is  no

longer the aim of the P.A.P. Its main task is  now

to  look after the interests of the P.A.P. itself

and  the  vested interests of a small  section  of

people  in  Singapore,  the Federation  and,  more

important, in Britain, Australia, New Zealand  and

the   United  States.  For  these  Western  vested

interests, Malaysia is the best hope in South-East

Asia.  After all, Malaysia is formed to allow  the

Western powers to maintain neo-colonialism in  the

region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech, the P.A.P. still continues its

lying propaganda about Malaysia. But it is already

becoming  increasingly clear to all  in  Singapore

that   Malaysia  gives  us  unequal   citizenship,

restricts  our freedom of movement  and  does  not

give  us  national  unity. In fact,  the  Malaysia

arrangements for Singapore are intended to  divide

the people and not to unite them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither has Malaysia given us independence.

Control  over  Singapore is now  merely  exercised

through  Kuala  Lumpur  instead  of  direct   from

London.  There  is no doubt whatsoever  where  the

ultimate  control  lies.  No  amount  of   window-dressing  will  cover  up the  fact  that  British

imperialism  still exercises subtle  control  over

our country in the form of neo-colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Barisan have always fought against

colonialism  and  imperialism,  and   the   P.A.P.

attempts  to  deceive  the  people  about   having

achieved  independence (by reading a  proclamation

on  31st August) will not be able to prevent  them

from   continuing  the  anti-colonial  and   anti-imperialist struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Barisan have consistently fought for

the  basic rights and interests of the people.  We

fight   for  the  oppressed  and  exploited,   the

underprivileged and downtrodden. We fight for  the

workers,   farmers,  fishermen,   hawkers,   taxi-drivers,  intellectuals, national businessmen.  We

shall  do  our best to safeguard their  interests,

and  we  shall  continue to struggle for  justice,

equality,  democracy, peace and  freedom  for  the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. always uses the Communist bogey to

frighten  and  intimidate the people.  And  indeed

because  of  its  control of the State  propaganda

apparatus,  it has to a certain extent  succeeded.

But  however  the P.A.P. may care to play  on  the

theme  of  the Communist bogey, with the  hope  of

isolating  the  Barisan and  gaining  support  for

itself,  it cannot cover up the fact that "poverty

in  the  midst of plenty and unemployment  in  the

face  of affluence" are urgent problems which have

to  be faced, tackled and resolved. Labelling  the

Barisan  pro-Communist simply because we  want  to

help  solve  these basic problems, cannot  deceive

the  people  for any length of time.  P.A.P. lies

might deceive some of the people all the time, and

all  the people some of the time. But they  cannot

deceive  all the people all the time. P.A.P. lies

will all be exposed. Truth will out and truth will

triumph.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to some of the other pro-colonial

policies of the P.A.P. I will leave the subject of

confrontation  and its effects on the  economy  of

Singapore to be debated later when we come to  the

debate  on the Budget statement on Wednesday.  But

before I go further, let me first remind the House

that the financial arrangements under the Malaysia

Agreement  have  literally robbed Singapore  of  a

huge  chunk  of its revenue. We pay the Federation

Government $117 million outright. In addition,  we

pay  for  developments of Federal  departments  in

Singapore  ($9.5 million) as well as the  annually

recurrent    expenditure    of    Statecum-Federal

departments ($15 million approximately).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we add the $30 million so-called loan to the

Borneo  territories, then the sum  given  away  by

Singapore  to the Federation comes to  about  $170

million! $170 million of our money given away!  If

this  money  were truly used for construction  and

development, at least we would be consoled by  the

fact that our money was put to good use. But it is

clear that most of our money will not be spent  on

construction and development, but on the expansion

of  armed  forces and for the suppression  of  the

national liberation struggle in Borneo!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



This is not the way how our money should be spent.

Expenditure  on armed expansion will only  benefit

the  big arms industries in the United Kingdom and

the U.S.A. Our Party had repeatedly warned against

this  during the debate on the Malaysia Agreement!

Now  all  can  see that what the Barisan  has  all

along  said  is 100 per cent correct.  The  P.A.P.

must  be condemned for having signed away all this

money of the people of Singapore!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the other pro-colonial policies of

the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our multi-national State, it is important that

genuine  equal  treatment is  given  to  the  four

streams  of  education.  Unfortunately  the   past

record of the P.A.P. has shown that it merely pays

lip  service  to its so-called equal treatment  of

the four streams of education. In actual fact, the

P.A.P. lays all emphasis on English education  and

neglects the rest. Clear evidence of this  can  be

seen  in  the disproportionately large  number  of

English schools built as against schools for other

language  streams;  and in  the  large  number  of

students  in English, as against Malay and  Indian

and Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is foolish of Government to try to put the

blame  for the great disparity between the  number

of  students  joining  English  schools  and  that

joining Chinese schools, on the parents themselves

and  on  so-called agitation and unrest in Chinese

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This naive P.A.P. explanation will not hide the

evident  P.A.P. discrimination against the Chinese

language.   Neither  does  the  sacking   of   the

inefficient  ex-Minister absolve the P.A.P. as  a

whole  from blame. Nor the report that  the  Prime

Minister   now   suddenly  believes   in   primary

education first in the mother tongue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the P.A.P. Government has discriminated

against  Nanyang University is of course  a  well-known  fact. $8.5 million annual aid is  given  to

the  University of Singapore but not a single cent

of  aid  has so far been given to Nantah.  Neither

have  Nantah  degrees  been  recognised  nor   the

graduates  been  given  the  same  pay   and   job

opportunities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount of P.A.P. slogan-shouting can deceive

the  people  of Singapore. The fact  remains  that

there  is no equal treatment for the four  streams

of   education.  It  is  clear  that  the   P.A.P.

education policy is to ultimately "anglicise"  all

language   streams,  under  cover   of   so-called

"integration".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the national language, we hope that

the  proposed intensification of the  teaching  of

the Malay language this time will not turn out  to

be yet another P.A.P. stunt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worrying many people at the present

moment is the question of university autonomy  and

academic  freedom. The open and unashamed pressure

put  on  the  University of Singapore  Council  to

compel the resignation of Dr Sreenivasan, ex-Vice-Chancellor  of  the University of  Singapore,  has

opened the eyes of many people in Malaya. All  can

now see P.A.P. machinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the name of security of the State and anti-Communism, all sorts of repressive measures have

already been taken against political opponents and

"unfriendly"  organisations.  The  same  untenable

excuses  are  now  used  by  the  P.A.P. to  gain

absolute  control  over the  two  universities  in

Singapore.  The  P.A.P. is bent on  a  rampage  of

witch-hunt and Macarthyism in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not without reason that the University of

Singapore  students  went  on  a  one-day  protest

boycott of classes. We ask the Government to pause

and  ponder.  We  ask the P.A.P. not  to  further

violate  the democratic rights of the people.  The

seats  of learning in Singapore should be  granted

their  university  autonomy and academic  freedom,

and  the  Government should take steps  to  ensure

this respect for autonomy and academic freedom  in

the universities of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.A.P. victimisation and witch-hunt has also

extended  into  all  other education  departments.

Perhaps  that  is the reason why a Special  Branch

Officer  has  been  transferred to  the  Education

Ministry. Some teachers have already been informed

that their services will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



soon  be  terminated. We warn the Government  that

such  victimisation and reign of  terror  must  be

stopped.  P.A.P. politics should not be introduced

into schools under the guise of anti-Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. still shouts autonomy in education.

Have  not  all the recent events proved that  what

the  Barisan has been saying all along is  correct

- that education autonomy is now totally bankrupt?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which the Government has handled

the  cholera  epidemic is deplorable.  Choked  and

unswept drains have caused a great increase in the

population of flies and mosquitoes. Diseases  like

malaria,  long unheard of in Singapore,  are  once

again  making  their reappearance. The  danger  to

health  must  have been obvious to  all.  Yet  the

P.A.P. has  been so busy with its  anti-Communism

crusade that it does not see, or does not want  to

see, such dangers to the health of Singapore.  The

result  is that a one-time clean Singapore is  now

turned into a cholera infected port. The number of

cholera  cases  so far confirmed is  23  with  two

deaths.   But  the  number  of  cases   that   are

undiagnosed  or unconfirmed must be  much  higher.

Daily reports of new cases are still coming in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: why has the public health

situation in Singapore been so neglected to such a

serious extent? Why were there no proper, adequate

and  timely precautions and preparations  made  by

the Government to inform the people of the serious

danger of cholera and so protect them against this

disease?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot be said that the disease was isolated

and  well  under  control.  No!  The  disease  was

rapidly spreading and cholera cases were found  in

widely  separated districts all over  the  island.

The  danger of a quick spread of the disease  must

have been well understood. Yet no action was taken

by the P.A.P. Government to quickly isolate, limit

and control the disease. No advice was given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



to  the  people to get inoculations as quickly  as

possible. And the Government made no provisions to

start  mass inoculations for the people until  the

dangerous infection had spread far and wide.  With

such  a dangerous infectious disease like cholera,

the confirmed diagnosis of two cases is sufficient

to   warrant   the  description  of  the   disease

situation  as  epidemic. Yet the people  were  not

informed of the seriousness of the situation until

there were 10 confirmed cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this P.A.P. "don't-care-less" attitude?

Before  the general elections when only one single

case of cholera appeared in Potong Pasir following

the  epidemic  in Malacca, the Government  quickly

got  down  to  the  job of mass  inoculations.  Of

course,  this  was meant to show how  efficient  a

government the P.A.P. was. The P.A.P. had hoped to

buy  votes.  This  time, after the  elections  the

Government  has  acted with  indifference  to  the

public health situation of Singapore. Almost as if

it  does  not  matter! Why such indifference  this

time? Is it not because the elections are over and

the P.A.P. has already formed the Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. must be condemned for its criminal

negligence   in  the  handling  of   the   cholera

epidemic. If earlier and more energetic action had

been taken by the Government, there might not have

been  so  many cholera cases today,  and  the  two

deaths might have been prevented. For the Minister

to  go  round  the  clinics watching  inoculations

after the damage has been done will not redeem the

P.A.P. in  the eyes of the people for  its  gross

negligence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has always boasted of its flats and

housing and P.A.P. Ministers have received  medals

and  praise  from  the P.A.P. Government  for  so-called P.A.P. achievements. It is a matter of  the

P.A.P. praising the P.A.P. What are the facts? Out

of  the thousands of housing units built, how many

of  them are low-cost housing units that the  poor

people can afford? It is a fact that thousands  of

flats have been built by the Housing Board. But it

is also a fact that thousands have remained vacant

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



unoccupied  for  months and months,  in  spite  of

special inducements to would-be tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board has been provided with funds by

the  Government to build low-cost housing for  the

poor, not to build expensive and high-cost housing

that  the  poor cannot afford to rent. We  do  not

want to see building for the sake of building. Any

person provided with the funds could build housing

flats.  Neither  do we want to see  housing  flats

built with the people's money to be used as police

barracks  and military barracks, as has been  done

by the P.A.P. Let the P.A.P. really build low-cost

housing  units  in  future so that  the  poor  can

really  afford to stay in them, or at least  lower

the  present  high  rentals in the  housing  flats

already built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. plans to sell what it describes as low-cost housing flats. It sounds attractive. But the

poor who already live from hand to mouth will  not

be  able  to  afford to buy any of  these  housing

flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water rationing is fast becoming a feature of

P.A.P. misrule.  The great inconvenience  to  the

people might still be somewhat excused because the

prolonged  drought at one time was not within  the

control  of  human  endeavour. But  today's  water

shortage  has come about largely as  a  result  of

P.A.P. incompetence.  The P.A.P. must  be  fully

responsible  for its failure to pursue  vigorously

the  Johore  River project in the last few  years.

And  now  as  a result of P.A.P. incompetence  the

people  of  Singapore  not only  suffer  from  the

inconvenience  of water rationing, but  also  from

the grave dangers of a cholera epidemic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the P.A.P. pursue the Johore River project

with the utmost despatch. Singapore has the funds.

Let  the  P.A.P. use the millions we have  in  the

kitty.  There is no necessity to borrow  from  the

World  Bank. The P.A.P. has already mortgaged  all

the   property  of  the  Public  Utilities   Board

- property belonging to the people of Singapore - to

the  World  Bank  on most humiliating  terms.  The

P.A.P. should  not  repeat the  same  humiliating

mistake. If we can afford to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



give  loans  to  the Borneo territories,  free  of

interest,   then  we  certainly  can   afford   to

implement  the  Johore River project  on  our  own

steam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P.'s plan to expand the network of

community  centres as well as the Work Brigade  is

of  course dictated by P.A.P. tactics and strategy

to  protect P.A.P. interests. We all know how  the

community centres were used to spread P.A.P. lies

during the unfair snap general elections. And many

have  seen  the manner in which the  Work  Brigade

boys were used by the P.A.P. to tear down election

posters  of  the  Barisan and  to  intimidate  and

assault  Barisan  election workers.  Many  Barisan

workers  still  bear the marks of  brutal  assault

from  these  P.A.P. strong-arm boys. Doubling  and

trebling the present strength of 2,000 in the Work

Brigade will only mean more strong-arm squads  for

the P.A.P. at State expense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must warn against such Fascist machinations of

the P.A.P. The Work Brigade should be used to help

in  national  Construction, and  not  to  build  a

P.A.P. empire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. still unashamedly proclaims its policy

of  so-called  industrial peace with justice.  The

workers  in Singapore have already seen  how  this

P.A.P. policy  is  put into  practice.  It  means

complete suppression of the workers' basic  rights

and freedom. The freezing of funds of the workers,

the banning of their unions, the breaking of their

lawful  strikes,  the arbitrary  arrest  of  their

trade  union  leaders - this  is  what  the  P.A.P.

labour policy means to the workers. All those  who

do not support the P.A.P. and all those who refuse

to  come  under its control are labelled Communist

and  pro-Communist. Threats and  intimidation  are

used,   in   addition  to  subtle  deception   and

promises, to coerce workers into accepting control

from  the  P.A.P. The Government breaking  of  the

Naval Base strike alone shows how pro-employer and

pro-imperialist   the  P.A.P. is.   The   P.A.P.

Government uses the power of the State  to  impose

its so-called industrial peace on the workers with

justice for the employers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



and  its  imperial  masters, with  oppression  and

injustice for the workers. That is the meaning  of

the  P.A.P. slogan, and more and more workers  are

daily awakening to this P.A.P. deception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say to the P.A.P.: if the slogan of industrial

peace  with justice is to be meaningful, then  let

there be justice to the workers. In which case the

Government must immediately stop playing politics,

stop  unlawful  and splitting activities  of  pro-P.A.P. yellow unions, and restore and respect  the

basic  right and freedom of workers to form unions

of  their own choice. Only then can there be  true

industrial peace with justice in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have touched but briefly on a few of the sins

of  P.A.P. commissions and omissions. The  P.A.P.

had boasted of its Four-Year Plan, but many of its

development plans have been completely  forgotten.

For   example,  the  Singapore  River  improvement

project  and  developments in the hospitals,  etc.

are  now set aside. Only a small fraction  of  the

funds   provided   has   been   spent   on   rural

development,  and so on. The large surpluses  year

after  year of P.A.P. office have come about  very

largely  as  a  result of P.A.P. inefficiency  and

under-expenditure  on  development  projects   all

round.  No  amount  of P.A.P. propaganda  to  the

contrary will be able to hide these facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P. is still shouting out its

successes.  Meanwhile  the  unemployment  problem,

already acute as it is, is fast becoming more  and

more  acute  with each passing day. How  does  the

P.A.P. intend to resolve this grave crisis in  the

economy of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For selfish reasons the P.A.P. has helped to

impose  Malaysia on the people, bringing  with  it

Indonesian  confrontation and great hardships  for

the  people of Singapore and South-East Asia.  The

newspapers headline Indonesia as "Hungerland". But

on the Malaysia side, Singapore bears the brunt of

Indonesian confrontation. Out of a loss of  $1,325

million worth of trade for the whole of Malaya  in

1962,  Singapore's share of the loss  amounted  to

$1,100 million, i.e. more than 80 per cent of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



the  total loss. Singapore therefore has a special

vested   interest  in  the  ending  of  Indonesian

confrontation. The living of the vast majority  of

the  people of Singapore depends on it. Hence  the

need and urgency of our amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be argued that the amendment is in the

field  of  foreign  affairs  which  is  under  the

control  of  the Central Government and  that  the

Singapore Government has no jurisdiction over such

matters. The speech of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

states  that [col. 117 of Hansard, 29th  November,

19631:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is policy settled by a Government which

commands  a majority of the Members of Parliament

in Kuala Lumpur that will decide our fate...'.



<br><br>It  may also be argued that Singapore has only  15

Members in a Parliament of 159, and that therefore

the   influence  of  these  15  M.P.s  is  totally

inadequate for changing the policy of the  Central

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is true. We had pointed out all this

long ago during the merger debate, and this is one

of  the  reasons why we opposed the P.A.P. merger

arrangements, which have already put the  neck  of

Singapore  into  the noose held by the  Federation

Government. We must not forget this. We  must  not

forget  also  that  it  was the  P.A.P. that  had

actively  promoted the formation of Malaysia.  And

it  was the P.A.P. that had insisted, in spite  of

the  glaring injustice and inequality  of  second-class      citizenship     and     disproportional

representation,  that its merger terms  were  fair

and  reasonable. Morever, for the past  two  years

the  P.A.P. has shouted that Malaysia will  bring

stability, peace and prosperity to the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons the P.A.P. must bear its

full  share  of  responsibility for  the  economic

crisis  in Singapore today. The P.A.P. itself  has

brought about the present sufferings and hardships

for  the  people.  It is now the P.A.P.'s  bounden

duty  to  help remove the root cause of  all  such

sufferings and hardships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also be argued that the Barisan Sosialis

M.P.s  themselves  could  move  a  motion  to   so

persuade  the  Central Government  to  change  its

policy and start negotiating with the Indonesian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



Government to resolve all existing differences  to

our   mutual  benefit  and  so  bring  peace   and

prosperity to South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we tell the P.A.P.: it is the P.A.P.'s

responsibility to rectify its own mistakes and  it

might yet redeem itself in the eyes of the people.

In  normal  times it would already have  been  the

duty   and   responsibility   of   the   Singapore

Government  to approach the Central Government  on

matters  of State and national interest on  behalf

of  the  people of Singapore. These are not normal

times.  Now the vital interests of the  people  of

Singapore are at stake. Therefore, it becomes  the

double  duty  and responsibility of the  Singapore

Government  to  raise  matters  with  the  Central

Government,  either  on a Government-to-Government

level,   or   even   as  part  of   the   people's

representatives  from  Singapore  in  the  Central

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confrontation is a serious affair. It has

affected not just 8.7 per cent of our economy, and

not just 8,200 people as the P.A.P. would like  us

to  believe. The trade loss is at least 16-20  per

cent  of the total trade of Singapore. The  number

of  people who have lost their jobs and livelihood

directly  as  a  result of confrontation  must  be

between  20,000 and 30,000. The number  of  people

indirectly  affected as a result of the multiplyer

effects must certainly include almost every person

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember too that it is Malaysia that

has  given rise to Indonesian confrontation. There

is  already sufficient international tension as  a

result  of rupture of diplomatic relations between

the  Philippines and Indonesia on the one side and

Malaysia on the other. Jingoism and the burning of

effigies  of leaders of neighbouring countries  in

order to arouse the so-called patriotic sentiments

of  the  people, will only further  increase  this

international   tension.   If   we   openly   make

preparations   for   war,   first   by   man-power

registration   and   later  by  mobilisation   and

conscription,  it will only further aggravate  the

situation.   It  might  even  lead  to   explosive

incidents  which may well precipitate our  country

into  a  hot  war. This is a thing which  we  must

avoid under all circumstances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remain ever vigilant against foreign

imperialist  machinations that try to involve  the

people  in  the region into fighting against  each

other. The neo-colonialists and imperialists  want

to  divide our unity and oar strength so that they

may  continue their policy of divide and rule.  If

the  people go to war, they would merely fall into

the  imperialist trap. Moreover, the  people  will

not benefit from war, as what follows can only  be

sufferings and hardships for all. Those  who  will

benefit  are the foreign arms industries  and  the

imperialists who want to oppress and  exploit  us.

It  is  not war but peace that the people want  in

South-East Asia. And it is peace that we must help

to safeguard and defend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Macapagal is reported to have said in

New  York  on  6th December, 1963, that  "For  the

present,  while Indonesia is willing to meet  anew

with  Malaysia  and the Philippines,  Malaysia  is

reluctant  to do so". Such reluctance to negotiate

can  only  be  due to the unwanted  influence  and

interference of foreigners and colonialists in the

affairs of state in the Federation Government.  We

must get rid of this foreign interference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously even Mr Arthur Bottomley, an admirer

of  the P.A.P., also accepts the principle that it

is  a  good  thing  to  get  the  three  countries

together in order "to call a halt to the trouble".

This  was  reported in the Straits  Times  of  7th

December, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we must do our best to persuade the

Federation  Government to  go  to  the  conference

table  and  negotiate  with  the  Philippines  and

Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interests of the people demand that we

prevent   the  present  friction  from  developing

further into open conflict and war with Indonesia.

Only peace will bring happiness and prosperity  to

the people. So let all of us in Singapore make our

full  contribution to the defence of peace in  the

region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are elected representatives of Singapore, and

our primary duties and responsibilities are to the

people of Singapore. But we also have our duty and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



responsibility  to the people of  the  Federation,

the  Borneo territories and of the whole of South-East  Asia. We hope that all Members of the  House

will  put the interests of the people above  party

politics  and everything else, fully  support  our

amendment,  and  urge  the  Government   to   take

immediate steps to persuade the Central Government

to  get  rid of foreign interference,  go  to  the

conference  table, negotiate with  the  Indonesian

Government,  and resolve all existing  differences

amicably  to our mutual benefit, and  so  help  to

bring  stability, peace and prosperity  in  South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`at end, to add -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"; but this Assembly regrets that the Government

in  helping to impose Malaysia on the people has

caused great difficulties and hardships to  them

in  Singapore and urges the Government  to  take

immediate   steps   to  persuade   the   Central

Government  to  get rid of foreign interference,

negotiate  with  the Indonesian Government,  and

resolve  all existing differences to our  mutual

benefit,  and so help to bring stability,  peace

and prosperity to South-East Asia".'



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the

speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed

to: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore, express our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered

on behalf of the Government on the 29th November,

1963".'.



<br><br>Since which an amendment has been proposed, at the

end to add-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"; but this Assembly regrets that the Government

in  helping  to impose Malaysia on the people  has

caused great difficulties and hardships to them in

Singapore  and  urges  the  Government   to   take

immediate steps to persuade the Central Government

to get rid of foreign interference, negotiate with

the   Indonesian  Government,  and   resolve   all

existing differences to our mutual benefit, and so

help  to bring stability, peace and prosperity  to

South-East Asia".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

added,  be  there added." In my view there  is  no

clear  dividing line between the contents  of  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech and the  proposed

amendment. I, therefore, propose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



to  allow  the  debate  to  range  over  both  the

contents  of  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech

and  also the proposed amendment. The debate will,

therefore, proceed on those lines. This will  mean

that  all  Members  will have the  opportunity  of

speaking once, except the Prime Minister who  will

be  given an opportunity to reply to the debate on

the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Member who wishes to speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment moved

by  the  Barisan  Sosialis  means  that  they  are

crying,  "Catch  the thief", when they  themselves

are   thieves,  as  a  Chinese  story  goes.  They

themselves   have   caused   this   situation   of

confrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia.  Now

they  want  to shift the blame on to the shoulders

of others. They are blaming others as the culprits

in order to clear their own names. Their action is

really very wonderful and fantastic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should review what has taken place in the past

few  years.  It  is now the time for stock-taking.

Let us now review our achievements in the past few

years  we  have  been in office.  Singapore  is  a

paradise   in   South-East   Asia.   Our   people,

irrespective  of race and class,  are  enjoying  a

livelihood and standard of living much better than

that of any other country in South-East Asia.  Had

it  not been for the agitation and instigation  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis  which  has  brought  about

confrontation against Malaysia, our  Malaysia  and

Singapore    especially   would   have    achieved

unprecedented   prosperity  and   happiness.   But

because of the stupidity and stubbornness  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis in persisting in their  line  of

confrontation, we have now amongst us thousands of

poor  labourers who have to pay the price  of  the

Barisan misdeeds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ask, which country in South-East Asia is

enjoying the same high standard of living which we

are  enjoying? Which country in this part  of  the

world  has  been  enjoying the  same  standard  of

living, or whose people are better clothed, better

fed  and  have better enjoyment? Just look  around

those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



countries, such as Indonesia. The people there are

in  deep  water  and  in great difficulties.  They

cannot  enjoy what we are now enjoying. They  have

even  difficulty in filling their  stomachs.  They

are  now even eating roots, the bark of trees  and

fruits to fill their stomachs. Perhaps they  could

explain  their  way  and say,  as  the  Indonesian

leaders  have said, that the spirit of  revolution

can  resolve all this, and that the people  should

put  the  revolutionary spirit  first  before  the

satisfaction of their hunger. But in asking  their

people  to  tighten their belts,  these  so-called

leaders are driving their people to starvation. It

is  fortunate  that we have no such leadership  in

our  State.  Otherwise we would be  suffering  the

same kind of misfortune as they are now suffering.

In  which country are the people enjoying the same

standard  of living as we are enjoying  here?  Our

currency is the strongest and most stable in South-East  Asia.  For  example, if the  $500  allowance

given  to the Barisan Members is put into a  bank.

they  can still buy $500 worth of goods when  they

draw it out next month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see the situation in Indonesia today. It

is unimaginable. Even the Japanese banana notes or

coconut  notes are worth more than the  Indonesian

currency   nowadays.   If  a  Nanyang   University

lecturer  in  Mathematics were  to  calculate  the

Indonesian currency, he would have to calculate it

in  five or six digits, as the Indonesian children

are  learning in their schools. Under such tuition

perhaps  the  Barisan Members  could  have  better

enlightenment. For instance, in 1960 Mr Chan  Sun

Wing followed the Prime Minister to Indonesia on a

friendly  visit, and he carried two bags  full  of

Indonesian currency in order to buy goods. He  was

looking for goods everywhere, and he had to  carry

such  a bundle of Indonesian notes with him.  This

is  the  situation with regard to  the  Indonesian

currency  and  economy. Inflation is  rampant  and

there are economic difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Singapore we have schools. We have a

place  in  school  for every  child,  to  whatever

school the child wants to go, whether it is Tamil,

Malay or English. The children of Singapore can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



go  to any school in any part of Singapore, in the

South Bridge Road area or in the North Bridge Road

area  or  in Queenstown. Here we have free primary

education. Students who are poor but diligent  can

get  bursaries  and scholarships. I  believe  that

among  the  Nanyang  University  friends  of   the

Barisan   there   are  many  students   who   have

Government scholarships and bursaries  to  go  for

higher  studies. They can make use  of  Government

scholarships   to   continue  their   studies   in

secondary  schools  and the universities.  Let  me

ask,  in which country in South-East Asia are such

facilities afforded to the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here among us we also have cheap housing. The

Government is giving subsidies for the  people  to

have their accommodation. The people can choose to

live  in  the North Bridge Road area or the  South

Bridge  Road  area or anywhere in Singapore.  They

can  also  choose  to have one-room,  two-room  or

three-room flats. They have this right to  make  a

choice.  It is not any country in South-East  Asia

which  has  this kind of facilities, even  in  the

whole world there are very few countries which can

afford  these  facilities to the  people.  If  the

people  fall sick, there are doctors to  prescribe

for them and they do not have to pay a single cent

for  this  service.  The Government  is  providing

clinics which are right at your doorstep and  poor

children can get a free milk supply. Let  me  ask,

how  many countries in the whole world can  afford

these  medical services and other free  facilities

to the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers are enjoying a standard of wages and

living  far  better  than anywhere  in  South-East

Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech it is also

disclosed  that the number of vehicles  registered

this  year has increased by 45 per cent more  than

that of last year. Now, this figure can very aptly

be  taken  to  show  the  raising  of  the  living

standard  of  the  workers.  We  have  progressive

labour legislation which will protect the workers'

interests, and the Industrial Relations  ordinance

provides   for  good  relationships  between   the

employer and the employee. Very few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



countries   in  South-East  Asia  can  have   such

enlightened  legislation for the  benefit  of  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people, irrespective of their situation, can

get  aid  from the Government. Every year  we  are

spending millions of dollars on public assistance,

such as fire relief funds, unemployment assistance

and  other  schemes of aid. Ours  is  a  socialist

welfare  state policy. The rich are sharing  their

wealth  with the poor, and this is only  just  and

reasonable.  Our society is marching towards  this

type of socialist society. Who can say that we  do

not     have    socialist    legislation?    These

opportunities of employment and the  provision  of

the facilities I have stated above are for all the

people  to enjoy irrespective of whether they  are

against  or  for the P.A.P. - even among Members  of

the  Barisan who are enjoying our low-cost housing

facilities.  We  are  so  used  to  seeing   these

favourable  conditions  and  facilities  that   we

sometimes   forget  about  the  value   of   these

facilities.  It  is  just as what  we  say,  being

amongst the flowers for so long, one forgets their

fragrance. In fact, we tend to think that  we  get

these  things  as our natural right, which  other

countries can never dream to have. We should thank

our  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for his speech  which

affords us an opportunity to remind all our people

that we are living in a very healthy and fortunate

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the establishment of Malaysia as the New

York  of  Malaysia,  we can  expect  that  we  can

further  raise  the  standard  of  living  of  our

people. We have all the factors and conditions  to

fulfil  this.  We have further reason  to  believe

that  we  can  even bring about  more  wealth  and

enjoyment to the people. We have a very  good  and

efficient  administration,  communication,  fiscal

and  trade systems. After Malaysia, our goods will

have a larger market and will also be protected by

tariff   legislation.  We  will  also  have   rich

material  resources. All this will bring  about  a

better  future for us. These are the main  factors

that will bring this about. We are now on the road

to prosperity, happiness and a better future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are now facing Indonesian confrontation

which has caused thousands of people to be out  of

job  and a depression in our trade. Who has caused

all this? Who has disturbed the beautiful dream of

our  people? To go to the root of the  matter,  we

can say that the confrontation policy by Indonesia

today is caused by the Barisan Sosialis. They  are

the culprits. The Barisan Members should know that

the unemployment of thousands of our workers today

and  the depression in our trade are, to a certain

extent, caused by them. They should be responsible

for all these consequences because they have tried

their  best  to oppose Malaysia and do all  things

possible  to  destroy  our democratic  system  and

affluent society. When we want to lay hands on any

culprit,  we should lay it on the Barisan Members.

It  is  they who have caused us these difficulties

- the unemployment of thousands of our workers  and

depression  in  our  trade.  They  are  the  arch-culprits who have caused this trouble arising from

the  Indonesian confrontation policy. We  can  see

very  well that at the beginning of this  two-year

struggle  for Malaysia, Indonesia had not  opposed

Malaysia. Even Dr Subandrio in December 1962 said

in   New  York  that  Indonesia  was  not  against

Malaysia, if it was the wish of the people. On the

other  hand,  Indonesia would  give  Malaysia  her

blessing. At that time the Barisan's opposition to

Malaysia  throughout Malaysia had not the  support

of the people and the referendum held in September

had also dealt the Barisan a deadly crushing blow.

Later they changed their strategy and secured  the

support of the Indonesian leaders, especially  the

P.K.I.,  to provide them with spiritual and  moral

support  in  their  opposition  to  Malaysia.  The

P.K.I. passed  a resolution last year  condemning

Malaysia.  At  that  time the  Barisan  were  very

elated.  The resolution passed by the P.K.I. gave

them  a  stimulant  to continue  their  activities

against  Malaysia.  They  took  heart  from   that

resolution  and persisted in their  opposition  to

Malaysia.  Now we cannot deny that the  Indonesian

confrontation against Malaysia has been instigated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



and  encouraged by the Barisan Sosialis. Even  the

Barisan  themselves last year  admitted  this.  We

could use their own documents and publications  to

prove  this  point. In the issue  of  the  Chinese

organ  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  of  the  1st  of

December,  on the second page, there was published

an  article the subject of which was "The Cause of

Malayan Socialist Front in the Present Situation";

of  course,  this includes the Singapore  Barisan.

The first part of the article says --- [Interruption].

How  can you say that I am talking at random? This

is  from  your own article, published by your  own

Party. It is from your own Party organ printed  in

black and white. How can you say that I am quoting

at random? Now let me quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First it must be pointed out that the Barisan

was  the  first who opposed the Malaysia  Plan  in

1961.  At  that  time, Indonesia did  not  express

their  opposition to the Malaysia Plan. The P.K.I.

elements  and other people started to  oppose  the

Malaysia Plan only after we had done so ---"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Interruption] Now, this is what you say in your

own article. I am not arguing who is leading whom.

Please listen to the end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, Indonesia did not express their

opposition  to  the  Malaysia  Plan.  The   P.K.I.

elements  and other people started to  oppose  the

Malaysia   Plan  only  after  we  had   done   so.

Therefore,   if   there  was   anybody   following

anybody's  line, then it must be they  who  follow

our  line  and  not we who follow their  line.  We

challenge anybody to rebut this fact." ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Interruption] This is what you yourselves have

said,  or  your friends have said.  Now,  this  is

making your own confession without being asked  to

do  so. Only this will go to prove that had it not

been    for   the   Barisan's   instigation    and

encouragement and trouble making, Indonesia  would

not have started a confrontation for no reason  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the article it is stated "Malayan Socialist

Front"   but  we  know  that  Singapore's  Barisan

Sosialis and the Malayan Socialist Front are birds

of the same feather. They themselves have admitted

that the Indonesian confrontation against Malaysia

is following their line. Even the Barisan Sosialis

and the Socialist Front in Malaya have admitted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



this.  Now,  who  can  say  no?  The  reasons  for

Indonesian  confrontation  against  Malaysia   are

partly   due   to   her   own  internal   economic

difficulties. This can serve as a red  herring  to

divert  the  attention of the people  as  well  as

foreign countries to her internal difficulties and

economic  disaster.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is

because the big shots in Indonesia have also taken

cognisance   of   the  fact  that  the   Barisan's

subversive  activities in Singapore  will  provide

them  with  a  golden opportunity  to  divide  our

people  and  swallow up North Borneo  through  the

Barisan  here.  But the people in  Indonesia  have

forgotten  that  the people of  Malaysia  in  this

crisis  have  all  united together  to  deliver  a

crushing  blow to the Barisan. Indonesia wants  to

make  use  of this opportunity to swallow  up  the

Borneo territories. This is her true intention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the pretext that Malaysia is a threat to

the  security of Indonesia - it is all humbug.  The

so-called military base, neo-colonialism, and  the

rest,  are  all  pretexts used  by  these  people,

including  the Barisan Sosialis. Yet  the  Barisan

are  supporting them on this specious pretext. Can

they  not see that Malaysia, without any airplanes

or warships, cannot be a threat to the security of

Indonesia, a country which has so much armoury and

such  a great army? We can see that when the  Yang

di-Pertuan Agong visited Singapore, he came  in  a

very  small light out-moded military plane. We  do

not  even  have an air force but Indonesia  has  a

large   fleet   of  jet  planes.  The   Indonesian

President,  Dr Soekarno, has his own special  jet

plane   to  fly  him  about.  And  Indonesia   has

warships, arms and submarines, supplied by  Russia

as  well as America. But we do not have these.  So

how can we be a threat to others?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military base in Malaysia has been in

existence  even  before the Indonesian  revolution

and independence. Why did they then not object  to

it?  Why should they wait till after Malaysia  has

been  established to protest against the existence

of this base?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their amendment the Barisan Sosialis urges the

Government  to persuade the Central Government  to

get rid of foreign interference and to ask for the

abolition of the British military base. But if  we

abolish  the base today, tomorrow it  will  be  an

Indonesian  colony, and our livelihood and  living

standard  will  be  worse  than  that  under   the

Japanese  regime, not to talk of the thousands  of

Naval Base workers who will be out of job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can recollect that Indonesia first opposed

Malaysia   after  December  1962  when   Azahari's

rebellion in Brunei took place. During that period

Indonesia had been encouraging a rebellion. Before

the  Brunei rebellion the rebel leader Azahari had

flown  into  Singapore to have talks with  Barisan

leaders,  including  Lim Ching  Siong.  After  the

rebellion in Brunei the Barisan Sosialis came  out

to  give full support to the rebellion and to  the

self-styled  revolutionist hiding in  a  hotel  in

Manila,  and  they  termed  him  a  hero  of   the

liberation    of   Brunei.   Yet    they    failed

disastrously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brunei is an oil producing country, a rich

country,  and  the people do not have  taxes  like

income  tax,  cigarette tax, oil  tax,  and  other

taxes.  What reason do they have to rebel  against

authority?  And now Azahari has fled to  Indonesia

to become a stooge of Dr Subandrio and to be used

as an exhibit at mass rallies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This a very clear example of their collaboration

and  collusion with a foreign enemy to destroy our

country.   I   recall  that  at   the   Afro-Asian

Conference  at  Moshi  last  year  the  Indonesian

delegates tried to bar our delegates from entering

the  conference room. Yet they were very concerned

about  the  Barisan delegate. Mr Lim  Shee  Ping,

because Mr Lim Shee Ping was detained during  his

journey and could not attend the conference.  They

were  very  worried and concerned. They asked  us,

"Why  is it that a partner of yours has not turned

up?"  In  fact, at that time we did not know  that

Mr Lim Shee Ping had been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



detained. When the Indonesian delegates knew  that

Mr Lim Shee Ping could not attend the conference,

they mobilised all their efforts to lobby all  the

delegates to prevent us from participating in  the

conference.  And at the sub-committee meeting  the

anti-Malaysian  forces  were  able  to   gain   an

overwhelming control over the meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this we can see that before the conference

the    fanatics   against   Malaysia   must   have

established  contact  through  correspondence  and

they  must  have tried to make use of the  Barisan

delegate  to be the main mouthpiece at  the  Afro-Asian Conference against Malaysia. Because Mr Lim

Shee   Ping  could  not  turn  up,  they  had   no

alternative  but  to  use two so-called  delegates

from Indonesia to represent the Barisan delegates.

This is another example of the Barisan's collusion

with the foreign enemy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present difficult economic situation was

brought about by them, and yet they have the cheek

to  put  in  an amendment blaming us  for  causing

difficulties  to  the  people  as  a   result   of

Malaysia.  Without the Barisan  Sosialis,  we  the

people of Malaysia will be the happiest people  in

South-East Asia, but because of them we have a lot

of   difficulties  and  hardships  and   so   much

disturbance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in their amendment the Barisan

Sosialis  also  mention the  false  imposition  of

Malaysia  on  the  people. What do  they  mean  by

imposition? We do not have to talk about Sabah and

Sarawak.  Let  us talk about Singapore.  Within  a

year  there have been two occasions for the people

to vote on the question whether they like Malaysia

or  not.  That was on the 1st September, 1962.  On

that day more than 70 per cent of the people voted

for   Malaysia  and  rejected  their  blank   vote

suggestion.  Although the voting  was  compulsory,

there were three choices, and they freely accepted

Malaysia.  Are not the people's eyes  very  clear?

The  second  occasion was in September  this  year

- the general elections. We put forward Malaysia as

one of our Party platforms and as a result of that

we won a great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: l79</b></font><br><br>



majority. Whether it was a snap election  or  not,

they  had  nine days to campaign. And in all  this

time   they   had  consistently  and  persistently

carried  out their anti-Malaysia campaign for  two

and  a half years. Yet they were defeated. Now  in

those general elections, the Barisan Sosialis  put

forward  anti-Malaysia as their election platform.

What  was the outcome? They had only 13 seats,  an

unlucky  number.  And today  among  them  one  has

disappeared,  their  Party leader,  Dr  Lee  Siew

Choh.  And  their  three other Members  have  also

disappeared from this House. Where are they now?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is five o'clock. I propose to

suspend  this sitting. I will take this  Chair again

at 5.30 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>at 5 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister for Labour had the Floor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

before  the  break, I was saying that the  Barisan

Sosialis in the recent general elections used anti-Malaysia  policy as one of their platforms.  As  a

result,  they have secured only thirteen  Assembly

seats  - the unlucky number of thirteen! Today,  we

have  seen even the Member for Bukit Merah is  not

here.  Perhaps  there  is another  crisis  in  the

Barisan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to say is that the recent general

elections  were  conducted  in  a  most  free  and

democratic  way. Those who are for Malaysia  voted

for our candidates; those who are against Malaysia

voted for Barisan candidates. How can you say that

anybody has imposed Malaysia on the people? If the

logic  of  the Barisan were correct that  Malaysia

had  been  imposed  on  the people,  then  we  the

Members  of this House would also be an imposition

on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



the people, including the Barisan Members. Whether

they  have  made their Assembly seats  a  kind  of

imposition  on  the people is another  matter.  If

they  admit  it, then their seats are  a  kind  of

imposition  on the people, and they should  vacate

them.  But  I will say that the people  voted  for

Malaysia by a free and democratic process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong mentioned the question of

the four streams of education. On the question  of

Chinese education, the Barisan slogans are usually

like   this,  that  we  want  to  destroy  Chinese

education.  Now,  what  do  they  know  about  the

destruction  of Chinese education?  What  do  they

mean?   Take,   for   instance,   Thailand,    the

Philippines and Indonesia. What about the attitude

of  the  Government  in  these  countries  against

Chinese  schools? Now, this is a real  example  of

attempts  to destroy Chinese education. But,  here

in  Singapore, is the P.A.P. Government trying  to

destroy Chinese education? On what grounds do they

raise these groundless accusations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Members of the Barisan, are or educated

purely  in Chinese. Now, please think of the  time

when  you  were educated in Chinese schools.  What

was  the situation then, and what is the situation

today?   Would   you  please   compare   the   two

situations?   If  the  Barisan  Members   have   a

conscience,   they  should  admit   that   Chinese

education nowadays is very much better than it was

before.  Nowadays it is not necessary  to  mention

the  time  when  they  were  educated  in  Chinese

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just give an example in my case. My

parents had to save money to send me and people of

my  generation  to primary schools. But  nowadays,

just  look at the present Chinese primary schools.

The  children do not have to pay for anything.  If

it   was  not  for  the  confrontation  policy  of

Indonesia,  we would have achieved free  secondary

education. Those children whose families are  poor

can   be  provided  with  free  textbooks  by  the

Government.  Now,  please consider  this.  Do  you

think this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



is  the way to destroy Chinese education? I  would

say  that this is a concrete example to show  that

Chinese education nowadays is enjoying much better

facilities than before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, if you wanted to join a school, you

would  have  to  ask people to recommend  you,  to

persuade  perhaps the principals  or  teachers  in

certain schools to let you have a place in school.

But just look around now. Now, the children do not

have  to do such things. They have no fear of  not

getting  a  place in school. Any child wishing  to

join  any school, whether a Tamil, or a Malay,  or

an  English or a Chinese school, would be given  a

place in a school nearest to his or her home. This

is  a second point to show how much better Chinese

education is treated nowadays than it was  in  the

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is, in the past, teachers in

Chinese   schools  would  have  to  try  to   make

blandishments to those on top who had  control  of

the schools in order to retain their position.  On

top  of  this, their salaries were not stable,  or

rather,  in the primary schools the salaries  were

determined  by  the principals  who  could  impose

their  will. Sometimes teachers did not get  their

salaries at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can recall an example of my old friend, Mr

Leong  Keng Seng of the Barisan Sosialis, when  he

was  principal for the first time in 1955. At that

time  we were still friends. When he received  his

salary  he  used to ask me to go for a drive  with

him to have dinner together. But sometimes when it

was time for him to give me a treat, he did not do

so.  For  what reason? It was because he  had  not

received the salary due to him at the right  time,

so he had no money to give me a treat, because the

primary school in which he was teaching would have

to  wait  for  the school fees to be paid  by  the

pupils  before the school could issue salaries  to

the teachers. In the rural areas, in the kampongs,

if  the pupils of a school could not afford to pay

their  school fees, then the school would have  to

delay the payment of salaries to the teachers, and

the teachers would have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



to  tighten their belts! But now the situation  is

entirely  different. Now, the payment of  salaries

to the teachers does not depend on the school fees

paid by the pupils, because the whole burden is on

the  Government. The teachers also  have  definite

salary   scales,  annual  increments   and   other

benefits. They get their salary on time regularly,

and they are well treated. Those teachers who have

taught for more than ten years can get quarters or

buy cars for themselves. Our old friend, Mr Leong

Keng  Seng,  after having been a school  principal

for  a few years, would at least have enough money

to buy a car ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, I do not know why the Minister for Labour

has  to  mention  Mr  Leong  Keng  Seng.  Has  he

anything   to   do   with   the   subject    under

consideration? Perhaps you are aware  that  it  is

not  quite  proper  for the  Minister  to  mention

anybody  in his absence, when that person  who  is

being criticised has no opportunity to reply.  The

Minister  should  have made  his  remarks  in  his

presence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> When I know what is the point

of  order,  I  will  continue with  my  speech  in

Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the Minister for

Labour   has   been   attacking   the   particular

gentleman. He was merely relating an anecdote.  If

he  was  personally reflecting on the  conduct  of

that gentleman, I would have stopped him. I do not

think he was doing that. He was merely relating an

anecdote. Please proceed.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I still have

good  feelings towards Mr Leong Keng Seng. I have

no  intention at all to attack him but the Barisan

Sosialis  keep on harping that they are  champions

of  Chinese  education. That is  why  I  mentioned

certain facts and episodes to rebut what they have

said.  That is why I mentioned my old friend,  Mr

Leong  Keng  Seng.  I  did not  say  that  he  was

corrupted or that he had misused the money, but  I

only mentioned that he could have used his salary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



to  buy  a car. I am only reflecting by comparison

that our Government is really very generous in its

treatment of Chinese education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now continue with Chinese education in

Singapore.  Teachers engaged in Chinese  education

are actually the most highly paid Chinese teachers

in  the  whole world. Can you pick out any country

where teachers of Chinese are paid more than those

in  Singapore?  Let  us take,  for  instance,  the

Chinese mainland or Hong Kong where there is  also

Chinese  education.  Do  the  teachers  there  get

salaries as high as those we are paying here? Take

also,   for   instance,  Taiwan,   where   Chinese

education  is  in existence. Are the  teachers  in

Chinese  schools there being paid more than  those

here?  The  Chinese primary school  teachers  here

compared with their counterparts in other parts of

the  world are very much better treated and  paid.

From  where do they get their salaries? Of course,

they  get  them from the Government. Can  you  say

that this is bad treatment of Chinese education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that in the past, Chinese school

teachers who were relatives of the principals were

employed as teachers in those principals' schools,

irrespective of their past experience or  academic

or  professional qualifications. As a result, they

had  wronged  not  only themselves  but  also  the

pupils  under  their care and the  schools  became

school  shops or commercial institutes.  But  now,

let  us  look  at Chinese education in  Singapore.

Chinese  education in our Chinese schools is  very

much  better. All the teachers are being  trained,

and we can also say that this is the only place in

South-East Asia where Chinese school teachers  are

given  training facilities. We should be proud  of

this   fact.  Therefore,  through  this  teachers'

training scheme the teaching standards in  Chinese

schools  can  be raised and Chinese education  can

continue to develop and flourished. Would you term

this as destruction of Chinese education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Barisan Members

repeatedly say that they are champions  of  Nantah

(Nanyang  University). Does Nantah belong  to  you

alone?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



It  is  not possible. Everyone in Singapore has  a

share  in Nantah. Nantah cannot be monopolised  by

this  minority  group. Their attitudes  and  their

ways cannot justify themselves in the eyes of  the

people  in  Singapore.  These  people  have   been

shouting   about  Chinese  education  in   Nanyang

University and yet they have never abided  by  the

Nanyang University Ordinance. In October we held a

Nanyang  University consultative  meeting  on  the

question  of the resignation of Mr Tan Lark  Sye.

Suddenly a person called Poh Seng See went to  the

meeting  claiming himself to be a  member  of  the

Council  of  Nantah, ignoring the  fact  that  any

representative sent out by the Council should be a

member of the proper body of Nantah. To qualify as

a  member of Nantah University, one condition  has

to   be   satisfied.  According  to  the   Nanyang

University  Ordinance, anybody who has contributed

$1,000  to  the University can become a member  of

Nanyang  University.  Has the  Member  for  Jurong

contributed $1,000? Is he a member of the  Nanyang

University?  How is it that they  could  show  off

themselves  as  members of the Nanyang  University

Council to attend the Council meeting? The Nanyang

University  Ordinance  also  provides   that   the

Chairman  of  the  Nanyang  University  Students'

Union   should  be  the  Vice-Chancellor  of   the

University, but this was not so. According to  the

Ordinance, the Constitution of the Students' Union

also provides that the financial statement of  the

Students'   Union  should  be  approved   by   the

University Council. But this has never been  done.

Have  they  complied  with the Nanyang  University

Ordinance?  They  have never done  so.  They  have

monopolised  Nanyang University as if it  belonged

to  them for the training of their personal cadres

to  create political disturbances and strikes.  In

October, these people boycotted their classes  and

went out to the Padang to lie in the sun. What  is

this?  And when they were asked to disperse,  they

refused to do so. This is really incomprehensible.

Even  during the holidays, they refused  to  leave

the  University. What is all this? They said  that

they wanted to stay in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



the  University  campus  in  order  to  carry  out

University  Week projects. This is  ridiculous.  I

note  that  on 28th November, the Students'  Union

submitted  a  plan  on  University  Week  to   the

University  Senate, but the Council of  Deans  did

not  approve  it  because  according  to  it,  the

University Council would have to spend $20,000. So

the  Council did not approve the plan,  and  since

the  money  was  not forthcoming, how  could  they

carry  out  University  Week projects?  University

Week was not held for the first time this year. In

the   past,  there  were  several  occasions  when

University  Week  projects were carried  out  when

they  did  not stay in the University  campus.  On

past  occasions, they took part in University Week

only  after the University had reopened when  they

went  to  meet in the Auditorium. Why should  they

now  want  to  stay in the University campus  this

time?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Members sitting in this House today

should  thank the Nanyang University students  for

having done their best to canvass for them. Day in

and day out, lorry-loads of students went round to

do  propaganda work everywhere. Is this a kind  of

academic exercise? It is not. And they also  went

round  to  collect money for the Barisan Sosialis.

Is  this  also  a kind of academic activity?  They

think  that they only can criticise other  people,

but  when  they are criticised by others they  say

that  other people are obstructing their  academic

freedom  and  destroying Chinese education.  These

are  all outmoded slogans. Is election campaigning

a  kind  of academic activity? Is staying  in  the

University   campus  also  a  kind   of   academic

activity? We know that the real purpose  of  their

remaining in the University campus is to  obstruct

the    efforts   of   the   Government   and   the

representatives of the University Council to reach

an  agreement.  On  the 4th  of  December  in  the

Nanyang  Siang Pau, there was a statement made  by

the  Chairman  of  the Students'  Union  that  the

purpose  of the graduates remaining in the  campus

was  to  make full use of the vacation  so  as  to

carry out preparatory work for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



University  Week projects? What did they  mean  by

that?  In actual fact, it was not really necessary

for them to remain in the University campus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Member for Jurong said that

the  Government has suppressed the University  and

the  workers  in  the  Naval Base.  What  actually

happened  is  that there was one Communist  worker

who   assaulted  another  worker  whose  name  was

Latiff.  This  particular worker, Latiff  did  not

obey the directives of the union in calling out an

illegal strike. He resisted the attempt, and as  a

result,  he was assaulted brutally. Now,  who  was

brutal?   Who  made  the  assault?  It   is   the

Communists  in the union who had carried  out  the

assault against an innocent worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong urged us to check our horse

on  the precipice. I will say that it is they  who

should pull up their horse before they plunge into

the  ravine. Their friend, Mr Lim Shee Ping,  has

now  turned over a new leaf. And it is their  turn

to  turn over a new leaf in their lives. What have

they  to  struggle for? They will not be  able  to

achieve  their  aims. Theirs is  an  authoritarian

regime.   They   can  only  create   trouble   and

bloodshed.   I  believe  they  will  not   achieve

anything  during our life-time. Therefore,  it  is

they who should pull up their horse before they go

any  further. What they are doing have  no  useful

purpose for mankind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other friend, the Member for Nee Soon, has

disappeared  for some time. What  is  the  use  of

hiding somewhere? Where can he hide? For how  long

can  he  hide?  There  is  no  way  out  for  him.

Therefore,  my advice to them is that they  should

pull  up  their horse before they go any  further.

They  should  not  persist in their  anti-Malaysia

struggle  to their own destruction. They can  turn

back.  It  will be good for them if they can  turn

back. It will be good for the people of Singapore,

and for the people in Malaysia as a whole, if they

can turn back.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In

these  proceedings  today,  many  Members  of  the

Opposition as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



well  as the Government have added their views  on

the  motion. When the Assembly resumed its sitting

at 2.30 p.m. this afternoon, some Members spoke on

the   motion  moved  by  the  Prime  Minister.   I

personally  feel  that, apart from  attacking  the

Communists  and the pro-Communists, the Government

Benches  do  not  seem to have  anything  to  talk

about. Just to attack the Communists is not a wise

approach.  Ngoh  Dinh Diem of South  Vietnam  also

treated  the monks as Communists. And so  has  our

friend,   Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew,  who   brands   any

progressive opponent as a Communist. He will  call

every opponent of his a Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of a majority, or minority, as

touched  upon by the Prime Minister, interests  me

in  this  way. Although we are a minority in  this

House, outside this House the broad masses of  the

people  are in sympathy with us. The last  general

election  was  conducted in  a  most  undemocratic

manner  and  it  was  won by the  P.A.P. in  that

manner. Our leaders were arrested. Many legitimate

associations  and  unions were banned  before  the

general   election.   Yet  in   spite   of   these

undemocratic  conditions, there were some  300,000

voters who supported us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Nanyang University. The policy

of   the  P.A.P. to  think  that  businessmen  in

Singapore  are unable to run any university  is  a

great insult to the intelligence of businessmen in

Singapore. They claim themselves to be experts  in

university  education.  But  they  have  not  done

anything  to  help  Nanyang  University.  So   far

Nanyang University has not received a single  cent

from  them.  Can the P.A.P. give aid and  academic

freedom  to  Nanyang  University  unconditionally?

They  say that the University is being run by  the

Communists.  There  is  no  autonomy  in  Nanyang

University. Now all the facts have come  to  prove

the  mistakes of the Prime Minister in making this

allegation. The Nanyang University Students' Union

has  all  along  been supported by the  people  of

Singapore and Malaysia for their work, and to  say

that  their activities during University Week  are

Communist activities is absurd. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



every  University Week organised  by  the  Nanyang

University  Students' Union, a lot  of  spectators

and  members  of the public attend the  exhibition

and   take  part  in  the  activities.  There  are

spectators  from  various  States  all  over   the

Federation  of Malaya. Year in and  year  out  the

people   have  been  shown  the  useful  work   of

University  Week.  Some  money  is  spent  on  the

activities  in  which  the  Nanyang  students  are

engaged.  To  say  such activities  are  Communist

activities  is  an insult to the people  who  take

part in them and who support them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. in giving aid to Nanyang University

wants  to have the condition that interference  is

permitted - in other words, they want to  give  you

aid   with   certain  strings.   They   say   that

businessmen  in Singapore are unable  to  run  the

University.  That means that only P.A.P. men  are

able to run it. If they are not P.A.P., then not a

single  cent  will  be given. That  is  not  quite

correct. Insofar as aid is to be given to  Nanyang

University,  the  P.A.P. has  not  done  anything

concrete   to  help.  Even  on  the  question   of

bursaries  - in  spite of what the  Government  has

said  and  its promise to help the poor  students,

what has the Government actually done? What is the

amount of money given to the poor students? A  sum

of  some  $600,000  has  been  allocated  for  the

purpose  of  bursaries.  Actually  only  half  the

amount has been spent, and the other half is still

dangling  in  the air. Why? We do  not  understand

why. The list of recipients has not been published

this  year and we do not know the total amount  of

bursaries granted to the students this year.  Now,

what is actually the game they are playing? We  do

not   understand  why  two  students  have   their

bursaries  recalled. Can all this  show  that  the

Government   is  really  interested   in   Nanyang

University?  The  Central  Government   tried   to

suppress  Nanyang  University  by  arresting  some

Nanyang students on the 8th of October. All  these

facts, and the action of the Central Government in

arresting and assaulting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



the   under-graduates,  show  that   the   Central

Government  is  unreasonable and barbaric  towards

Nanyang  University.  Is the Singapore  Government

collaborating  in  these actions  of  the  Central

Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour talked about the Barisan Sosialis Members in this House. From his speech we can go one step further and know what kind of a political Party the P.A.P. is; what kind of

democracy they are talking about. What is the true

meaning of democracy they are talking about?  They

are trying to brag about their victory and the so-called  support of the people. If they are  really

getting the support of the people, why should they

be   so  apprehensive  of  the  true  meaning   of

democracy?  Of our struggle through constitutional

means?  Why  should  they  be  so  afraid  of  our

legitimate  political activities by constitutional

means?  Is  the P.A.P. today really interested  in

struggling   with   the   Barisan   Sosialis    by

constitutional means? Or is it more interested  in

getting  the support of the Central Government  in

using   Fascist  measures  against   the   Barisan

Sosialis?  We  have heard from the horse's  mouth,

namely,  the  Minister  for  Labour's,  the   true

meaning of democracy in their dictionary.  We  ask

them  one question. Are we safe as Members of  the

Legislative Assembly? Do we have personal security

as Members of the Legislative Assembly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the severance of trade between

Singapore  and  Indonesia, the Minister  concerned

says  that  it is because of the Barisan  Sosialis

that such a situation has arisen and all the blame

must  be shouldered by the Barisan Sosialis. I  am

not   clear  whether  he  and  the  Minister   for

Education have read the booklet published  by  the

Ministry  of  Culture  on A Year  of  Achievement,

printing  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech.  I

make  a  quotation for the purpose  of  record.  I

quote  the  reasons given by the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara for the confrontation. Let them listen to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



this. Members will note that the confrontation put

up by Indonesia against Malaysia has caused regret

among  the people. Let us read the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech made on the 29th of  November  in

this  House in which he gave the reasons  for  the

confrontation. Have the Ministers  read  this?  If

not, let me read it [col. 117]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... whether "confrontation" at present confined

to  a  trade boycott of Singapore and Penang,  and

military pressure along the borders of Sarawak  is

contained  and held, and slowly resolved,  depends

upon the policy settled by the Central Government,

not that of any member State Government.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if the control is in the hands of the

Central Government, then how can the Minister  for

Labour  blame  the Barisan Sosialis for  all  this

confrontation  and  its  consequences?   Let   the

Ministers   and   Members   opposite   read    His

Excellency's speech!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What causes us amazement is that the Ministers

and  important  people opposite do not  understand

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech,  I  would  like to say something  more  to

supplement  my argument. I would like to  ask,  is

Indonesia  not  an independent country?  Would  it

have  to follow Barisan's directions to carry  out

its confrontation policy? Does Indonesia have  to

take  directions from the Barisan?  Even  a  child

will understand this. But these people opposite do

not even know this simplest Common sense question:

How   can   this  independent  sovereign   country

(Indonesia)  take  instructions from  a  political

Party  in a non-independent foreign State?  It  is

most  ridiculous to believe this. Indonesia is  an

independent sovereign country and it has  its  own

power  and  discretion to decide its own policies.

Confrontation is a policy exercised  by  Indonesia

in  such  a  way.  The  Barisan  Sosialis,  as   a

political  Party,  also have a  right  to  express

their  own  thoughts  and  political  ideas.  They

propose    that    this   crisis   arising    from

confrontation  should  be  resolved  by   peaceful

consultations  between the Central  Government  of

Malaysia and Indonesia. But up to now, the  P.A.P.

oligarchy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



have   not  tried  to  do  so.  Has  the   Central

Government adopted this peaceful means  or  is  it

stepping  up the supply of armaments to  launch  a

hot  war to deal with confrontation? There are two

alternatives: one is by peaceful means; the  other

is  by  force.  Today,  the confrontation  between

Malaysia  and  Indonesia is caused by  reactionary

elements  in  Britain as well as in Malaysia.  The

P.A.P. does  not  only  want  to  curb  the  evil

consequences  but  it is also  giving  support  to

these activities. This only goes to show that  the

P.A.P. is a stooge in this neo-colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour bragged about academic freedom and educational equality. I will only give an example to rebut his statement. At the ninth milestone, Tampines, there is a school which has been in existence for 40 years. What has happened to this school now? The land has been confiscated

to  make  way  for  an airport; the  teachers  are

jobless  and the students have been absorbed  into

English  schools.  Is  this an  example  of  equal

treatment  for the four streams of education?  Now

let  us  look  at  the treatment received  by  the

University  of  Singapore and Nanyang  University.

The  University  of  Singapore has  received  many

millions  of  dollars  as  aid,  whereas   Nanyang

University has not received a single cent from the

Government. Is this equality of treatment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talks about prosperity in Singapore. I want to tell him that this is only a superficial phenomenon. In spite of many foreigners coming to Singapore, in spite of some people and the Ministers owning houses and cars, the number of unemployed people is increasing day

by  day.  In every corner of Singapore we can  see

beggars  begging  for money. Is  this  a  sign  of

prosperity?  We  can  also see  people  committing

suicide   by   jumping  from  high  multi-storeyed

buildings.  Hawkers,  whether  they  are  on   the

thoroughfares or in the backlanes, are  everywhere

to  be found. This is because they cannot find any

other  jobs. They are therefore compelled to hawk.

We  admit  that  Singapore is  placed  in  a  very

advantageous geographical position. If we can make

use of this geographical position and put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



our port to good use, we will be able to solve our

problems of livelihood and the people of Singapore

will  then  be able to enjoy the same comforts  as

are  enjoyed  by the Ministers. But what  are  the

facts  today?  They talk about the free  education

enjoyed  by  the children here as  an  example  to

prove that we are heading for prosperity. But free

primary  education is paid for by the people.  The

P.A.P. also  talk about the achievements  of  the

Housing  and Development Board and the raising  of

the  people's  standard  of  living.  Many  people

living in Selegie House have to pay $96.50 a month

for  a three-room flat, excluding water and light!

If they are earning only $100 to $200 a month, how

can  they  afford  to  pay  such  a  high  rental?

Although  such  people are living in  Housing  and

Development  Board  flats,  they  have  to  starve

themselves and lead a miserable life because  they

cannot  build  attap houses in other  places.  The

Government is the biggest landlord acting  through

the  Housing and Development Board. The Government

has  fattened  itself on the revenue derived  from

the  Housing and Development Board rentals. We can

clearly   see  that.  The  Mountbatten  area   was

originally  a  rich people's area, and  the  votes

that  we  got from this area were cast  by  people

living  in  Housing and Development  Board  fiats.

This  shows  that they are dissatisfied  with  the

present Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister talked about better treatment for the workers, but there are many workers who are laid off by the management and who are compelled to take up jobs at very low pay - from $2 to $3 a day. He also talked about the increasing number of motor-cycles to show that we have prosperity in

Singapore.  Such promises cannot  hold  water.  In

fact,  most  of those who ride on motor-cycles  are

the poor workers who have to ply their trade. They

are  not  like  the Ministers who have  cars.  The

Minister  also talked about public assistance  and

relief  to fire victims. When we visited the  fire

victims,  they told us that their future was  very

bleak. Their monthly income was only $100 to $200.

They wondered whether they could afford to stay in

a Housing Board flat. Now that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



their  houses had been devastated by fire and  all

their  personal belongings lost, they have to  pay

higher  rentals  if they want to stay  in  Housing

Board flats. They have gone through misfortune and

now  the  Government want to impose high rents  on

them.  In  fact, the Government want to clear  the

fire  site  in order to build other Housing  Board

flats so that they can earn income from rentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talked about Singapore being the New York of Malaysia, but unemployed workers are becoming more numerous and this is what they call the New York of Malaysia!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. helped the British Government and the

Federation  Government to impose Malaysia  on  the

people   of   Singapore,   thus   bringing   about

misfortune   to  the  people  of  Singapore.   The

Minister  also talked about Malaysia being  unable

to  encircle  Indonesia. It does  not  concern  us

whether  the  present  attitude  of  Indonesia  is

correct  or  not.  Whether  a  small  country  can

surround a big country is another matter, but  the

past  two  World Wars have shown that  it  is  the

small   countries   which   surrounded   the   big

countries. Japan, being a small country, was  able

to  surround a big country such as China, and this

is  a  very  good  example to show  that  a  small

country  is  capable of aggression against  a  big

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talked about the Afro-Asian Conference in Moshi. The Ministers of the P.A.P. did not condemn the brutal act committed by the Central Government in arresting one of our representatives. This only shows that the P.A.P. delegates were not supported by the delegates in

the Afro-Asian Conference at Moshi.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the strike at the Naval Base, it is the

P.A.P. who broke it up and caused misery  to  the

workers there. What is the attitude of the P.A.P.?

Do  they want to oppose the Central Government, or

do they want to support it in regard to the strike

at  the Naval Base? The workers staged a strike at

the  Naval  Base  in order to raise  their  living

standard, but their strike was sabotaged.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



Do  the  P.A.P. agree to the action taken  by  the

Central Government or do they support the workers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talked about Mr Lim Shee Ping. We do not know the real position of Mr Lim Shee Ping because he is not here. Now, if the statement allegedly made by him is false, then the Central Government is very mean in falsifying his statement. This is a very low tactic, using the

threat of life imprisonment to force detainees  to

give up their political convictions and to prevent

them   from   carrying   out   their   legal   and

constitutional  struggle  by  banning  them   from

carrying  out their political activities.  In  the

case  of the Member for Toa Payoh, it is the  same

case  of the Central Government trying to suppress

their political opponents. Now, what is the P.A.P.

attitude  on this question? They do not side  with

the   people  but  instead  they  side  with   the

reactionary Central Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to talk about the labour policy mentioned in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. I am of the opinion that this labour policy is detrimental to the interests of the workers. If the P.A.P. oligarchy are genuinely interested in looking after the interests of the

workers,  then  they  should  alter  their  labour

policy.  The  labour  policy clearly  reveals  the

P.A.P.'s reactionary anti-worker stand. They  have

not changed this stand. All these facts prove that

they  want  to  sacrifice  the  interests  of  the

workers  in order to appease the foreign investors

and  their  insatiable demands  for  profits.  The

labour policy for the next five years will not see

any   changes.  They  will  be  anti-worker,  more

reactionary and more detrimental to the  interests

of the workers in the years to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what is stated in the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's speech, we can see this. I would like  to

touch  on  several points. One point is  that  the

P.A.P. want to strengthen their hand to  exercise

their  control  of the workers by introducing  new

trade union legislation into the House. On the so-called educating the workers and the training of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



trade  union  leaders, we are of the opinion  that

the P.A.P. will make use of the N.T.U.C., which is

a  stooge of the P.A.P., and make use of the Adult

Education  Board under the control  of  Mr  Devan

Nair  to  deceive  and to manipulate  the  working

masses.  In  implementing  their  so-called   four

streams of education for the workers, it will mean

that   the   workers  will   be   forced   to   be

indoctrinated by their so-called education. If the

workers  do  not want to be trained in their  way,

then  the workers will not be able to get any jobs

in  the foreign-controlled firms. What will be the

result  of the so-called training of the  workers?

They  will  only  be  trained to  become  stooges,

riding  over the heads of the working masses.  The

sole  point is that the P.A.P. will set up  a  so-called committee composed of representatives  from

the  Government, employees and the employers. Now,

let  us  examine this proposal. The P.A.P. in  its

nature is thoroughly anti-worker, and these  three

propositions will further increase its reactionary

power  and  authority  to  prevent  workers   from

supporting  the  popular trade  unions  and  their

trade union leaders -for instance, to prevent  the

existence  of the popular Commercial  and  Factory

Workers'  Union.  It  raises  the  myth   of   the

Communist bogey to carry out its tactics, and even

the  Labour  Ministry cannot deny that  the  union

which   I  mentioned  earlier  has  thousands   of

members. Now, that is the first intention  of  the

P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that the P.A.P. want to carry

out   their  so-called  measures  to  prevent  the

workers from being indoctrinated and influenced by

the  Communists. Anyone who is not satisfied  with

the  present  P.A.P. political policy  or  is  not

satisfied  with  his  living  conditions  will  be

dubbed as a Communist by the P.A.P. Now the P.A.P.

want  to introduce a new trade union law the  main

purpose  of which is for the reason which  I  have

just pointed out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that the P.A.P. say is that the

Government  is trying to improve the  relationship

between  employer and employee and to improve  the

economy, but from our point of view the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



present  economic situation is  the  result  of  a

colonial  economic system inherited by the  P.A.P.

If  such  an  economic situation is  not  changed,

there   will  be  no  improvement  in  the  living

conditions  of the workers. The P.A.P.  Government

economic   policy   is   to   encourage    foreign

capitalists to exploit our workers further and not

to  encourage our national capitalists to  develop

our industries. Instead, the P.A.P. is encouraging

foreign  monopolists to compete with our  national

capitalists and investors. Furthermore, the P.A.P.

is  going to introduce a new Trade Union Ordinance

to  prevent  the workers from staging strikes.  To

sum up, the purpose of the P.A.P. in doing this is

to  treat the workers of Singapore as serfs in the

feudal  system in order to enable the  capitalists

and  other exploiters to scrape their profits from

the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these are the three main reasons for the

Government's  policy.  This sugar-coating  of  the

Government  policy will further encourage  foreign

capitalists  to exploit our workers in  all  ways.

Singapore  is  very unfortunate in  this  kind  of

situation and yet the P.A.P. are looking  for  the

worst  to  happen. They are not  keen  to  seek  a

better future for the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, we can describe the P.A.P. as being

biased.  The  introduction  of  their  legislation

concerning the Trade Unions Ordinance  is  out  of

political  motivation and not with the  object  of

looking  after the interests of the  workers.  The

main purpose of the legislation will be to control

and suppress these large trade unions supported by

the progressive workers in order to put them under

the  control of such puppet trade unions as  those

under  Devan Nair. This is a repetition  of  their

past evil deeds and it has also now reached a  new

stage in their scheme of repression. They are  not

contented with arresting trade union leaders. They

have  gone further and banned seven trade  unions.

They  even intend to go a step further and destroy

all other unions which are really fighting for the

interest of the workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's refusal to allow the workers to

organise  themselves into unions to improve  their

working  conditions is a direct interference  with

the  rights  of the workers. Why is  it  that  the

P.A.P. is  so very interested in introducing  new

legislation  of  such  a  nature  as  to  exercise

stricter  control  over trade unions?  This  is  a

question  that is worth our careful consideration.

This  shows  that the Ministers of the P.A.P. are

very  afraid  of the people being aware  of  their

basic  rights.  This also goes to  show  that  the

P.A.P.  Ministers are trying their  very  best  to

foster  their own unions against the interests  of

the  workers in general. The objective  conditions

are  not in favour of the P.A.P. and their stooges

in the trade union field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P.-controlled unions cannot stand where

true  unions exist, because such true  unions  are

fighting for the interests of the workers and  are

getting  the  support of the workers  in  general;

whereas the P.A.P.-controlled unions will not  get

such  support,  and  so the P.A.P. will  have  to

resort to governmental interference with the  true

unions  of  the workers in order to  foster  their

P.A.P.-dominated   unions.  Such  P.A.P.-dominated

unions  as  the  N.T.U.C. can  never  find  their

existence  in  true  trade unionism,  because  the

P.A.P.-controlled  unions  such  as  the  N.T.U.C.

exist only for the interest of the P.A.P. and  the

foreign  capitalists.  They  exist  only  for  the

interest  of  a  few leaders who  work  for  their

selfish  interests, but against the  interests  of

the  workers in general. They will sell  away  the

interests of the workers for their own sake.  They

are anti-labour, they are anti-worker; and that is

why  they  are being discarded by the  workers  in

general.  Such a situation is inevitable,  because

true  trade unionism will have the support of  all

the working class and will flourish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven big unions in Singapore have been banned.

The  anti-worker  elements, the  traitors  of  the

workers,   try  to  take  over  control   of   the

membership  of the banned unions by  absorbing  it

into the N.T.U.C., but their hopes have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



shattered to pieces, because the majority  of  the

members  of  the  defunct  unions  do  not   allow

themselves to fall into their trap. They have made

a  wise  choice by joining unions which can  truly

represent their interests. That is why the  P.A.P.

is now trying its very best to take action against

these  unions  which have absorbed and  which  are

absorbing the members from the banned unions,  for

instance,  the  Commercial  and  Factory   Workers

Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is now contemplating the introduction

of  a  new  Labour Ordinance to enable the  P.A.P.

Ministers  to  cancel  the registration  of  those

unions which truly represent the interests of  the

workers. The introduction of the proposed Bill  on

labour  has a lot of political motivation  in  it,

and  this motivation aims at depriving the workers

of  their  basic  rights. It has this  undesirable

element of taking away the right of the workers to

ask for betterment of their working conditions. It

also  has  the  undesirable factor  of  trying  to

prevent the workers from leading a decent life  by

their  strength and unity. That is why the workers

in  general are very dissatisfied with the  P.A.P.

nowadays.  Whether  you are  a  colonialist  or  a

reactionary element of the Federation  of  Malaya,

or  whether you are a P.A.P. divisionist, you  all

aim  at  high  pressure to  be  exerted  over  the

workers.  You  are all trying to  resort  to  very

undemocratic   means   and  unreasonable   tactics

against the workers. To achieve all this you  make

use  of this popular education campaign to try and

monopolise the trade union world. But in spite  of

all that they are doing, they will not succeed  in

getting  control of the true trade unions, because

their  motivation  is  undesirable  in  the  first

instance.  An idea of this undesirable  motivation

can  be  seen from a speech broadcast  over  Radio

Singapore by Dr Goh Keng Swee. In this speech Dr

Goh  believes that only his kind of trade unionism

will be able to promote industrialisation, whereas

the  trade  unionism  that is  in  favour  of  the

workers, such as the trade unionism encouraged and

accepted by the seven banned unions, according  to

Dr Goh, is not conducive to industrialisation  in

Singapore. Yet in spite of what he says, these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



unions  that  are  truly  representative  of   the

workers'  interests have popular support from  the

working  class, because they seek to  improve  the

lot of the workers in general. The broad masses of

the  working class cannot compare their  wages  to

the  salaries  of the Ministers. The  workers  are

living in misery, unlike the Ministers who live in

big  houses.  So to improve their  lot  to  get  a

decent living they have to take certain actions to

claim  for better working conditions. Our  workers

in Singapore are not, as is said by our Ministers,

enjoying a very high standard of living. If you go

round  Singapore and see for yourselves, you  will

realise what misery our Singapore workers are  in.

In  his  speech over the Radio, Dr Goh Keng  Swee

says  that some foreign investors are hesitant  in

coming forward to Singapore to invest because they

are  afraid of the industrial unrest in Singapore.

Today, the P.A.P. has taken a lot of capital  away

from  Singapore  to the North Borneo  and  Sarawak

territories. Yet they have the cheek to turn round

and say that it is because foreign capitalists are

hesitant  in  coming  forward  to  Singapore  that

Singapore  has  not  been able to  get  sufficient

capital for industrialisation purposes. I  do  not

know  what  these  economic  experts  will  do  to

protect  our  local  capitalists  against  foreign

competition.  In  fact,  our  so-called   economic

experts  are  more  interested in  protecting  the

foreign  capitalists  and investors  in  Singapore

than  our  own  local  small  capitalists.  It  is

therefore very clear that the P.A.P. in trying  to

educate   the  working  class  perhaps   aims   at

depriving the workers of their right to strike and

to  ask  for better working conditions.  In  other

words, they are trying to deceive the workers into

believing that by keeping quiet they will be  able

to  have  a better lot in future, that it  is  not

necessary for the workers to go on strike  to  get

better  terms of service. This perhaps is the  aim

of  the  so-called education policy of the  P.A.P.

This  measure  and the steps contemplated  by  the

P.A.P. now will in the next five years bring  the

workers  into greater misery and go a step further

to fatten the pockets of the foreign investors. We

can say that but for these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



measures   and  proposed  policies  the  Singapore

workers  will be able to lead a decent  life,  but

because  the  P.A.P. is  trying  to  appease  the

foreign  capitalists, the lot of  the  workers  in

Singapore  will not be improved; in fact  it  will

deteriorate as more money is being taken  away  by

the  foreign capitalists and more and more workers

will  have  to work under worse working conditions

with less wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the policy of the P.A.P. in regard to

foreign  capitalists and investors  in  Singapore?

They  are  more  interested  in  protecting  their

vested interests. They do not care so much for the

workers  in Singapore. Neither do they  care  very

much   for  the  local  capitalists  and  national

capitalists. What they are interested in now is to

get as many foreign capitalists and investors into

Singapore as possible. They think that by so doing

they will be able to bring about prosperity in our

country.  But  I  will  now  tell  them  that  the

prosperity that they are going to bring about will

not  be enjoyed by the workers in general but will

be  monopolised  by  the foreign  capitalists  and

investors. It is fantastic for the P.A.P. to think

that  they  are  able to educate  the  workers  of

Singapore  into obedient servants. Their so-called

trade  union  leaders  are  actually  aristocratic

people.   Their  talk  of  collective  bargaining,

administrative training and improvement  of  trade

unionism  is  all  a  bluff. They  are  trying  to

deceive the workers into believing that by working

obediently   for  their  capitalist  and   foreign

masters,  the workers will have a better  life  in

future. The anti-worker elements such as Mr Devan

Nair  are  trying to ride over the  heads  of  the

workers.   They  are  not  able  to  protect   the

interests of the workers in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are actually working for the interests of

the  ruling class and for their own selfish  ends.

What  are  they  trying  to  do  now?  By  way  of

educating   the  workers,  they  are   trying   to

inculcate ideas into the workers, that by  keeping

quiet they will have their lot improved. The  true

colours  of these anti-labour elements  have  been

seen clearly by the workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



in  general.  Who have assaulted  the  workers  on

strike?  Who have sold away the interests  of  the

workers? Who have taken the leaders of the workers

to prison? And who are actually enjoying life now?

The broad mass of the working class knows too well

such  things.  The  so-called educating-the-worker

policy and the new legislation to be introduced in

the labour field, are all the steps taken in order

to   safeguard  the  interests  of   the   foreign

investors  and  foreign  capitalists.  The  P.A.P.

leaders are trying to extract the sweat and labour

of  the  workers  of  Singapore  to  please  their

foreign friends and capitalists. In fact, the high

standard of living our Ministers are enjoying  now

has   been  the  result  of  exploitation  of  the

workers. The people in general are living in great

misery.  Their standard of living is lowering  and

their  lot  will become worse and worse.  The  so-called  prosperity, as claimed by the  P.A.P.,  in

Malaysia  is only a myth. Malaysia, as imposed  by

the  reactionary elements and the P.A.P., has  not

brought  happiness to the people. Instead  it  has

brought  misery. The working class has to  tighten

their  belts.  This  is what  the  P.A.P. call  a

prosperous Malaysia - asking the people to  tighten

their belts. How can the PAP, convince the workers

by  their radio broadcast? How can they make empty

promises to the workers by painting a very glowing

picture  of the future? By trying to push  forward

their  education campaign? They will only want  to

deceive the people. The workers themselves realise

that.  In  order  to change their lot,  they  must

encourage   the  local  capitalists   to   promote

industries and commerce. All these were  mentioned

by Dr Goh Keng Swee during the 1959 election. But

today,  what they safeguard are not the  interests

of  the local capitalists and the interests of the

workers. They are not interested in protecting  on

promoting  local industries. What  they  are  more

concerned  with is to induce foreign investors  to

come   here.   They   say  that  without   foreign

investments we will have to suffer. This is  their

logic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour says if we do not have military bases we will be attacked by other people. No self-respecting people will allow their own country to be the military bases of a foreign power. Talking about military bases, although the expenditure on the military bases is not paid by

Singapore  and  the Federation, but  the  military

bases  we have here are intended to safeguard  and

protect  the  mining  and  rubber  industries   in

Malaya,  which  suck  the  blood  of  our  fellow-citizens,  and  they belong to the foreigners.  He

says  without these military bases 60 per cent  of

the  tin  mines  and  90 per cent  of  the  rubber

industries  will be nationalised  by  our  country

through  peaceful  negotiations  between  the  two

Governments. The British military bases,  although

the  money  spent on them does not come  from  our

country  and our people, help to maintain  foreign

capitalists and their interests in this area.  The

British will not be a stupid robber. They are  too

clever  for that. The Minister for Labour and  the

Prime  Minister have been saying that the military

bases  support a lot of people here. The  salaries

paid  to  the workers in the military  bases  come

from the rich rubber estates, from the revenue  of

our  port  and  from the benefits of  our  foreign

trade.  Is  this  not  a classic  example  of  the

British  sucking  the blood  of  our  people?  The

salaries  received by the workers in the  military

bases   do  not  come  from  the  British  people.

Although  to some extent the troops here have  fed

some  of  our  workers,  all  peace-loving  people

throughout the world and the people in our country

have  in  turn supported the British  troops.  The

Minister for Labour can for some time deceive  the

people  through  his radio, television  and  Press

talks,  but  outside this Chamber  his  propaganda

will not stand the lest of time. How can they  say

that  the  British imperialist bases in this  area

support  the  people in this area? This  plausible

argument  put  forward by the  Minister  will  not

deceive  the  people  any longer  and  it  is  not

without   reason  that  they  put   forward   this

argument.  It  is  put forward to deceive  certain

sections



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



of  the people who are ignorant of whether who are

supporting whom, whether the British bases support

our  people or we, the people, support the British

bases  here. They say that to abolish the military

bases  here will bring unemployment to our workers

here. In fact, with our rich natural resources, we

can  very  well  support the workers  who  are  at

present  working in the military bases.  Once  the

British  foreign  bases no more  exist  here,  the

workers working in the bases will be looked  after

by  our nation and will receive their proper  due.

Only  the  reactionary elements and the  Ministers

will  dare to say that without military bases  our

workers  will  be  jobless  because  we  have  our

national  wealth  to  support these  workers.  The

P.A.P.   Government  will  not  look   after   the

unemployed   people.  We  strongly   condemn   the

maintenance  of foreign bases and we  condemn  the

British/Malayan   Defence   Agreement   from   the

standpoint of safeguarding the workers. We  expose

the  specious arguments put forward by the  P.A.P.

Ministers.  Once they know the true  picture,  the

workers  will  not be misled or  deceived  by  the

argument  that without military bases our  workers

cannot get any jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those anti-worker classes on the question of

solving  the  unemployment problem of the  workers

are  helpless. The only thing they can  do  is  to

destroy   the   workers'   organisation,   disrupt

peaceful  living and interfere with the legitimate

right of the workers. These people are helping the

British  masters  to  carry  out  suppression  and

exploitation. In the coming days if  their  policy

fails  and  if  the  lot of  the  workers  is  not

improved,  then  they  will be  discarded  by  the

workers. What I have said above is on the intended

trade union legislation and the specious education

of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to talk about the Labour Advisory

Council. As long ago as the beginning of this year

the  P.A.P.'s  Minister for Finance  mentioned  it

during  his radio broadcast. In the speech of  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara this session, there is only

a  short passage about it. The speech broadcast by

the  Minister  for  Finance was more  clear  about

this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



In  order not to let this point pass away, I  find

it  necessary  to  repeat what  the  Minister  for

Finance, Dr Goh Keng Swee, said on it during  his

broadcast. He said his view and impression of  the

trade  unions  supported by the workers  was  that

they   supported  only  the  interest  of  certain

sections  of  the people. They were interested  in

asking  for  better living conditions  and  better

wages  only for a section of the workers in  these

trade  unions.  That is why Dr Goh suggested  the

setting up of a Labour Advisory Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as an organisation a trade union must

look  after the interests of its members. It  goes

without  saying  and  it is justified.  And  as  a

national  organisation, of course,  it  will  also

look  after the members who belong to it. How  can

you  ask  the organisation not to seek to  improve

the  lot and the working conditions of the members

belonging to it? Of course, people like the P.A.P.

Ministers  are  not satisfied, although  they  are

using  their  positions in the  State  to  protect

their  interest. They are not contented with this.

They  also  want  to make use of the  trade  union

organisation to protect their own interest. As  to

how  to protect foreign capitalists, Dr Goh  Keng

Swee   suggested  setting  up  a  Labour  Advisory

Council so that the workers can be recruited  over

to  their side and not to raise demands for better

working  conditions. Dr Goh was not in  agreement

that  the  claims by the workers were  for  better

working conditions and better living standards. He

said  his view was that the unions making  demands

on  behalf of the workers should be concerned with

the claims to benefit foreign capitalists instead.

You can see clearly what has been mentioned in the

policy  speech, that the Labour Advisory  Council,

consisting    of   Labour   Ministry    officials,

management   representatives   and   trade   union

representatives,  is not really  directed  towards

nor can it achieve the aim of improving the lot of

the  workers.  Instead they  want  to  freeze  all

improvement of working conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today an important question is: "What kind of

people  are  trade  union representatives?"  Trade

unions which

are  truly supported by the workers they  construe

to  be Communist controlled. Only those under  the

control  of P.A.P. they construe to be true  trade

unions.   And   those  anti-worker  trade   unions

controlled by anti-worker personnel as Devan  Nair

who   serve   only   the  interests   of   foreign

capitalists they construe to be true trade unions.

We  doubt very much whether people like Devan Nair

can truly represent the interest of the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> On a point of order.

Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Chamber two years ago we

heard   the  Chairman  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis

repeating  the  same old record and  yet  now  the

newly  elected  Member is doing  the  same  thing,

criticising all this P.A.P. labour ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Tampines has

been  mentioning Mr Devan Nair several  times  in

the  same context. Would he just go on to the main

debate  before the House? He has mentioned  Devan

Nair several times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

doubt very much whether the Member for Changi  has

read  the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  I

doubt  very  much whether he has  read  about  the

Labour Advisory Council mentioned in the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech. If he has not  done  so,

how  could he form any opinion about it? How could

he say that this has nothing to do with our debate

on  labour policy? Does he not know that there  is

mention made of the Labour Advisory Council in the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I was analysing the composition of the

tripartite representatives in the Labour  Advisory

Council. With reference to the first part  of  the

tripartite  representatives, I have  expressed  my

doubts  about  it when I talked about  the  labour

policy.  I have doubts as to the acceptability  of

this representation by the workers. To the P.A.P.,

it  is those trade unions which support the P.A.P.

that  can  be considered as genuine and legitimate

trade  unions. To the P.A.P., those  trade  unions

registered under the Trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



Unions Ordinance, as provided for by the Registrar

of  Trade Unions, can truly represent the workers.

And  today the Ministry of Labour has proposed  to

set  up  a  Labour Advisory Council! Therefore,  I

have  grave doubts as to the intention  of  having

them  as one of the three representatives  in  the

Council  - whether  the  so-called  representatives

would be recruited from the discredited unions who

are  stooges  of the P.A.P. Perhaps a member  from

the trade unions fostered by the P.A.P. - which are

stooges of the P.A.P. - will be nominated  as  one

of the representatives in this Council. The P.A.P.

have not only arrested a few people, but they have

also arrested many of the trade union leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now analyse further the composition of the

Labour  Advisory  Council with  reference  to  the

Ministry  of  Labour officials. In  spite  of  the

P.A.P.'s  propaganda  and  what  they  have   been

saying,  namely, that the officials of the  Labour

Ministry  are to look after the interests  of  the

workers,   the   question  whether  these   Labour

Ministry  officials  represented  on  the   Labour

Advisory Council can truly speak on behalf of  the

workers  raises  a  grave  doubt.  I  have  doubts

whether  the  Labour  Ministry  officials  to   he

represented  on the Labour Advisory Council  which

is going to be set up can look after the interests

of  the  workers. If they can do so,  they  should

have concrete evidence to prove it. What have they

done up till now about looking after the interests

of the workers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> On a point

of  order. The Member should come to the point. He

can indicate it in his speech in his words. But he

should  not beat about the bush and come  back  to

the same point.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am now talking

about the tripartite representatives on the Labour

Advisory  Council. I have been talking  about  the

representatives  from  the Labour  Ministry.  This

point  is contained in the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,  and  I have  been  confining  my

speech to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



this  matter.  I  am  of  the  opinion  that   the

officials of the Labour Ministry cannot  speak  on

behalf  of  the  workers in these coming  days  or

years.  I  have concrete facts to substantiate  my

doubts. For instance, in the past, during a strike

at  Lorong 3, Geylang, the strikers were beaten up

by  the police and troops were sent down from  the

Central   Government.  But  the  Labour   Ministry

officials were indifferent to this. What was their

attitude then? What has been the attitude  of  the

Labour  Ministry  officials on such  questions  as

this?  Can  they look after the interests  of  the

workers  when  they  sit in  the  Labour  Advisory

Council? The general mass of the people have grave

doubts about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will touch on the third category of the

tripartite representatives in the Labour  Advisory

Council, namely the management representatives. We

say    that   there   are   two   categories    of

representatives;  one  representing  the   foreign

capitalists   and   the  other  representing   our

national employers. If the national employers  can

look  after the interests of the workers, it would

be  something very wonderful. But the Minister for

Finance  has  said that the P.A.P. intend  to  get

foreign capitalists to invest here. In addition to

the  doubt  as  to the intention of  the  national

capitalists  and their ability to look  after  the

interests  of the workers, we have further  doubts

as   to   the  good  intentions  of  the   foreign

capitalists.  Of  course,  there  should  be  true

representatives of workers in the  Council  before

there  can  be any genuine representation  of  the

workers.   If   there  is  no   genuine   workers'

representation  on  the  Council,  we  have  grave

doubts  as  to the intention of the representation

of  the employers on the Council, and the value of

the  Labour  Advisory  Council.  This  policy   of

brutality  and barbarism against the workers  does

not  meet  with  the needs of the  whole  economic

requirements of local conditions. Yet  the  P.A.P.

is  not satisfied with it. It goes further. It  is

dealing  with the Labour Ministry. From  the  fact

that the Labour Research Unit could not bring  any

benefit  to the workers, we can imagine  that  the

Labour Advisory Council will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



the same as the past Labour Research Unit ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The setting up of

the Labour Advisory Council is proof of the P.A.P.

Government's    appeasement    towards     foreign

capitalists.  Of  course, the foreign  capitalists

will  thank the P.A.P. for their so-called  labour

policy. They are trying to make use of this Labour

Advisory  Council to tie the hands of the  workers

who  want  to fight for their interests and  raise

their  wages.  It is indeed a great misfortune  to

the workers if this Labour Advisory Council is set

up according to the P.A.P.'s plan. As long as some

of the trade unions are manipulated by the P.A.P.,

there will be no industrial peace. In the days  to

come  the P.A.P. will inevitably link up with  the

Central  Government to carry out their anti-worker

measures and to brutally and savagely suppress the

workers in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have noted that in the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech it is very obvious that not  only

does  the P.A.P. Government ignore the true  trade

unions, but it also goes out of its way to get the

co-operation  of the management and  employers  to

suppress  the workers. And those true  leaders  of

the   workers  are  branded  by  the   P.A.P. as

Communists  in an attempt to suppress their  trade

unions. They are also trying to make use of  their

P.A.P.-controlled  unions  to  foster  their   own

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour policy contained in the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's speech will not bring benefit  to

the workers. Neither will it bring any prosperity.

The  P.A.P. and the reactionary Government in  the

Federation  must realise that however  brutal  and

savage  their  suppression, the workers  will  not

submit to them. And their ---

reason,  I have not chosen to stop this particular

Member. Since we have only about 15 minutes  more,

I  think we had better press on as fast as we can.

Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, we

are  very  honest  about the  procedures  in  this

Chamber  and  that  is  why  we  have  to  prepare

ourselves  before the sitting. In order to  enable

Members of this House to know our ideas better, we

have to read from our prepared speeches. Well,  so

much  for  this idle talk. Let us go back  to  the

topic under discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main question that I am raising now is on

labour autonomy. To what extent is labour autonomy

granted  to  the people of Singapore in substance,

or  does labour autonomy only exist in its titular

value - just in name? We urge the P.A.P. Government

to keep its promise in maintaining labour autonomy

in Singapore and in meeting the Opposition in open

argument  rather than in resorting  to  the  high-pressure  tactics  of the Central  Government.  We

urge  the  P.A.P. Government to resist  the  high-pressure tactics of the Central Government because

such  tactics are against the declared  policy  of

the  Government in fighting in the open  argument.

It  is  inconsistent with the open argument policy

of  the  P.A.P.  We  want the  P.A.P. to  declare

whether  it  still supports the open  argument  or

whether  it  has gone over to support the  Central

Government  for its high-pressure and  high-handed

tactics.  We  also want the P.A.P. to  defend  the

labour  autonomy which it has been boasting  about

so  much.  As a matter of fact, the livelihood  of

the   workers   in  Singapore  has  been   grossly

interfered  with, and unnecessarily  too,  by  the

Central  Government. And that  was  precisely  the

fear that we had before the formation of Malaysia.

Without  political protection,  there  can  be  no

existence of any labour autonomy. If you have no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



political  safeguards, you cannot talk  of  labour

autonomy. If the P.A.P. still persist in believing

that   there   can  be  labour  autonomy   without

political safeguards, then how are they  going  to

explain  away the fact that the workers have  been

interfered  with  by  the Federation  police?  Why

should  the Federation send troops and  police  to

assault  the  workers  in  Singapore?  The   Prime

Minister has said time and again that he does  not

endorse  the  action  of the  police  against  the

workers.   But   only  recently   the   Federation

Government  has  taken police and military  action

against  the workers on strike. Now, what  is  the

attitude  of  the P.A.P. to this matter?  Are  the

P.A.P. really  interested  in  safeguarding   the

interests  of the workers? Or are they going  back

on  the  word of the Prime Minister? He  has  said

- and  he  is known to have said - that he does  not

endorse  police  and military action  against  the

workers,  but  that they must  be  dealt  with  by

peaceful  means. There has been no riot occasioned

by any strike of the workers and there has been no

necessity  for the Federation police to come  down

to Singapore to interfere with the strikes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in Singapore have seen for themselves

that  well-trained police personnel have been used

by  the Central Government against the workers  on

strike  in  Singapore. In any constitution,  there

should be no provision to-deprive the right of the

workers  to  strike.  Even the  Government  itself

recognises the right of the workers to strike.  So

before  such  a  right  is declared  illegal,  the

workers  themselves can take part in a  legitimate

strike and there should be no police or government

interference. The strike is a weapon by which  the

workers   can   seek  to  improve  their   working

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my view of the labour policy of the

P.A.P., Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>7.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, I

thought  we had already got rid of the filibuster,

Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh,  but we  have  got  so  many

filibusters here today. Mr Speaker, I would  like

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



crave  the same indulgence that you have given  to

the Opposition Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to rebut a few points. The Member

for  Tampines has said that Mr Devan Nair and the

N.T.U.C. are stooges of the P.A.P. Government.  I

wish  the  Member  for Tampines will  answer  this

question:  are  Bani, Woodhull  and  S.A.T.U. not

stooges  of  the  Barisan Sosialis?  Probably  the

Member for Tampines was still very young when  Mr

Devan  Nair was a trade unionist. I think  he  was

still then sucking his mother's milk.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member for Bras

Basah not use unparliamentary language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker. I would

like to withdraw that remark. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Let me say that the Member was

then  sucking  his  thumb. Everyone  in  Singapore

knows  that  Mr  Devan Nair  was  once  with  the

Communists,   and   if  he  had   squealed,   many

Communists  who have infiltrated into the  Barisan

Sosialis would have gone to gaol. But he  had  not

done  so.  The so-called trade union  heroes  - Mr

Woodhull, Mr James Puthucheary, and Mr Lim  Shee

Ping - squealed while they were in gaol for a short

while, and they were released just a few days ago.

From  this  the people of Singapore can  know  the

characters of these men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I assure you that I am not going to filibuster and I would therefore like to come back to the debate on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. Mr Speaker, I associate myself with the Prime Minister in voicing our thanks to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for his

stirring  speech in opening the First  Session  of

the   Legislative  Assembly  of   the   State   of

Singapore. This little island of ours has  entered

a  new  phase  in  its  history.  The  cobwebs  of

colonialism  and  imperialism  have  been  finally

swept away by the confederation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



of Malaysia. We are now fully in the mainstream of

a  Malaysian life. Our hopes, our aspirations  and

our  achievements  must therefore  be  sought  and

examined within the context of a wider flow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this revolutionary change in our lives, it is

heartening  to  hear  His  Excellency   speak   so

confidently of our future and to note the  general

optimism throughout his review of the past and the

projections from this past into the future. I have

no criticisms at all of His Excellency's speech in

his  wide sweep of our history and of our  future.

However, there are certain parts, largely  matters

of   detail,   to  which  I  wish  to   draw   the

Government's  attention. I could, of course,  have

done  this through the Party's channel or  through

private memoranda to the Cabinet. But then if  all

of  us of the ruling Party did this, this Assembly

would  indeed  become a very poor place,  and  the

public   would   be  denied  the  opportunity   of

witnessing their representatives in action.  I  am

referring, of course, to the poor Opposition Party

in  this  House. As we all know, those of  us  who

cherish  democracy  appreciate  an  effective  and

intelligent Opposition. Mr Speaker, Sir, it  does

appear  to  me  that  such a  desirable  state  of

affairs is not at the moment present with  us.  As

the   Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  has  stated   very

accurately, our life is now interwoven  with  that

of  Malaysia,  and  if  we  confine  ourselves  to

Singapore   we   cannot  be   effective,   however

successful we may be in the Malaysian scene.
