<br><br><!--Inche Yusof Bin Ishak-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Inche Yusof Bin Ishak)</b> <i>(In Malay)</i><b>:</b>  Members  of   the

Singapore Legislative Assembly -



<br><br><b>Introduction</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the work of the P.A.P. Government

during its first year of office, due regard must be

paid to the limitations under which it had to work.

These  limitations were clearly and frankly stated,

before  the  elections, in the  P.A.P.'s  Five-Year

Plan.  The  people were aware what they  could  and

could  not  expect of a P.A.P. Government.  It  was

that   the   Government  would  operate   under   a

constitution which did not give it complete freedom

and   independence  of  political  action.  It  was

emphasised that Singapore was a small island,  with

no natural resources and dependent upon a sensitive

entrepot   trade  for  its  livelihood.   "Existing

conditions", the plan stressed, "are not favourable

to  the immediate attainment of a socialist society

and  a  fully  developed socialist society,  and  a

fully   developed  socialist  economy   cannot   be

achieved as long as Singapore is separated from the

Federation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would no doubt have been advantageous, before

an  election,  to  have-come  forward  with  lavish

promises  of independence and socialism.  But  P.A.P.

had  no  intention  of deceiving  the  people  into

voting  for it with promises it could not  fulfill.

It  asked the people to vote for it on the basis of

what  it  described  as a "not over-ambitious"  but

"realistic" Plan, to quote the words of  the

Five-Year  Plan.  The  overwhelming vote  given  by  the

people to the P.A.P. is proof that its analysis and

strategy were acceptable to the mass of the people.

If  the  Government  was not  prepared  before  the

elections  to deceive the people with  promises  to

deliver  the sun moon and stars, it has  even  less

reason  now to hold out false hopes. Democracy  has

collapsed   in  some  countries  in  Asia   because

governments, in their eagerness to cling to  power,

embraced  demagogy at the expense of integrity  and

courage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has no intention of recklessly

abandoning the aims and policies arrived  at  after

long   and   patient  deliberation.  A  responsible

Government  cannot  permit  itself  the  luxury  of

changing with every puff of wind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correctness of the policy laid down in the

Five-Year  Plan  has been shown by  the  fact  that

under  the  new Government, Singapore  has  enjoyed

greater  political and economic stability  than  it

has  known during the last 15 years. For the  first

time  in the Island's history the interests of  the

masses  have  been  more closely  linked  with  the

purposes  of  Government. The sense of  oppression,

humiliation and resentment which people experienced

under  colonial  rule  has  slowly  given  way   to

feelings of national pride and self-confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first year of office was one of

reorganisation, consolidation and preparation.  It

was  taken up largely with clearing the ground  and

setting  the  course for the year  of  construction

ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not wish to give the

impression  that there have not been  mistakes  and

shortcomings during the past year. It is aware that

some   of  its  measures  should  have  been   more

carefully  planned and expertly executed.  In  some

instances, it moved too fast and without  preparing

public opinion adequately for the changes. Some  of

the  legislation  resulted  in  inconveniences   or

misunderstandings which could have been avoided  by

a    little   more   foresight,   a   little   more

consultation,   discussion  and   a   little   more

explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are errors arising from zeal and

impatience  to get things done. In the coming  year

the  Government will temper zeal with understanding

and its impatience by explaining more to the people

the need for certain courses of action.



<div align="center"><b>FINANCE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that a year ago the State of

Singapore  faced  many  financial and  economic

difficulties. There was a deficit looming on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



horizon. There was considerable uncertainty  as  to

the  stability of the political foundation  of  the

State  and  this led to hesitation on the  part  of

potential investors. Our two great neighbours,  the

Federation  of  Malaya and Indonesia,  then  looked

upon the events in Singapore with some reservation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far-sighted policies of the Government

announced last year were firmly carried out and  in

12 short months we have seen a complete reversal of

position. The State ended the year's budget with  a

small surplus of $9 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relations with Indonesia entered a stage of

cordiality.  This was principally  due  to  a  more

realistic  appraisal of relations between  the  two

States.  With regard to the Federation  of  Malaya,

the  danger  then  was  that the  Federation  might

pursue policies which did not take into account the

legitimate interests of Singapore. This danger  was

happily averted. On major matters of financial  and

economic  policy,  the two Governments  have  taken

pains  to  carry out mutual consultations. Examples

of  these are the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill,  the

new  Currency  Agreement, fiscal proposals  over  a

broad  field  and, last but not least, the  current

talks on the Common Commodity Market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of trade and private investment, the

economic  policies  of  the Government  have  borne

substantial   fruit.  The  last   12   months   saw

considerable  improvement in the  volume  of  trade

both for domestic market and for the entrepot.  The

atmosphere  of  uncertainty and hesitation  in  the

field  of  private  investment was  replaced  by  a

climate  of  confidence.  Proof  of  this  was  the

substantial   volume  of  private  investment   now

seeking   permission  to  operate   in   Singapore.

Applications  for  exemption  under   the   Pioneer

Industries  Ordinance alone give  a  total  paid-up

capital  of  more than $101 million from  13  major

concerns. These new industries range over fields as

wide  apart  as oil refining, rolling of  aluminium

products, flour milling, sugar refining, production

of  foodstuffs  such as chocolate, condensed  milk,

etc.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be necessary to ensure that the momentum

which  has  been achieved at the cost of much  hard

work   and   planning  should  be   sustained   and

increased.  The most important single objective  of

the  economic  policy  of  the  Government  is   to

increase the rate of gross capital formation in the

State. In the past years, gross investment in  this

island  hardly exceeded 11 per cent of its national

income.  This  proportion is quite inadequate,  not

only  to  provide work for our expanding population

but  even  to  maintain our present  level  of  per

capita national income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be necessary to increase the rate of

gross  investment to something like 20 per cent  of

the  gross national income. This will be the  prime

objective  of the Five-Year Development  Plan,  the

first  draft of which has been prepared  and  which

will  form the basis of financial discussions  with

the United Kingdom Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of money value, it will be necessary to

plough  back something like $400 million a year  in

investment. About half of this investment will take

place  in the public sector. This will include  the

expansion of economic services such as power, water

and  gas  supplies, the construction of  roads  and

bridges,  improvement to the sea port  and  Airport

and    the   Singapore   River,   enlargement    of

telecommunications   facilities,    provision    of

industrial   sites  and  so  forth,  as   well   as

investment in the social services the main item  of

which   will   be  housing,  schools  and   medical

facilities.  The proportions in which  the  demands

for economic services and social services are to be

satisfied have been provisionally estimated in  the

Development  Plan. An assessment must  be  made  of

what  overseas finance is available. It is expected

that  the answers to this will be known before long

and  the  final copy of the Development  Plan  will

then be tabled in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater part of the money for public

investment,  however, must be found  from  our  own

domestic resources.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



This will mean the exercise of strictest economy in

annually  recurrent expenditure which provides  for

the  normal economic and social services  which  we

now  have. The aim is to provide as large a surplus

as  possible  in  the annual budgets  of  both  the

Government   and  public  authorities  to   finance

development projects.



<br><br><b>Industrial Expansion</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several factors which have generated confidence

and   stimulated  industrial  expansion  are  worth

noting.  They  must be strengthened to  consolidate

the advances we have made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these must be a firm and stable

Government  whose policy and actions are consistent

and   predictable.  These  would  allow   long-term

forecasts  to be made by private investors  with  a

degree  of assurance that their calculations  would

be right. Next there must be stability in the basic

elements  of the economy. Foremost among  these  is

that  the  value  of the currency  must  be  stable

beyond  any possible doubt. Then the basic economic

services,    such    as    the    port    services,

transportation, power supplies, must  maintain  the

highest  degree of efficiency. A further  important

factor     is    stability    in    labour-employer

relationships,  for  nothing  is  more  harmful  to

economic expansion than the unpredictable outbursts

of  industrial  strife. The labour  policy  of  the

Government  which  will  be  elaborated  later   is

designed   to  secure  this  balance  of  competing

interests  between industrial peace and  industrial

action for higher benefits.



<br><br><b>Trade</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it would be the principal objective of the

Government  to  bring about accelerated  industrial

growth in Singapore, this does not mean that we are

unaware of the importance of trade. For many years

to  come  Singapore's trade will be  the  principal

support  of  the economy and, as such, it  will  be

Government's policy to avoid taking any action that

will  damage our trade. Indeed the Government  will

do what it can to promote and expand the volume



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



of trade, although in the free port economy such as

we are, the prime responsibility for trade

promotion must rest with the traders themselves.





<div align="center"><h4>COMMUNICATIONS, CONSTRUCTION AND HOUSING</h4></div>



<br><br><b>Shipping</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shipping, civil aviation and telecommunications

play   a  vital  role  in  the  economic  life   of

Singapore. It is essential that our citizens should

man  all the important points in these services  as

soon as practicable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government has taken steps to remedy

this defect by starting a one-year pre-sea training

course  in  the Polytechnic, so that  students  who

take  this  course will eventually  be  trained  as

cadets  in the merchant marine service and  acquire

the necessary sea experience to sit for the foreign

master's certificate examination. Although our port

and harbour facilities are the best in the East the

number of Singapore citizens who have the requisite

technical qualifications to run the port in all its

aspects  is negligible. This is because  no  action

was  taken  by past governments to encourage  local

personnel to be trained in the necessary skills and

techniques.  With the cooperation of  the  Japanese

Government under the Colombo Plan students will  be

sent to Japan to study marine engineering and naval

architecture.  These students  will  eventually  be

placed  in  the  Marine Survey Department  and  the

Singapore Harbour Board.



<br><br><b>Port Authority</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some progress has been made in the planning to

set up a Port Authority combining the functions now

carried out by the Singapore Harbour Board and some

departments   of   Government.   The   problem   of

appointing  an experienced, competent  and  capable

Chief Executive for the Port Authority has still to

be  resolved before the new organisation  can  take

shape under expert planning. The Government expects

to  be  able  to begin the organisation changes  in

this session.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Harbour Board is proceeding with

the  East  Wharf Project which will give  nine  new

berths.  This  is the first stage in the  long-term

scheme   for   the  development  of   our   harbour

facilities.



<br><br><b>Civil Aviation</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By April 1961 it is expected that the new

building  to  house  the  administration,   control

tower,  air  traffic  control centre,  aeronautical

information service, meteorological station and the

offices  of  air line operators will be  ready  for

occupation. Co-ordination of all services for civil

aviation  will then be centralised and the handling

of  increased  flight  frequencies  of  modern  jet

aircraft will be made more efficient.



<br><br><b>Postal Services</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postal services are being expanded by

establishing  new Post Offices and Postal  Agencies

particularly to meet the increasing needs of  rural

communities. A new non-delivery Post Office will be

opened in Pulau Bukom at the end of this month.



<br><br><b>Parking Schemes</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parking schemes for cars have been

successfully  operated. These schemes  have  proved

their  usefulness  in relieving congestion  in  the

heart of the city and in introducing orderliness in

the   car   parks.  Plans  are  in  hand  for   the

introduction of this parking scheme in other  areas

of the city.



<br><br><b>Telephone Services</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the next 12 months, the Singapore

Telephone  Board  will  connect  more  than   3,000

subscribers  into  our present Singapore  Telephone

Board network from all our exchanges. By June 1961,

Nee Soon, Sembawang, Changi and Upper Tampines will

be connected to our general network.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year, the Singapore Telephone Board

proposes  to  connect telephones  to  kampongs  and

villages in the urban and rural areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><b>Local   Government  integration  with   Government  Ministries</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of integrating the City Council with

the   Government   Ministries  is  administratively

completed. All departments are now administratively

integrated  with  and directed  by  the  respective

Government  Ministries.  Only  a  Public  Utilities

Corporation remains to beset up. Extensive  schemes

for   developing  of  electricity,  gas  and  water

supplies have been planned to meet increased demand

arising  from  both the increase in  population  as

well as industrial expansion.



<br><br><b>Lands and Planning</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 1st this year, the Planning Ordinance

was  brought  into force and a Planning  Department

created  under  the Prime Minister's Ministry.  The

new   department  is  now  working   smoothly   and

speedily. The Master Plan will be revised  to  take

into  account the greatly increased population  and

Government's  Five-Year Economic Development  Plan.

This  will  take time to complete but consideration

is  being  given  in  the meantime  to  an  interim

revision of the Master Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrialisation programme of Government

will   be  set  in  motion  when  the  Land  Office

initiates  action  to acquire a  total  of  2,438½

acres  in  the Jurong area. This is in addition  to

other  areas  to  be acquired for  drainage  works,

schools, clinics and community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation to give farmers better security of

tenure  is under preparation and will be introduced

in the Legislative Assembly during this session.



<br><br><b>Housing</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the period June 1959 and February 1960

contracts for the construction of only 821  housing

units  were given out. In February 1960 the Housing

and  Development Board was formed to take over  the

housing functions of the former S.I.T. For the five

months that it has been in existence the Board  has

so  far given out contracts for the construction of

4,000  units.  It  has also drawn  up  a  Five-Year

Building Programme providing for the construction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



of  52,000 units at an estimated total cost of $210

million over the period 1960 to 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now 4,720 units under construction of

which  1,811 units will be completed by the end  of

this year.



<br><br><b>Flood Alleviation</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flood problems in Singapore have become more

acute year by year with the development of built-up

areas.  Considerable  work  and  funds  are  to  be

concentrated on flood alleviation schemes. Work  is

already proceeding on flood alleviation schemes  in

Ulu   Pandan,  Queenstown,  Geylang,  Bukit  Timah,

Tampines and Jurong.



<br><br><b>Rural Amenities</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the improvement of kampongs in the rural

areas  has  been  specially intensified  and  water

mains  laid  in  areas where water supply  is  most

needed.  More  standpipes are  being  installed  in

remote  areas  where drinking water from  wells  is

either   brackish   or  unsuitable   for   drinking

purposes.  Programme for kampong sanitation,  water

main  laying and erection of standpipes  have  been

prepared  and  more  of  these  services  will   be

introduced in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New link roads are in the course of construction

for  these areas: West Coast Road/Jurong, Choa  Chu

Kang/Lim   Chu  Kang,  Serangoon  Garden   Estates/Braddell  Road. Agricultural roads to help  farmers

to  bring  their produce to the markets  are  being

constructed in accordance to priorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity supply is now being brought to remote

rural  areas  and the erection of more  substations

and  the  abundance of electricity from  St.  James

Power  Station will help the project  to  become  a

reality.  All possible help is being given  and  in

some  cases the Rural Board subsidizes schemes  for

electrification of areas, e.g. Kampong Chai Chee at

Changi  Road, 6¼ m.s., and Bulim at Choa  Chu  Kang

Road.



<br><br><b>Community Centres</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medium and small Community Centres will continue

to   be  built  in  all  areas  which  are  thickly

populated. Small Community Halls will be  built  in

attap areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><b>Agriculture</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increased production of sewerage sludge

in Singapore it is proposed to use it as a base for

different    formulations   of    fertilisers    by

incorporating chemical fertilisers. These  mixtures

will  be  tried out at the Government  Experimental

Stations   and,   if  found  to  be   satisfactory,

arrangements will be made to make them available to

the  farmers in order to assist them to  cut  their

cost of production of vegetables.



<br><br><b>Poultry Farming</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An improved strain of chicks has been bred which

will  grow  much faster than the local Canton  fowl

and which will lay 40 per cent more eggs. Each fowl

of  this  strain will lay up to 150 eggs  per  year

whereas  the local Canton fowl can lay only between

90  and  100 eggs per year. Day-old chicks of  this

new  strain  will  be  distributed  to  farmers  to

improve their livestock.



<br><br><b>Fishing</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is considering a scheme to encourage

Malay fishermen to seek new waters for fishing  and

to  assist them with equipment. The success of this

scheme  depends  largely on negotiations  with  the

Indonesian  Government for the Malay  fishermen  to

fish in their territorial waters off Singapore.



<div align="center"><b>LABOUR</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps are being taken to implement the Industrial

Relations  Ordinance and to appoint  the  President

and   panels  of  members  of  the  Court  and  the

recruitment of the necessary staff. The Court  will

be housed in the Supreme Court Building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Unions Bill which did not receive my

assent before the prorogation will be re-introduced

with  some  amendments  to enable  the  unification

policy to be implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Labour Advisory Council will be set up on which

there  will  be  representatives of  industry,  the

trade  unions  and  Government.  The  work  of  the

Council will be:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to advise the Government in relation to

employment, industrial relations, employee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



welfare,  and  related industrial and  economic

matters; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to advise the Ministry of Labour and Law in

relation to matters within the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Committee will be set up with representatives

from  the Singapore Trades Union Congress to advise

on  the designing and the detailed planning  for  a

Trade  Union House to be built for the use  of  the

Singapore Trades Union Congress and its affiliates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Employment Bill will be introduced which will

repeal  the  three  Ordinances  dealing  with   the

conditions   of   labourers,   clerks   and    shop

assistants. The scope of the Bill will be  enlarged

to   include  these  employees  as  well  as  other

categories  of  employees which were  not  hitherto

included.  Provisions  implementing  some  of   the

recommendations  of the Contract Labour  Commission

Report will also be included in the Bill. The  Bill

will also contain powers to compel the notification

of vacancies where non-citizens are to be employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to streamline the procedures for

registration in the Employment Exchange and to  set

up  a Labour Market Information Service with a view

to   better  placing  of  all  employable  persons,

including   recent  school  leavers,   in   gainful

employment.



<br><br><b>Women's Rights</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will re-introduce the Women's

Charter. The Bill will have regard to the proposals

for   amendment  which  were  made  to  the  Select

Committee of the last session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will introduce comprehensive

legislation  for the regulation of Muslim  marriage

and  divorce  and Muslim religious affairs  on  the

lines   of  legislation  in  the  States   of   the

Federation of Malaya.



<div align="center"><b>HOME AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br><b>Police</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will consolidate its efforts to

preserve peace, good order and security in the

State.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of transforming the Police Force into

a  popular  and  friendly force  to  safeguard  the

interests  of the people has made further  progress

and  will  continue.  Efforts in  bringing  greater

cooperation  between police and the people  through

the  media  of  holding  Police!  people  meetings,

visits of Assemblymen to police establishments, and

the periodical joint discussion between Assemblymen

and  people's  representatives and  the  divisional

police  have  proved  to be a  step  in  the  right

direction.  The  people are now looking  upon  the

Force  as  fellow citizens protecting them  against

evil  doers.  The  Government is  trying  out  new

methods   of  organising  the  people  to   protect

themselves  in  co-operation  with  the  Police  in

kampong areas. The success of this experiment  will

bring the Police another step closer to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments made last session to the Criminal

Law  (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,  1958,  have

enabled  the  Police to carry on a  more  effective

campaign  against  secret society  gangsters.  This

must   continue  relentlessly  until   their   evil

influence  is  destroyed.  At  the  same  time  the

Government  is  conscious of  the  fact  that  mere

detention  of  secret society members  without  any

attempt  to re-educate and rehabilitate them  with

the  aim of returning them as less embittered,  and

better  and  more useful members of  society  is  a

negative  and  wasteful approach  to  the  problem.

Therefore, the Government has launched  the  Pulau

Senang  Settlement Scheme for the re-education  and

rehabilitation of secret society detainees. To date

82  detainees have been transferred to Pulau Senang

from  Changi Prison. The Scheme has got  off  to  a

good  start and the Government will give it special

attention. The Government also intends to carry out

Prison  Reform  and  to that end  is  awaiting  the

Report  of  the Prisons Inquiry Commission  set  up

last year with a view to making recommendations  in

that direction.



<br><br><b>Anti-corruption and anti-yellow culture</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware that bribery and

corruption  have  yet to be completely  eliminated.

The shortage of officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



and  the inadequacy of the previous laws have  made

the task of fighting corruption more difficult than

it  should  be.  Now  that the  new  Prevention  of

Corruption   Ordinance  has   been   brought   into

operation,  steps have been taken to  recruit  more

staff   for  the  Corrupt  Practices  Investigation

Bureau.  General  Orders dealing with  disciplinary

procedures in respect of Government employees  will

be  revised and adapted with a view to giving  more

effective   assistance   to   the   anti-corruption

campaign, which will be intensified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with its policy to promote the healthy

growth of a new national consciousness and culture,

the   Government  will  continue  to  suppress  and

eliminate yellow culture.



<br><br><b>Citizenship and Immigration</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel to its citizenship policy, the

Government's immigration policy will be to  protect

the   economic   interests  of  its  citizens   and

safeguard  their  employment  opportunities.  Close

alignment   and   liaison  with  the   Federation's

immigration  laws  and policy is being  maintained.

Preventive  action  against the  entry  of  illegal

immigrants will be intensified.





<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL AND HEALTH</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past year the emphasis on the

preventive aspects of medicine was begun  with  the

drafting   of   legislation  for   the   compulsory

immunisation of the young members of our population

against  the  twin  scourges  of  Tuberculosis  and

Diphtheria.  The legislation will be  presented  to

the   Legislative  Assembly  shortly.  Tuberculosis

continues  to  be the major health problem  of  the

community.  Legislation, now in  final  form,  will

provide   for  the  immunisation  of  children   at

secondary  school entrance level. Such  a  measure,

consistently  applied,  is  expected  to   decrease

sharply  the  incidence  of  Tuberculosis  in   the

younger population. Towards the end of the year  an

X-Ray   campaign  is  planned  to   ascertain   the

incidence of Tuberculosis in the adult population.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans for a mass Family Planning campaign to

stimulate  an  awareness  of  intelligent   planned

parenthood  among  the adult population  have  been

completed and should be launched by the end of  the

year.



<br><br><b>Hospitals</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thomson Road Hospital, opened in late 1959,

now  accepts acute general medical cases. Plans are

in hand to develop it into a full District Hospital

for  acute  surgical, obstetric and  gynaecological

cases. Woodbridge Hospital is being re-designed  to

house certain categories of the chronic sick so  as

to  make available the accommodation and facilities

at the General Hospital for medical cases requiring

better attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the improvements to hospitals planned for

the coming year, is the expansion of the Government

Medical   Store  to  increase  the   capacity   for

manufacture  of  tablets, sterile preparations  and

drugs,  the establishment of a Third Medical  Unit,

General Hospital, to increase the number of general

medical  beds by 120, and improvement and expansion

of   the   Orthopaedic  Services  to  include   new

Theatres,  X-Ray unit and Laboratory units  and  to

increase the number of Orthopaedic beds by 150.



<br><br><b>Out-patient clinics</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Out-patient clinics will be opened at Jalan

Kayu  and Lim Ah Pin Road. More Maternity and Child

Health   Centres   will   be   built   next   year,

particularly in the rural areas.



<br><br><b>Recruitment</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of 35 nurses from Chinese and

Malay   schools  were  recruited  into  the  Nurses

Training  School in September 1959,  in  accordance

with Government policy. Two months later 17 Chinese

and  Malay  educated pupil midwives were recruited.

The  policy  of  encouraging  non-English  educated

girls to join the Nursing Service will be pursued.





<div align="center"><b>EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past year has seen the foundations firmly

laid  of  the  three main principles on  which  the

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



has based its policy on education as enunciated  in

the  Address to the Assembly at the opening of  the

First  Session  last year. These  three  principles

are, firstly, the provision of equal treatment  for

the   4   streams   of  education;  secondly,   the

acceptance  of Malay as the National Language;  and

thirdly, intensification of the teaching of Science

and Mathematics subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with equality of treatment steps have been

taken to effect uniformity in the structure of  the

education  system  in  all  media.  The  period  of

primary education is now uniform, i.e. 6 years,  at

the  end  of which time primary school pupils  will

take,  for  the first time this year, the Singapore

Primary  School Leaving Examination. The period  of

Secondary  School education will also  be  uniform,

i.e.  4  years, the Malay and Tamil schools  having

secondary  school classes for the first  time  this

year. The Government's aim is to have eventually  a

common secondary school leaving examination for all

media.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Singapore Examination Syndicate is to be

established  to control and supervise  examinations

for  both  primary  and secondary  schools.  It  is

intended  that  our Syndicate will  work  in  close

cooperation  with  its  sister  Syndicate  in   the

Federation of Malaya, especially in respect of  the

examinations   now  conducted  by   the   Cambridge

Syndicate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uniformity of treatment is also being observed in

the   school   syllabuses.  In  this  respect   the

Educational  Advisory  Council  has  devoted   much

specialist  knowledge, effort  and  energy  in  the

compilation of syllabuses which will be used in all

schools.  The  syllabuses are entirely  Malayan  in

content  and  will ensure that the textbook,  which

will be compiled are also Malayan.



<br><br><b>Integration</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A start has been made with integration. The Bukit

Panjang   and  Serangoon  Garden  Government   High

Schools combine English medium schools with Chinese

medium  schools  with timetables so  arranged  that

language   teachers   of  the   two   streams   are

interchangeable. Next year it is proposed to extend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



integration  to  primary  schools.  The  experience

acquired in these schools is being closely  studied

in  the  hope that they will provide the experience

for  further  development along these lines.  On  a

wider  plane,  integration  is  being  fostered  in

sports and recreation by the formation of two Joint

Athletic  Sports Councils covering the  four  media

and responsible for arranging sports meetings which

will cut across communal barriers.



<br><br><b>Special position of Malays</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although maintaining parity of treatment in

education, the Government is mindful of the special

position  of the Malays, and has therefore accepted

the  policy  of  providing free  education  to  all

Malays who are either born in Singapore or children

of  Singapore  citizens, in schools, the  Singapore

Polytechnic and the University of Malaya.



<br><br><b>National Language</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the policy of Malay as the

National  Language,  the task of  the  Ministry  of

Education  has been to provide training  facilities

for  the  teaching  of  the language  in  non-Malay

schools.  For this, classes were organised  in  the

Teachers'  Training  College, and  to  date,  about

1,400  teachers  have passed the Standard  I  Malay

Examination.  About 1,800 teachers are  at  present

receiving  instruction  in  the  language   up   to

Standard   II  level,  and  those  who  have   been

successful  in Standard I are already teaching  the

language in primary classes. In the year ahead  the

programme of teacher training will gather momentum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the policy emphasising Science

and  Mathematics, the Government has had to contend

with  limited  equipment  and  staff  shortage.  To

overcome the first difficulty, the Government plans

to  have  a  new standard type of Secondary  School

building  which  will  have 4 Science  laboratories

instead   of  the  present  three.  Where   science

facilities in the older secondary school  buildings

are  lacking on inadequate, increased accommodation

is being planned. Science teaching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



begins  during the last year of primary school  and

more  simple equipment is being provided for  these

classes   than   hitherto.  Because   of   staffing

difficulties  the  schools  are  allowed   to   use

graduates  from  the  Universities  without   their

waiting for a further year at the Universities  for

the Diploma in Education.



<br><br><b>School building programme</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problems are the expansion of the

school  building programme and the teacher training

programme to meet the annual increases in enrolment

in schools. A careful survey of the increase in the

school-going population over the next 5  years  has

been  carried  out  and it is  estimated  that,  to

provide for this increase, the Government's  school

building  programme must be geared to  construct  a

minimum  of  5  secondary schools  and  14  primary

schools  each  year. In its plans  Government  will

provide  that  two  out  of  every  five  secondary

schools will be devoted to technical education.



<br><br><b>Teacher Training Programme</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To staff the new schools each year it will be

necessary to increase the capacity of the Teachers'

Training  College.  Hence  the  system  of  teacher

training in the Teachers' Training College has been

re-organised. The previous part-time and  full-time

training  courses have given way to a new part-time

in-service  system which, in content and  practice,

combines-the  best  features of  the  two  previous

courses.  There  is  also  a  new  course  at   the

Teachers'  Training  College to provide  in-service

training  in  education on a  part-time  basis  for

graduates  of the University of Malaya and  Nanyang

University.



<br><br><b>Universities</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is concerned to see that the

Singapore  Polytechnic  and the  two  Universities,

Nanyang  University and the Singapore  Division  of

the  University of Malaya, are geared to serve  the

needs  of  the State. Nanyang University  has  been

promised  equal  treatment with the  University  of

Malaya  in the matter of annual grants, subject  to

its re-organisation and the maintenance of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



adequate  academic standards. Discussions  are  now

going  on  with the Nanyang University authorities.

By 1962 the Singapore Division of the University of

Malaya  will  become the autonomous  University  of

Singapore.  The  Government will strive  to  ensure

that the University of Singapore will be a national

institution conscious of the part it has to play in

the  development of the community and able to  meet

the  educational needs of Singapore, the scientists

and    technologists,   the   administrators    and

professional  talent  which  the  State  needs   in

increasing numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will be introduced to enable

graduates in law of the University of Malaya to  be

admitted  to the local Bar after a short period  of

pupilage and a professional examination.



<br><br><b>Polytechnic</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps have been taken to ensure that the

qualifications   obtained   from   the    Singapore

Polytechnic  will  be  recognised,  not   only   in

Singapore,   but   in  adjoining   territories.   A

Commission   of  Inquiry  will  be   appointed   to

investigate and make recommendations on the  proper

co-ordination of vocational and technical education

in   all   institutions,   governmental   or

non-governmental  in  Singapore. A  systematisation  of

vocational and technical education will provide the

sinews  to  man future industries to be established

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 5,000 are now attending Post-Primary

Classes  in  the English stream. In the past  those

who   failed  at  the  Secondary  School   Entrance

Examination were thrown out of schools  whilst  too

young   to  gain  employment,  and  others  entered

private  schools. Until the Commission  of  Inquiry

into  vocational and technical education  mentioned

above  produces a plan of vocational  training  for

these  Post-Primary  Classes,  it  is  proposed  to

continue  providing them with a two-year  course  o

education based on strengthening their knowledge of

languages  and learning the more practical  aspects

of normal school subjects.



<br><br><b>Adult Education</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa, which was

established in April



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



this  year, will henceforth be responsible for  the

direction  and control of adult education  and  the

eradication of illiteracy.



<div align="center"><b>CULTURE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inculcation of a Malayan loyalty and the

development  of  a  Malayan  consciousness  in  our

people  is  a  task that the P.A.P. Government  has

shown  is possible, by imaginative and constructive

use  of  modern  mass media to  develop  a  Malayan

loyalty and a Malayan consciousness in our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highly complex concept of Malayan culture

was  given concrete expression through the open-air

concerts - Aneka  Ragam Ra'ayat. These  concerts  not

only made thousands of ordinary people aware of the

richness  and  variety of the  cultural  wealth  at

their   disposal  but  they  have  also  stimulated

cultural activity. The enthusiastic response to the

National Theatre Fund is an encouraging sign of the

conscious  search  of  the  people  for  a  Malayan

culture.  Work on this National Theatre will  begin

this year. When completed, it should contribute  to

the  further flourishing and ultimate fusion of our

diverse cultures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government plans to establish a National

Cultural  Brigade  in order to  give  positive  and

creative  impulse to Malayan art, music, drama  and

so  on.  Members  of the Brigade  will  consist  of

artists,  painters, musicians, dramatists  and  all

those involved in the arts and they will perform as

well  as  teach and organise dramatic, musical  and

dance  groups  in  community centres  and  cultural

associations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year will also see the establishment of the

Institute  for National Language and  Culture.  The

aims and objects of the Institute have already been

explained   to   Members  of  the   Assembly.   The

Institute,  in addition to publishing  translations

of  outstanding works of literature  and  promoting

the  growth  and  spread of the national  language,

will  also  encourage original works, literary  and

scientific, by local writers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another medium through which the Government keeps

the  public informed and entertained is through the 193 Community Radio Listening sets in rural





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



areas.  It is proposed to acquire another 200  sets

in  order  to  keep isolated rural  communities  in

touch with what is going on in their country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year will also see the start of Commercial

Broadcasting. We are being assisted by two  experts

from New Zealand under the Colombo Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also plans to inaugurate a

National  Service  network.  At  the  moment  Radio

Singapore  broadcasts four language  programme  and

though   these   have  ceased  to  be   exclusively

communal,  they  nevertheless cater  to  particular

linguistic  groups. The National Service  would  be

identified with no particular language or  cultural

group. It will try to reflect a Malayan outlook and

content.  We hope to increase short-wave broadcasts

substantially early next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also decided to introduce

television. It is not possible at the moment to say

when   a   television  station  will  be  in   full

operation, for in addition to erecting the  station

we  will  have  to train technicians and  programme

staff  to  work this new mass media which can  help

break  through the language barriers. We  have  had

the  valuable  assistance of  foreign  experts  and

their  report is now being studied. Active work  on

television will begin this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the National Library it will be the policy to

strengthen  the Malay, Chinese and Indian  sections

which  were  neglected in the past.  When  the  new

building  is completed later this year  there  will

not  be  that shortage of space which had  hampered

expansion of the Malay, Chinese and Indian sections

in the past.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Museum will be reorganised to make

it   more  representative  of  local  customs   and

traditions. There will be more stress on the wealth

of  cultural material out of which we hope to weave

a  Malayan  culture.  It will  emphasise  more  the

history and contributions that the many races

have-made towards the creation of modern Singapore.



<br><br><b>Conclusion</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year of office of the P.A.P.

Government  will  be  a year of construction.  This

year will see the addition of an industrial base to

our  entrepot economy. As the Five-Year Development

Plan,  which  has been prepared by the  Government,

gets  into  stride our economy will gradually  lose

its   colonial  character  by  ensuring  a  greater

measure  of economic self-reliance. This  does  not

mean  the  advent  of  an  economic  paradise.   By

broadening  our economic base we will  enhance  the

chances of a better life for more of our people, in

particular  the  underprivileged  sections  of  our

society.  The  necessary  conditions  for  economic

expansion   are  purposive  action  and   political

stability.  These  the Government  will  strive  to

provide. But it will not overlook the fact that the

purpose  of  economic expansion is to  benefit  the

people as a whole and not a privileged few.
