<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question (3rd March, 1959),

"That the words proposed to be left out, be left out."



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>10.04 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In clause 27 the original amendment

proposed by the Member for Tanjong Pagar was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 11, line 14, at end, to add- - "; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) open or maintain, for the purpose of any activity

directed   towards  promoting  or   procuring   the

election  of  a  candidate  at  any  election,  any

office   in   any  room,  building  or  any   place

whatsoever,  whether  open or  enclosed,  within  a

radius  of two hundred yards of any polling station

on polling day.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment to the amendment has been proposed by the

Member for Queenstown,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lines 4 and 5, to leave out ", whether open or

enclosed, within a radius of two hundred yards  of  any

polling   station  on  polling  day"  and  insert   "in

Singapore, whether open or enclosed, on polling day.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question "That the words proposed to be left out, be

left out," again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

yesterday at the moment of interruption I was  speaking

on  my amendment on the question of within a radius  of

200  yards  prohibiting the setting up of  an  election

office.  The Chief Minister has now an amendment  which

serves  the  purpose of my amendment, and in  order  to

allow  the Chief Minister to move his amendment, I  beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to the amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have given

thought  to  the amendment proposed by the hon.  Member

for Queenstown. I am in sympathy with him in regard  to

the  fears  that  he has if such an  amendment  is  not

moved.  I  have also given consideration to  the  point

raised by the hon. Member for





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>



Tanjong  Pagar that it is necessary that there  should

be  some  point  or  other where a  candidate  or  his

election  agent  shall have contact with  the  polling

clerks  and  all the other assistants on duty  at  the

polling  station  on polling day. Therefore,  I  would

like  to  move  an amendment which will  satisfy  both

sides  of the House, and I would like to hand to  you,

Sir, typed copies of my proposed amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Hon. the Chief Minister

would like to read it first.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, lines 4 and 5, to delete "within a radius

of two hundred yards of any polling station" and add a

proviso-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that every candidate or his

election agent may open or maintain in his electoral

division one office which shall not be within a radius

of two hundred yards of any polling station and the

address of such office shall be registered by the

candidate or his election agent with the Returning

Officer before polling day."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the amendment to the amendment handed

in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment is in order. Copies are

available, and they will be distributed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Chief Minister like to

comment on it any further before I propose the

Question?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The original amendment by the Member

for Tanjong Pagar is as appears in paragraph (1) on

the Order Paper. The first amendment to the amendment

proposed by the Chief Minister is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, lines 4 and 5, to leave out "within a

radius of two hundred yards of any polling station".



<br><br>The second amendment is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 5, to add-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that every candidate or

his election agent may open or maintain in his

electoral division one office which shall not be

within a radius of two hundred yards of any polling

station and the address of such office shall be

registered by the candidate or his election agent with

the Returning Officer before polling day."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will propose the first amendment. The Question is,

"That the words proposed to be left out, be left out",

and honourable Members will be permitted to range over

the second amendment in the debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, my view is

just  that  this amendment is completely  unnecessary.

Considerable thought was given to it when we moved the

original amendment, and our amendment was agreed to by

the  Government. Yesterday, as a result  of  a  bright

idea  by the Member for Queenstown, he wanted to blot

out  all election offices during polling day.  I  then

brought  up  the  difficulties which candidates  would

encounter  if  they had no place to  meet.  The  Chief

Minister  then  proposed to resolve the  difficulties,

and  save  face  all  round by allowing  one  election

office. I see no reason why election offices should be

limited in this way. It is no more than usual for each

candidate  to  maintain one election office  for  each

polling district or division. The average division has

about  four  polling districts, and I do not  see  the

slightest objection to any candidate maintaining  four

election offices or as many election offices as  there

are in polling divisions. I would therefore suggest to

the Chief Minister that our considered opinion, before

the  Member for Queenstown upset the general agreement

on  the  subject, was, and still is, the best opinion,

and this amendment is unnecessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to add to what the Member for Tanjong Pagar said.

I  would  point  out that particularly  in  the  rural

constituencies,  which cover a  very  wide  area,  one

office  is certainly insufficient for the purpose  and

it   would  cause  very  great  inconvenience  to  the

candidates concerned. It might be all right in a  city

constituency  where the areas are small and  distances

are not great. But in the case of rural areas, this is

a  considerable disadvantage to the candidate and this

amendment  does not meet the point at  all.  It  could

possibly be all right if we altered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>



this  amendment to "an office or offices", but  as  it

stands  I do not think it would be acceptable to  this

side of the House.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I appreciate the point

raised by the hon. Member for Tanglin. I am sure  that

his  objection  will not be so great  if,  instead  of

having  just one office in a whole electoral division,

it  is permitted for a candidate or his election agent

to  open  or  maintain  one  office  in  each  polling

district.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have no objection to it if he wants to move an

amendment to this effect.



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Chief Minister would have saved

himself  a  lot  of  trouble if he had  not  tried  to

retrieve   the   Member   for  Queenstown   from   the

predicament in which he placed both his Government and

himself  yesterday by moving all kinds  of  gratuitous

amendments  at  the last stage. If in fact  the  Chief

Minister  said, "Well, that is right, there should  be

as   many   election  offices  as  there  are  polling

districts", then why move this amendment at all? Since

we  are  all  so inextricably involved, by  all  means

change  the  words "electoral division" to  "electoral

polling district".



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> May I take the advantage to move my

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was just going to suggest that we

deal  with the first amendment and then, when we  come

to  the  second amendment, the hon. Member's amendment

could be an amendment to the second amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will deal with the first amendment, that is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lines 4 and 5, to leave out "within a radius of

two hundred yards of any polling station".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out, be

left out," put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is now the complementary

amendment, in line 5, at the end, to add the proviso.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move an amendment

to the amendment to the amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 3, after "office" to insert "for each polling

district".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to say, Mr Speaker, that I am very

grateful to you for your assistance in what has become

a combined operation, and I do hope that this will now

meet with the support of all sides of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be

inserted, be there inserted."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not want to be the nigger in

the  wood-pile in this business, Mr Speaker, Sir, but

I can imagine the discomfiture in which the Government

is  now  placed as a result of the adventures  of  the

Member  for  Queenstown. If we do  this - "may  open  or

maintain in his electoral division one office for each

polling district, which..."- then the grammar goes wrong

in  the second limb of the amendment, and we will have

to   add  further  amendments  that  "the  address  or

addresses   of  such  office  or  offices   shall   be

registered." All this would be completely unnecessary,

and I do say this is unnecessary if the Hon. the Chief

Minister  will  just scrub out both his own  amendment

and  the Member for Queenstown's amendment, and  leave

the  amendment as I have proposed and as  agreed  with

the Attorney-General.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I trust the proposer of the amendment

has  grasped the point made by the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my intention to move

a second amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After "of" where it secondly occurs, to insert

"every",



<br><br>so  that  the phrase will read "every such office".  I

think this possibly meets the point of the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I would just like to enquire from

the   Attorney-General  whether  the  phrase  "polling

district" is a term of art in the Elections Ordinance,

otherwise we shall be involved in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>



further difficulties. I still maintain that if - I know

saving faces is a very important operation-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has made

that point on several occasions in the immediate past.

Let us try and solve this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Attorney-General inform us

whether  "polling district" is a term of  art  in  the

Ordinance,  and  if  so,  where  will  we  find   that

definition?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, if the

hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar will refer to section  2

of   the   Singapore  Legislative  Assembly  Elections

Ordinance,  Cap.  53, he will find the  definition  of

"polling district", and it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"polling district" means a part of an electoral

division   subdivided  under   section   9   of   this

Ordinance;.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

suggest that those words to be included by way  of  an

amendment should not come after the word "office"  but

rather  after  the  word  "maintain"?  Therefore,  the

amended amendment should read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that every candidate or his election agent

may  open or maintain for each polling district in his

electoral division one office which shall not be.."



<br><br>etc.

Sir, the word "which" would then qualify "office"  and

not "district".



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment

if  the Hon. the Chief Minister will withdraw his, and

we  go  back to the first amendment which I  think  is

perfectly  satisfactory. I only raised this matter  in

the first place because I was not satisfied that there

should  be  one office in each electoral division.  My

own  view  here  is  that the amendment  as  it  stood

originally was perfectly satisfactory.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The original amendment by the Chief

Minister  to  the  amendment  was  to  add  a  proviso

reading:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that every candidate or his election agent

may  open  or  maintain in his electoral division  one

office which shall not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>



within  a  radius of two hundred yards of any  polling

station  and  the  address of  such  office  shall  be

registered by the candidate or his election agent with

the Returning Officer before polling day."



<br><br>Since  which an amendment has been moved in  line  3,

after  "office" to insert "for each polling district",

and  it has been indicated that in line 5, after  "of"

where  it  secondly  occurs,  an  amendment  will   be

proposed  to  insert "every". Hon.  Members  have  the

proposed proviso before them. It has been proposed  in

line  3,  after "office" to insert "for  each  polling

district".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be

inserted, be there inserted."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of all the

dangerous  operation one can indulge in this Assembly,

the  most dangerous is that of being caught and frozen

in  an  unexpected and unpremeditated  posture.  I  am

quite  sure the Attorney-General must have been aghast

at himself for saying "Aye" - thereby including into the

legislation   of  this  Colony  a  clause   which   is

manifestly  inelegant. I ask him honestly to  ask  his

Government  whether they ought not  to  save  face  by

withdrawing  this  amendment and  going  back  to  the

original  amendment as it stood, or at least  try  and

accommodate  the hon. Mr R. C. H. Lim  on  his  point

that  "which"  in  fact qualifies not  "district"  but

"office".



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that amendment

was  proposed as a result of consultations  with  you,

and  it  was  your suggestion to the hon.  Member  for

Tanglin  that  it should be moved in that  manner.  We

have  therefore accepted your advice, and  we  do  not

think it necessary that we should doubt your advice in

this  matter.  We have, therefore, voted  accordingly.

The  hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar would like  to  say

that  I  need not have to move this amendment  to  his

amendment, but I did so in order to correct  something

which it is said was out of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar saw me

and  said  that he proposed to move certain amendments

to  this  particular Bill and that as he  had  already

missed  the  opportunity  to submit  notices  of  such

amendments,  he asked me whether the Government  would

give  its consent to allow him to move such amendments

when  the  Bill  was  to have been taken  through  the

Committee stage at the last February sitting. I agreed

but  it  was then found that his amendments  were  not

properly  and  elegantly  worded,  and  the  Attorney-General therefore came to the rescue and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>



tried  his  best to help the poor Member  out  of  his

dilemma.  Now it would seem that after the  Government

has  tried all it can to help the Member polish up the

phraseology  of his amendments, it is now thrown  back

at the Government that we should not have done this or

we should not have done that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps I could allay the fears

of  the  hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar by saying  that

after "office" a comma will be inserted, and so will a

comma be inserted after "district".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not know if it is correct or

proper  for any Minister to do it. But I should  think

that  whatever the merits or demerits of your  office,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  defects in legislation  certainly

should not be laid at the foot of your august Chair.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it was all done in fun!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, as amended, to the amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Now we have the original amendment, as

amended, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 11, line 14, at end, to add- "; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) open or maintain, for the purpose of any activity

directed  towards promoting or procuring the  election

of  a  candidate at any election, any  office  in  any

room,  building or any place whatsoever, whether  open

or enclosed, on polling day:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that every candidate or his election agent

may  open  or  maintain in his electoral division  one

office, for each polling district, which shall not  be

within  a  radius of two hundred yards of any  polling

station and the address of every such office shall  be

registered by the candidate or his election agent with

the Returning Officer before polling day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original amendment, as amended, agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move an

amendment which is intended to be a new clause  to  be

inserted after clause 14.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is a matter of procedure. I

think the first thing the hon. Member should do is just

to  "bring  up"  the new clause, and perhaps  read  the

marginal title.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

formally  move that the principal Ordinance  is  hereby

amended by adding immediately after section 34 thereof-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. All the hon. Member need say at

this  stage  is that he begs to introduce a new  clause

intituled    and the marginal title is there for him to

read:  "Polling day at general election  to  be  Public

Holiday."  Then  there will be a  motion  by  the  hon.

Member  that the clause be read a Second time. Standing

Order 51(7) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the title of any new clause being read by the

Clerk,  the clause shall be deemed to have been read  a

first  time. The question shall then be proposed  "That

the  clause be read a second time"; if this  is  agreed

to,  amendments may then be proposed to the new clause.

The  final  question to be proposed shall be "That  the

clause [as amended] be added to the Bill".'



<br><br>To  enable  the  Clerk to read the  title  of  the  new

clause,  the  procedure is that the  hon.  Member  must

"bring up" the new clause formally.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in accordance with

Standing Order 51 (7) I formally bring up a new  clause

in  respect of which the marginal note reads,  "Polling

day at general election to be Public Holiday."



<pre>

New clause (after clause 14)-



'New Section   The principal Ordinance is hereby amended by adding

34A.        immediately after section 34 thereof the following new section:-

                  Ordinance.".'.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up, and read the First time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is generally

agreed that if there is to be compulsory voting,  there

must  also  be  a  public holiday on polling  day.  The

Government  has indicated that it proposes  to  have  a

public holiday declared by His Excellency the Governor,

exercising   his   power  under  the  Public   Holidays

Ordinance. However that may be, Sir, we must  remember

that  this  piece of legislation which we  are  pushing

through  this  House  is not only valid  for  this  one

general election but also subsequent general elections.

Unless  we  have  a proviso in the Elections  Ordinance

that  polling  day  shall be a public  holiday,  it  is

always open to a subsequent Government without breaking

an undertaking, because none would have been given, not

to  have  a  public holiday on polling day. I therefore

propose to move this amendment to include, after clause

14, the proviso ensuring that polling day shall, in any

general election, either the one we all expect  in  May

or any other subsequent ones, automatically be a public

holiday. Sir, I move, "That the clause be read a Second

time."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, am I

correct in commenting on this clause? When the Bill was

moved  for the Second Reading I emphasised that polling

day should be a public holiday. In the past many shops,

department  stores and business houses  remained  open,

and  it was most difficult for employees to get out and

vote.  The argument now is that the employers  will  be

forced to allow their employees to go and vote.  But  I

do  not  think that is quite sufficient in the  present

dangerous   state  of  Singapore  under   the   present

Government.  Sir, we have to think of females  who  are

compelled to vote when their breadwinners are in  their

offices working. Grown-up daughters and beautiful wives

will find it difficult to go out and vote by themselves

without  an  escort. The thing is this. If there  is  a

public  holiday it will be easier for the  female  folk

and  the weak to get assistance from their men folk who

could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>



accompany  them to go and do their duty in, this  very

important election, when this Government must get  out

permanently.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, at last the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar has got

me to my feet. The form of this new clause that he has

proposed  I have agreed. But he knows full  well  that

what  I have agreed is only the form. I have told  him

that if a new clause in this form is put into the  law

it  will do what he wants it to do. But I dislike this

new clause for two reasons. First, it is, at least for

the  forthcoming general election, quite  unnecessary.

An undertaking has been given that polling day will be

declared  a  holiday,  and secondly,  I  dislike  this

device   of  seeking  to  amend  a  not  uncomplicated

Holidays  Ordinance  by putting  something  into  this

Elections Ordinance. If the hon. Member were satisfied

with  the  arrangements that will  be  made  for  this

general  election  but fearful  of  what  some  future

Government may do, he should, in my view, introduce  a

Bill to amend the Holidays Ordinance, and not seek  to

amend  the Holidays Ordinance by the by-blow  of  some

not  immediately essential or desirable  amendment  to

the  Elections Ordinance. It seems to me that we shall

only  be  storing  up trouble for  the  future  if  we

persist  in  altering  the law  haphazardly  by  these

curious cross-references which in practice will, I  am

quite  sure,  be  liable to be  overlooked  and  cause

endless trouble.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to

have  got the Attorney-General to his feet to meet  my

argument,  but  I think he can at least  see  that  an

amendment  is necessary if subsequent Governments  are

to  be  bound.  We can always accept his  Government's

undertaking, but no subsequent Government has yet come

about  nor  given an undertaking. It may believe  that

the  proper form to maintain legislative elegance  and

neatness is to amend the Holidays Ordinance, but  also

he  knows  that, if a private Member moves a  Bill  to

amend  the  Ordinance, it must automatically  go  into

Select Committee. It will never be pushed through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>



before  this  Assembly is over. And I suggest  to  him

that  if  at a subsequent date his draftsmen  consider

this  to be a piece of inelegance, then the Government

that  is elected as a result of these provisions which

we  are  enacting  can always tidy  up  the  Ordinance

before  the next body of consolidated laws are issued.

I would therefore ask him to consider, or at least the

Chief  Minister to consider, whether it is not  wiser,

politically,  to allow the amendment, and  then  at  a

subsequent date to get the draftsmen to tidy it up.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of procedure, perhaps the

hon.  Member  for Tanjong Pagar may be  interested  to

know that a private Member's Bill does not necessarily

go  to Select Committee, and the Bill mentioned by the

hon. Member would be a private Member's Bill. It would

not  be  a  private  Bill. There is a  distinction.  A

private Bill affecting personal interests must  go  to

Select Committee. It is only a question of procedure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Whatever it is, Mr Speaker, Sir,

you  will  realise  that it is not  possible  for  me,

unless  I  get  a  Certificate  of  Urgency  from  the

Governor, to rush it through.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am not arguing. I am just pointing

out a point of procedure. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Attorney General may be

right.  The proper thing to do would be to  amend  the

Holidays Ordinance. But the life of the Government  is

only  for a few days. There is no time for any  Member

to move a private Bill. In view of the coming election

and  in view of my suggestion to give escort to female

voters, it is very essential that, as a special  thing

for  this  election, we pass this Bill in the interest

of  the public. I am sure the Government is not  going

to obstruct that.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I am afraid, as usual, the

hon.  Member  for Telok Ayer has failed to  grasp  the

real meaning of the exchange of words between the hon.

Member   for  Tanjong  Pagar  and  the  Hon.  Attorney

General. It is just a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>



question of how to achieve this - whether it should  be

by amendment to this Bill or amendment to the Holidays

Ordinance. The Government has stated a long time  ago,

Sir,  that polling day will be a public holiday and  I

am  happy  to  note that the hon. Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar does not doubt Government's intention. What  the

hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar seeks to achieve is that

it  shall be so stated in some Ordinance that  polling

day  for  future general elections should  also  be  a

public  holiday. This is a matter in which I  have  to

rely on the advice of the Attorney General. He advises

me  that that is not the proper way to achieve it. And

now,  I  hear  from the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar

that  it  would  be better if the intention  could  be

stated  in some form or other so that it is clear  and

that  if  the  intention is made clear in  this  Bill,

subsequent Governments can have it amended at a  later

date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of that, Sir, we are not going to oppose his

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause read a Second time and added to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clause (after clause 17)-

'Amendment       Subsection (1) of section 46 of the principal

of             Ordinance is hereby amended-

                 the ballot papers; and" appearing in the eighth and

<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the clause be

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause, Sir, is necessary to implement the

provisions of clause 17 of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>



amending  Bill and is connected with the  amendment  I

moved  to  that  clause previously in connection  with

retaining  the  marked  copies  of  the  register   of

electors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 46 (1) of the principal Ordinance, the

presiding officer in each polling station is required,

as  soon as practicable after the close of the  polls,

to  make up three separate packets and to affix  seals

thereto.  The  first package contains the  unused  and

spoilt  ballot  papers  placed  together;  the  second

package  contains  both  the  marked  copies  of   the

register  of  electors  and the counter-foils  of  the

ballot  papers;  and  the third package  contains  the

tendered  votes  list. Since it is now provided  under

this  amending  Bill  that the marked  copies  of  the

register of electors should be opened and retained  by

the Returning Officer in order to check who has or who

has  not  voted, it is desirable that there should  be

separate  packets in respect of the marked  copies  of

the  register  of electors and of the counterfoils  of

the ballot papers. The object of this new clause is to

make provision accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause read a Second time and added to the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I do not know whether I am in

order - please  correct  me if  I  am  not - in  making  a

general observation. It is in the interest of all  the

Parties contesting the elections. This is what I  want

to say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the rich candidates or rich Parties or those

who can afford to buy votes may try an indecent way of

buying  votes. A voter does not place his vote in  the

booth. He carries it with him and later on the one who

has succeeded in buying votes may throw in a bunch  of

ballot papers at a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion to the administration is that they

must  keep  an eye on the voter putting his vote  into

the  box  and  that he does not put in more  than  one

ballot paper. In the past the booth is closed on three

sides.  Nobody  knows what the voter  does - whether  he

throws in one paper - his own voting paper - or a bunch of

papers.  My  suggestion is that  the  police  and  the

person in the booth should see that no malpractice  of

this nature is attempted by anyone.



<br><br>11.06 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, I want to ask the hon.

Member  for Telok Ayer this question. Is he  proposing

that  there should be a policeman to watch the marking

of  the  ballot by the voter? It appears to  be,  from

what he is saying. I can hardly believe that it is his

intention that the police should stand over the  voter

to see that he votes one way or another.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, in reply to the hon. Member for

Telok  Ayer, the procedure, as I understand it,  which

already  operates is as follows. The voter, after  his

name has been checked on the list of voters, is issued

with  a ballot paper. He takes that ballot paper  into

the  polling  booth where he marks it in  any  way  he

thinks  fit and out of the view of anybody else.  When

he  comes out of the booth he is required to  put  the

ballot paper into the ballot box, and therefore  there

can be no question of ballot papers being popped in or

removed from the polling station. They are only issued

once  to  each  voter and he is required  to  put  the

ballot paper into the ballot box.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill, as amended, accordingly read the Third time

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the Governor's recommendation

to proceed with the motion; I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $106,705

shall be supplied to the Government under the heads of

expenditure  and  for the services  specified  in  the

Schedule contained in Sessional Paper No. Cmd.  13  of

1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Schedule consists of seven applications for

supplementary  provision amounting  to  $106,705.  The

reasons  for  these supplementary votes are  given  in

detail  in  the  Sessional Paper. There are,  however,

three items on which I propose to make some additional

comments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first refers to the proposed appointments of

interpreters for the Legislative Assembly in order  to

implement   the   proposal  that   all   debates   and

discussions in the Assembly will be conducted  in  the

four  languages, namely English, Malay,  Mandarin  and

Tamil, under the new Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will recollect that, in this connection,

a  Select Committee was appointed and made its  Report

on  the  matter in 1957, which has been  published  as

Sessional  Paper No. L.A. 20 of 1957. It is imperative

that  early  arrangements  should  be  made  for   the

recruitment  and  training of these  interpreters,  so

that  a  trained  staff will be  available  to  render

simultaneous  interpretation in the four languages  at

the first sitting of the new Assembly. It is therefore

proposed  to implement immediately the recommendations

in  sub-paragraphs (7) to (10) of paragraph 35 of  the

Report,    namely    to   recruit   three    permanent

interpreters - one  in  English and  Malay,  another  in

English  and  Mandarin, and the third in  English  and

Tamil - and  six part-time interpreters, two  proficient

in English and Malay, two in English and Mandarin, and

two in English and Tamil, and that Mr A. T. Pilley of

organisation and training of simultaneous oral

instructions/translation   personnel   and   who   was

previously  consulted  by  the  Select  Committee,  be

engaged  for  a  period of at least 10  days  for  the

purpose   of  testing,  selecting  and  training   the

candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concerns the provision of bursaries for

Malay students in the secondary schools. The object of

the  proposal is to enable the Malay students who  are

in  needy  circumstances to complete  their  secondary

education.  The  bursary will  be  awarded  where  the

financial  circumstances of a deserving student  would

prevent  him  from obtaining secondary education.  The

award  will  be  confined to Malay  students  born  in

Singapore  or children of Singapore citizens  resident

for  not  less  than  five  years,  prior  to  joining

secondary schools. The value of the bursary  would  be

$72  per  annum  and, on the basis of  250  bursaries,

supplementary provision of $18,000 will  be  required.

In  addition, school fees will be remitted and the sum

of $10,080 will be involved in a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third refers to the provision of a loan scheme

for  Singapore  overseas private  students  to  assist

proven  needy  cases. Assistance will be  confined  to

students who have passed at least their preliminary or

intermediate  examination, and are making satisfactory

progress   in   the   course  of  study   leading   to

qualifications for which there is still an unsatisfied

demand in Government, and to prove their inability  to

continue  studies without Government  assistance.  Any

applicant  who receives assistance must  undertake  to

apply  for  appointment in Government  service  for  a

specified  period. Two sureties will be  required  and

the  loan,  which is interest-free, would be repayable

over  a  period after the students have qualified  and

begun  gainful  employment.  It  is  hoped  that  this

proposal  will  tide  over the  shortage  of  suitably

qualified  professional men at the  present  stage  of

Malayanisation. Only $20,000 will be required for each

year  and  it  is  proposed to  put  the  scheme  into

operation for five years, or until the demand for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>



the requisite qualifications has been met. Regulations

to give effect to this scheme are being prepared.

<div align="center"><b>NANYANG UNIVERSITY BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Select Committee's Report)</b></div>

11.25 a.m



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Assistant Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the

Nanyang  University  Bill, as contained  in  Sessional

Paper No. L.A. 3 of 1959, be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving that the Report of the Select

Committee on the Nanyang University be adopted, I wish

to say that the Government is grateful to you, Sir, as

Chairman  of  the Select Committee, for going  through

the  Bill  and the representations made by  interested

parties  so expeditiously that we are able to do  what

the sponsors of the Nanyang University wish done.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is urgency in the minds of those connected with

Nanyang University, particularly the sponsors, that

the time has come for the constitution of Nanyang

University to be put on a proper basis. This Bill is

drafted by the legal advisers of Nanyang University

which is essentially a private organisation. But the

Government has seen fit to handle this matter because

the provision of higher education in Chinese is of

public concern. Very few substantial changes have been

made in the Bill as the result of the deliberations of

the Select Committee, because it is not the intention

to make material changes to the proposals submitted by

the sponsors of this private institution. I will deal

with these changes which we have introduced into the

Bill at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need only say at this stage that there is the

Nanyang  University  Commission  consisting  of   five

eminent scholars who are extremely interested  in  the

future  of  Nanyang  University.  They  are  making  a

special   study   of  the  constitution   of   Nanyang

University. Members of the House can therefore  expect

that  when  the Commission has completed its findings,

there might be further changes to be introduced to the

University.   Of   course,  those  changes   will   be

considered   jointly   by  the  Government   and   the

University Authority when they are submitted,  because

the Commission was jointly appointed by the Government

and  the  University.  But  the  matter  of  immediate

importance   now   is   to  have  Nanyang   University

incorporated  by  law  so that the  administration  of

Nanyang University can be put on a better footing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the changes which the Select

Committee  have  introduced  into  the  Bill.  I  have

mentioned   that   the  changes  are   few   and   not

substantial.  I  refer  in  particular,  Sir,  to  the

addition  of  a  new clause 26 in  the  Bill  for  the

purpose   of   establishing  the  Nanyang   University

Students'  Union, the constitution of which should  be

approved by the Council of the University or  by  such

authority  as  may be authorised for that  purpose  by

statute. The clause also gives power to the Council



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>



to  delegate to the Union, on such conditions as it may

think fit to enforce, the management of any building or

common room assigned for the use of students. The House

will  remember that at one of the previous sittings  of

this  House, when the Minister moved the Second Reading

of  this  Bill,  he  stated  that  he  would  see  that

provision would be made in the Bill to give the Nanyang

University Students' Union a status, and that  is  what

has been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the addition of a new sub-paragraph (3)

to  paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule to provide  that

notice   of  every  meeting  of  the  members  of   the

University,  stating the business to be  considered  at

the  meeting, should be sent by post to each member  of

the University at least seven days before such meeting,

unless  special  circumstances require shorter  notice.

But  the  proceedings  of any  meeting  should  not  be



invalidated  by  any irregularity in  respect  of  such

notice.  This  amendment is mainly to  make  sure  that

proper  procedure  is followed. Apart  from  those  two

amendments, all other amendments are factual  and  need

no further mention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say at this stage that those who have

made  representations to the Select Committee have made

some useful suggestions. We are grateful that with  the

help  of  those suggestions we are able today  to  have

this Bill before the House for the Third Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of Nanyang University must depend on a

proper constitution and proper administration, and I am

glad that the sponsors of the University have seen  fit

to approach the Government to approve this Bill so that

the   foundation  for  the  administration  of  Nanyang

University  will  properly be laid, and  there  is  the

Nanyang   University   Commission   now   sitting   and

considering   certain  problems  connected   with   the

University.  They are deeply interested in  this  Bill,

and  I  have no doubt that they will submit their views

to  the  Government and the University in  due  course.

Whether further changes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>



should  be  made to the constitution and administration

of  Nanyang  University must depend on that Report  and

the  decision  of  the Government  and  the  University

Authority, but before that, there is a proposal to  put

Nanyang  University on a better footing,  and  this  is

what this Bill aims to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, I rise to second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.31 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, I have only a few

words to say. I congratulate the pioneers of Nanyang

University who have sacrificed not only their time but

also their money. With their influence, they have

established a very important centre of culture in this

part of the world.



<br><br>11.32 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

very glad to note that clause 26 of this Bill gives the

Students'  Union of Nanyang University a legal  status.

Education in any university, Sir, falls mainly into two



parts. One part is the academic side and the other part

is  the  social  side, and that social  side,  Sir,  is

certainly as important as the academic side. It will be

in   the  Students'  Union  building,  where  there  is

association between one student with another, that  the

students  of  Nanyang University will be able  to  form

friendships that will last for life. In time  to  come,

they  will be able to remember some of the good  things

and  even some of the naughty things they have done  in

the  Union  building.  Those of us  who  have  had  the

privilege  of being resident in any university  hostel,

often  look back with pride at even some of the naughty

things we did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government has for the first time made a grant to

Nanyang  University. Now that the  administration  is

being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>



put  on a better footing, I feel confident that further

Government support will be forthcoming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the Nanyang

University  Bill, as contained in Sessional  Paper  No.

L.A. 3 of 1959, be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>MALAYANISATION COMPENSATION TERMS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TO MALAYAN OFFICER</b></div>



<br><br>11.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to move the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House deplores the payment of Malayanisation

Compensation terms to any Malayan officer who had  been

given   and  had  accepted  promotion  on  account   of

Malayanisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday morning, Sir, the Chief Secretary gave us an

account  of what must be one of the most sorry episodes

that  ever  took  place after the  publication  of  the

Malayanisation terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to preface the strong remarks that I wish

to make on this subject by stating my Party policy with

regard  to  the public service generally. I  know  that

there  is a certain amount of concern over the  welfare

and  well-being of the public service as  a  result  of

expected  political  changes. I would  like  to  remind

them, first, that it is their duty as civil servants to

be  politically neutral in carrying out the  orders  of

the  Government in power, and that they enjoy a special

position  under the new constitution with  their  basic

salaries  guaranteed; but that corresponding  to  these

special  provisions  for their benefit,  they  have  to

shoulder special responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to read what I stated last Sunday

with  regard to our policy on labour and trade  unions.

We have a special provision entitled "Special Duties of



the  Civil  Service" which I stated  on  behalf  of  my

Party:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At this point, we would like to emphasise the special

duties of workers in the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>



service  like the Government, the Government agencies,

the   Singapore  Telephone  Board  and  semi-Government

agencies like the Singapore Improvement Trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the right to a fair wage and good

conditions  of  employment,  holidays,  leave,  medical

benefits and good terms for retirement. We support  the

principle  of collective bargaining between  unions  of

workers in these categories and the Government or these

statutory  Boards, but we expect and will enforce  high

standards  of  service and courtesy to the  public  and

equally high standards of efficiency and discipline  in

these services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the business of the P.A.P. Government after it

has been elected by the people into office to implement

its policy and no civil servant has the right to oppose

or block or hinder our policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these few special observations, a P.A.P.

Government will treat its workers and the unions  as  a



good employer and as the people's trustees."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a result of the deliberate

distortion  and  propaganda carried on by  the  English

language  Press for the specific purpose of  trying  to

demoralise our English-speaking supporters, the  public

service thinks, rightly or wrongly, that the P.A.P. is

against   them  because  they,  being  members   of   a

privileged class, will be destroyed in a non-privileged

society. I would like to remind the civil service  that

it  is our duty, if and when we form the Government, to

abide by the rules of the game, and the rules are  laid

down  in the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council,

1958,  which safeguards their basic interests. I  would

like  to  say  this: that their interests  having  been

safeguarded,  it is their duty to exert  themselves  to

the best of their ability on behalf of the people whose

taxes  help  to pay their emoluments and  ensure  their

peaceful and happy retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I asked a question to which I received a

reply which was silent on several matters. My motion is

in  general terms, and I am asking this House  to  join

with  me  in  stating something which is  a  matter  of

general  policy. It is my view that any Malayan officer

who  has accepted promotion as a Malayan on account  of

the Malayanisation scheme is automatically disentitled,

whatever  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the   special

provisions that are written into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>



the  abolition terms can say to the contrary. I do not

know  if  there  are any other members of  the  public

service who hope to follow the example of this  august

official who will retire with a sum of money the total

of  which we have not been informed, but I would  like

to state here and now that nobody has the right, if he

has  accepted  promotion on account of Malayanisation,

to  say,  "Ah, but I am really not a Malayan. I  would

like  compensation  like the  white  man."  The  Chief

Secretary said yesterday, in regard to this particular

officer, that he made representations to the Secretary

of  State  in  1957 - he did not say at what  particular

time in 1957 - under section 18 of Ordinance No. 43  of

1956. The Chief Secretary said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Secretary of State after considering these

representations  expressed himself satisfied  that  he

had  reasonable  grounds  for  anxiety  regarding  the

future of his career in the public service."



<br><br>I  would  like to know from the Chief Secretary  when

the  Secretary  of  State expressed himself  satisfied

that  this officer had reasonable grounds for anxiety.

I  would  also like to know what advice the  Singapore

Government  tendered  to the  Secretary  of  State  in

regard  to this particular application. When  I  first

came to know that moves were being made to retire this

officer,  I warned the Chief Minister that this  is  a

political  issue and not just a civil service  matter.

When  an officer gets promotion and then says,  "I  am

going to scoot with a bagful of notes" - it is the duty

of  the  Government to prevent that from happening.  I

want  to know from the Chief Minister what advice  his

Council  of  Ministers tendered to  the  Secretary  of

State,  for  the Secretary of State does  not  act  on

these matters without advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary went on to say that the officer,

having  become entitled, gave five months'  notice  in

November 1958 of his intention to retire under section

3 of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to know these facts. What is the

compensation  to  be in terms of dollars?  What  would

have  been the position of the officer had there  been

no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>



Malayanisation scheme? When in 1957 did he apply to be

entitled? When was he advised that he was entitled?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a country moves from a state of tutelage

and   dependence  towards  independence,  it  is   the

practice  in British territories to allow their  civil

servants  to quit the service and enter the  political

arena. It is a legal and open recognition of the  fact

that,  in  a colonial territory, the civil service  is

not  necessarily neutral. Two officers opted to retire

and  enter  the political arena. They were  given  the

opportunity to take part in politics. They were  given

no  compensation terms. They will be candidates at the

next  elections. If this officer felt that at the next

elections  a  government will come  into  power  which

would  give him grounds for anxiety as to his  future,

it was quite open to him to opt out of the service and

contest  the  elections against  the  Party  which  he

dislikes,  or  which  he thinks will  be  against  his

interests. But for him as the Head of the Intelligence

organisation of the Government, to scoot with a bagful

of notes is the most deplorable episode ever recounted

anywhere  in  the world. A man who was entrusted  with

the   whole   business  of  Intelligence   and   anti-subversion, turns out to be not a great idealist and a

man  of  convictions and ability to match his  duties,

but a lout who only wanted to further his own ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a tribute to my Party, if what the Straits

Times  said was true, that he quit because he expected

the  P.A.P. to  come in. I will  say  this,  that  no

officer  will be penalised in the service  for  having

carried out his orders, whether they be for or against

the benefit of the P.A.P., because we expect the civil

service to carry out orders. Therefore, we acknowledge

the  fact that they must carry out the orders  of  the

present  Government  or  any future  Government  which

follows  the  P.A.P.  In the case of  this  particular

officer, his position is especially entrenched in  the

Singapore   (Constitution)  Order  in   Council.   The

position  of  the Commissioner of Police,  the  Deputy

Commissioner of Police and the Director of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>



Special  Branch  receives  special  mention   in   the

Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council.  I  do  not

know  on  what grounds the officer can conceivably  be

anxious  when his position is already a built-in  one.

All  I can say is that either he must have done a very



treacherous   act  which  he  was  afraid   would   be

subsequently  discovered, or that he was a  despicable

mercenary, and it was a deliberate and calculated plan

to  go  twice  at  public expense to England,  qualify

himself  as  a  barrister-at-law, and then  give  five

months' notice of his intention to retire on full  pay

at  public expense, while he sits in Chambers  waiting

to  be admitted to practise at the Bar and rake in the

shekels.  Sir, I notice that he is prudent  enough  to

make   sure  of  collecting  his  compensation  terms,

because,  if  I  read  the  Chief  Secretary's   reply

yesterday  correctly, his retirement will be effective

from next month, that is before the elections. But, as

I  told the Chief Minister, this is a political issue.

No officer is entitled to do this. It is our view that



this  man  should  be made to refund  the  $20,000  or

$30,000  or  $40,000 that was spent on him on  several

trips  to Britain. On the first trip that he went  for

special training as a policeman in order to equip  him

for his special duties, he enrolled as a member of the

Bar.  He  is an able officer in his particular  field,

and  nobody objects to a police officer acquiring some

legal  knowledge.  Subsequently, he wangled  a  return

trip  during which he completed his studies.  He  then

came  back, took full advantage of the fact that there

was  Malayanisation and that vacancies were two for  a

penny right at the top, and got himself ensconced in a

convenient job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have nothing against Mr Khaw. I am only sorry

that he did a disservice to the whole police force and

to  the  whole of the public service by  what  he  has

done.  My Party has every intention of resisting  this

officer  in  his  scheme  to get  about  $100,000  for

compensation.  I would like to add this  in  case  any

other officer thinks of opting out of the service in a

similar way, that it is the business of the Government

to  prevent this. I do not believe that there  can  be

any other such mercenary in the service. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>



those who stay behind to serve the next Government,  I

say  it  is  a  Government which  will  play  strictly

according  to the rules, which states what it  intends

to  do,  and  will  do  what it has  stated.  We  have

carefully  considered  the  position  of  the   public

service.  We  are  party to the  provisions  regarding

their  future, and we shall abide by those rules.  But

we   expect   and  will  enforce  high  standards   of

efficiency, discipline and loyalty to the service, and

I am quite sure that they will rise to the special and

heavier  responsibilities that  will  fall  upon  them

after  the  next general elections. But just  in  case

there  happens to be some other adventurer wanting  to

take  advantage  of a weak and vacillating  Government

giving  the  wrong kind of advice to the Secretary  of

State,  I ask the House formally today to join  me  in

saying  that  we deplore the payment of Malayanisation

compensation terms to any Malayan officer who had been

given  and  had  accepted  promotion  on  account   of

Malayanisation.  I  shall have more  to  say  on  this

particular  officer in my reply,  after  I  have  been

provided  with the information I have sought from  the

Chief   Secretary.  But  I  ask  the  civil   service,

particularly those in the higher strata,  to  remember

that  their  future, and the future  of  the  country,

depends  upon high standards of integrity and  service

to  the  people. That these Malayanisation  terms  and

schemes  are  avenues for them to serve  their  people

better,  and  that we expect them so to  approach  the

future.



<br><br>11.55 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is ridiculous that Government should

embark  on a policy whereby a local officer  not  only

gains  accelerated  promotion  as  a  result  of   the

Malayanisation  policy, but also  that  he  should  be

allowed to retire from the public service after having

accepted  promotion  with compensation  on  the  terms

approved for expatriate officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in carrying out the Malayanisation policy,

expatriate  officers  have  to  make  room  for  local

officers, and it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>



for this reason that they receive compensation for loss

of  employment. Does the Government not realise that it

is acting foolishly, as well as perpetrating a fraud on

the  taxpayers, when it agrees to allow a local officer

who has been promoted to a job vacated by an expatriate

officer to leave his job and to receive the same amount

of  compensation which has been paid to the  expatriate

officer, with the object of making the job available to

the local officer?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a local officer has accepted promotion and has

been promoted as a result of the Malayanisation policy,

he  should surely never be allowed to pretend that  his

appointment  will  no longer be safe  for  him  with  a

change  of  government, and that  after  having  gained

early promotion, he should then be allowed to leave his

job  on  lavish  compensation terms. Sir,  if  a  local

officer  in  the restricted class wishes to retire  for

political  reasons, he had the opportunity of declaring

his intention some time ago. In this case, Sir, he will

leave  the service on his usual pension terms and  will

not be compensated for loss of employment; but the case

to  which I am referring cannot be so compared. In that

case, a local officer has been paid compensation  on  a

very lavish scale for loss of employment on vacating  a

post which he was never required to leave and which  it

was his duty not to relinquish at a time when important

constitutional changes are to take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the officer concerned has been allowed to leave

the service and is now practising at the local Bar.  He

has been paid compensation far above what he would ever

have received on normal retirement after having enjoyed

the  higher emoluments of the post which he would never

have reached were it not for the Malayanisation policy.

I consider this action of Government to be indefensible



and deplorable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>12.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> It seems to me, Sir,

that the ex-Labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>



Front  Government, now the S.P.A. Coalition Government,

has   bungled   everything  in  its  management.   Sir,

memories,  especially in Singapore, are very short.  In

1952,  the  Legislative Council, in order to  help  the

local-born boys to rise to higher positions and to take

over  high  posts from the expatriates, got a Committee

appointed  through  me,  the Ad-hoc  Committee  of  the

Legislative  Council, with Mr L. C. Goh as  Secretary.

The  Report  of the Committee was ultimately presented,



and  it recommended that local-born officers should  go

up  to  the top and take over from the expatriates  the

right  to run the administration of this Colony. Later,

the  Malayanisation scheme with compensation terms  for

the  abolition of the expatriates came into being. What

was  meant by that scheme? The spirit of it is that  if

we  want  to  take  over as early as possible  for  the

benefit of our local-born boys, we must give favourable

terms   to  the  expatriates - white  or  black,  it   is

immaterial - so that they can strike this big lottery and

retire to their homes. Well, all this is past now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in any democratic country democracy can rule only

if the local men, forming the public civil service, are

loyal  to their own country. If any local-born  officer

takes   advantage  of  the  Malayanisation  scheme   by

retiring with compensation, and that was not meant  for

such people at all, and the Government has allowed  him

to  so  retire, then that is wrong in principle. He  is

not  retiring  to any other country as  he  is  not  an

expatriate; and if he is not an expatriate, why  should

this  huge sum then be paid to him? Sir, I do not  know

this  officer in question. I do not know anything about

his  case, and I am only talking on principle - that  our

local  boys, trained at the expense of public  revenue,

should give loyal service and stick fast to their jobs.

Then only can we gain independence; not otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know what has happened in this case, and

while  awaiting the reply of the Government, I wish  to

stress   this  principle - that  no  local-born  officer,

trained  at  the expense of public revenue,  should  be

given the advantage of compensation terms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>12.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think it is quite obvious that whoever this officer

may be, he is not a member of the P.A.P., and perhaps

he does not like the P.A.P. He may even fear the

P.A.P., Sir! He may feel that he should not allow

himself to be made a "Marcus"! Sir, if this particular

officer, according to the existing law today, is

entitled to retire and is entitled to the compensation

which he has been paid or will be paid, where then is

the kick? It may be that he is not sporting. But if he

has fear that the future treatment which he might

receive may not be fair, then why should he not have

the right to retire and receive compensation if the

law so allows him? Sir, bad law is considered better

than no law at all. If the law is bad, it has to be

changed; and until that law is changed, every person

working under that bad law, has his legal rights to

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not defending this man; I do not know him

well.  But it is unfair to attack him as he cannot  be

here to defend himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to Malayanisation, Sir, In 1924 I fought for

better terms of service for local officers. I was then

employed as a teacher. My maximum salary was $300, and

it  could not get beyond that. A European coming  from

England  started with $400. In 1924, Sir, I  fought  a

losing battle. There was no chance. Today we have  our

chance. We have fought and won Malayanisation by which

we  have  got rid of all expatriate officers,  and  by

which  we  are giving our local boys a chance  to  get

better   terms  in  Government  service.  Sir,   their

salaries    must    be   commensurate    with    their

responsibility  and  be  equal  to  those  offered  by

commercial firms, otherwise we will not get  the  best

men  in  the civil service. If commercial firms  offer

higher salaries than what the Government can offer  to

its  civil servants, Sir, I shall feel very sorry  for

the class of civil servants we shall have in future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>12.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

hon. Mr R. C. H. Lim referred to the year 1924. I

remember coming out here myself as a young teacher in

1934 - ten years later. There was a senior Chinese

teacher on the staff who was, so I thought, in charge

of me and he told me what to do, and kept an eye on

me. I called him "Sir" until I was sent for by the

principal who said that this senior teacher had been

to see him, and would I stop calling him "Sir",

because that embarrassed him. I then looked into the

matter - it had not occurred to me before - and found that

this man was longer in service than I, and was getting

$300 a month; and that I with about six weeks'

service, was getting $400. That was my first shock at

the irrationality of the way things were done in

Singapore some time ago. I thought then of the

importance of giving proper treatment to all officers,

and I did not feel it was fair, speaking for myself,

that I should start at a scale higher than that of a

man of long experience. I have in the course of nearly

25 years of life here seen the extreme value of the

work of the long service officers, who have come up

the hard way in all departments of the civil service,

and who, in addition to basic qualifications, have

acquired the practical administrative experience which

is of vital importance, without which mere intellect

and scholastic achievements can make most serious

mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I was reading, Mr Speaker, a very

interesting   book  by  a  Mr  Tarzie   Vittachi,   a

Ceylonese.  It is called "Emergency 1958"  and  in  it

this  journalist of a most responsible Ceylonese paper

described how, in May 1958, they arrived at a state of

communal riots, deaths, murders. He described them  in

some  detail. For example, how a gang of  rioters  set

fire  to a sugar-cane plantation in which people  were

hiding,  and  the flames thus drove the hidden  people

out;  when  they  were set upon  and  beaten  up,  and

pregnant  women  had their stomachs ripped  open,  and

bled to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>



death.  That  was  the  sort of situation  which  they

arrived  at  in Ceylon. His book is banned  there;  he

himself is not allowed to live there apparently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it sounded to me convincing. I was in Ceylon a

year  previously  and it seemed to me  something  like

that  was  on its way. I recollect also that when  the

Labour  Front Government took office in 1955,  it  was

not  long  before  we had rioting in  the  streets.  I

recollect then that the experienced Governor we had at

that time warned us that rioting and death were on the

way,  and he was right. These things can happen,  they

can  happen  in Singapore, and they have  happened  to

some  extent  in Singapore. And the safeguard  against

them  is,  very largely, the experience, the practical

wisdom  of  the  senior civil servants in  the  public

service;  whether it is the Government public service,

or  the  City  Council, or the  Rural  Board,  or  the

S.I.T., or the Telephone Board, or the Harbour  Board,

or  any  of  the other quasi-governmental  bodies,  we

always come back to the same problem that somebody has

got to know the answers from experience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order, Sir. My motion

is  on  a  specific issue. I state a precise principle

that  there  should be no officer who should  be  paid

Malayanisation compensation terms who had  been  given

and  had  accepted  promotion. Is Mr  Francis  Thomas

relevant and in order?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was about to say that perhaps the hon.

Member  was wandering a bit far away from the  motion.

But  I  take  it he is touching on the civil  service,

because the hon. mover did touch, in passing,  on  the

civil service. Perhaps the hon. Member might touch  on

the civil service in passing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was well aware that I

was  not  strictly relevant to the precise details  of

the  motion.  If I may come closer to  the  motion,  I

would  like  to  say that, as far as I understand  the

case - and I heard primarily only the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>



Opposition  side because I am not well informed  about

the  details from the Government side - it may  be  that

there  are other factors of which I am not aware,  but

prima  facie on the information available to me  as  I

stand  now  (and  I  rose partly because  nobody  else

wishes  to  rise, and I thought I might  fill  up  the

time)  on the information available to me, I do  think

that it was rather unfortunate that the situation  had

so arisen. I do not understand in what way the officer

concerned was positive that he felt-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Anxiety!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> -anxiety about the future of his career in

the  public  service. There has been a great  deal  of

anxiety  expressed  in  getting around  the  political

reasons in the last few weeks. I have heard a  lot  of

anxiety. A lot of it is artificially engendered in  my

opinion,  but nevertheless there is that  in  the  air

because,   throughout  many  territories   where   new

governments have come in, there have been difficulties

for  civil servants. I would like specifically to say,

Mr  Speaker, that I do not think this anxiety,  which

some  people feel, arises only from P.A.P. activities.

I  have  risen  frequently before  in  this  House  to



express my disagreement and disapproval of the  things

that  have been said in this House, the sort of things

which  inevitably damage the confidence of  the  civil

service in the good sense of politicians, the sort  of

things that have been said from this side of the House

very frequently as well as from the other. It is not a

matter  of  one Party or another; it is  a  matter  of

people  coming rather new to administration.  I  would

like to start again on that one, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was myself a politician without any

experience, except as a schoolmaster, I was pulled out

by  the  former Chief Minister and made  Minister  for

Communications and Works. I came into my Ministry with

a  profound belief that, on the whole, I should find a

lot  of things wrong and that with my piercing mind  I

should be able to put them all right. I said obviously

this  ought to have been done, and if it had not  been

done somebody was very much to blame.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>



But  as  I went about my work I discovered, of course,

that  certain things ought to have been done, and what

was  possible was being done, but we could not do more

than  was  possible.  The former Chief  Minister,  Mr

Marshall, used to have a telephone on his desk at  the

"Meet  the  People"  sessions, and  telephoned  senior

officers.   That,   I  am  sure,   induced   in   them

considerable anxiety about their future, because  they

are  dealing with important work. They got a telephone

message  from  the Chief Minister based on  inaccurate

information  given  by a man dealing  with  a  special

case,  and  they  got  instructions  to  do  or   undo

something  on which no proper consideration  had  been

given.  That  was  the thing that  would  cause  great

anxiety  to any officer who is seriously concerned  in

getting his work done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really speak, Mr Speaker, rather on the edge of

the  motion  to  the  effect that  even  if,  in  this

particular case, the officer concerned is actually  in

a degree of anxiety which is unnecessary and has taken

advantage of his legal position to the extent which is

undesirable, it should not induce any of us  to  think

that  that is widespread throughout the civil service.

I  know  myself  of  senior  civil  servants  who  had



resisted the most tempting offers of posts to go  into

private  life. The rates of pay in government  service

are  not  equivalent to what a man  can  earn  in  the

commercial world, and in carrying on the senior  civil

servants  are making real sacrifices, and they  should

be remembered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can finish with one of my favourite authors, Mr

Speaker,   Confucius,  in  the  English   translation,

remarks  that  "an  accomplished  scholar  is  not   a

utensil". A senior civil servant is not a tool; he  is

a  person; and so is a junior civil servant; so is the

man  who  cleans the drains; they have their feelings;

they  have their impulses; these have to be  borne  in

mind.  The  idea  of the mechanical civil  service  is

unreal.  Certainly the civil service  must  carry  out

orders,  just as much as a soldier carries out orders.

We  have had War Crimes trials after the Japanese  and



the  Nazis had been beaten, and we have seen there how

some  people did carry out orders, and how the  orders

were held to be invalid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>



because  they were contrary to public morality.  These

principles come down to personal decisions in the end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am ready at the present, Mr Speaker, to support

this  motion, but I cannot make up my mind clearly  on

it  until I have heard more of the other side  of  the

case.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is time to suspend.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House deplores the payment of

Malayanisation  Compensation  terms  to  any   Malayan

officer  who had been given and had accepted promotion

on account of Malayanisation."



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, when the conduct of a public officer is called in

question in this House, when he has been acting in his

official  capacity,  it  is a normal  convention  that

responsibility  for  that  act  is  accepted  by   the

Minister  concerned.  In  so  far  as  the  particular

matters under discussion concern the personal act  and

decision  of a public officer, it is not a  matter  in

which    the    Minister    concerned    can    accept

responsibility. It follows that the discussion in this

House must necessarily be of an ex parte nature, since

the  officer concerned cannot in the nature of  things

be  here to defend himself, and I would ask the House,

in  considering  the  terms  of  this  motion  and  in

discussion and any conclusions to which they may come,

to bear that point in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, Sir, that this motion really falls

into  two  parts. One is concerned with the acceptance

of the application made by this officer under section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2127</b></font><br><br>



18  of  the Ordinance, and the second part  of  it  is

concerned with the personal election of the officer to

exercise  the  privilege he  has  been  given  and  to

retire.  On  the  first point, some of the  criticisms

which   have  been  voiced,  and  in  particular   the

observations made by the hon. Member for  Telok  Ayer,

seem  to  me to be addressed to the principle embodied

in  that  section  of the Ordinance  with  which  this

motion is concerned. Under that section (Ordinance No.

43 of 1956):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An officer not in receipt of expatriation pay who

holds  his  appointment by the approval of a Secretary

of  State  who following representations made  by  him

before the expiry of a period of three years from  the

operative date satisfies a Secretary of State that  he

has  reasonable  grounds  for  anxiety  regarding  the

future  of his career in the public service  shall  be

eligible  to retire and receive a pension or  gratuity

and  compensation for loss of career as if he were  an

entitled  officer and the provisions of this Ordinance

shall apply accordingly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I am correct in saying that at the time

of  the  1956 discussions in London, the Secretary  of

State  did make it clear that he considered he  had  a

responsibility towards local officers who had accepted

appointments under his authority, and this section was

included  in  the  Ordinance when it  was  enacted  in

December  1956.  I do suggest to the hon.  Member  for

Telok  Ayer,  and  those who are  concerned  with  the

general  principles involved in this  Ordinance,  that

the time when that matter should have been queried was

when  the  Ordinance was enacted, but I have consulted

Hansard on the debate on the Second Reading and in the

Committee  stage of the Bill, and the matter  was  not

raised at that time when this Ordinance was enacted by

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the matter, Sir, is concerned with

the  particular  application which is the  subject  of

this  motion.  As  I  stated in reply  to  a  question

yesterday  morning, this officer made his  application

under  that section in October 1957, and the  gist  of

his representation in short was that, in the execution

of  his  duties, it had fallen to him to play a  major

part  in  investigating the subversive activities  of,

and taking appropriate action against, certain persons

who might at later time be in a position to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>



exercise  influence,  either  in  or  over  a   future

Government,   and  he  accordingly  had  grounds   for

apprehension regarding his future career.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar

that the position of this officer in the post he fills

had  special  protection  in being  enshrined  in  the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order in  Council,  but  the

only  section of which I am aware in that Order  which

concerns  this point is section 82 (1)  of  the  Order

which provides that before any appointment is made  to

this  post  then  the  advice of  the  Public  Service

Commission has to be referred to the internal Security

Council  which then has the right to refer the  advice

back once for reconsideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Secretary of State on this

application was given in May 1958, and I would like to

make  it  clear that the Secretary of State's decision

in  this matter was made on the recommendation of  the

Governor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Council of Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> The Governor - not the local Government. If

I  may  revert for a moment to the general  principles

embodied  in  this application, I would  also  mention

that   I  am  advised  that  this  section  has   been

incorporated  in  similar  legislation  in  all  other

territories   at   the   time   of   their   achieving

independence  or  self-government,  namely,   in   the

Federation,  in India, in Pakistan, in  Ghana  and  in

Nigeria.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now, Sir, to the personal decision of the

officer  to  retire  and  to  take  advantage  of  the

privilege  he  had  been  accorded  in  reply  to  his

application,  I can only say I regret that  he  should

have  decided  to  retire, but I must  make  it  quite

clear,  in  fairness to him, that he had  a  perfectly

legal  right to do so and, in this matter, he is  only

exercising that legal right as an entitled officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in reply to the question yesterday,

the  compensation to which he is entitled for loss  of

career  is  not in fact calculated on the  appointment

which  he  fills  at the present time as  Director  of

Special Branch, but on the previous rank held  by  him

before   his  promotion,  and  the  sum  involved   is

approximately $75,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard, Sir, to the wording of the motion that he

was  an  officer  who  had been offered  and  accepted

promotion  as  a result of Malayanisation,  it  is,  I

think,  difficult  to  say exactly  when  a  promotion

results from Malayanisation or when it does not. If it

is  to an appointment which, as a result of the policy

laid  down  in  the White Paper on Malayanisation  and

accepted by this House, is laid down as a post  to  be

Malayanised  within  a limited period  of  time,  then

there  is  clearly no argument in the matter,  but  in

this  particular appointment the post is not  in  fact

due  for Malayanisation under the policy laid down  in

the  White  Paper for a period of six years  from  the

time the Paper was tabled and the decision taken. That

is  on the narrow definition. On the broad definition,

it  is  of  course perfectly true that certain  senior

officers   have  retired  since  the   date   of   the

Malayanisation  Paper and consequently vacancies  have

occurred  in the higher ranks and officers  have  been

appointed thereto on promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only say, in conclusion, that I welcome the

remarks  made by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  in

opening his speech on this motion, and I am sure  that

the  civil  service as a whole will respond  to  their

responsibilities under the new Government; and I  hope

that  all  parties, and in particular the party  which

will  hold  office,  will  always  subscribe  to   the

principle that the civil service should be neutralised

from politics, that for acts done in good faith and in

an   official   capacity,  there  should   always   be

ministerial  protection;  that  in  matters  affecting

them, the approach by the Government should always  be

objective  and  not subjective; and  finally,  in  any

issue  in which disciplinary action is involved,  that

the  matter  should  be dealt with by  an  independent

tribunal,  as  is indeed provided by the existence  of

the Public Service Commission.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped

that this motion would be debated impersonally, but  I

must  admit that this is most difficult as the  motion

would  never  have  arisen had it  not  been  for  the

defection,  if I may say so, of the officer concerned.

I support the sentiments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>



expressed in the motion on the ground that it is

a principle to which the Government should subscribe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayanisation of the public service was a policy

which my Government had pressed vigorously. Our reason

was to ensure that Ministers would have local men with

local sympathies and the requisite local knowledge and

experience to advise them and to ensure the  execution

of the Government's policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, Malayanisation has benefited a good

number  of  local officers and, in certain  instances,

Ministries  have  had to make-do with available  local

talent.  That local officers should take advantage  of

this national move is to be deplored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying, Sir, not to touch on personalities and I

wish  to  speak  on general principles  affecting  the

public  service. The civil service has a tradition  of

impartiality,  loyalty and service, and no  Government

in  its  right  senses will want to  sweep  away  this

tradition.  It  is  a good tradition.  But  the  civil

service  must realise that they do not exist  for  the

purpose  of  maintaining a tradition. They  must  make

sacrifices and contribute strenuously to justify  this

tradition   and  to  ensure  that  they   so   conduct

themselves  that all Parties who subscribe  to  it - the

people,   the   Government  and  the   civil   service

themselves - respect it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to have a civil service taking advantage of

the  times  and the moods, we shall be left without  a

public service, and only an empty shell of a tradition

will  mark  the  passing  of a  body  from  which  the

Government  and  the people have  a  right  to  expect

service and sacrifice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service has seen many changes since the

introduction  of  the  Rendel  Constitution.  It   has

adapted itself to these changes creditably. There have

been  new  and  heavy strains and  stresses,  but  the

machinery as a whole has withstood these. I would like

accordingly to pay tribute to the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service has a place and a part to play in

the  changes and challenges awaiting us under the  new

Constitution.  I would not like to see this  machinery

impaired  and  it  is the duty of this  Government  to

ensure that this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>



vital  machinery  is  handed  over  intact,  in   good

condition  and ready to continue to serve the  people,

whatever Government may come into power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I will defend that tradition, I cannot defend

defection  on the part of any officer, and an  officer

who  sees fit under the circumstances facing us  today

to  quit  the  service other than on grounds  of  ill-health  or  old  age  or other legitimate  grounds  is

failing  in his duty to the Government and the  people

and damaging the tradition of the service to which  he

belongs. Respect for that service cannot be maintained

if  those who are responsible for it, by their actions

disregard it and bring it into disrepute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new constitution has provided safeguards to

ensure the independence of the public service and  has

set   up  machinery  to  maintain  its  integrity  and

impartiality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service owes its being to the public and

its first duty is to serve the public through the duly

constituted  Government returned  by  the  people.  An

inadequate  public  service will  make  an  inadequate

Government rendering inadequate service to the  public

and common sense dictates that no Government will want

this to happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said all these things, I cannot help but

share  the  grave concern of the public  service  over

what has been happening in the City Council since  the

P.A.P. took over control. Much damage has been done  to

the  morale  of  the City Council employees,  but  the

public  service  need  not be unduly  alarmed  because

there  is  adequate  protection afforded  in  the  new

Constitution and this protection cannot be taken  away

without  constitutional changes.  In  a  parliamentary

democracy, they are not completely helpless. While  it

is true that as civil servants they should steer clear

of  political  activities, as citizens they  have  the

right to exercise their votes freely and in their best

interests. Surely, they and their families  and  their

families' families constitute a good percentage of the

electorate. Surely they and their families  and  their

families' families will not be so foolish as  to  cast

their  votes  to  bring into power a Government  whose

policy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>



is going to be detrimental to their security and their

wellbeing.  Their fate is in their hands. They  should

bestir themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked several questions by the hon. mover

of  the  motion. He asked me what advice the Singapore

Government tendered to the Secretary of State. I would

like  to  tell him, Sir, that I was not aware of  this

officer's  intention to resign from the service  under

the   particular   section  in  this  Ordinance   - the

Retirement   from  the  Public  Service   Compensation

Ordinance, 1956 - until sometime in November.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just informed that this officer had sent in

notice  of his retirement. I was indeed flabbergasted.

I  tried to do what I could to persuade; to see to  it

that such a situation did not arise which, in my view,

would embarrass this Government. It has happened.  The

hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar said that he warned  me

that  he would make this a political issue. I know  he

will  make it a political issue and I know that I have

been  embarrassed, but I must say it here and now that

I   have  nothing  to  do  with  it  apart  from  this

particular  Ordinance, to which I made reference  just

now.  In  this  Ordinance there is  a  section - section

18 - which   gives  an  officer  the   right   to   make

representations to the Secretary of State, and  it  is

for  the Secretary of State to consider whether or not

such  an  officer  is  entitled  to  come  under  this

Compensation  Ordinance. I have  nothing  to  do  with

approval or advice in regard to this matter. In  fact,

as  I  said, I was flabbergasted and I was against  it

because,  according  to my way of thinking,  to  allow

such  an  officer to retire at a time when the  danger

imagined has not happened is to indicate to the public

that  such  a  danger  cannot be avoided.  Surely  the

people of Singapore have not been so mesmerized or  so

frightened or so intimidated that they will  not  wake

up  to the danger that faces them, that they will  not

unite  and  avoid this evil that they fear  is  coming

into their midst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This officer, Sir, just takes advantage of this

particular section and I must say that I do agree,  as

I said earlier, with the hon, mover of the motion that

such an advantage should not have been taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>



of  at  this time, particularly when there is  already

sufficient protection written into the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at a future date when a future Government is in

power  and that future Government is conducting itself

in  the  same manner as we see from the antics in  the

City  Council today, surely such an officer  can  make

representations to the Secretary of State that such an

eventuality  has  arisen and that he seeks  protection

under section 18 of this particular Ordinance. But  to

seek  protection  now and to retire  now  before  that

eventuality  has  arisen is one  that  I  considerably

deplore. Here again, Sir, the hon. Member for  Tanjong

Pagar,  in  moving  his motion,  issues  warnings  and

threats. He says that the P.A.P. will see to  it  that

whatever  expense  the  Government  has  incurred   in

sending  this officer overseas for training  shall  be

deducted from whatever compensation he is to receive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the public service is very sensitive to

utterances of this kind. If we want the public service

to  serve the country well, it is up to us to see that

they  are not unnecessarily threatened or intimidated.

They  have to be instructed no doubt to do their duty,

and  I  am sure the civil service know their duty  and

will  do their duty to the best of their ability.  But

to  be  threatened with dire consequences as the  poor

City Council employees have been facing since 1957  is

not going to help to build up the morale of the public

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member in passing mentioned that there are

two  members of the civil service who retired from the

civil  service without compensation because  they  are

going  into the political arena. It is true they could

not  retire with compensation because the Compensation

Ordinance does not allow them to take advantage of it.

But  one  must  not forget that they were  allowed  to

retire  with their pension rights protected. One  must

not  also  forget that the Government does not  demand

back  the expense that had been spent on one  of  them

for  his training. The Government does not demand that

such expenses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>



should be deducted from whatever pension he has

and  will  be receiving. We do not go out  doing  such

things.  If we feel a thing is right, we allow  it  to

take  its course. We do not allow ourselves to  be  so

stirred by emotion as to shout threats or intimidation

and  such other evil things against the civil  service

which  is  dedicated to the service of the  people  of

this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. mover of the motion says that it is because

of  this weak and vacillating Government that  such  a

situation  has been allowed to happen. Sir,  had  this

Government been weak and vacillating, the hon.  Member

for Tanjong Pagar and his two colleagues would not  be

sitting on that side of the House this very minute. It

is   because   this  Government  is   not   weak   and

vacillating,  because it is strong in its  service  to

this  country,  that subversives were  taken  away  to

allow them to breathe the air of democratic freedom.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In reply. I cannot believe that the

Chief  Minister intended to incite the  civil  service

into  disobedience, but I would ask the civil service,

since  the  Chief Minister was ill-advised  enough  to

tell  them how they can oppose the P.A.P., to remember

this.  Keep your politics and your personal views  out

of  your  service.  If you take the  Chief  Minister's

advice  and try to down the Government because you  do

not  agree  with  it,  then that Government  will  not

tolerate  it.  Take the advice of the  Opposition:  Do

your  duty because that is right; do not try to  'fix'

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has been said about the City Council. Let me

say  this: In so far as an officer does his  duty,  we

will  be  the  first  to  cheer  him,  because  nobody

understands   the   necessity  of   having   effective

instruments of policy so well as the P.A.P. We are the

people who have a political organisation and know  the

meaning of that word "organisation"

- the necessity to build a machine over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>



and above the individual, and the necessity to get your cadres.

Whether they be in the civil service or the party organisation,

we cheer a man when he works hard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One speaker mentioned Mr Marcus. I did not want to bring up City Council matters

in this Chamber. Mr Marcus was a good officer. For that reason, he was promoted and

we cheered him. But Mr Marcus mistook his loyalty to

his brother, as his duty to the people. When he did that, he went against the primary

principle to which we subscribe - service first and service last, and your brothers

and your relatives do not count. That is basic and fundamental. If Members in this House would like to

know, Mr Marcus also happen to be a brother-in-law of a Central Committee member of the People's Action

Party, but we do what is right by the public, not by our friends and our relatives. He was promoted not because

he was a relative of this Member. When he defended his brother, although his brother was in the

wrong, he was brushed aside. I told the civil servant who is in charge of the Establishment Section

quite frankly that that is the policy of the Party and that he had nothing to fear, whatever

his personal views were. But if he was asked to execute policy and he allowed his personal considerations

to prevent him from executing that policy, then he must be prepared to fight the Party - and no civil servant

is in a position to do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, Sir, on a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Minister for Commerce and Industry will have plenty of time later on.

He has had four years working with the civil service,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>



but I know more about how he runs his Ministry than he does himself.

His Permanent Secretary is my colleague.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Chief Minister did the civil service harm by trying to bring

them into the political arena and inciting their families to 'fix' a P.A.P

Government. I say this. Whatever you do or you do not do, remember this - that

the civil servant has only his career at stake. When we enter the  political

arena - unless we do it for half a million dollars at a time and vanish with it - our lives are

at stake. When my colleagues' lives and my life are at stake, I say this: I will brook no

nonsense from my quarter, not from the Chief Minister or any Government. He said that these

things were done without his knowledge. What kind of a Government is his? He is responsible

for this. He advises the Secretary of State. His Government does it and it is his business to see

that the Governor gives the right advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister is a wily and able politician, unlike the nominated Member,

Mr R. C. H. Lim. He knew that it was political suicide to try and defend this officer.

Mr R. C. H. Lim wanted to defend him, not the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister joined me in deploring

this act which is worse than defection. When Dr Otto John hopped from West Germany to East Germany, he defected.

When he hopped back from East Germany to West Germany, he also defected, but there were deep

political complications and emotional implications. But when this officer says,"Give me $75,000.

I am going into private practice. What is more, I am going to take my five months' leave with full

pay and I will sit in Chambers as a lawyer while awaiting admission to the local Bar. Then

I am going to make money" I say that is not defection. It is a sell-out. I am not threatening any

civil servant. In fact, I went out of my way at the outset to state the Party policy on the civil service

generally. But I say to this officer, if he believed that the P.A.P. was going to do him in,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>



then either he must have a very guilty conscience, something which he has done which he would

not like us to know about, or he has not got the courage of his convictions to step out and fight the

P.A.P. on the S.P.A. ticket. If he does that, we will pay him his pension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say this quite frankly, particularly to the English Press. They may have gone out of their way to give

the English-educated, particularly the civil servants, the fright of their lives. Changes are going to come within

the next few months, and they are necessary and vital if we are to survive and not collapse. If the

English-educated knew what the problem were, they would be the first to cheer us, because we are making it

possible for the system to survive and not collapse. If you get Ministers who resign on the eve  of a big

debate on an enquiry into their financial affairs and they are referred to as the democratic forces, setting an

example to the civil servants, then I say that the whole system will collapse. Anybody and everybody will

grab half a million dollars at a time and flee the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this of the Director of the Special Branch. He says that he is anxious. I should have thought that with

12 years of special training in that job he should have nerves of steel! Anxiety! If he had felt

anxious, he should have seen a doctor and got a couple of tranquillizers that would put his nerves right!

There were no grounds for anxiety whatsoever. If he felt there were, it was because he had no confidence

whatsoever in the Labour Front Government at the time when he resigned in November-it might have been

the Labour Front, it might have been the S.P.A. On the general principle, I do not think anybody has

got the courage to disagree. As regards this particular officer, I say that we are not going to leave the matter

there, because it is an absolute scandal that he should have been allowed to go back to finish his legal training

at public expense and then come and say,"Well,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>



I am anxious about my future." Nothing is a better tranquillizer than $75,000 in the kitty! It is disgusting,

an utter disgrace to the whole police force and the public service, and I would like the House to know that

if he were here to defend himself, he would shrivel for shame. It is a lucky thing that he does not have to be

in this House, and he ought to be thoroughly ashamed of himself.

<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly expresses its sympathy with the

victims  of the Kampong Tiong Bahru fire and  deplores

the  electioneering propaganda at the scene and in the

vicinity of the fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of a fire in Kampong Tiong Bahru on

13th  February, 1959, over 5,000 or 6,000 people  were

rendered  homeless. We have read in  the  papers  that

these  unfortunate people lost practically  everything

they  owned.  They  lost  their  household  goods  and

personal  effects, their furniture, their poultry  and

livestock.  These people are now undergoing  hardships

and  worried  about their future and the  question  of

their food.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these problems would not have come about if the

P.A.P. in  the  City Council had  kept  its  election

pledge  to  look after the interests of the people  of

Singapore, in this case the people in Tiong  Bahru.  A

large part of the area was razed to the ground, due to

lack  of  water  available for the use  of  the  fire-engines.  The attap dwellers in this area looked  with

despair  at their burning huts, while the firemen  and

voluntary  firefighters  were  unable  to  save   them

because  of lack of water. I say the P.A.P. dominated

City Council is responsible, because we have time  and

time again approached the City Council asking them  to

put up standpipes in the area. We have also asked them

to  replace the small main waterpipes with big  pipes.

And  even the supply of water, at low pressure, in the

kampong  was  blocked on many occasions  by  the  City

Council.  The  Liberal-Socialist City Councillor,  Mr

Lee  Bah  Chee, and myself brought up the matter,  and

the  reply  given  was  that it would  cost  the  City

Council a lot of money to replace the old pipes. I  am

really  surprised,  Sir, that the City  Council  could

afford  to  spend  over $105,000 on its  Anti-Spitting

Campaign, and that the Mayor, upon his election, asked

for over $7,000 a month in salary and allowances. Yet,

Sir, they replied that they were unable to replace the

pipes  because of lack of money. They did not  realise

that  this  main pipe supplies water to thousands  and

thousands of residents in that area where the big fire

started.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have not only failed in their duty to

serve  the  people of Singapore, but  they  have  also

tried  to cash in on the misery of these people.  With

your  permission,  Sir, I wish  to  quote  the  second

paragraph of the paper, The Malayan Undergrad:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Residents from the nearby King Edward VII Medical

Hostel rushed to the scene of the fire to render  aid.

They  did all they could, but unfortunately supporters

of  the  People's  Action Party wanted  them  to  wear

armbands bearing their Party symbol."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cashing in on the misery of these people who have

lost everything, P.A.P. supporters converted a coffee-shop, which was only 150 yards away from the scene  of

the fire, into a centre of registration and collection

of  cash. The medical students, anxious to render  aid

to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>



fire victims, were taken in by the pseudo, volunteers.

These  students,  all innocent and anxious  to  render

aid,  did voluntary work in registering the poor  fire

victims. I went to the coffee-shop and recognized some

of   these  pseudo-volunteers  as  supporters  of  the

People's  Action  Party. I spoke to  a  few  of  these

pseudo-volunteers myself, and I am convinced that they

are,  in  actual  fact, supporters or members  of  the

People's Action Party. After my argument with some  of

them  there, the students believed it was true because

one of them rushed in and took out a bunch of armbands

and asked them to put them on. While this argument was

going  on  in  front of the coffee-shop,  the  pseudo-volunteers  planted  a huge flag  bearing  the  P.A.P.

emblem,  and political speeches were made through  the

loud-speakers  which  they had installed.  They  said,

"The P.A.P. is the only Party in Singapore which comes

to the aid of those unfortunate. The Government is not

doing anything. No political Party is doing anything."

They   condemned  other  political  Parties  and   put

questions  through the loud-speakers, "Where  are  the

other political Parties who profess that they serve or

are  working  in  the  interests  of  the  people   of

Singapore?" But they forgot, Sir, that I was there  on

the  spot!  I was there right up to 3 a.m. on  Friday,

13th  February, 1959. Such propaganda! Sir,  the  fire

provided a golden opportunity for the P.A.P. to  tell

such  lies to the people. In my opinion, such speeches

delivered  by  supporters of the P.A.P. attacking  the

activities    of   other   political   Parties    were

unjustified, particularly on such a sad day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to mention the

hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar's statement  about  Mr

Marcus, the Hawker Superintendent in the City Council.

It  is  because  his elder brother, the C.A.O.  (Chief

Administrative  Officer), also of  the  City  Council,

tried  to protect him, and that is why he, the C.A.O.,

cannot remain true to the P.A.P. The truth is that  in

the same area of Kampong Tiong Bahru, that is, Kampong

Silat,  there  is a very big group of hawkers.  Orders

were given by the Mayor himself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>



to arrest these hawkers in that kampong. And I was the

one who went to see the Mayor-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether the

hawkers were victims of the Kampong Tiong Bahru  fire!

If they were not, then I am afraid the hon. Member has

strayed very far from his motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> What I wish to say is that I want to

prove  that  the P.A.P. are telling lies! Because  the

Mayor issued instructions to arrest these hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I then reported the incident at the scene of the

fire to the Assistant Commissioner of Police at King's

Theatre,  only  a short distance from the  coffee-shop

mentioned.  I  regret  to say  that  he  seemed  quite

incapable of dealing competently with these offenders.

Here   we   have   people  committing  offences   like



collecting  money  without a permit, making  political

speeches  at the scene of the fire without  a  permit,

and yet the Assistant Commissioner of Police could not

do  anything. He only sent an Inspector to  check  and

that  Inspector, I am sorry to say, went out to  check

but  did  not return. The whole thing went on for  two

and a half hours. The least the Assistant Commissioner

of  Police  could do was to instruct his  officers  to

take  down the names and addresses of these offenders.

I am quite sure that if they did so on that day, these

pseudo-volunteers would disperse.  I  could  tell  you

they  would  run away with their tails  between  their

legs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion, as I said, has caused many people

to  be  homeless, and I would like the  Government  to

reply to this.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Just on a point of clarification. The

Speaker  is rather puzzled. The hon. Member  has  said

that the motion has caused people to be homeless!



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I am trying to say that I have moved

this  motion because I feel that it is my duty, as  an

elected representative of Tiong Bahru, to bring  these

facts to the Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some questions I would like to put to the

Government. First, there are quite a number of  people

who  owned  houses  in the kampong and  who  had  lost

everything  in  the fire. I wonder whether  Government

could   compensate   these  people.   In   Queenstown,

Government intends building many multi-storey flats as

compensation  to  the squatters or  attap-dwellers  in

Queenstown.  Similarly in this case, I would  like  to

ask  the  Chief Minister whether Government will  give

compensation,  particularly to those people  who  grow

food,  the farmers - give them land and cash  for  what

they  have  lost  in the fire. And as  the  Government

intend building multi-storey flats, it is my hope that

they will compensate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the few huts which were partly burnt by the

fire  or  their planked walls damaged by fire-fighters

when they were making fire lanes. These squatters were

not  given  any aid by the Social Welfare  or  by  the

Council for Social Services. Will Government see to it

that  these  people  who  need urgent  assistance  are

attended to?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, in the case of people who owned shops

in  this  kampong: when the S.I.T. flats are built  in

that area, will these people be given priority to  own

shops in these multi-storey buildings?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I am convinced, Sir, that Government will not

be  able  to complete those multi-storey buildings  on

the  site  of  the fire within three  months,  but  as

Government  are  so  generous  in  giving  them  three

month's occupation of the Kallang flats without  rent,

light  and water, I suggest that Government give  them

six   months   to   stay  without   rent,   light   or

water - [Laughter] - that is, until the huts-



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Government intend to

give  them  occupation of the flats without rent,  but

with light and water!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Now, I would also like to bring to

the  attention of the Government that on the  site  of

the fire were many graves. Should the Government build

flats on that site, will they inform the relatives  of

those   buried  there  before  the  bulldozers   begin

demolishing  or trying to demolish those  partly-burnt

huts, trees, and so on?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, as the Chief Minister has said, I

would  also like, as an elected representative of  the

people  in  Tiong  Bahru, to  express  my  thanks  and

appreciation for the help and consideration  given  by

the  various  voluntary organizations, donations  from

the  United Kingdom Government, the Government of  the

Federation of Malaya, the Government of North  Borneo,

the  Chairman of the Council of Social Services,  Dato

Lee  Kong Chian and his colleagues, the Social Welfare

Department, the British Red Cross Society, members  of

the Civil Defence Corps, and the Singapore Improvement

Trust.  These people worked day and night. I saw  them

working  with my own eyes. Some of them went on  right

up  till  the  next  morning to complete  the  job  of

evacuating those fire victims who were staying in  Kim

Seng  Road to the Kallang area. I also wish to express

my appreciation to the members of the general public.



<br><br>3.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, considering the

contents  of the motion itself, and being  an  elected

representative of a neighbouring Division, I  rise  to

second the motion, at the same time reserving my right

to speak at a later stage, if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member

for  Tiong Bahru has asked for certain assurances from

the  Government. He has raised many points, and I  can

assure him that all the points that he has raised will

be  duly  considered.  In fact, I  will  instruct  the

Social  Welfare Department, at the latest by  tomorrow

morning, as to the points



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>



he  has  raised, and to see what can be done to assist

the  fire victims. I must, of course, say that  it  is

not  possible  for  the Government to  grant  adequate

relief  to  those  fire victims who  have  lost  their

shops,  those  shopkeepers who  have  lost  all  their

merchandise, or the farmers who have lost their crops.

But  as far as accommodation and household effects are

concerned, they will be properly looked after.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I have no intention of joining

in banging the gong over the Kampong Tiong Bahru fire.

But  I  thought  there was one thing  that  the  Chief

Minister  said yesterday which we should  correct  for

the  sake  of the record. He deplored that  fact  that

people went about and did acts of charity and kindness

in  order  that pictures could be taken and published.

He  particularly  expressed  his  displeasure  at  the

suggestion in our Petir editorial that he went down to

Kampong  Tiong  Bahru, became an amateur fire-fighter,

and,  as expected, it appeared in the papers next day.

He  vehemently  protested that it was not  his  desire

that this should be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two copies of two Party organs. The

People's  Alliance have just started to  print  theirs

copying  the  format  of the People's  Action  Party's

Petir.  He might be interested to know that a  picture

showing  him  with trousers rolled up and  carrying  a

bucket  of  water, appears on the front  page  of  the

People's Alliance organ.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the date?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The 24th of February, Sir, I think

it  was at the first mass rally they were compelled to

hold  after we got started on our third. He might also

be  interested  to know that, despite his  allegations

that we went about with photographers, we did not have

pictures  of the fire in our issue of our Petir  after

the  fire.  In  fact,  we were kind  enough,  when  we

published  the debate, not only to publish a  copy  of

the Mayor's but also a copy of Mr Tang Peng Yeu's for

the  people's  delectation. Sir,  at  the  time  these

respective Party tracts were issued, I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>



think  anybody expected the Member for Tiong Bahru  to

try and redeem his position somehow by moving a motion

in  this  House about the fire. These two  papers  are

irrefutable proof of the basic attitudes  of  the  two

Parties.



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar, I did not intend to take part,  as

he  said, in beating the gong on this motion, because,

when  seconding the motion, I said I reserved my right

to  speak at a later stage, if necessary. But for  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar to come now and tell us  that

the  Member  for  Tiong  Bahru  deplored  the  act  of

kindness  shown  by the people is, I  think,  entirely

groundless.  It  is not because the Member  for  Tiong

Bahru wants to deplore the act of kindness. It is  not

just because you want publicity for your own Party  or

for  yourself  that you go there to  do  your  act  of

kindness. It is a humanitarian act for the victims who

were  caught in the fire. It is by this way  that  you

should prove your act of kindness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point he raised was that of the S.P.A.

paper,  which  showed a picture of the Chief  Minister

with  rolled  up trousers, and called him  an  amateur

fireman.  Sir, it is out of the kindness of his  heart

and  his sense of duty that the Chief Minister thought

of  the  plight  of  the  victims,  and  therefore  he

volunteered  his services by holding a hose  to  fight

the fire.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The proof is in the picture!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Unfortunately the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar himself was not there to  put  out  the

fire!  If  he had been there, he would have  witnessed

with  his own eyes that the Chief Minister held a hose

to  fight the fire - not like the P.A.P. or the Mayor of

Singapore  who  brought along with them  photographers

and a fire-engine. Is that what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>



he  called an act of kindness? I cannot believe it. It

is  just  because  he  hoped  against  hope  that  the

newspapers  would publish on the front page  the  next

day  a picture of the Mayor directing the fire-engine.

And   he  hoped  his  own  photographers,  should  the

newspapers fail to print the picture, would bring that

picture to the Press for publication. He claims in his

Petir  that  there is no publicity of any  picture  at

all.  It  is because the P.A.P. has got no courage  to

print  any picture of the actual act or the  good  act

they  have done. It is because the Petir has  not  got

the courage to show that the Mayor himself went to the

scene  of  the  fire  with  the  fire-engine  and  the

photographers. That was the reason why the Member  for

Tiong Bahru has brought up this motion today. I really

cannot  understand  why,  when  there  is  plight  and

misery,  when  the  residents of the attap-houses  are

subject  to hardships by the fire, and have  lost  all

their  belongings,  the People's Action  Party  should

exploit  the  situation  by  going  there  and  making

election  speeches. Although Nomination  Day  has  not

come  yet,  we are still allowed to make our  election

speeches  and  election  campaigns,  but  not  at  the

expense of the fire victims. The People's Action Party

held  a  mass  rally at Jalan Kayu; so  also  had  the

People's  Alliance,  but not at  the  expense  of  the

misery  of  the public. To have election campaigns  at

the expense of the fire victims and to exploit them is

beyond expression. Shame!



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, in moving his motion the hon. Member

for  Tiong  Bahru did suggest that the Police  had  in

some  way  shown a dereliction of their duty  on  this

occasion. He had not informed me that he was going  to

raise the point, so I am not in a position to say that

I  have  investigated it fully. But my information  at

present with regard to the collection of funds at  the

scene  of  the fire was that there were  a  number  of

persons  who,  no  doubt with the best  motives,  were

seeking  to collect relief funds on the spot. But  the

Police  did draw their attention to the fact  that  it

was unlawful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>



to  do  so  without a permit, and when their attention

was drawn to the fact, they then ceased to do it.



<br><br>3.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am only an

Opposition Member, and I do not have all the  power  I

wish  to  have  in  order to be  able  to  help  these

unfortunate people. I am only trying to do my best  to

help these fire victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Hon. the Chief Secretary, I would say

that  after  this incident, I had a conversation  with

the  Commissioner of Police, and I placed  before  him

all  the  facts  of what happened in the  coffee-shop.

Furthermore, the conversation was held in the presence

of the Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of collection of money by voluntary

people  or  organisations, is it not the duty  of  the

authorities - they have an Ordinance regulating house-to-house  and street-to-street collections - to stop  these

people,  and, if possible, to take down the names  and

addresses  of  these people? Is it not true  that  the

Police  can stop them? We have known students  of  Kai

Kok  Public School and Chong Teck School - they are good

people - who, having been instigated by members  of  the

other  political Parties, went about collecting  money

all  over  the  area of Tiong Bahru.  Why  cannot  the

Police stop them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About electioneering propaganda. The Chief Minister

said  yesterday that even on the day of the  fire  the

P.A.P., by their propaganda machine, was accusing  the

Government  of  being responsible for  the  fire.  All

sensible  people  know that it is untrue.  What  I  am

really   concerned  about  are  the  so-called  pseudo

volunteers   who  worked  under  cover  as   volunteer

workers. They said they wanted to help the people, but

in actual fact they were members of a political Party,

and  were trying to cash in on the misery of the  fire

victims  and  on the misery of those people  who  lost

everything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance, this point. They carried out

registration  work  in  a coffeeshops.  That  was  not

necessary. Government has two registration centres - one

in the Seng Poh Road Chinese School



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>



and  one in Tiong Bahru School. I am glad to say  that

when  I approached the Hon. the Chief Minister to  set

up another centre at Tiong Bahru School, which is only

100  yards  from  the scene of the  fire,  he  agreed.

Moreover,   at  the  same  time,  the  Department   of

Information  Services  van  went  round  the  kampongs

informing  the  people  that  registration  would   be

carried on at these two centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly expresses its sympathy with the

victims  of the Kampong Tiong Bahru fire and  deplores

the  electioneering propaganda at the scene and in the

vicinity of the fire.

<div align="center"><b>INVESTIGATIONS INTO BANK ACCOUNT OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MR CHEW SWEE KEE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Commission of Inquiry)</b></div>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it is not often in the last two years that we have had

drama enacted in this Assembly. I had looked forward

to this afternoon. I had eagerly awaited the big

surprise that was to come when the Minister for

Education was confronted with the truth. I had

seriously prepared my brief for the last two weeks.

Unfortunately, Sir, when the accused was to be brought

to trial, he jumped bail and absconded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not my purpose to prosecute Mr Chew. I

have never, nor has my Chairman ever, accused him of a

criminal act in respect of the half a million dollars.

I  think  it salutary if we first trace the beginnings

of  this  issue  as  a  result  of  which  one  Acting

Comptroller of Income Tax had a heart attack and  died

on a Monday, one Minister has resigned, and I am told,

there   is  every  possibility  that  the  substantive

Comptroller  of Income Tax may never return  from  his

leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us begin from the beginning - the 15th of

February. I would like to preface my remarks by saying

this -  that I do not think, in view of what  the  Hon.

Mr  Chew has done, that there is any doubt as to  the

truth of what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>



Chairman  of  the P.A.P. stated, and a  Commission  of

Inquiry   is  completely  unnecessary  to  prove   the

allegations  that  we made. But I do  suggest  to  the

Government that, though I am no longer interested in a

Commission of Inquiry, because the truth in so far  as

we are concerned is already out, if they say that they

are  not implicated in this, then it is their business

to  clear themselves by a Commission of Inquiry or any

other means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to go back to the 15th of February, at the first

pre-election  rally of the P.A.P. at Hong  Lim  Green,

where Dr Toh Chin Chye, the Chairman, opened with  an

analysis  of  the current situation in  Singapore.  He

stated, inter alia, that "second powerful patrons  for

Tun  Lim  and  the  S.P.A. are  the  British  and  the

Americans."  Then  with regard to  the  Americans,  he

said, "But the Americans are less discreet. They  have

lots  of  money, so there is no difficulty at  all  in

giving money to those whom they hope to win and it  is

an  open secret that income tax investigation into the

half  a  million dollar account at the First  National

City  Bank  of New York in the name of a Minister  was

quickly  choked  off,  because  this  money,  being  a

political   gift,  was  not  liable  to  income   tax.

Americans are very slow in learning that those who can

be bought for money are not worth the buying."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member identify the paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, this was a speech made by the

Chairman of the P.A.P. and it has been reproduced in the

March issue of the Petir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times then carried the story on the 16th

of  February,  at page 5. On the 16th there  were  big

consultations between bank officials, the U.S. Consul-General  and  the  S.P.A. leadership.  Wishing  to  be

helpful  as  usual, the Straits Times  gave  a  banner

headline "That $500,000,000" - er -

"$500,000".  I  am  sure Mr Chew wishes  it  is  $500

million. It is much more worthwhile. "I deny  this.  A

stupid  lie!  ",  says the S.P.A. Sir,  this  is  very

interesting because I think this sparked off the whole

dispute. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>



never  accused  any  Minister  of  the  Government  of

robbing any bank or cheating anybody of $500,000.  All

we  said  was,  from  an American  source,  there  was

$500,000  in the name of a Minister of the  Government

in  the First National City Bank of New York. We  even

named  the  bank, just to be helpful, and that  income

tax investigations were started and choked off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to tell the Financial Secretary

this:  that one of the duties of the civil service  is

to  carry  out  orders, but they  have  to  be  lawful

orders. He need not answer, but if he does, he  should

give  correct  and truthful answers. I would  like  to

tell  him  this: there is very little about this  case

that we do not know about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we go back to the 17th of February - the Straits

Times. This is, I think, the biggest blunder ever made

by  a  group  of  politicians with the  help  of  bank

officials and consular staff. They went and denied the

truth.  One could laugh at truth, brush it aside,  and

pretend  that it does not exist. But to  deny  it  and

call  the other man a liar, then it becomes an  issue.

Because,  first  of  all, you confess  that  what  was

stated,  if true, was most discreditable and damaging,

and  that it was wrong; and secondly, you compel  your

opponent to force the issue. It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore People's Alliance today denied a P.A.P.

allegation  that  the Americans had  given  the  party

$500,000."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we never said they had given the S.P.A.

$500,000.  At  the time when the money  was  paid  the

S.P.A. had not been formed. It is obvious in my motion

that  investigations  into  this  account  stopped  in

September  1958. We did not say it was the  S.P.A.  We

said it was a group. It did not matter whether it  was

the S.P.A. or any other name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The U.S. Consulate-General also issued a statement

denying   that  the  U.S.  Government  had  made   any

contribution to the S.P.A. and emphasising that it was

U.S.  Government  policy  not  to  interfere  in   the

political affairs of other nations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never said it was the U.S. Government. We said it

was  from  an American source - $500,000 in an  American

bank. That is all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Newell. This is the art, popularly called in

Latin - suppressio veri suggestio falsi - you, state  the

truth  in  a  form  which does not make  it,  strictly

speaking, an untruth, but you thereby suggest  a  lie.

And Mr R. P. Newell, General Manager of the Singapore

Branch  of  the First National City Bank of New  York,

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There had been no income tax investigation

concerning an alleged $500,000 account in the bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No one from the income tax department has asked us

if there is such an account', he said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Newell added that no individual in the Singapore Government had such an account with the bank."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is a little bit foolish because Mr Chew,

as  part  of his farewell gesture before he absconded,

said  that  he did have an account at this  bank,  but

nothing  like  $500,000. I can quite believe  that  it

must  have  gone  down somewhat  since  it  was  first

credited to his name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, let us hear what Mr Wang Tsun Hao,

Secretary-General of the S.P.A., said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"The statement made by the PAP Chairman, Dr Toh

Chin Chye, that the SPA is receiving monetary aid from

bank  cornpradores and British and  Americans,  is  as

false as it is stupid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegation that the Americans had given $500,000

to the SPA is completely unfounded."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wang added: "Since the PAP is so interested in

rumours and lies, it should not ignore the rumour that

the  PAP  is receiving aid from international  sources

through a local bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also not ignore the rumour that $100,000 of

trade union funds went into the PAP treasury."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry for Mr Wang. I do not know if he was

aware  of  the truth when he issued the statement,  or

who  advised  him to issue that statement.  But  I  am

sorry to say that, because he was so ill advised as to

call the Chairman of the P.A.P. a liar, we called  for

a Commission of Inquiry. There was no crime. No act of

illegality had been committed. We have not accused the

Income Tax Department of doing something irregular. In

fact, we admit that if the money



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>



was  a  political gift, as we say it must  have  been,

then  it is not liable to income tax. But I will  come

to the business of the choking-off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary said yesterday that Mr Chew

never  saw  Mr  Holloway. I know  Mr  Chew  saw  Mr

Holloway  and  that it was recorded  in  a  file.  But

before we reach that point, may I say what happened as

a result of that denial? Dr Toh said - it was published

in the Straits Times on 18th February:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Newell, the manager of the National City Bank of

New York, said his bank was not involved in any income

tax investigations. But I said that investigations had

been initiated and were stopped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Newell said no person in the Singapore Government now has such an account. But he did not say that no

money  had ever at any time been remitted to his  bank

to   be  operated  by  a  Minister  of  the  Singapore

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Consulate-General denied the U.S. Government

paid money to the SPA. We have never alleged that  the

U.S. Government was involved."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the call for a Commission of Inquiry, just

to  establish facts. We have not suggested a crime was

committed. But since we were called liars for  telling

the  truth, then the truth should be known. When I had

to table a motion in order to have this matter brought

up  in  this Assembly, the Straits Times on  the  19th

February carried Mr Chew Swee Kee's portrait  on  the

front  page - and his famous last words, "My conscience

is clear."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asked for his comments on Mr Lee's motion, Mr Chew

Swee   Kee   told  the  Straits  Times  tonight:   'My

conscience is clear, I have nothing to fear.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost a doggerel. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There seems to be some disorder

in   the  Strangers'  Gallery.  Mr  Serjeant-at-Arms,

please attend to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> To carry on, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that he would answer the PAP motion

'personally and fully' at the Assembly meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And when I do, there may be some surprises for the

PAP,' Mr Chew said. 'I will not say anything now. The

motion is a big political stunt.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was looking forward to this big surprise which

was  going to be sprung upon us, and I prepared myself

with the necessary data in respect of this transaction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>



May I say that people who run newspapers should

be  careful before they pass judgment on the  acts  of

political leaders? For instance, the Straits Times  of

the  17th  of February in an editorial was ill-advised

to  take  sides  on this matter before they  knew  the

truth. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dr Toh laced the smear with the charge that the

Americans  have banked half a million dollars  in  the

name  of  one  of Singapore's Ministers, a  fine  tale

which  has  promptly  been  denied.  This  unsupported

charge, and the curious attack ..."



<br><br>and so on, and so on-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...a dirty beginning to the coming elections."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but the dirt does not come from us. We just

disclosed  it  to make sure that people  did  not  get

contagious germs as a result of the dirt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my duty now, briefly, to recite the facts,

because Mr Chew, as he left his duties yesterday, saw

fit to issue a statement in which he said, inter alia,

published in today's Straits Times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact the Government decided to oppose the motion

that  was  coming up for debate on March 4  and  there

was,  therefore,  no  question  of  any  fear  that  a

Commission of Inquiry would be set up."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am astounded at the audacity of this man. First of

all,  he  is  breaching the Official  Secrets  Act  by

letting  out what the Council of Ministers had decided

in privacy. Secondly, he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, since there is not going to be an inquiry on

me, therefore I leave with my conscience clear."



<br><br>Then he goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will fight the election under the S.P.A. banner."



<br><br>Presumably he will, because if he is the man that  has

the money, he calls the tune.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can now devote more time to party organisation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody knows what organisation the S.P.A. has

got  in its air-conditioned office in Victoria Street.

But not everybody knows where the money came from. But



now  we  do.  And I say quite frankly  that  there  is

nothing which I am going to state which are not  facts

and  which I cannot justify up to the hilt. I  do  not

require a Commission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>



of  Inquiry. Mr Chew's absence today is a  confession

that  he  is  guilty.  I further  suggest  this:  that

although  he  is  not guilty of any crime,  but  of  a

treacherous  political act, the fact that  he  commits

political suicide does not absolve his accomplices. It

may  prevent  his  accomplices from being  discovered,

because  he has betaken himself to another place,  but

it  does not absolve them altogether. But he did admit

this - and  this  appears in the Singapore  Standard  of

today's date, 4th March, page four:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asked whether it was true that he had had an account

with the National City Bank, Mr Chew said it was."



<br><br>Well, well, why did the manager say "No"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the facts are there. First, for the benefit of

the Financial Secretary, we will just tell him that we

have  got all the cards on the table. Mr Chew's  file

is  G.S. 47909. As a former Government servant, he has

the  cipher "G.S.". Investigations were commenced into

this account in September 1958. Mr Chew went and  saw

Mr   Holloway.   There  was  some   explanation   and

investigations  were lifted from their normal  course.

We are not suggesting that it was wrong that no income

tax  was  to  be imposed. We admit that if  it  was  a

political gift, there should be no income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that Mr Chew paid out of this account a

sum  of  $30,000 to Mr Liu Yi Chih, former proprietor

of  the Ih Shih Press, and with this money Mr Liu  Yi

Chih  said he bought a house at No. 12, Worthing Road,

Serangoon Garden Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I could go into further details which do not

really  concern  Mr  Chew but  will  corroborate  the

general  facts that we have got. What was  this  money

for?  Well, that is not our business. Whatever he  and

his  caucus  wanted to do with it was their  business.

But we say two sources can be checked with great ease:

foreign  exchange  control  and  income  tax.  Foreign

Exchange  Control  will show the transaction  in  U.S.

dollars  - about  $150,000 (gold) - and Income  Tax  will

show when investigations were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>



commenced;  when  they  were taken  away  from  normal

channels;  when  Mr Chew met Mr Holloway;  and  when

investigations were stopped because the Comptroller of

Income  Tax  was satisfied that it was not  liable  to

income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am stating another fact openly and publicly

because  I do not think that there is anything  to  be

gained by suppressing it, and I have the permission of

the  hon. Mr Francis Thomas, to do so. Mr Chew  told

Mr  Thomas  at the end of 1957 that he  got  $100,000

U.S. gold for the Party. Mr Thomas is here to answer,

if  I  am  accused  of  telling  a  lie.  I  have  his

permission to state this also. Mr Chew is  not  here.

We  shall  hear what he has to say from the wilderness

to  which he has betaken himself. I say that that U.S.

$100,000 gold was given to Mr Chew Swee Kee  in  1957

for  the  purposes, inter alia, of  the  City  Council

elections;  and  in  the same way over  U.S.  $150,000

gold,  amounting to M$500,000 was given some  time  in

1958  for  the  same  political  purposes.  These  are

irrefutable  facts.  I do not see  why  the  Singapore

People's Alliance got hot under the collar about this.

We  never  said  it  was  for the  Sinapore  People's

Alliance.  It was not formed yet. At that  time,  they

were  collecting  all the chickens into  the  nest  to

field  them as prospective candidates. Members of  the

Liberal-Socialist  Party were  being  inveigled  over.

There  was  money  for  jam.  Everybody  was  to   get

something. The name does not matter. It might  be  the

People's Alliance; it might be the Donkeys' Parade. It

might be anything. But the important fact is that  the

cash  was  there  and  Mr R. Jumabhoy  has  mentioned

disclosures



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Member for Telok Ayer tells me

that he has also got something on this. Sir, we do not

want  to have a Commission of Inquiry because we  know

the  truth.  The only tragedy is that  the  truth  was

denied.  If  Mr Chew or Mr Wang Tsun Hao said,  "Oh,

well, so what! Half a million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>



dollars?" Do you know what they are saying in  the

coffee-shops? The workers say the Chinese are very

good  when  they expel their saliva; they  make  a

magnificent sound to accompany it. That  is  heard

in the coffee-shops over this affair. But Mr Chew

should  hear  what the bankers say, "Five  hundred

thousand dollars, is that all? So cheap, you could

have  bought  out the whole gang for five  hundred

thousand dollars!" Why was he so silly? Sir,I do

not know. It is not my business. No crime has been

committed, but an act of political folly  of  the

highest magnitude has been perpetrated. It  is  a

matter  for the Government whether they  want  to

try  to  extr1cate themselves  from  the  act  of

indiscretion  of Mr Chew. The indiscretion  lies

not  in  the  collection of $500,000, but  in  the

folly  of  putting it in a bank in  his  name;  he

having  once  worked in the Income Tax  Department

should  know that these things can be discovered.

Sir,  I had wanted to congratulate him today  for

his  great qualities as a salesman, because if  he

could  get  $500,000 in hard cash from hard-boiled

Americans,   then  it  speaks  volumes   for   his

salesmanship, because, with his Party known to  be

bankrupt,   it  is  really  a  masterly   act   of

salesmanship which takes a lot to be excelled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the facts are there. They do

not  lie.  We  are not accustomed to being  called

liars. What we say we justify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

Commission  of Inquiry should be appointed  under

the Inquiry Commissions Ordinance or otherwise  to

investigate  and report on the facts regarding  an

account of about $500,000.00 in September 1958  in

the  First National City Bank of New York  in  the

name  of  the  Honourable Mr Chew  Swee  Kee  and

regarding  the reasons why investigations  in  the

matter  for  the purposes of Income Tax  were  not

pursued by the officers responsible in the Income

Tax Department.



<br><br>4.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the motion for  the

purpose of the debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to yesterday, my Party was duty bound to

press  for  a  Commission of  Inquiry.  Today  the

position is radically different. Mr Chew Swee Kee

has  resigned  on  the eve of  a  debate  on  his

financial  activities. The people can  draw  their

own conclusion. The obvious and correct conclusion

is  that  he is made to shoulder the whole  blame.

His friends hope, by his act of self-destruction,

that they can be spared from sharing his fate. But

the  people are not so stupid. The whole group  is

implicated.  If  they are not,  then  his  former

Ministerial  colleagues should  be  the  first  to

demand  an inquiry to clear themselves, if  they

are guilty, then no inquiry will be held. Indeed,

as  far  as we are concerned, the guilt  has  been

admitted beyond all doubt by the former  Minister

on behalf of the whole group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Party, in

the  interest  of justice, strongly supports  this

motion which has just been moved by the Member for

Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has already stated the facts. What I am

interested  in  is  this:  there  are  two  issues

involved. One is aid from the Americans in  trying

to   influence  the  elections;  the   other   is

corruption  on the Government side by  accepting

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar says-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member alleging that the Government are corrupt?

If he is, he is entirely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> What I mean to say is, in the

acceptance of $500,000.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then the hon. Member should

withdraw the word "corrupt".



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, I do withdraw it. What I

mean is the acceptance, as alleged, of $500,000

from foreigners.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is in the interest of both this Government

and  the American Government and/or its nationals

that this issue should be cleared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Asia is under-developed. Americans and

Westerners  are giving their aid  to  one  or  the

other country and thereby having an economic  hold

on  these  countries.  But  those  countries  are

independent  and it is for them to accept  it  or

not. We are still a Colony. So, is it right on the

part  of  the Americans to send money to influence

the political elections in this Colony?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been reading in the Press as to what

has   happened  to  the  $500,000.  Sir,  in  this

morning's  Straits Times - I am quoting  from  it - it

says - this is Mr Chew's statement:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I stress here that I have nothing to hide. My

resignation was purely voluntary one on my part as

I  felt  that  the good name of the  SPA  must  be

maintained."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if one is a good businessman, one should

defend  oneself,  and say that the  accusation  is

either  right  or wrong. Here, in  spite  of  this

motion  against  him,  he has  resigned  from  his

Ministership  and the Assembly,  to  escape  from

having  to  reply. This is not enough.  If  he  is

escaping from having to reply as a Minister,  then

it  is the collective responsibility of the other

Ministers  to reply. They must hold this  inquiry,

in  fairness and justice to Singapore, and to  the

Americans  as  to whether or not the  charges  are

true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, about this flush of money. I understand

from  reliable  sources that last month  Mr  Chew

Swee  Kee  bought  a house in Wilkinson  Road  for

$75,000.  There are also rumours that he  has  got

mining interests in Ipoh. Sir, when Ministers take

office, they have to declare their assets to  His

Excellency  the  Governor and we know  what  their

incomes  are. We also know that they are forbidden

to  trade, and if they do trade they must declare.

Thus,  with the limited income to meet Singapore's

high  cost of living, how much can one save? Where

does the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>



money  come  from  after three or  four  years  in

office?  Do  you  not think, Sir, that  they  must

satisfy the public's query? It is the duty of  the

Council of Ministers to disclose all these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be very interesting to say from this

side  of  the House that members of the  Liberal-Socialists at a meeting said, not once but twice,

that  one  of  the chief reasons for  leaving  the

Party was because the Party had not got money  for

elections.  Here  the S.P.A. has  got  plenty  of

money,  tons of money! This was said in the  Party

meeting, and I can bring 40 or 50 witnesses if  it

is said that my statement is childish, or if it is

challenged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, are the voters of Singapore so foolish as to

allow their votes to be bought by foreign aid,  or

by any aid? They are no fools. Instead, they would

reply  that in the coming elections, the  S.P.A.'s

candidates  would  lose their deposits.  And  not

only  this, they should elect people of  integrity

of  character  who can safeguard the interests  of

Singapore and its people. Further, Sir,  if  I  am

elected,  I would like the Government to  inquire

into   the  assets  of  those  who  are   now   in

power - liquid   assets,  movable   and   immovable

assets,  either here or overseas,  and  either  in

their names or in their relatives' names. This has

been done in other countries, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the S.P.A. presents a very sad spectacle.

They were elected on the Labour Front ticket. The

public  chose  to  elect ten  of  them.  With  the

contrivance and with the help of the nominated and

ex-officio  Members, they have governed  for  some

time.  Within  three or six months, three  of  its

members left the Party and came to our side.  That

is  a  fact - the  ex-members are  still  here.  And

later,  Sir,  the  former Chief  Minister  himself

resigned  his Chief Ministership and had to  leave

the Party.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the hon. Member would

try  and  assist the Chair and say how his remarks

are related to the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. To satisfy you, I

would  say  that it is the Government  which  has

been formed by these elected Members that is being

accused  in  this motion. Does that  satisfy  you,

Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot see any accusation

against  the  Government.  It  seems  to   be   an

accusation against the Hon. Mr Chew Swee Kee, and

the  motion  seeks  to  appoint  a  Commission  of

Inquiry  to  investigate into and  report  on  the

facts.   There  is  no  accusation   against   the

Government in this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> But I submit, Sir, that he was

a Minister, and the responsibility rests with the

Council of Ministers. If you say "No", I will not

pursue this; but what I want to say is that  as  a

political  Party  there are only  three  Ministers

left  today. One is ill, I believe, and I can  see

two  here. After all these Budget speeches and the

extravagance   of  expenditure   in   respect   of

travelling  and  entertainment and  whatnots - I  am

sorry,  I  should  not  say "whatnots" - they  have

changed  their  label  to the  "S.P.A."  The  talk

started  that they have got plenty of  money  from

British  interests and from Chinese interests.  We

told  our  friends that there will  be  plenty  of

money,  but  the voters are no fools.  The  voters

will judge the acts of the Government in power and

then  vote.  If anybody accepts money, the  people

are not going to vote for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion is moved in the interests of

justice   and  it  is  the  duty  of  the  present

Government  to  clear  up  these  accusations   by

holding a Commission of Inquiry. Sir, I would like

to  move an amendment to make it complete, but may

I  have your guidance whether I can move it now or

after the Government's reply?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member is now speaking on

the  original motion, and if he wishes to move  an

amendment, he must do so now because he  will  not

be able to speak again.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, since you want me to do so

now,  I will, but the amendment will be discussed

and  not  the  original motion. Sir,  I  move  my

amendment,

movable and immovable held in Singapore or outside

of Singapore in the name of the Chief Minister,

Ministers, Assistant Ministers, or their

relatives."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I in order, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have it in writing first,

before I rule?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member seeks to move an

amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, to add-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", and to inquire into the

assets both movable and immovable held in Singapore or outside

of  Singapore  in the name of the Chief  Minister,

Ministers,   Assistant   Ministers,    or    their

relatives."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member, I take it, is aware of Standing

Order  25 - possibly he has more experience of these

Standing Orders than I have - which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When any motion is under consideration in the

Assembly  or in a Committee thereof, an  amendment

may  be  proposed to the motion if it is  relevant

thereto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, that amendment is completely

irrelevant  to  the main motion, and  therefore  I

over-rule it.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, since you over-rule it, I

will  take a chance to move a motion, if possible,

at  the  next Assembly sitting on the 18th March.

In  the interests of Singapore, the investigations

should  be disclosed so that the people will  know

what  is actually going on; how the administration

has been going on for three and a half years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would ask non-Singapore citizens,

whether  they be Americans, British,  Indians,  or

anyone, not to try and meddle in or influence  our

politics.   We  are  just  getting  our  so-called

internal self-government. Singapore will still  be

a  Colony.  Let us try our own hand at  democracy.

Especially  to the Britishers, I would say,  "Save

your money; save your interests in this country by

not interfering or taking sides."



<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as Chief

Minister  of  the Government and  as  head  of  my

political Party, it now behoves me to reply to the

charges



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>



made  by  the  mover of the motion. It  is  indeed

regrettable that the person named is not here this

afternoon  to  answer the charges  specifically

laid at his door. I must, I feel, in fairness  to

him, to my Ministerial colleagues and to my Party,

say  that he saw me yesterday and told me that  he

would resign his seat from the Assembly and  as  a

Minister  of the Government, because he felt  that

in  doing  this  he would save some embarrassment

for me and for my Party. I did not know and do not

understand  what caused him to take this  line  of

reasoning.  But  I feel that as  he  was  a  loyal

colleague of mine, and as he had given of his best

whilst he was a Minister in the Government in the

discharge  of  his portfolio, I thought  that  it

would be proper for me to accede to his request. I

allowed him to resign. I would have liked  him  to

remain and face these charges and answer them,  so

that  this Assembly as well as the public can have

a proper assessment of whether or not such charges

are true or unfounded, or are just mere political

distortions.  Unfortunately, he  is  not  here  to

reply.  But  what  I resent most strongly  is  the

suggestion  in the speech of the seconder  of  the

motion that, by his resignation, he has damned all

of   his  Ministerial  colleagues,  and  that  his

resignation  was as a result of the desire  of  my

Government  to  make  him the  scapegoat.  It  is

because of that that I feel that the truth  should

now be told, not only in regard to the allegations

that have been made but also in regard to all  the

political manoeuvrings that have been taking place

for  the  past three years, in order  to  build  a

healthier,  better  and  non-Communist   form   of

government.  Moreover,  Sir,  as  the  time  gets

nearer  and  nearer towards the general elections,

politics tend to get murkier and murkier, and  in

the  urge to capture power, it is just regrettable

that there are men who are prepared to forget  the

decencies of life, the decencies of leadership and

stoop  to  the extent of doing something which,  I

must  confess, was not expected this afternoon.  I

say, Sir, let the truth be known once and for all.

Let  the  people of Singapore wake up to what  has

been going on and let them decide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>



- and  decide  wisely at the general  elections - so

that  the  government that is returned can  be  a

government that is clean, pure and sincere in  its

efforts to work for the welfare of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it grieves me to have to say things

here which I would not ordinarily have said.  But

the  Opposition speakers have forced the pace  and

forced  the  tone of this debate. When  Mr  Chew

Swee Kee saw me yesterday morning, he said that he

was  prepared to resign from the Assembly and from

his  Ministry if I could speak to the  leader  of

the P.A.P. to see whether all this unnecessary mud-slinging  could be prevented, and if an assurance

could  be received from the leader of the  P.A.P.

that  this  motion  would not take  the  trend  it

originally intended to take, he would resign. The

answer  was  given  in  the affirmative,  and  he

resigned.   But  this  afternoon,   after   having

received  an  assurance from the hon.  Member  of

this  Assembly, the man who hopes to be  the  next

Prime  Minister of this country, what do  we  get?

All  this mud-slinging at a man who cannot defend

himself,   who   resigned  just  because   of   an

assurance received from the hon. Member. That  is

the  kind of political trickery which we  have  to

contend  with at this time when a new constitution

is to come into force: when complete internal self-government  is  to be given to us  to  guide  this

country  towards prosperity, towards  cleanliness,

towards  all that we believe in, all that we  have

fought for. It is indeed a sad day for me to  have

to  put  that  faith  in  something  which  I  was

advised would never be honoured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it has now come to the stage, Sir, when it

is  felt  necessary by the Opposition to try  and

make  things  as dirty as they can be  against  my

loyal  colleagues who have worked  so  hard,  who

have fought so vigorously with their hearts, their

souls  and  their lives to keep this country  from

the grip of Communism, I find that the truth must

now  be  told. I am sure the people of  Singapore

must  have  been  wondering  how  it  was  that  I

succeeded  in bringing an All-Party delegation  to

London  and  succeeded in  bringing  home  a  new

constitution with the subversive clause. The truth

shall now be told. If one side can play



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>



dirty and begin to be dirty, I shall play the same

game  and do it too, and let the country  and  the

world  and  God decide. The subversive clause  was

put in as a result of the hon. Member and I seeing

the Secretary of State for the Colonies-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is a downright lie!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member for

Tanjong Pagar rising on a point of order, or is it

on a point of explanation? Can I have the answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Only if the Chief Minister will

give way.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir,-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am sorry, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is another point which has

struck  me,  that  possibly  all  this  matter  is

completely   irrelevant  to   the   motion,   and,

therefore, I ask the Chief Minister to switch  his

horses.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Irrelevant, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Irrelevant to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I submit to your ruling, Sir,

but  I must say that my heart aches inside me, and

I  am  not ashamed if I were to cry here, and  cry

loudly.  You  have so ruled, Sir, but  before  you

rule, the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar did scream

and say that it was a downright lie.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am sorry, I was just-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did not hear the hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar say "a downright lie". If

he  did,  he  must withdraw the expression.  I  am

addressing the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar.  If

he  used the expression "a downright lie", he must

withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since you did

not hear, obviously I could not have said it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It has been stated in passing

by  the  Chief  Minister that that expression  was

used.  The  hon.  Member is his own  judge  as  to

whether  or not he used it. If he says he did  not

use the expression, of course, that is the end  of

the  matter.  But  if  he  says  he  did  use  the

expression, he must withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well, I withdraw it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you, Sir.

I  did  not mean to show disrespect to the  Chair,

but  I  brought that in just to throw back at  the

hon.  Member  the  point that he himself  said  in

moving  his  motion - when he made such allegations

and  when  the S.P.A. stated that it was a  stupid

lie,  and it is because of that refutation it  was

true - according to his reasoning

- and therefore using his reasoning, what I  said

and what he said would lead one to believe that it

must  have been the truth. But leaving that apart,

Sir,  since  you have so ruled, I must  seek  your

indulgence  and  the  indulgence  of  this   House

because  I  feel that the time has come  when  the

eyes  of  the  people of Singapore and  the  world

should  be  properly opened to all the  intrigues

that  have  been going on and on and  on  since  I

became Chief Minister. In saying such things, Sir,

I  might damn myself, but I am not worried now. As

Chief Minister I am just an individual. As Lim Yew

Hock  I  am  still an individual. But the  country

stands  above all, and if it is going to  be  for

the benefit of the country and, therefore, for the

benefit  of  the people of this country,  Lim  Yew

Hock  and the Chief Minister can be trampled down,

just  as  much  as  poor Chew Swee  Kee  is  being

trampled  down  when  he is  not  here  to  defend

himself.  I  would  like to  say,  Sir,  that  the

Government has been accused of taking very  strong

action  against subversives, against comrades,  or

rather  ex-comrades of the People's Action  Party,

and  that  has  been thrown at me  time  and  time

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not dismayed because I was doing my duty.

When  I was asked many a time why it was necessary

that there should have been so many consultations,

discussions  and friendly meetings with  the  hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>



just  laughed it off and said: "Forget  it,  boys!

That's nothing." Let the truth be told. The action

that this Government took against subversives  was

an  attempt to cleanse the P.A.P. for the good  of

the  P.A.P. That was what I said. I did it because

I  felt that it would be in the best interests  of

the people of Singapore if there could be built up

another  force  which is dedicated  to  serve  the

interests  of  the country, which  might  at  that

particular time not have awakened to  the  danger

that  the  game  that  they  were  playing  was  a

dangerous game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did so many things for the good of the country.

I  did  so many things for the good of the  P.A.P.

after discussions with the P.A.P. Such is politics

in Singapore today!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary, when replying

to  the  question  raised by the hon.  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar, said that it was not true that  an

inquiry  had  been  stopped on the  request  of  a

Minister.  There  had been no inquiry.  There  was

consideration given as to whether or not the funds

that  Mr  Chew Swee Kee had received came  within

the  Income Tax Ordinance, and whether or not such

funds  were  subject  to taxation.  There  was  no

inquiry.  There was no choking-off of an  inquiry.

The   hon.  Member  was  not  satisfied,  because,

according to him, no man other than he can  speak

the  truth. The insinuation is that even the  poor

Financial Secretary did not speak the truth.  Then

again  he  said that we are afraid of a Commission

of Inquiry because it will stir up dirt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been in politics for years and years

and  years,  and I am just as good a tactician  as

many  others. It is my view that, irrespective  of

the  merits or demerits of the appointment of such

a  Commission  of  Inquiry, the appointment  will

definitely lead to the disadvantage of  the  Party

that  is  being examined. We are having a general

election in three months' time, and the Commission

cannot  wind  up  its  business  so  quickly.  The

investigations  will have to be  done  in  public.

There  will have to be almost a running commentary

on what is going on inside the Commission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>



of Inquiry. This will therefore lend extra fuel to

the Opposition to hold us up to ridicule. That  is

the  reason why we feel that it is not right  that

we  should fall into the trap of having to hold  a

Commission of Inquiry to go into matters which we

know  for sure are not as alleged, although I must

admit  that  there were circumstances  surrounding

such    instances   leading   to   the   unfounded

allegations being made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know very little about the source of these

funds. But I can say this with all sincerity, that

they are not from an American source at all. I  do

not  like  it. I can say this from what  little  I

know.  It  is  not  from an American  source.  But

before I go further, Sir, I would like to set  the

minds  of  the  hon. Members of the Opposition  at

rest, since so much has been said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will accept the motion and appoint a Commission

of  Inquiry. We are not hiding anything. We  would

like  to  let the public know to what  extent  the

allegations made at this late stage are  true;  to

what extent they are just political manoeuverings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the S.P.A. has been held up to ridicule by

the  previous speakers. It is to be expected  that

we  cannot  expect  to be well spoken  of  by  the

Opposition. We try to do what we can, and what  we

believe is good for the country. We try to keep on

building up a cohesive organisation, and we  feel

that  we  must  not be afraid to  be  held  up  to

ridicule  by  Members of the  Opposition  in  our

genuine attempt to find the best way to serve  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is one of the common failings of

democracy  that,  when  we  try  to  build  up   a

democratic force, all the parts of that democratic

force  are not so united. Each force has  its  own

way  of  thinking, its own line of action and  its

own beliefs. Therefore, there cannot be that ideal

state of united action. Even though we could build

up  a very strong organisation, there would still

be little sprinkiings here and there of so-called

democrats who find that they cannot find a  place

in  our  organisation. But, Sir,  if  a  political

organisation is run on the lines of a Party  which

is Communistic, there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>



is  no  need for all these headaches, no need  for

all   these   attempts  to  bring   about   closer

understanding  and  closer unity.  What  the  head

says, goes. If it is white, it shall be white even

though it may be black.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Telok Ayer took this

motion  as  an opportunity to smear the reputation

of  my  Ministerial colleagues, and quite rightly,

Sir,  you  ruled  that  the  amendment  which   he

proposed  was  not in order. Sir, any  government,

may  it  be  the  Government  today  or  the  next

government - any government - will have to face  such

criticism and such attacks. But it is to be hoped

that  when attacks of this nature are being  made

there  should  be  some sense of proportion,  some

sense  of appreciation whether or not there  is  a

basis for such allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first time in all my political

life  that I have to stand up in this Chamber  and

speak  so  solemnly  and so  sadly  that  a  man's

beliefs  in  another man's honesty and  integrity

can   be  shattered,  just  because  of  political

necessity.



<br><br>4.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in this motion there are as far

as  I  could understand two major parts.  One  to

make  sure whether the said fund was received  and

the  second, is the source of the fund - the  source

from  which  the  fund  was  received.  But  while

answering,  the Chief Minister had  just  admitted

that  he knew the fund was received. But he doubts

the  source  to be from America. That  is  what  I

understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that it is also important that we

must find out the source - where the fund came from.

I  do  not  know I will be in order if I  move  an

amendment.  To  get the general consent  of  this

Assembly,  I  will  give  you  the  text  of   the

amendment. May I read it? To add that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the report of the Commission be revealed before

the next election of the Assembly."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Be revealed?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Be revealed. That is,

made public. This is important because before  the

next  election, the voters must know  exactly  the

truth  of  that allegation, whether the allegation

is  correct or incorrect. The voters will have  a

chance to cast their votes accordingly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member

give  me  the amendment in writing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member move his

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, to add, "and.that the Report of the

Commission  be  revealed before the  next  general

elections."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason for my moving this amendment is

that,  before the public are called upon  to  cast

their  votes  for candidates contesting  the  next

elections,  they should know the truth about  this

serious allegation. Either the P.A.P. is making  a

false  allegation or the S.P.A. is a stooge  party

of the Americans and is prepared to sell Singapore

for  a  certain amount of money. I am not  saying

that  the allegation is true or false. I only want

the  public to know whether there is any political

Party  which has sold itself to foreign interests,

or  there  is  a  party which goes  about  telling

scandalous lies about honest and upright men  like

our  Chief  Minister. Unless we  decide  that  the

results of that Inquiry be made public before  the

next  Assembly elections, it is very  unfair  for

the  voters of Singapore to know for whom to  vote

under this cloud of suspicion. Since this request

for the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry is

made  in  this House, it is appropriate  that  the

results of the Inquiry should also be revealed  in

time before the next elections. If the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar is really earnest about his  motion

and does not want his request for a Commission  of

Inquiry  to  languish  in obscurity  after  it  is

passed,  I  hope  he will have  no  hesitation  in

supporting  this  amendment which  seeks  to  give

teeth to his motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that if the Hon. the Chief Minister

has nothing to fear about this allegation and that

there  should be a speedy Inquiry into the serious

allegation   against   the   Hon.   Minister   for

Education, which also involves his Party, he  will

readily support my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any seconder? There is no seconder.

The amendment falls. The original motion is before

the House.



<br><br>5.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed sad, Sir, to hear the speech made

by  the  Chief Minister when he said that  he  was

actually tricked by the P.A.P. into agreeing  that

if  the Hon. the Minister for Education (Mr  Chew

Swee  Kee)  were  to  resign,  then  it  was   not

necessary to move the motion. He should realise by

now,  Sir,  that  during the  December  1957  City

Council  elections, an unholy alliance  was  made

between  the  P.A.P. and the  Labour  Front.  He

should  know that they were tricked and  that  the

P.A.P. cannot  be  trusted.  He  is  talking  about

something  good  for  the country;  then  let  the

people judge. Let the people judge this affair  of

$500,000.  The  Chief  Minister  said  that   this

$500,000  is  not from the Americans.  Then  from

whom  did  he  get  it? This is  a  local  affair.

Singapore  is our country. We were born  here.  We

detest any interference from any country

- foreign or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about cleansing the P.A.P. of

subversives and the fight against subversives. If

we  are trying to sell ourselves to fight against

the subversives for $500,000, then I strongly take

objection to that. I am very glad, Sir,  that  so

much  dirty water has been pouring in and  out  of

this House today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made allegations myself in this House

about  corruption before on the  question  of  the

rice stockpile and things like that. Now, this  is

a  motion  introduced by the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar alleging that an amount of $500,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>



was  deposited with the First National City  Bank

of  New York in the name of the Hon. Mr Chew Swee

Kee  and  if we want to clear the doubts  and  not

create  any more misunderstanding in the minds  of

the  people as to who are honest and dishonest,  I

strongly  support the motion for a  Commission  of

Inquiry.



<br><br>5.08 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it distresses me to see  the  Chief

Minister,  in  his agony as the  final  blows  are

landed, resorting to counter-smear to try and kill

us  by the only weapon he thinks he has left,  and

that is to tell a lie which he thinks-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has already

been  over-ruled by alleging that there is a lie.

He must not repeat it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Very well, I withdraw it, but

let  me  remind  him  that what  the  P.A.P. says

publicly it honours publicly. [Interruption.] I am

sorry  for the interruption, Sir, It is  a  rather

unusual  message  which I have  received  from  a

Member of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is briefly and simply this. First,

let  us  get  our facts straight. The issue  arose

over  facts and the Inquiry will be on the facts:

first,  the $500,000 which should be investigated;

second,  the resignation of Mr Chew Swee  Kee.  I

never asked Mr Chew Swee Kee to resign. Yesterday

morning,  as I was walking into this Chamber,  the

Chief  Minister  asked  me,  "If  Chew  Swee   Kee

resigns, will you go soft on him?" I said,  "Well,

it  is  not  for me. I will ring up my  Chairman."

[Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> "I will ring up my Chairman,"

I  said. The Member for Sembawang is here to  bear

witness   and  several  members  of   my   Central

Executive  Committee are also in the  Gallery.  We

held a lunchtime meeting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>



to  decide  the offer of appeasement made  by  the

Chief  Minister on behalf of Mr Chew Swee Kee.  I

told  the Chief Minister before lunch that  I  was

not  in  a position to decide, and that it  was  a

matter for my Chairman. My Chairman decided that,

although he was the person called a liar,  he  was

not  in a position to decide either, and we had  a

Central Executive Committee meeting at one o'clock

yesterday which went on to a quarter-past  two.  I

came  back  to  this Chamber and  told  the  Chief

Minister, who was resting in the C.P.A. Room, what

was  agreed - that  if Mr Chew  resigned,  then  it

would  not  be necessary for me to press  for  the

Inquiry,  because then the matter was  admitted;

but  that it would be my duty, nevertheless, since

the  matter had gone that far, to state the facts.

I told him that in clear and categorical terms. He

was  in  the C.P.A. Room on the adjournment  this

morning  when my Chairman. Dr Toh, Dr  Goh  Keng

Swee,  I  and  the Member for Sembawang  told  him

clearly that that was the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that I came to

see  you  yesterday to make sure that the position

was as stated - that Mr Chew had resigned, because

I told the Chief Minister, "If Mr Chew is here, I

must  pursue the matter to the hilt. If he is  not

here,  I am prepared to state the facts,  and  if

the  facts  are not challenged, then there  is  no

point  for a Commission of Inquiry, be, cause  no

crime  has  been  committed but only  a  political

blunder of the biggest magnitude has been made."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I stated must have been too much for

the Chief Minister. There was only one thing which

he did not know, and that is that I had permission

from   the   Hon. the   former   Minister    for

Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas)  to

disclose  that Mr Chew had told him he  got  U.S.

$100,000  gold for the Party at the end  of  1957.

The Minister told me this only two weeks ago - I  do

not  remember  exactly when, but it  was  told  me

after I had tabled the motion. He is the only  one

honest guy left in the Government, and he told me,

"Look, if it is any help, tell him."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Sir, on a

point of order. Is the hon. Member insinuating

that all the others in the Government are

dishonest?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member used the

expression that "he was the only honest Member in

the Government".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not sat

down  yet.  Now, if the hon. Member is insinuating

that   other   Members  of  the   Government   are

dishonest,  then  of course he is  unparliamentary

and he should withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What I think I should have

said was "known to be honest". All are honest, but

he is known to be the honestest of them all!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that will

satisfy  the  Chair  at all. I suggest  the  hon.

Member withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Very well, Sir, it does not

really matter as far as the public are concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of

order, Sir, I do take exception to the reply  that

he  gave  to the Chair's ruling, that it does  not

matter.  I  want a categorical reply and  I  would

request him to name the other dishonest Ministers,

and include me - outside the privilege-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. I think the point

really  is  that if an hon. Member  is  asked  to

withdraw  any  unparliamentary  word,  he  should

withdraw  it unqualifiedly. That is, I think,  the

point  and that is quite a correct point.  Perhaps

the Member for Tanjong Pagar will do so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker, I

withdraw  it.  I  am  not  interested  in   making

allegations which I cannot substantiate. I do  not

know  why  the Minister for Commerce and  Industry

labours   under  this  tremendous  guilt  complex.

Nobody  is  accusing him of anything,  not  unless

there is proof.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>



I  have no proof; so I am not accusing him. But as

against Mr Chew my Chairman had categorical proof

and  therefore we went forward when we were called

liars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the position. My Chairman informed

the  Chief Minister this afternoon, in my presence

and  in the presence of the Member for Sembawang,

that   we  had  to  state  the  facts,  that   his

resignation does not mean that we have to withdraw

all  the  charges because they are not necessary.

They  have  to  be  stated categorically  for  the

purpose  of  the  record,  and  if  the  Hon. the

Financial Secretary had looked at file G.S. 47909,

he would know that what I stated is true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as to the counter-smear. Sir, before I went

to  London, I thought, "Oh! The Chief Minister  is

the  master plotter in this House." He  plots  and

conspires  with everybody, because he  is  a  very

cunning  and  a  very wily man. He survived  three

phases- from  the nominated phase  into  the  first

partially-elected, and on to  the  Rendel  phase.

Before we went to London, we carefully weighed the

odds,  whether by so doing we would  subsequently

be  put in a fix by a possible smear that we  sold

out  on  our comrades. Sir, he wants at this  late

stage,  when there is no way out, to smear  me  by

saying,  "Ah! I sold out my so-called comrades.  I

saw  him  and  agreed the subversive  clause  with

Lennox-Boyd at a private meeting." Let me tell him

this:  I  never,  with him, saw Lennox-Boyd  at  a

private  meeting. I knew, when we were inside  the

Conference Room - the Member for Serangoon was there

together  with the Minister for Local Government,

Lands and Housing - that there were two choices left

for me: either  I  broke  up  the Conference  or  I  said,

"Reject  the subversive clause and come back."  He

remembered it, because if he wants the  truth  to

be  out, let me tell him this: that, in fact, they

were  all  in  favour  of it  and  they  tried  to

persuade  me  to  accept it.  I  said,  "Under  no

circumstances, because I was not in a position  to

accept any such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>



thing  and because my Party members were in gaol."

Sir,  whatever  we  do or do not  do,  there  are

certain guiding principles we always follow,  and

one  of  them  is: never make a move which  makes

you  a  hostage  of another man.  And  if  I  had

accepted the clause, I would have been a  hostage

of  chaps  who  were locked up. If I  refused,  I

might become a hostage of the people with whom  I

was  negotiating. Therefore I came back  and,  on

the  slightest challenge, I went and fought  the

polls.  The  Chief Minister had not the  guts  to

face  the public and defend -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

Member  has  gone  far enough. I  think  the  hon.

Member  does  recollect that I  pulled  the  Chief

Minister  up  when he was on that topic  as  being

irrelevant and perhaps the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar  should be satisfied with his  reply  up  to

now. Let us now be relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I just, in passing,

mention this: that what we do politically, we must

do  cleanly and honourably? We are not  afraid  of

any  inquiry being held, anywhere, any  time,  any

place,  on  any one of us, because our  hands  are

clean.  First  and  last, we  have  financial  and

political   integrity  of  purpose.   They   were

undecided  on what to do. I knew that  they  were

plotting.  Now  it  is  too  late  to  close   the

P.A.P. - that  is  their biggest  regret.  But  they

would  have banged us and closed us down  if  they

knew  that  we would go from strength to strength.

If  they  knew  that, despite the fact  that  they

pulled  away the active C.P. types from the Party,

the  Party could still have the momentum  and  the

drive  to succeed, they would have closed us  down

in  August 1957. Sir, I have no illusions on  this

score.  The  Chief Minister is a wily  man  and  I

treated him on that basis. I say this. The trouble

with the Chief Minister is that, although he is  a

wily man, some of his subordinates are not. One of

his subordinates was Mr. de Cruz and he let it  be

known  that  it  was the intention of  the  Labour

Front to absorb the P.A.P. Therefore, if you  lift

up all the active C.P. types, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>



you absorb the democratic element. He knew that we

were  not  C.P. types, and yet he carried  out  a

consistent  smear  that we are Communists - and  we

kept      on      saying     we      are      not

Communists - deliberately to confuse  the  public.

That  was  the reason why he could not close  us,

because   not  only  did  he  know  we  are   not

Communists,  but  he  also  knew  that   we   are

prepared  to  work for a positive  non-Communist

line.  Sir, throughout all the twists and turns,

the  position is now reached where I say that the

Chief Minister -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have just

noticed  that  the  hon. Mr  Francis  Thomas  has

crossed the Floor. That, in my view, is completely

out of order. If he wishes to cross the Floor,  he

must  do so at the beginning of a sitting.  May  I

ask  the  hon.  Member either to cross  the  Floor

again  and  go  back  to his seat,  or  leave  the

Chamber?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am sorry, Sir, but it seemed to me

necessary to do so, due to the circumstances.  But

I submit to your ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Thomas left the Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, when we formed the

People's  Action Party in 1954, we  were  academic

intellectuals,  Left-wing  types.   We   did   not

understand the machinations, the twists and  turns

of power. We learned that soon enough! Let me tell

the  Chief  Minister  this:  one  thing  we  never

unlearn  is  that if you want to be a  force,  you

have  to  be clean. Had his group been  clean,  we

would  have absorbed them. We knew they  were  not

Communists, but we also knew that they  were  weak

types,   effete,   feeble   and   susceptible   to

corruption.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I know this is a rather

heated  debate, but if expressions of that  nature

are   used   loosely,  they  can  be  applied   to

honourable Members of this Assembly. I  think  the

hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar should be a little

more careful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is a choice of expression.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to get involved in

a tricky effeminate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>



discussion on this subject.

So far as  I  am concerned, the sands of time have run

out on the Government. They have failed to absorb us.They

have failed to block us. When the former Director

of  the Special Branch decided to scoot, then they

really knew that their goose was cooked. I am  not

afraid  at  any time to be called a non-Communist.

At  this  stage, for the Chief Minister to suggest

that  I  was fighting the subversives is  a  very

foolish  thing,  because that is contrary  to  the

whole of his line. I will say this: the reason why

the  P.A.P. survives today is because we have held

a  consistent line. And the reason why the  Labour

Front  collapsed and why the S.P.A. will  collapse

is  because  it  has no basic beliefs,  no  basic

line,  nothing to sell; everybody in for  what  he

could get out of it - loot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I saw you yesterday and asked you what the

position  was with regard to my motion,  since  my

Party  had agreed that if Mr Chew resigned  there

was  no  point  for a Commission of Inquiry.  The

Chief  Minister found the facts too  much  because

they  told too heavily. He now says he is prepared

to accept this motion. I had indicated to him that

after the debate had taken place, I would withdraw

my motion, because it was no longer necessary. He

says  he  wants to carry on and accept the motion.

Mr Speaker, Sir, you told me that if I wanted  to

withdraw  it, I would have to get the  consent  of

this  Assembly.  We  keep our  bargains.  I  still

propose to withdraw, but there is nothing to  stop

the  Government,  on their own, if  they  want  to

clear   themselves,  from   proceeding   with   a

Commission of Inquiry. I therefore formally, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  ask  your  leave  to  withdraw  my

motion, since everybody knows why I am withdrawing

it.  I  find it serves no useful purpose. We  keep

our  bargains.  We  do not want to  embarrass  the

whole   of   the  Government  as   a   result   of

investigating  Mr  Chew's  affairs.   The   Chief

Minister  knows  exactly how  I  feel  about  the

matter.  He knows that this is political dynamite.

Once Mr Chew resigned, he admitted his guilt.  If

the  Chief  Minister  wants  to  proceed  with   a

Commission of Inquiry,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>



he can do so; nothing can stop him. I  have

witnesses  in  the C.P.A. Room this  afternoon  to

bear witness to what was agreed. Because of it,  I

formally ask leave to withdraw the motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it the pleasure of honourable

Members that the motion should be withdrawn?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will put it to a vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that a

Commission of Inquiry should be appointed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>



under  the  Inquiry Commissions  Ordinance  or

otherwise  to investigate and report on the  facts

regarding  an  account  of  about  $500,000.00  in

September 1958 in the First National City Bank  of

New  York  in the name of the Honourable Mr  Chew

Swee   Kee   and   regarding   the   reasons   why

investigations in the matter for the  purposes  of

Income  Tax  were  not  pursued  by  the  officers

responsible in the Income Tax Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That this Assembly do now

adjourn."-[The Chief Minister].



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>

<div align="right">twenty-seven minutes past Five o'clock p.m. to</div>

<div align="right">Wednesday, 18th March, 1959.</div>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Wednesday, 4th March, 1959</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following question for oral answer stood on

the Order Paper of 4th March, 1959:- <br><br>





<div align="center"><b>VISIT OF DUKE OF EDINBURGH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use of Students to Line Route)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inche AHMAD BIN IBRAHIM: To ask the Minister

for  Education  how  many (i)  primary,  and  (ii)

secondary school students were asked to  line  the

route taken by the Duke of Edinburgh from Clifford

Pier  to Government House on Sunday morning,  22nd

February,  1959;  and  whether  his  Ministry  had

obtained  the  permission of their parents  before

the students were asked to do so.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid),



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>



who was to have

answered the question, was absent when the question

was called, and has supplied the following answer:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answers to the first part of the question are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 8,010 primary school pupils;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) 6,410 secondary school pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second part of the question is

that   there   was  no  compulsion,  implied   or

otherwise,  for  the children to  line  the  route

taken  by  the Duke of Edinburgh. The number  from

each school represented was necessarily restricted

to  a  small  quota selected only from  those  who

volunteered to attend and, in all cases,  adequate

time  was given for the children to consult  their

parents.
