   <b>USE OF ABACUS IN SCHOOLS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee</b> asked the Minister for Education whether he will promote the use of the abacus in schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K. Wong) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is conducting a pilot project on the teaching of abacus in seven primary schools starting in May this year. Based on the outcome of the pilot project, my Ministry may promote the teaching of abacus in more primary schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, Primary 3 pupils will be taught abacus skills in addition and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> subtraction to reinforce their understanding of relationships between numbers and the concept of place values. The pilot project will also evaluate the effects of abacus teaching on pupils' attitude towards the learning of mathematics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training of teachers will take place in March and April after which the abacus will be taught during mathematics lessons for one period or 30 minutes per week over four months. As the learning of abacus skills is to enhance the learning of mathematics, it will not be an examinable subject.

   <b>RMCA REINSURANCE LTD</b>

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Reasons for suspension)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) what are the reasons behind the suspension of a trustee stock, RMCA Reinsurance Ltd; (b) who are its controlling shareholders; (c) how many investors have used their Central Provident Fund savings to purchase the shares; and (d) whether there is a chance for these investors to get back some of their money invested.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> RMCA Reinsurance was admitted to the Stock Exchange Main Board in 1988 and became a CPF trustee stock in the same year. At that time, the company had a paid-up capital of $20 million and a three-year profit record which met the SES listing requirements fully.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th September 1991, RMCA Reinsurance requested the Stock Exchange to suspend its shares from trading pending the announcement of its results for the financial year which ended on 30th June 1991. The company had incurred a loss of $56 million in that year due to heavy claims for damages caused by natural disasters, including the Hurricane Hugo in the United States and Storm Daria in Europe and losses in its Asian reinsurance business. Insurance companies worldwide suffered losses on their reinsurance
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> contracts as a result of the unusual severity and frequency of natural disasters in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $56 million loss reduced RMCA Reinsurance's equity to $9.6 million which was far short of the US$25 million considered adequate in the international reinsurance market. As RMCA Reinsurance was liable for claims on various reinsurance contracts still in force, the $9.6 million equity was insufficient to cover the potential claims. The company therefore requested the Stock Exchange to continue the suspension of trading of its shares while it re-assessed its future direction. Since then, the company has stopped writing new businesses and the suspension of its shares has remained till today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company lost another $82 million in FY 92 and $10 million in FY 93.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RMCA Reinsurance is 30% owned by the Insurance Corporation of Singapore (ICS) and 20% by Sime Darby Singapore Ltd. The remaining 50% of the shares are held by the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 11th September 1991, the date of suspension, 2,120 CPF members used their CPF savings to purchase a total of 5.423 million RMCA Reinsurance shares. The shares were traded at 90 cents per share just before its suspension.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the suspension of RMCA Reinsurance shares from trading on 11th September 1991, the company ceased writing new business and conducted a review of its operations. The company concluded that it has no reasonable prospect of returning to profitability. On 1st October 1991, it appointed a run-off manager, RMCA Pte Ltd, to oversee an orderly run-off of the company's reinsurance liabilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, the company engaged insolvency expert Messrs Cork Gully of Coopers &amp; Lybrand to independently assess the company's position and find ways to resolve its financial predicament. On 20th September 1993, upon the advice of Messrs Cork Gully, the company's board proposed to its shareholders a Scheme of Arrangement under section
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 210 of the Companies Act. The Scheme sought to avert an involuntary liquidation of the company and provide an early commutation of all claims against the company. Although RMCA Reinsurance would have no assets left after the Scheme is implemented, it will preserve the company as a corporate entity with a listing status. The Scheme was approved by the shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 6th October 1993. It has also been approved by the company's creditors and is now subject to the approval of the court.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although RMCA Reinsurance is not to be wound up, it will have no assets left after the Scheme is implemented. Its shareholders will not receive any distribution. Thus, their RMCA Reinsurance shares are likely to be worthless.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, does that mean, even if ICS belongs to Temasek, as long as it is a normal course of business, and it has gone bust, whether it is a CPF trustee stock or non-trustee stock, the investing public has to accept the fact that there is a risk involved?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The answer is yes. ICS itself is 49.8% owned by DBS Bank and not by the Government directly.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> That would also mean that for all future investments in Government companies, the Singapore investors have to open their eyes that the Government will not bail them out even if it is directly owned by Temasek.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think this must be the case.

   <b>(Education and publicity)</b>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Finance, now that the Government has succeeded in getting over 1.4 million people interested in shares, whether it will spend money to further educate the population on proper share investment as against share speculation through a sustained publicity blitz.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as part of Government's programme to promote widespread ownership of valuable national assets, Government ran a month-long share education programme just before the flotation of Singapore Telecom. The programme was aimed at educating Singaporeans on the essentials of share ownership. Its key message was that while shares would broaden an individual's range of assets and could be valuable long-term investments, there were risks involved and prudence should be exercised in selecting the companies to invest in.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme was successful in encouraging more Singaporeans to own shares. Before the ST flotation, only 250,000 out of 1.9 million adult Singaporeans had ever bought any shares. Of the 700,000 CPF members who qualified for the CPF Approved Investment Scheme, only 120,000 had actually bought shares under the Scheme. For the ST flotation, 1.4 million Singaporeans subscribed for and were allocated shares in the company. In view of the coverage and success of the programme, there is no need for Government to launch another programme on share investment in the immediate future. If there is a need to, it can be done again when other Government agencies are subsequently privatised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress again that Government is not compelling or inducing anyone to buy shares. The share education programme was to help Singaporeans make informed decisions about whether to invest in shares, taking into consideration their family circumstances and financial resources. They must learn that share prices can go up and down, and choose carefully which companies to invest in. They should take a long term view, and not enter the stock market for quick gains. Most importantly, they should avoid buying more shares than they can afford, or borrow to speculate. Investors must recognise that the higher potential return from stocks and shares reflects the greater risks involved, and should therefore be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> prepared to risk losses when markets turn down or companies get into difficulties. However, investors who buy good quality shares in markets with strong fundamentals should be able to ride through market fluctuations, provided they have not bought beyond their means with borrowed money.

  <b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a total of 5,157 unused motor cycle Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) has been frozen since 29th January 1994. The Government has announced that it will redistribute this to other vehicle categories. The formula for conversion and distribution of the unused motor cycle COEs has yet to be finalised. It will be announced together with the quota allocation for May 1994 to April 1995.

  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Would the Minister consider a weekend category for commercial goods vehicles and buses for delivery purposes outside the normal trading hours? Would such a category be allowed for those who do their delivery outside the normal trading hours as they do not jam up the roads? It will be cheaper for these small businessmen to own the vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Currently, as the Member knows, there is a category for private car owners under the weekend car scheme. We have not received any request for such a category for commercial vehicles. However, if there is such a request, we will consider it.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1994 to 31st March, 1995." - [Minister for Finance].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Finance. I would also like to thank the Minister for his generosity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to report the mixed reactions of the public to the Budget Statement. The Feedback Unit conducted a dialogue session on the Budget Statement on 28th February. Most of the participants felt that this Budget should be welcomed by the people because there are many goodies given to the people, for example, personal income tax rebate, HDB service and conservancy charges and rental rebates, and also the $300 for the CPF share ownership top-up scheme. I think our people will welcome these goodies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some representatives from the business community expressed their disappointment over this Budget because the corporate tax has not been further reduced. On the other hand, they were worried that the increase of 1.5 percentage points for the employer's CPF contribution would further increase labour cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the participants of this dialogue session have reached a consensus, that is, they are concerned with the impact of the forthcoming GST. The union and community leaders, academics and professionals are more worried about the profiteering and inflation that may come with GST. But the businessmen and employers are worried about the GST compliance cost. From these different reactions and the press reports, we can come to one conclusion, that is, "The more you give, the higher would be the expectation. What was given last year does not count. If you give less this year, there will be a lot of hue and cry." No doubt, asking for more is a natural reaction. But the Government should be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> very prudent and careful in dealing with this matter, that is, not to allow the people's expectation to be raised too high, and to take for granted that every year, there would be some hong bao and gifts to the business community and the ordinary citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should also let the people realise the reasons for giving all these concessions. In my view, the reasons for giving these concessions in the past few years are mainly two-fold. Firstly, to improve our competitiveness and to stimulate our economy. Secondly, to return the wealth to our people according to our economic performance so as to encourage our people to work harder and to upgrade their skills. For example, the reduction of income tax in 1993 and the GST to be implemented are measures to promote our competitiveness through tax reform. The second example, for last year and this year, the various tax incentives given to the finance and other industries and the incentives for overseas development have the primary objective of increasing our GNP. The third example is the CPF Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme. Its aims are to return the wealth to our people, to reward the people for their past contributions, and to encourage them to strive for excellence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now let me talk about the implementation of GST. With regard to GST, the biggest fear among the people is profiteering and inflation that may come with its implementation. How to contain inflation rate at below 6% is the main challenge facing the Government. The Government will not only have to prevent businessmen from using GST as an excuse for profiteering, but also to pay attention to the fact that inflation may lead some unions and workers to demand for higher wages, thereby triggering a price-wage spiral.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the participants at the dialogue session also suggested that the Government departments and statutory boards should freeze their fees and charges for the next two years. Otherwise, it would undermine the Government's
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> moral authority to persuade the businessmen not to increase prices at random. Furthermore, if the Government departments and statutory boards continue to increase their fees and charges, it may create an impression among people that "we allow only the magistrate to set fire, but disallow the people even to light their lanterns" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business community is very concerned that in order to collect GST for the Government, it has to incur additional costs. The business representatives at the dialogue session felt that the Government had underestimated the private sector's cost in this aspect. They also feel that they are merely acting as collection agents for the Government, so the Government should compensate them for their expenses incurred.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me go on to the issue on external economy. Apart from the amount of our investments abroad, the size of our external economy can also be measured by factor income from abroad. In 1993, our income from abroad was $1.23 billion as compared to $1.37 billion in 1992. I wish to ask the Minister for Finance: what was the reason for this decline? At the same time, I like to know, from the $1.23 billion income from abroad, how much of it came from the public sector's investment overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget debate last year, I mentioned about the mutual repellence between civil servants and the entrepreneurs. This point was raised in the two dialogue sessions held by the Feedback Unit with the entrepreneurs on venturing abroad. Coupled with my personal interaction with the entrepreneurs, I have now a better understanding of the local enterprises, particularly the small and medium enterprises, and their complaints and reservations on partnership with the Government-linked companies. The private sector feels that GLCs are slow in making decisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think that there are three reasons for this. Firstly, because the people in charge of these GLCs are mainly civil servants. They are more careful and prudent. For every project, they need to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have a feasibility study conducted before they commence action. Secondly, it is the same group of civil servants who are managing the Government-linked companies. They have to participate in rounds and rounds of negotiations. They are very busy and they have to travel all over the places - China, Vietnam, India, or Myanmar. If they are not overseas, then they are in the meeting rooms. Therefore, they are unable to make "quick" decisions on various projects. Thirdly, the Government-linked companies are participating in too many projects. So for particular projects, they lack the sense of urgency and the motive of quick completion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from being slow, the entrepreneurs also observed that despite their "golden reputation", when these Government-linked companies go overseas to negotiate for projects and investment plans, they may not necessarily secure the most favoured terms. Also, some of these entrepreneurs are not quite happy with the attitude of the civil servants because the civil servants are used to being the "regulators". They have given people the impression that "you have to beg them, they would not beg you". On top of that, some civil servants who are in charge of GLCs are not familiar with the local situation and they lack the tact necessary for business dealings. Very often, these have resulted in some unnecessary obstacles and delay, even to the extent of spoiling the whole project.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite that, I still believe that the Government should have some means to narrow the gap between the private entrepreneurs and the Government-linked companies. In fact, they should complement and supplement each other. At the same time, the Government should play the catalytic role through these Government-linked companies and statutory boards for our overseas ventures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private entrepreneurs have also complained that the local banks are too conservative in their management style. They insisted that the local assets should be used as collateral for loans for overseas development. This has resulted
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in our entrepreneurs who are venturing overseas having to bear double risks. Some of them thought that this might be the requirement stipulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. I hope that the Minister for Finance will be able to clarify this point. More importantly, how are we going to allow our local entrepreneurs to use their overseas assets as collateral for loans? The entrepreneurs felt that the conservative style of our local banks is not in line with the Government's encouragement for our local people to venture overseas. They also suggested that the Government should consider setting up an overseas development bank at this critical moment, or to set up an overseas development fund with the banks to provide loans and thus spread the risk.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my personal view, the Government should do its best to assist our local entrepreneurs to venture overseas. The Prime Minister and the Senior Minister have been making many overseas trips to look for opportunities for Singaporeans to venture overseas. This is the Government's greatest assistance to our local entrepreneurs to venture overseas. This political goodwill is indeed an intangible asset for our overseas ventures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some entrepreneurs who go overseas for development are prone to complaining that they do not enjoy protection under the local laws, the lack of transparency of regulations, and the frequent changes of government policies. As a result, they have to take very great risks and sometimes they do not even know what to do. These entrepreneurs should realize that if these countries have all the comprehensive legal framework and regulations, strict enforcement of the law and consistency in policies, then they would not need our investments for development. To put it simply, when we go to these countries where the development policies are still in the groping stage, we are trying to find an equilibrium in a disequilibrium situation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we encourage Singaporeans to venture overseas, we cannot hollow out our domestic economy. We must not only
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> maintain our economic competitiveness, but also continue to attract foreign investments. I notice that the investment commitment from foreign sources in the manufacturing industy has steadily increased from $1.63 billion in 1989 to $3.15 billion in 1993. Recently, a foreign consortium has committed a $3.5 billion investment commitment in the petrochemical industry. This is encouraging. The Economic Development Board has put in a great effort in this aspect, and we must compliment EDB for that. I also notice that from 1989 to 1993, in the same period, the local investment commitments have fluctuated very much. I understand that the nature of investment is volatile. But why is it that the local investment commitment has fluctuated so much more than the foreign investment commitments? Does it mean that there has been a diversion of investment to foreign countries?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me deal with the next topic, ie, the role of government. The Minister for Finance said in his statement that the Government has a role to play in economic development. Although we rely on market forces, the Government needs to intervene in several areas such as education, skill training, upgrading of economic structure and the provision of a stable environment. I agree with the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feedback Unit has also discussed the issues relating to market forces and Government intervention with the community leaders. I noted that many people do not quite understand the operation of the market forces. More people ask for the Government to intervene in public housing, public transport, education and health care by providing subsidies. But, on the other hand, for any government intervention measure that affects their own pocket or to increase the Government's coffers, such as the foreign workers' levy and the COE, they will inevitably express strong objection and dissatisfaction. All over the streets, in coffeeshops, in restaurants, people discuss these matters. Many people want to know how much the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government has collected in these two areas. I note that in terms of fees and charges last year, the Government has collected $3 billion. How much of this came from COE and the foreign workers' levy? I would ask the Minister to give us some figures on these two items.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Minister did not put it explicitly, it is in fact quite clear that there is Government intervention in the distribution of income and wealth through subsidies on education, health care and social services. On 11th March last year, in answer to my question, the Minister said that because of the tax rebate and the lowering of tax rates, 74% of our residents will not have to pay any direct tax. In other words, from 1st April this year, although every consumer has to pay GST, the income tax burden will be shouldered by fewer taxpayers. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide some statistics to compare the changes in the number of taxpayers and tax collected for different income groups before and after the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax. In this way, our people will be able to understand better how the Government has redistributed wealth and income in order to benefit the lower income groups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also referred to the surpluses and reserves in his Budget Statement. This year, the estimated surplus is $2.2 billion which is much lower than the $6.97 billion for last year. Over the past two years, most of the surpluses were put into the Edusave Endowment Fund, Medifund and the CPF Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme. The Pension Fund to be set up will also be getting some of these surpluses. On the other hand, our reserves reached the level of $77.87 billion last year. However, this apparently massive amount of money can only sustain six months of imports. Furthermore, it is also lower than our GNP of $90.23 billion of last year. It is just like a family with savings of less than one year's income. I agree with the Minister for Finance that in good years, we should put more surpluses into our reserves for emergency use. Reserves and surpluses belong to the State and the people, not the Government. The Government only
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> collects and manages the funds. It collects taxes and charges on behalf of the people in order to pay for defence, social services and economic development. The money does not go into the pockets of the Ministers or the civil servants. It is only when the country enjoys prosperity and when the people are wealthy that the coffers will be enriched. It is very vicious and vilifying to say that "the Government has money but the people have none."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, in the short-term, the Government's task ahead is to deal with the impact of GST. But over the long term, the Government has to face three challenges:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) how to focus the people's attention on our national competitiveness, to build up our external economy, and to address the issue of our aging population;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) how to manage the rising expectations of the people. The Government cannot ignore the wishes and views of the people. But at the same time, the Government should not try to please everyone with material incentives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) how to strengthen the bond between the people and the Government. In this respect, we should enhance our people's national consciousness, the family concept and the moral values of the individuals. At the same time, the Government must make greater efforts to explain its policies so as to convince the people, to win their minds and their hearts. The Government should also adopt a caring attitude and take practical actions to help citizens who are not regarded as elite so that they will also understand that they have a part to play and a contribution to make. As for those poor and unfortunate people, the Government should provide assistance with warmth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the way to govern is to implement benevolent policies (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). The tactic to govern is to win the hearts of the people (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). As it is said, "He who wins the heart of the people, wins the universe." (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). This is the lesson of a few thousand years. We must never never forget the teaching from history.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong (Bukit Gombak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the aging of the population is a universal phenomenon. In view of the longer life expectancy of the people, a number of countries have now raised pension withdrawal age. But in Singapore, the PAP with its usual paternalistic style has now doubled the Minimum Sum, or one may call it the retirement account, to $80,000. Out of the $80,000, $40,000 will be attached to the property and the other $40,000 will be by way of cash which the CPF holder will not be allowed to withdraw but will be paid by way of annuity from the age of 60. Quite obviously, this particular measure has been taken on the assumption that Singaporeans cannot be trusted to look after themselves during their old age. Or that if the lump sum is allowed to be withdrawn at the age of 55, they would squander away this money. The question one must ask is this: is $40,000 sufficient to maintain a Singaporean? Obviously not, if one were to go on the expectancy of life. This would then lull the Singaporeans into a false sense of security. They would have thought: The Government has retained $40,000 from us. That is enough. I can afford to spend away whatever money I may have.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that we will have to consider is this. What the Government is doing now is contrary to the spirit and intent of the original CPF objective. Previously, it was actually meant as a forced saving and you will be allowed to withdraw at the age of 55 years. The first intrusion into this spirit is this. The Government has decided to retain Medisave. That is the first step. Now, the Minimum Sum. My question is: what next? Would parents of Down Syndrome children and physically and mentally handicapped children be required in future to have their account retained to maintain these poor children? I think the answer is quite obvious.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is this. All in all, the retirement account, together with Medisave, would come to a hefty $90,000. Of course, to everyone of you here, $90,000 is nothing. But we are talking in terms of more than half a million people in Singapore whose income is below $1,300. Is it right for this Government to retain
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> their hard-earned money, knowing that some of them may not have a chance to "smell" it before they leave this world? I would say that the Government has got no moral right to withhold the hard-earned money of the citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singaporeans are by nature very thrifty. In fact, now there is clear evidence that Singaporeans are preparing themselves for their old age. The fact is that the POSB accounts have increased and deposits have also increased to billions of dollars. The trend is that more and more Singaporeans are buying insurance policy, either for their old age or for their children's education and so on and so forth. These are good signs that Singaporeans are becoming more responsible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more factor that one must remember is this. Compared with 10-20 years ago, most of the men were the sole breadwinners, but now with widespread education, with higher education and with no unemployment problem in Singapore, nearly every household member does have a job. They can work and save the money. Why is there the necessity to withhold the money from these people? Of course, the Government very often cites the figures. In 30 years' time, we will have about 600,000 people over 65 years of age. Therefore, we need to look after them. However, we have to bear in mind one thing. These 600,000 people of tomorrow are the useful citizens of today. They are gainfully employed and they are not destitute. So, it may well be that the ratio is three young men to one old person. So what? These old people are not supported by three young men because in their lifetime they would have saved sufficient money for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell Members here: let us not compare with Australia, New Zealand or Switzerland. Singapore cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered a welfare state. These countries have got unemployment benefits. They have so many benefits. In Singapore, we only have the basic subsidies. So let us not compare with these countries. If you want to compare, let us compare.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> We have no unemployment!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> It is precisely that we have no unemployment, why do you want to retain the people's money? I give due credit to the Government for creating a society where employment is not a problem. But my point is this. That being the case, what is the necessity of retaining the people's money and not allowing them to have their hard-earned money? That is the point. You contradict yourself.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that Singapore brags itself that it wants to achieve a society where almost every Singaporean will own a property, for example, a HDB flat, and the value will keep going up. That being the case, why cannot this property, an asset of the people, be considered as a pledge for their old age, instead of retaining their money? Of course, the Prime Minister made a statement, "Oh, they do not want to sell the property". If the children are not bothered with the parents and if the parents are the owners of the flat, sell it by all means. What is there to bother? Quite obviously, he must be in a financial strait. The money can be withdrawn over a period of time and when he dies, the Government can repossess the whole flat, set off this amount with interest, and the balance can go to whoever he has willed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of the Government has a very uncomforting insinuation about these old people, and it could be us by that time. We are considered as dregs and are of no use to society. That is why you say, "Sorry, we have to withhold your money because you would become dregs in time to come." We are these 600,000 people of tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to move on to another topic. I read in the newspapers that the Government will be making a lump sum payment into the Medisave accounts of about 400 to 500 civil servants who have got five years or less to go before their retirement, but the amount has yet to be worked out. My question is this: what about the other 64,000-plus people, especially those who have served the Government, and who have 10 years
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> or more to go before their retirement? Members will recollect that during the debate on the revision of salaries of the Ministers and civil servants, the emphasis was all the time on market rate. It was all the time on bridging the disparity between the public and private sectors, ie, how the income of the public sector should be brought as close to the private sector as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this package deal, if the Government says that Divisions II, III and below have been paid more than enough and they are actually on par with the private sector, that is a different matter entirely. If it is not, then it must be a factor to be considered. Can the component of the increment not be broken down? Some of the civil servants get 7.1%. Let us have the components broken down, and say, "Okay, to bring you in line with the private sector, we need to give you 3% or 4% increment. And in view of the fact that you have chosen to be under the old scheme, you would not get the other component, which is meant as compensation for those who have opted for the new medical benefits scheme, ie, either under the Comprehensive Co-payment Scheme or the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient Scheme." Would the Minister consider this and let the civil servants decide on this point? Either way, I would say that for those who have opted for the old scheme, they should be given the increment. Honestly, I find it hard to believe that the Public Service Division could make such a boo-boo when they declared that those who have opted to remain under the old scheme would not be given any increment. I find it hard to believe that such an efficient Government of ours could make such a boo-boo there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to mention is this. The Singapore Government practises meritocracy. They believe and endorse equal opportunity for all and they believe in equality. I find it hard to believe why the Government is not prepared to offer the women civil servants the same medical benefits for their children as the male civil servants. There is no reason at all. Financially, it involves only $8.1 million. We must practise what we preach. Set a good example.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on to the next point, I would like to declare my interest first. I am a practising lawyer. I have a son who is a practising lawyer and I have another son who is a third-year law student. The Singapore Government is well-known as an ardent advocate and exponent of the free market economy, and of free opportunity and it is against protectionism. The recent amendment to the Legal Profession Act to restrict or cap the number of lawyers is something which I would like to highlight. In Singapore, it is the wish of the parents, as the Chinese saying goes, wang zi cheng long (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). It may be the dreams of the parents and the aspirations of the children to become doctors or lawyers. But now, with the recent amendment, it would appear that some of them would have their dreams shattered. As Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon had spoken before, with the amendment, the Singapore Government would take in 50 from the 15 recognised universities in the United Kingdom. What happens if you have 70 of them, all having Second Class Upper Honours? How do you pick 50 from the 70 graduates when they are of equal merit? How do you pick them?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more salient point here is this. Because of the stringent admission criteria of the National University of Singapore, some applicants would be rejected. But of those applicants who have been rejected admission to the National University of Singapore, some would have made the grade had they gone overseas, and they would have no problem getting a Second Class Upper overseas. Here comes the inequity. You have two applicants, for example, both of them were rejected by the National University of Singapore because of the high standards for admission here. You have two applicants - one is from a well-off family, while the other is from a poor family. If these two persons have gone overseas to one of the 15 universities, they would have been admitted and would have achieved a Second Class Upper. They would come back and be qualified to take up the Diploma course. But the parents of the boy or girl from the poor family do not have the financial means to send the kid to the university in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> England. He or she will have no chance to be a doctor or lawyer. Is it fair that this should happen in Singapore? I am asking this House: is it fair? If the Government makes a ruling that only those who do not qualify, fair enough. But the point is some could even go by way of the back-door, ie, go to UK and come back. We are drawing a distinction between the rich and the poor. I hope the Government will really look into this and consider this factor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have observed that this Government is so obsessed with accumulating more and more surpluses that it is giving less and less in subsidy to Singaporeans. A Singaporean is likened to Qing Shi Huang (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). You know the building of the Great Wall of China. But how much did it cost to build the Great Wall of China? Thousands and thousands of people died and were buried just to build the Great Wall of China. Perhaps we need Meng Jiang Nu ku dao wan li chang cheng (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just heard Mr Ling How Doong speak at length on a few issues. In fact, I could recall briefly four issues. First, the CPF Minimum Sum Scheme, then the salary increase of civil servants, next, something on the amendments to the Legal Profession Act and, finally, medical benefits for female civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today is the debate on the Budget, and these four issues are actually old issues. They are passe. They had been debated in the past and Ministers had answered them fully in the past. I do not know why Mr Ling has taken this occasion to repeat them during the Budget debate. In fact, more specifically, the issues he raised on the CPF Minimum Sum Scheme have just been very recently debated during the debate on the Presidential Address. Many Members have raised questions and asked for clarifications from the Minister. The Minister has given many clear replies to this issue. Perhaps he was not here in that very long debate which
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> lasted many days. Therefore, he touched on these issues here again. But these are issues that have been fully debated in the past.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point he raised was that the Government is giving less and less to the people. I would like to counter this point. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think if he has read the Budget carefully, he must acknowledge that this year's Budget is definitely very pro-individual. The individual receives quite a few goodies. Besides the 3% personal tax cut, he also gets a 5% tax rebate, HDB service and conservancy charges and rental charges rebates as well as $300 CPF Share Ownership Top-up into his account. If Mr Ling does not like this Budget, perhaps he would like to ask the Minister to withdraw all these concessions to the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, this year's Budget is in fact a very significant and well-considered one. Many people in the business community have expressed disappointment in this Budget, as it has not offered any major incentives to the business sector. Since we have achieved better than expected growth in 1993, and attained healthy budget surpluses for several years, the business community has expected to be very well rewarded.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain to the House why I thought this year's Budget is in fact a very good one: it is very significant and well-thought through.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, as the Minister has said in an interview on SBC, this year's Budget should be viewed as a continuation of the 1993 Budget. This year is significant in that you will see the introduction of a very comprehensive indirect tax regime, that is, the GST of 3%. At the same time, corporate and personal taxes are being slashed by 3% and various tax rebates and grants are given to the individuals, especially those of the lower-income group.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous years, the budgets had generally been pro-business. This is valid as we have to recover from a major recession in the mid-1980s. Then the world economy was generally weak in the early 1990s. The USA, Europe and Japan
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> were in recession. During these periods, pro-business budgets were necessary, so as to stimulate economic growth. However, for last year and this year's Budget, Singapore has already reached the pink of health. For 1993, we chalked up an economic growth rate of 9.9%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the healthy state of the economy, now we have to be very cautious that the Budget is not overly stimulative. Moreover, since we are introducing a 3% GST, there is added concern of inflationary impact. We should be watchful over the economy being over-heated. With an over-heated economy, it may also give rise to the risk of an over-inflated stock market and property market. As we know, last year we saw a very active and buoyant stock market as well as the property market. Since the economy is strong and steady, I feel that only minor fine-tuning is needed. Therefore, the Finance Minister is in fact correct to have chosen a conservative and cautious approach this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would like to commend the Minister for his very appropriate diagnosis of the health of the economy and prescribing the right dose of medicine. There is a Chinese saying dui zheng xia yao (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) - which means to apply the medicine best suited to the illness of the patient. However, in this instance, the patient is actually not sick at all. Another Chinese saying that best describes the situation is wu bing sheng yin (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), which means to moan and groan, although one is not ill. If a person is well and in robust health, there is no need to feed him with any more stimulants, otherwise he will be "overheated", in Hokkien, we say "tai luat". Therefore, what he actually needs is a balanced diet and also ample exercise, including doing more outdoor activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about venturing outdoor, the Government has actively exhorted our business people and professionals to venture overseas. The Government has done a lot for local businessmen. In the past two years, our Government leaders had led many business delegations to China, India and Vietnam. This year's Budget has offered some tax and CPF
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> incentives for those who venture abroad. I think these incentives are a good start. While it is helpful to have the Government to lead the way, but eventually to land the specific deal or contract, the businessmen have to strike out by themselves. Just like school children, for primary school kids, it might be expected of the parents to fetch them to and fro the school. However, once they have reached secondary and university levels, the school children will have to learn to travel by themselves independently.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many stories of Singaporean businessmen who have ventured out early on their own, and made good. To further assist our local businessmen, especially the SMEs, in sourcing business contacts and deals overseas, I say that the Government can do the following:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to organise more overseas visits led by Government leaders, including Ministers, targeted at specific industries. Government bodies such as EDB, TDB, or even JTC, can lead delegations overseas. To spread the net wider and to get more local businessmen involved, the private sector associations such as SMA, the ASME, the various Chambers of Commerce like the Chinese, Malay and Indian Chambers of Commerce can also be encouraged to organise their own trade and business delegations overseas, so as to assist their members establish contacts and open doors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government can also establish more trade and commercial representative offices overseas under the EDB or TDB in the main overseas cities in countries like PRC, India and Vietnam.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, thirdly, while we venture to the less developed countries such as in East Asia, we should not forget about opportunities in countries nearer home, such as South-East Asian countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. The Government can also lead business delegations to these countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While businessmen are venturing overseas, opportunities are abound, but these should not be restricted to large organisations and businesses. Even the small-time businessmen who have the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> pioneering spirit can venture abroad. Just the other day I heard that a local businessman is actively working out the details for setting up a beef kuay teow outlet in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was said in the past that Singapore is a fine city. What they actually mean is that Singapore imposes fines liberally. There is a $500 fine for littering, another fine for not flushing the toilet, and so on. Now I feel that we can call Singapore a "fine and fund" city. "Fund" here I mean "fund", not "fun". Do you notice that there are many funds in Singapore? There are the Skills Development Fund, Venture Capital Fund, University Endowment Fund, Medisave Fund, R&amp;D Fund, and the latest, the big fund called the Cluster Development Fund. Even at the grassroots level, we have our own CC Building Funds. There are so many Funds. Singapore is really a "fund" place, and fund-raising is a perennial affair. But this demonstrates that, fortunately, the Singapore Government and the Singapore people are flushed with money and capital. Therefore, it is appropriate that some of these funds can be channelled to overseas investments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest brother of all Funds in Singapore is the very pervasive Central Provident Fund. Calls have constantly been made to use CPF for various purposes. I would like to add one more request for its use, and that is, to ask the Government to consider allowing CPF to be used for foreign investments sometime in the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the ordinary salaried worker has not caught on the venturing overseas fever. One of the very few means for him to participate is to buy shares of listed companies with strong overseas drive. To enable the ordinary people to invest directly in overseas projects, the Government can consider allowing CPF funds to be used for specific approved projects. I admit that this idea is still in its very early stage at present. Naturally, we must tread with caution on the use of CPF money. But sometime in the future,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> if venturing overseas is proven to be a viable strategy, the Government can then consider allowing the people to invest in very specific approved projects overseas. An example is the recently announced Singapore-Suzhou project. It can become a privatisation scheme like the Singapore Telecom where Singaporeans are allowed to invest their CPF money in these privatised projects. Again, I must reiterate the need to be cautious on the use of CPF funds for overseas projects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to move on to comment on some very specific tax incentives.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Property Tax Reduction</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax rate has been reduced from 16% to 15%. Given the rapid increase in property prices each year, especially for residential, retail and industrial properties, the savings for business of this 1% cut will be easily eroded by higher property capital values. That is, in effect, in spite of the 1% cut, companies may still be paying higher property tax in absolute terms. Hence, I believe there is justification for the Government to reduce the property tax rate to the targeted 12% more rapidly over the next few years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Employer's CPF Contribution Rate</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase of 1 1/2% on employer's CPF contribution rate is quite large. Plus the increase in the Skills Development Fund (SDF) ceiling from $750 to $1,000, the combined effect of these two increases could add another 2%, or so, to the total staff cost incurred by companies. This is quite a big sum for companies to bear. To mitigate the effect of CPF and SDF increases, I thought that the Government could have considered a more gradual increase of, say, 1/2% or 3/4% from the employer's CPF contribution and spread the increase of 1 1/2% over two to three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>GST</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed an opportune time to introduce GST when our economy is robust. Many companies can absorb some of the costs of the GST increase. I would
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> like to congratulate the Finance Minister for his very impeccable timing. However, I would like to urge him to take extra caution and monitor those businesses which attempt to profiteer on the GST increase, by jacking up their prices excessively. I suggest that perhaps watchdog groups, particularly at the constituency level, can be formed to monitor price increases. For example, our Citizens' Consultative Committees of all the constituencies can be mobilised to form Profiteering Monitoring Groups (PMGs) to watch over retailers in the constituency who might attempt to profiteer from the GST increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Tax Concessions for the Individual</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the Finance Minister for giving so many goodies to the individual in this year's Budget. In fact, it is opportune to reward the individual as he has worked hard to build up the economy. Previous years' Budgets have been generally pro-business. It is right that this year is pro-individual. Of the many incentives given, I am particularly heartened by the higher level of rebates for HDB service and conservancy charges and rental charges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also most considerate of the Government that higher levels of rebates are given to the lower-income groups, such as, those in the 1-room, 2-room and 3-room categories. These groups may not fully enjoy the 3% reduction in personal income tax since they have low incomes and, therefore, do not pay much income taxes. On the other hand, they have to face the brunt of the full impact of the 3% GST. I would like to urge the Government to continue with these measures to help the lower-income groups as long as healthy budget balances can support these concessions. In fact, I feel more can be done by the Government if it can afford to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I wish to conclude by commenting that while the business community has felt disappointed by the Budget, they should not be. The Government has always been keenly aware of the need to create a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> main policy direction in this year's Budget is to introduce the GST. They should allow the GST regime to work its course before considering any stimulative measures. The Government must be watchful over the threat of inflation and those who attempt to profiteer from the GST increase. The above are the reasons why I thought this year's Budget is, in fact, significant and well-considered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leading industrialised economies, such as, USA, Europe and Japan are showing signs of emerging from the recession. On the other hand, East Asian giants, such as, China, India, Indonesia and others are awakening and beginning to boom. With a firm guiding hand, the Government has led local businesses to sail far and wide to seek our fortunes. Exciting times are ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I comment on what Mr Ling How Doong has said about the recent measures taken to amend the Legal Profession Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to express my surprise that he now raises this matter several months after the Legal Profession Act was amended in November, and the main thrust of the amendments was to give effect to the Report of the Attorney-General's Committee on the Supply of Lawyers. I have looked at the Hansard here and I find that he did not even bother to attend that sitting. If it was an important issue to him where he had views, I would have thought he would have made it a point to attend the sitting and express his views. He seems to have suddenly woken up to this only several months later.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me say that it is not sufficient to come to this House and dismiss the various amendments which were made as being unfair because Members will recall that in my speech, during the Second Reading of the Bill, I emphasised that these measures and the recommendations of the Attorney-General's Committee were founded on public interest and national interest and clear arguments were given in the Report of the Attorney-General why these measures were needed, why there has to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be an optimum projected growth rate of lawyers, and why it is necessary to maintain quality. If he disagrees with it, I think it is incumbent on him to tell us which aspects of the rationale, which aspects of the arguments of the Attorney-General's Report he finds fault with. If necessary, he can move an adjournment motion so that we can have a full debate. But it is necessary for him to tell us which of the premises and arguments which led to the measures he disagrees with.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> May I speak?
  <br>

  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Ling.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the thrust of my speech in respect of this is in two areas. One, as spoken by Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon before, is the inequity. The question is: when you restrict to 50 of Second Class Upper, what happens when you have 70? That is what I am worried about. How do you go about choosing from 70 applicants who are of equal merit and say, "Okay, 50 of you are qualified to come, the other 20 are out of the picture." That is the thrust of my speech.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is that, as I mentioned earlier, the admission criteria to the National University of Singapore are very stringent. Therefore, there could be a number of qualified applicants who have been rejected. They could have secured good results but, because of the limited vacancies in our University, they were rejected. If they had gone to the United Kingdom, they would have been easily admitted to one of the 15 universities. The inequity comes in here. You have one parent who is well off and you have another parent who is poor. The rich one, by virtue of being rich, can be a lawyer, but the poor chap cannot be a lawyer. That is my thrust.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The most important question to address here is: does the Member agree that what is essential for Singapore, and for the legal profession, is to ensure that the system is such that the legal profession gets a fair share of the best into the legal profession? Does he agree with that basic premise?

  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Mr Speaker, I have known of people who are qualified but are not even admitted to the Medical Faculty. In fact, the Government is doing all these things. So what difference does it make? It is not that all the good ones will go to one particular stream. I do not think that is the case because all along in Singapore, I know that, as a fact, admission to the various faculties does not necessarily depend on this. In fact, there is some sort of engineering going on in Singapore all this while.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> He has not answered the question. Does he agree, or not agree, that we must ensure good quality in the legal profession? It is a simple question.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I really do not understand. With this arrangement, how can you ensure that the good ones will come in? I have already emphasised the fact that if you have 70 applicants who are qualified to come in, how do you make a distinction as to which 20 must go out and which 50 must come in? And how do you explain that, to a certain extent, only the rich can be doctors and lawyers, but not the poor?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I think the Minister for Education has emphasised, on many occasions, that no person is denied admission to the University solely because he cannot afford it. But the Member has refused to answer my question. Because if the answer to the question - he refuses to answer - is yes, I am surprised because, as a member of the legal profession, surely he must agree that it is necessary to ensure high quality for entrance to the legal profession. If that answer is yes, then whether it is 60, 70, or 80, and if there are 50 places, the best 50 will be taken in. Does he agree to the question?

  <!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Mohammed (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate on the Budget Statement 1994.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year in and year out, Sir, varying views and opinions are given to describe the Budget and this year is no different. Overall, the reaction has been positive and it must be so given the fact that existing taxes are maintained and no new taxes are introduced. This is made possible because of the stronger than expected economic growth over the past year resulting again in a healthy budget surplus which once again proved the Ministry of Finance has pursued sound and pragmatic fiscal policies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for me, Sir, I would like to join the ranks of those who hailed this year's Budget Statement as a "people's Budget" having taken into account the various rebates, perks and incentives dished out to almost every sector of our society. Some quarters in the business sector perceived it as "pro-worker" or "pro-individual" and feel dissatisfied.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could this dissatisfaction be attributed to their assumption that being "pro-worker" must be contrary to business interests? I certainly hope not because if this was so, perhaps it could be due to a misinterpretation of the actual intention. In fact, the Budget is pro-business in many respects like the property tax cut of 1% (which could work out to as high as 15%
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> savings for some businesses), tax perks for lending and borrowing of securities and extension of tax relief period for economic expansion incentives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the majority of Singaporeans will concede that the Budget is good for both the individuals and the businessman. As one informed source has put it, the whole package of measures announced last year and this year are designed to propel Singapore into its next stage of economic development, ie, to be in the First League of developed nations as we enter the 21st century, and must be consciously seen against this economic backdrop.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me now to touch on some specific issues contained in the Budget Statement. Firstly, I would like to focus on the final restoration of the CPF cut with effect from 1st July 1994. By keeping to its word in increasing the employer's contribution and reducing the employee's contribution this year consistent with the strong across-the-board economic growth of 9.9% achieved last year, the Government has restored workers' confidence and this will augur well for the future. The recent pre-budget call by some employers to defer the restoration was inappropriate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say so? It is because workers have accepted the stage-by-stage restoration without much fuss despite favourable economic growth and have waited eight years for the full restoration to the new target of 20%. Have employers forgotten that when the cut of 15% was made in 1986 it was done in a single stroke. Employers should not forget that prior to the 1986 cut, their previous contribution was 25% as opposed to the current rate of 20%, ie, workers have forgone 5 percentage points which in monetary terms is no mean sum. Surely employers cannot be worse off when their pre-cut contribution was 25%. On the contrary, the reality is that workers have sacrificed much by restraining themselves in not demanding for the full pre-cut restoration. This demonstrates that our workers are responsible and positive. In this

  <br>
  <br> connection, Sir, may I ask whether it is possible to restore the additional 5% employer's contribution in the near future?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on the subject of CPF, it is indeed laudable for the Government to make a commitment to top up every CPF account with $300 to enable adult Singaporeans to buy shares. By giving an 18-month period for Singaporeans to build their co-payment share of $750, the Government is giving more than ample opportunity for every working citizen above 21 years of age to participate in share ownership in a manageable and responsible manner without having to indulge in speculation and risk getting their fingers burnt. Thus, I would like to urge every adult Singaporean not to miss this good opportunity as there are not many countries in the world whose governments will take the trouble to go that extra mile to enhance the well-being of its citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I would like to make some comments on the Skills Development Fund (SDF) levy. To me, the revision of the salary ceiling is overdue as the present level of $750 is already out of date and no longer realistic bearing in mind that the SDF levy was introduced in 1979. However, I have heard that employers are concerned about this increase and this is understandable. However, employers must remember that the SDF was set up primarily for the skills upgrading of their employees and retraining of retrenched workers. Thus, employers stand to gain if workers' skills are upgraded through training and retraining as it will lead to increased productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another relevant fact is that SDF disbursements far outstripped its collection. On the average, SDF could only collect $13 million to $14 million a year whereas its current disbursements could amount to $50 million and beyond. Even with the raising of the salary ceiling to $1,000, it is anticipated that SDF's collection will still be below its collection level during its initial years. This is because the pool of workers to be trained, in particular the older workers, is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> getting larger which therefore requires more money to be channelled into training so that Singapore can continue to maintain its competitive edge.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen against the scenario I have just given, it is clear that over the years with fewer and fewer workers earning $750 or below, employers have benefitted more than they contributed and hence enjoyed cost savings. We have to come to grips with the reality that economic restructuring has become part and parcel of our Singapore way of life. With the pressing need and increasing importance of training and retraining, I would like to suggest that the salary ceiling for SDF levy be raised to $1,500 instead of $1,000. I sincerely hope that my suggestion will be considered so as to benefit as many workers given the existing educational profile of our workforce which is still some way behind the other Newly Industrialising Countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, permit me now to move on to my last point, ie, the rebates on HDB service and conservancy (S&amp;C) charges and rentals. This is indeed a boon to the ordinary man-in-the-street as these rebates are additional to the GST offset rebates which take effect from 1st April this year. Such additional rebates are reassuring as there is still a fair amount of fear and anxiety as already some retailers and businessmen have started to increase prices unnecessarily and blame it on the forthcoming GST. Once again, this gesture reiterates Government's commitment to utilise part of the budget surplus, where circumstances permit, to improve the lives of Singaporeans. I would like to urge the Government to vigorously pursue this principle as the beneficiaries are the low-income earners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the motion moved by the Minister for Finance.

  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to comment on an issue that crops up here and there in this year's Budget Statement but never forming part of the budget proper. I refer to the issue of privatisation, more particularly, the implications of privatisation. Some people, for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> instance, have voiced their fear that privatisation will lead to higher prices. My concern is the effect privatisation may have on our quality of life. I am also concerned with the principle of free market that is espoused by the Government though privatisation does not sit well with the practice of the Government elsewhere in the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first say I understand and appreciate the need for the Government to privatise some of its functions. For one thing, we will have a leaner and fitter bureaucracy, which is in keeping with our image of a health-conscious society. No, I am not opposed to privatisation. I am only put off by the way privatisation is presented to us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whenever the Government decides to do something or other, the Government tells us what the Government has decided is the best thing we can do or have. Of course, the Government is very open minded about the whole thing and is prepared to hear what we have to say. In the end, we must accept the Government has decided correctly for us. From the absolute manner in which the Government expresses its decision, we can be sure the Government thinks it is on the right track.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we promote courtesy, nothing is to be prized more than courtesy, even if you smile with a mouthful of rotten teeth. When we promote a green environment, nothing is as healthy and pleasant as a green environment, even if your drain is slimy with moss. When we promote productivity, nothing gives more satisfaction than an increase in productivity, even if you are very rude when achieving it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the same with privatisation. Privatisation must be good since the Government has decided upon the privatisation of its departments and statutory boards. Of course, we are allowed to quibble on the word "privatisation". To the purists, the Government's effort to restructure its hospitals hardly counts as privatisation. A privatised enterprise should operate and behave like a private enterprise, without any help or hindrance
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> from the Government. However, we have to accept that a privatised enterprise is one which is licensed to make profit from the public and one about which the Members in this House cannot ask too many questions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Government department or statutory board is privatised, we naturally expect the former department or statutory board to be self-sufficient and to be no longer a drain on the Government's revenue. We also expect the staff of the privatised enterprise to work harder than ever to make a success of their venture into the uncertain world of private enterprise and to be rewarded accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are not prepared for is that the attitude of the staff and the services they render to the public may change somewhat after privatisation. We hope it is for the better; but if our luck is bad, it may be for the worse. I am not talking about superficial courtesy. One thing the staff of a privatised enterprise are sure to be instructed by their boss is that a toothy smile is good for business and profit, even if it is as artificial as their dentures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers may no longer be viewed as people whom the staff can serve and help, as they are now rendering a commercial, and not a public service. Customers are not so much human persons as walking dollar notes who are valued according to their denominations, that is, ability to contribute to their privatised enterprise's coffer. The customers who can give most profit to them will receive A1 service with the broadest and friendliest smile. The customers who can barely pay for the services they receive will be given the minimum service without any superfluous smile. If privatised customers do not get a frown, it is because a smile costs less time and effort than a frown.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope our privatised enterprises will never show such a commercial face to our public. But this is a very real danger that comes with our emphasis on profit-making as the bottom line for our privatised enterprise. With more and more privatised enterprises expected to make the scene here, our promotion of a caring and sharing society may be the first casualty.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has assured us, in the Budget Statement, that it is prepared to intervene where the people are too weak or poor to withstand free market forces. Such assurance does credit to the Government. As a matter of fact, the restructured hospitals do make a provision for patients who cannot afford the full cost of privatised health care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some people are relatively weak or poor because of the Government's intervention in the first place. I refer to our workers, whose wages are rigidly regulated in the national interest. The activities of the NWC and restrictive provisions in our industrial legislation all help to ensure that our workers contribute to the maintenance of Singapore's competitive edge. For instance, the NTUC sees to it that wage level does not outstrip the workers' productivity rate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, privatised enterprises do not have to worry about pricing themselves well above their cost level. Their only consideration is they do not price themselves out of existence. The Government has publicly assured that it will undertake to monitor and regulate the rate of charges levied by the restructured hospitals. But no similar assurance is given by any one regarding the rate of charges in the privatised food centres. It may be argued that hawker food prices are insignificant compared to the hospital charges. But, we hope, hospital charges are incurred once in a blue moon, while workers have to pay hawker food charges day in and day out. They amount to a tidy sum over a period of time and are a burden on the workers' pocket.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has convinced us that privatisation is very desirable from the Government's point of view. It remains to be seen whether privatisation will benefit the public as much as it benefits the Government.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will get down to the brass tack issues which affect the ordinary persons at the grassroots level.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's Budget has brought benefits to the low income workers and their families. The service and conservancy rebates, the restoration of the employer's contribution of CPF to 20% and the share ownership cash grant scheme of $300, do reflect the Government's concern for reducing the burden of the lower income people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Singapore Government is the only Government that I know of that promotes actively asset accumulation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, imagine if we do not have CPF that has been implemented since 1954, then we would not be able to talk about withdrawal of savings at 55, and many people may not be able to accumulate savings by then if it has been free for all. If you take the case of Hong Kong, where it is a free market and there is no CPF, a lot of them are now asking for CPF, which is quite the reverse in comparison to our case. The issue that we have to address is savings at old age and how this is going to be drawn out in terms of allowing people to use their savings effectively when they are old. I think that is the basic question that we have to address. The Member for Bukit Gombak in fact has missed the issue. I feel that this whole issue of CPF will have to be looked at in that context.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget for this year is significant on several counts. In my comments on the budget last year, I highlighted that the Government, though no doubt generous, could have been more generous. I particularly singled out two groups of people which I felt more could have been done. These are the lower income group and the pensioners. Thus, this year I am glad that the Government has been more generous to the lower income group. In fact, to be fair, the generosity accorded by the Government has expanded in scope. This is evident in that more people than last year stand to benefit from the Government's bonus. This time round not just the very poor benefitted but also those who have just enough to meet the monthly expense. And I believe this group is rather substantial. Sir, I hope that the Government will continue to give annual rebates and other bonuses as long as the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> economy is doing well. This will in fact strengthen the bond between the people and the Government because, in the final analysis, to the common man, it is the issue whether they are getting the direct benefits and whether Government surpluses are, to some extent, reallocated in good times to the ordinary working class. If this is continued, then the bonding between the people and the Government will be further strengthened. So I hope that in good times the Minister for Finance would be able to continue to provide more rebates to the ordinary working class and others who have worked hard to improve the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the pool of Singaporeans in the workforce has increased, and as more of our nuclear families have both parents working, the net result is that more and more people are liable to pay personal income tax. Hence, the move to reduce the one-off 5% personal income tax, I am sure, is welcomed by most, if not all. However, Sir, I am told that people still have some nagging anxiety about the Budget. The man-in-the-street feels that all these extra monies would be absorbed when the GST takes effect. I think this feeling and concern is quite real because the ultimate analysis is that the impact of GST and increased cost on the ordinary persons will have to be addressed. Although I feel that this is a misinformed viewpoint, the concern is quite rampant at the grassroots level. Whatever extra they need to pay out, I am sure the Minister will argue, has been considered by the Government and these remedies have been effected. I have been reassured by the Minister for Finance that a large section of Singaporeans would not be worse off when GST comes into effect. For those who are worse off, particularly those who face hardship because they have no income, or they are on public assistance, I hope some immediate assistance would be extended to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am inclined to believe that the GST in itself is good for the people in general and good for the country in particular. The threat, however, comes not from GST. The fear of the people comes from the unintended consequences of the GST,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that is, profiteering. Quite rightly so, too, Sir, as many of the benefits of the GST appear rather vague to people until it is implemented. The effect will take shape then. There may be a cascading effect when GST is implemented. This is the general thinking at the ground level. Sir, what is real, right now, to people is that prices have gone up pre-GST, and, in some instances, quite dramatically. These are over-profiteering by some greedy businessmen. By recognising that there is profiteering, the Government recognises that there is a problem. What is discomforting to the people is that the Government seems to know what is wrong but appears unable to deal with it effectively because it is left very much to the free market to deal with these consequences. Now that profiteering has occurred before GST, it is important to know if businessmen will profiteer further after GST. Hence, the Prime Minister's call for prices, pre- and post-GST, to be monitored is most reassuring. Sir, concrete solutions, I feel, against profiteering in some form of consumer action, either by CASE or at grassroots level through various grassroots' organisations, can be organised. Perhaps, withdrawal of licences for those who profiteer should be instituted against those who are greedy and who profiteer too much.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of our growing aging population, I am indeed pleased to note that a higher interest rate would be given to the Special and Minimum Sum accounts above the normal usual rates accorded by CPF. However, Sir, the rate is not attractive. I hope a 2% or 2 1/4% higher than the normal interest rate would be a greater incentive for people to save in the CPF after 55 years. Sir, besides this, there is a working group of single persons and others who look after their aged sick parents by employing domestic maids. It would be fair to give them tax deduction for their maid levy. This is a good gesture in recognition of their efforts and concern. Otherwise, some of them would probably be sending and admitting their parents to the home for the aged.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I highlighted two groups of Singaporeans in last year's Budget Statement. I am glad that the Government has responded to one of the two groups that I have represented. I wish the Government could do more for the lower-income pensioners. Sir, there is a sizeable number of pensioners who have pensions of less than $500. It saddens me that the plight of this group of pensioners is not given more attention than they deserve. The increasing cost of living has really eroded their income. With the GST, they are likely to be affected further, and their income will be eroded further, although much reassurance has been given by the Minister for Finance that they will be getting rebates and other forms of subsidies. But to them, I think the problem is crucial and real. Sir, can anything be done for them? Should they not deserve a review of their small pensions? Sir, how can we attract people to join the civil service when it is seen that the pensioners who have served umpteen years for the Government have become a forgotten lot and they have to from time to time put a case for review of their pension? Sir, the contributions of our pensioners to the good of Singapore cannot be debated. It has been well argued in this House by many of the hon. Members before me. Last year, when the subject was touched, the Minister for Finance said that he sympathised with the small-time pensioners. I hope his sympathy will be translated into some concrete actions to help the pensioners. Hopefully, Sir, their Singapore Allowance will be reviewed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in other years, the Straits Times, this year predictably in its 24th February issue, praised the Budget in its banner headline as follows: "Dr Hu hands out hongbao Budget."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hongbao was certainly not given to the business community in Singapore. Many businessmen thought this year's budget was a disappointment, in the light
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of the GST which shall be implemented on 1st April this year. The stock market certainly thought that the Budget was a disappointment. After picking up prior to the Budget day on 23rd February, it took a 38-point plunge the following day after the Budget was revealed. Generally, to the business community in Singapore, the mood was one of gloom after the Budget was unveiled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen expected a further cut in the individual and corporate taxes. They expected a further one to two percent cut in corporate tax over and above the 3% corporate tax reduction given in last year's budget. This fact was reflected in the Straits Times report of 25th February under the heading: "Budget offers little to defray costs of implementing GST." The article, inter-alia, stated, "Businessmen struggling with the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax yesterday said that they were disappointed that the Budget had little to offer to compensate their time and money in GST preparations."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hongbao in the Budget was not given to the businessmen, was it given to the masses of lower income Singaporeans? The Straits Times seems to think so. Chan Sue Meng, writing in the Straits Times of 24th February, has this to say:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finance Minister Richard Hu yesterday handed Singaporeans, specially the less well off, a big hongbao - in the form of a generous Budget for fiscal year 1994. The goodies include a 5% income tax rebate across the board for year of Assessment 1994, and rebates on service and conservancy charges and rentals for those who live in one to five-room HDB flats."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the 5% income tax rebate really a goodie? Certainly not for the masses of the lower income Singaporeans; the majority of whom in any event pay very little income tax, perhaps less than $100 a year. The majority of these low wage earners will comprise the 76% of taxpayers who shall not pay income tax on the introduction of GST this year. So the 5% rebate could hardly benefit them. It is the rich that will be much better off with the 5% income tax rebate, in particular, the upper 8% of income taxpayers who pay the bulk of income tax collected by the Government every year. The 5% income
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tax proportionately will come to a sizeable amount. Therefore, as far as the 5% income tax rebate is concerned, it will benefit the rich, and benefit the poor only marginally.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the rebates on HDB service and conservancy charges and HDB rentals are concerned, those rebates could certainly be more generous, if they are really meant to offset the impact of GST this year. The inflation in the first year due to introduction of GST shall most likely be 9%, like the New Zealand experience, rather than 5% as touted by some quarters. If the inflation is going to be nearer the 9% level in the first year of introduction of the GST, then the rebates given to the one-to five-room HDB flats are insufficient to meet the inflation caused by the GST. The Government should be more generous and give an additional one to two months' rebates in respect of service and conservancy charges and rentals. The HDB rebates that I recommend may be very conservative compared to the surpluses accumulated by the Government each year. Yes, the hongbao in the Budget has not benefitted the business community or the masses of the poorer Singaporeans. The hongbao in the form of budget surpluses, most of which are paid by Singaporeans, have entirely been benefitted by the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget surplus last year was reported to be a mind-boggling sum of $7 billion. It is a massive sum of money looked at from every angle. The total Government expenditure last year was expected to reach $15.5 billion. It is not uncommon for governments in the developed nations year after year to have a deficit budget. I am not saying here that the Singapore Government should aim for a deficit budget. But it would appear that the Singapore Government is trying to establish a record in the accumulation of money. The $7 billion surplus last year represented 45% of its total expenditure. That must certainly be a world record or near a world record in achieving budget surpluses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Government aims to have a $2.2 billion budget surplus. The Government aims to get richer and richer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The question is, "at whose expense?" Singaporeans will without hesitation tell you that it is at their expense. Singaporeans are being squeezed by frequent cost increases, most of which are Government initiated. The common complaint amongst workers is, "The Government has so much money and yet it is collecting more and more from us. What do they do with all those monies?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is the envy of many governments in the West. They are envious of the Singapore Government because it is in a position where it can collect and accumulate so much money. At one time, the New Zealand government attempted to start a forced savings scheme, not unlike our CPF scheme, but it failed. The people of New Zealand voted against that scheme. The people of New Zealand were suspicious of any government accumulating too much wealth because they fear that the government could use those surplus funds to "buy" votes to put them back into power.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I am not pointing my finger at the Government. But I do not think that I am wrong in saying that any government which has accumulated massive amounts of funds shall one day be tempted to use them for its own political ends.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the Government for diverting some of its surplus funds into the Edusave and Medifund schemes and also the pension fund which will shortly be set up. More money, I believe, could be put into education. It is not flattering to know that Singapore has one of the lowest educated workforce amongst the four dragons in the region. This problem of low education amongst our workers was highlighted 10 years ago; it is not a new problem. At one time the Government pointed out that the problem was amongst the older workers. But it is now more than 30 years since the PAP took power. I should say that now the majority of the uneducated workers in our workforce grew up during the rule of this Government. It is time the Government put more money from the surpluses into quality education to prepare the Singapore workers to meet the ever fiercer competition from other emerging nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has prided itself in diverting some of its budget surpluses to Singaporeans through the CPF Share Ownership Top-up Scheme (SOTUS). I have commented that it was a clever scheme. It is true that the people who have purchased shares in Government companies, such as Telecom, will benefit in the long term. But the Government in introducing this scheme is not entirely altruistic. The Government will benefit from the massive cheap funds it will be able to gather for itself. The next float of a Government company will be in two years' time. For the next SOTUS exercise the Government will top-up $300 for every CPF member who has contributed $750 or a proportionate sum thereof. At the last SOTUS exercise when Telecom shares were floated, 1.26 million citizens received $242 million in matching contribution from the Government. Assuming that this same number of citizens has $750 in each of their CPF accounts, the Government shall next contribute about $378 million. The amount contributed by the Government and the $945 million being the members' own contributions will eventually go back to the Government when the next lots of shares in the Government company are sold to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that by the CPF Top-up Scheme, the Government shall gain large sums of cheap money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the PAP took power, its Government's announced policies were to encourage economic growth and establish social stability. In this light, it has used Government surplus funds to create a conducive environment necessary for economic growth such as, constructing the MRT system, building Changi Airport and subsequently Changi Terminal. I agree with these enlightened and farsighted policies. I also agree with the Government's economic policy of using surplus funds to invest in the economy, in places where large capital is needed, for example, in such enterprises like Sembawang, Jurong, Keppel Shipyards, DBS Bank, Natsteel, NOL, SIA and also the Petrochemical Complex. These
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> farsighted massive investments have helped Singapore's economic growth considerably.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is how long will the Government continue to keep on this policy of pumping massive funds into investments and thus making its hand greatly visible in the economic activities of the country. Even now, the Government is leading the charge to invest overseas. I am not saying that this move of the Government is bad. But my worry is: when can the indigenous private sector in Singapore come of age, or does it need to play second fiddle to the Government all the time? It moves only when the Government tells it to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My feeling is that, as long as the Government accumulates massive budget surpluses, the indigenous private sector in Singapore will always remain in the shadow of the economic hand of the Government.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget Statement announced by the Finance Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a prudent Budget, cautious and conservative. It consolidates past schemes and addresses future challenges. The Budget is confident that the economic strategies followed by Singapore for more than 25 years are the right ones for the 1990s. We have had better than expected economic growth of 9.9% in 1993 compared to 6% in 1992. However, 1994 is full of uncertainties, such as the US-Japan trade friction and prospects of rising real interest rates. And we may not achieve our projected growth rate of 4% to 5% this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of such uncertainties, many businessmen felt that the 1994 Budget is too prudent, too cautious and too conservative. They have been looking forward to a one to two points cut in the corporate tax rate on top of the three-point cut announced last year to help defray the cost of implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST). However, the Budget provides no tax cuts and no allowances to offset the cost of implementing the tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most businessmen were disappointed. To add to their disappointment, the 1.5 point hike in CPF contribution by employers will increase business cost and put a further squeeze on already small margins. This 1.5% hike was higher than expected as most businessmen expected a half point, or, at worst, a one point hike.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add to their woes, the Budget was silent on the effect of the full-day Area Licensing Scheme on the retail business in Singapore. The Singapore Retailers Association has recently sent out survey questionnaires to its 300 members, and initial responses indicated that, on average, both shopper traffic and sales turnover have decreased by about 30% since the introduction of the full-day Area Licensing Scheme on 3rd January this year. Many retailers fear that sales may drop even further after March, when the GST is introduced and the full impact of the ALS will be felt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I certainly hope that the Government will study the survey report that the Singapore Retailers Association intends to submit and, hopefully, to lift the ALS, especially on Saturdays, so that people can shop after working.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the 1993 Budget was a "corporate Budget", the 1994 Budget is a "people's Budget". There will be a 5% individual income tax rebate. There will also be another topping up of the Central Provident Fund accounts for buying shares, and rebates on service and conservancy and rental charges for all HDB dwellers. The Budget also proposes to pay high interest rates for some of the balances with the Central Provident Fund so as to make adequate provision for old age. Singapore has a rapidly ageing population and the Budget proposal represents a move in the right direction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Budget also addresses a key challenge facing the Singapore economy and, that is, how to develop the external wing as the economy matures. In addition to tax incentive measures announced in last year's Budget, the 1994 Budget provides some additional incentives for individuals to venture abroad. The Government has also set up a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Cluster Development Fund of $1 billion to encourage Singapore companies to invest regionally. As these companies go regional, many local entrepreneurs will have to follow as they provide the supporting services and products. Many of them lack the financial resources to set up offices and factories overseas. May I suggest that the Government allocate a portion of this Cluster Development Fund to our local entrepreneurs and assist them to go regional.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for letting me join in this debate. Before I turn to the debate proper, I just want to touch on a point made by the hon. Member for Potong Pasir on the equation of GST by reducing the S&amp;C charges and also the rental for 2- and 3-room rental flats. If he had been in this House during the GST debate last year, he would have realised that HDB flat dwellers who stay in 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-room flats have received waivers which more than cover the GST to be imposed. The recent introduction of the so-called ang pow is in addition to the GST deflation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, is a welcome one by any standard. We have achieved a broad-based 9.9% growth rate, much better than expected. This is more remarkable because it was achieved against a backdrop of dismal performance turned out by most of the developed countries. Such a budget would have brought much relief and jubilation to any one of them. Yet, astonishingly, in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore, the stock market reacted by dropping some 70 points. And I heard from a TV programme that a so-called analyst attributed this to a budget blue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the adverse reaction from the business is somewhat expected because of the 1.5% increase in employer's CPF contribution and by the fact that they have been building up the expectation that the corporate tax would be reduced by up to 2%, it is hard to believe that such expectation can be realistic in view of the fact that in 1993, the corporate tax had already been reduced by 3%. And one can hardly expect corporate tax to be reduced by a massive 5% point in two consecutive years, especially when we have achieved such high growth rates. But I am more at a loss as to why the general public, especially the HDB dwellers who tend to benefit so much from the waiver of rent in the rental flats and the waiver of conservancy charges, could give the Budget Statement such lukewarm and indifferent reaction. Even the addition of $500 million being injected into Edusave and another $100 million channelled into Medifund from the budget surplus did not generate too much excitement. And surprisingly, the increase of 10% in bus fare or a cup of coffee would create tremendous unhappiness and reaction in the coffeeshop and in the market place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have our Singaporeans really been conditioned to expect year after year of good performance and be blinded to the fact that countries all over the world are going through a harsh period of economic recession and that we have become so complacent that we are being insulated from such adversities? It would be totally naive not to realise that our continued prosperity can be stopped by either some unexpected internal happenings like labour unrest or even civil commotion due to racial disharmony or such similar factors or we may well lose our competitive edge to the up and coming developing countries like China, Cambodia and India.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget that countries like Japan, the United States, Europe and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Australia have enjoyed continuous economic prosperity for such a long time that no one would expect that they would be faced with such a devastating economic recession in recent years, especially Japan. Not long ago, Japanese companies were buying up almost everything all over the world - big corporations like Columbia Studio, real estates in Manhattan and almost every hotel and golf courses in Hawaii. And now suddenly, the economic bubble has burst and the government is working overtime in getting the country back on its track.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, where the people have the highest rate of saving, a coherent social structure and good work ethics and discipline, it may not be too difficult for them to succeed. But if we are put in the same position, I wonder what the consequence would be like and we still rely on our social discipline, community cohesion and prudent economic planning by our Government to get us back to the path of recovery. I would urge those who always call on the Government to spend our reserves freely, especially Members of the Opposition Party, to be more responsible before coming to this House to ask for our hard-earned reserves to be spent freely on welfarism and other unproductive projects just to gain personal popularity. Because if we encounter any prolonged recession, our reserves may be our only life-line.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been reminded time and again that we are near to becoming a developed country. We may not be able to achieve a high growth rate year after year if we just rely on our internal economic growth. Therefore, our Government is perhaps the only one in the world in which the leaders are so consciously and systematically leading the people to develop an external wing. We are constantly developing relationships and promoting trade with our neighbouring countries and establishing new trading partners by encouraging both public and private sectors to venture into these countries. It is no doubt that we are going through an exciting era of rapid development in this region, as our Senior Minister, Mr Lee, has spoken of the thrill of living through one of the most stimulating
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> epoch in history. There are vast opportunities opening up in China, Vietnam, India, and even Cambodia and beyond. While we should look for these opportunities positively, we must remember that for every success story, there may be many, many failures. Therefore, it is essential for us to move with caution, be brave and yet prudent. There should be maximum cooperation between the Government and the people in the sharing of experience and information. More importantly, we must move as one unit, even if we are fighting a different front. We must pool our resources together. But in doing so, it is important that we must not forget the investment opportunities by our trading partners, especially our ASEAN neighbours with whom we have enjoyed such close relationships.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the euphoria at the moment is being generated by external investments, it is of paramount importance that we must not forget also our internal development. Because no amount of external development can replace the wealth we generate from our internal development, whether in telecommunications, finance, manufacturing, construction and other such businesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also be very sensitive to the external competition we face. Mr Robert Chua once said that wages in Vietnam are incredibly low compared to ours and that the wages in China, the Philippines and India are well below that of ours. Therefore, we must upgrade our skills, increase our productivity and, most importantly, raise the educational level of our young in order to move ourselves up to a higher level of competition. 0therwise, countries like China, Vietnam and India which are now offering us tremendous investment opportunities will one day become our competitors. With their vast supply of land and manpower, relatively low living standards and well-educated masses, they can develop to be as competitive as we are and may not need assistance in manpower or software from us any more in the very near future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time therefore to look at ourselves critically and stop taking our progress through these years for granted. While
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> internal problems still exist, matters like COE, GST, rising cost of medical expenses, are important for us to resolve. But it would be negative to channel all our energy and over-emphasise such problems and ignore the greater economic picture.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I had a conversation with a few successful Taiwanese industrialists. They said that one of the reasons why the Taiwan economy grew so fast was that during the early days, the government encouraged every family to produce all sorts of products in the homes for the factories, and almost every home was turned into a small factory with every member of the family working late into the night. This form of support resulted in tremendously high productivity at very low cost. Now that they have more or less arrived, their wages have skyrocketed. Most of their young people are reluctant to work hard any more. They go for soft options. The situation is worrisome.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our situation in Singapore is not much different and once complacency sets in, it would be extremely difficult to reverse the trend. If we have a performance of 9.9% growth rate and we still show a lot of unhappiness, it is a clear sign of the nation on the verge of losing its fighting edges. And if we are not careful, we might be walking down the same economic path that countries like the United States, Japan and Australia have taken in the last few years. With the Government's prudent planning and management and our traditional work ethic and discipline, we can continue to be a player in such an exciting era of development in this region, and not just be a spectator like countries such as Vietnam, Burma and Cambodia who are so caught up with their internal problems that they have lost out completely this vast opportunity. So let us receive this year's Budget with a greater sense of satisfaction and gratitude and hope that our Minister for Finance will continue to deliver such Budget Statements year after year.
  <br>

  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Jacob, in the Economy of Cities, wrote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The primary economic conflict, I think, is between people whose interests are with already well-established economic activities and those whose interests are with the emergence of new economic activities."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreams, the hypotheses, the research ideas of today will one day spew forth new technologies that will sweep away industries of today and make established industries worthless. Those who do not ride the winds of change will find themselves slowly slipping into obsolescence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many ways, the Singapore Government has consistently espoused policies that have kept us at the forefront of emerging changes. The success of the policies and investment have brought material progress. Material progress is, in many ways, elitist, making the rich richer. We have been fortunate that the Singapore Government has made it possible for the large majority of Singaporeans to accrue material wealth and hence avoid the politics of envy. However, the past years of material progress have resulted in a shift in values, a change in aspirations and expectations and an increase in material wealth that is not necessarily accompanied by happiness. Success is now equated with those who have extraordinary wealth. They are often held as examples to be followed. Singaporeans now have much higher expectations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, we will have to grapple with two changes: (1) with those who failed to make the transition to the new changes, and (2) the higher expectations and shift in social values in the younger generation. Only about 54% of our labour force has attained at least a secondary school education. Many of those with lower educational attainment are those in their 40s and 50s who find it difficult to adapt to the changing demands of industry. They have skills which may be obsolete, do not have the fundamentals of education to help them climb the educational ladder and are at an age in which most companies are not willing to hire or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> retrain them. The only jobs open to them are the lower end jobs with low pay. They seek avenues of self-employment only to face an increasingly hostile market. Whether it is a market stall, a hawker stall or a shop, the tender prices are not for the faint-hearted. They feel alienated and do not know who to turn to. What does the Budget hold for these people? They might find some solace in the rebates on service and conservancy and rental charges, increase in employer's contribution to the CPF and some may be able to benefit from the CPF Share Ownership Top-up Scheme, but otherwise there is not much to look forward to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was taken aback recently when an elderly well-qualified administrator remarked to me. What is there for those who have retired? There is nothing. He added that the nation did not recognise the contributions of those who have given the best years of their lives for the nation. Many who have retired, he felt, have not qualified for senior citizen concessions for public services, such as the public transport system at the point of retirement. He expressed disappointment that many recreational places such as Sentosa did not have special concessions for the elderly. I remarked that besides housing, good affordable healthcare services, there was CPF to meet the financial needs. Of course, there are many elderly who have little in their CPF accounts. He, however, was supportive of the Government's move to increase the CPF Minimum Sum. He felt that although he had contributed to the changes that have made Singapore a success, the Singapore today does not appear to have a place for retirees like him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle age who are unskilled and lack educational qualifications and the retirees are two groups of people who appear to have missed out on the good life. Certainly, all the measures in the past few years and in this year's Budget will ensure that in the years to come, less will join the ranks of the unskilled, lowly-educated members of the workforce. For the retirees, surely it will not hurt Government agencies, quasi-Government agencies and statutory boards, to grant concessions to retirees where appropriate
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in recognition of their past contributions. The Government should study the needs of these two groups of people so that they do not feel alienated in their ever changing environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days ago, a senior staff member from a newspaper told me that his staff who had a $300 pay adjustment had expected $1,000 pay adjustment. And those who were promoted expected a double promotion. This situation is a reflection of the times where high expectation is the norm of the day. Singaporeans have been urged to strive hard to reach the Swiss standard of living. In this quest for increased material comforts, our social values may have fallen behind the blazing trail of economic growth. In our maturing economy, the younger Singaporeans will find it more difficult to buy a car, own a house, join a country club or aspire to have those material assets that will enable them to tell their friends that they have arrived. Crest-fallen hopes turn to disappointment and sometimes eventually to unhappiness. We must be careful. The mixture of high expectations for material wealth and unhappiness can be a potent potion. Material success appears to be the ultimate goal of our younger generation. Family relationships, social cohesiveness and neighbourliness are all secondary to this goal. This is an unhealthy trend.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Community Development's allocation was only 0.32% of the GDP, yet this is the Ministry that will spearhead the cultivation of family values and promote social cohesion. A set of family values has been espoused by the Ministry of Community Development. It should not be a passing campaign. It should be made to bear fruit and be inculcated in our Singaporean families. If we do not invest in developing family relationships, neighbourly relationships and community relationships, we will have a nation of self-serving beings with no social souls. We should invest in our education system not only to promote educational excellence, but also to inculcate good social values in our youths. We need to invest more in our community centres and our grassroots organisations that play an extremely important role in developing social cohesion in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> community. I hope that the Government will not consider the development of social values as being not an economically productive investment, but rather will continue to invest in institutions that will develop social cohesion. A collective effort is required to inculcate family values, social values and community values in Singaporeans. Only then can our society be rich, not only materially but also socially.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1993 turned out better than expected. Singapore has progressed to become a model city-state. In fact, we read daily that there are so many countries inviting us to start townships in their countries. We would soon find many, many "Singapores" around the world. I salute the Government last year and I do it this year again for a job well done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things happened last year and most noticeably is the thrust for our second wing. The seeds have been sowed. Our Government leaders, in fact, our Prime Minister, Senior Minister and many of the other Ministers have just returned, and they have been working very hard to go for this second wing. Our private sector has also responded. If we take the budget incentives announced last year and this year (it is correct that the private sector is unhappy) and if we digest a bit and look at the two years' incentives, probably it is fair to let the incentives run. The Government is listening.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, there were a lot of incentives given to corporations, and this year, the attention is switched to the individuals, even for individuals who are working overseas, things like the CPF reduction, the tax incentives, and so on. Maybe the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Minister would like to explain the rationale behind the individual ceiling tax of 30% versus the corporate tax of 27%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other interesting point is the Government returning the dividends to the people, particularly the CPF Share Ownership Top-up Scheme (SOTUS). Last year, there was this $200 offer, but there were still over 10% of people not benefiting from the $200. I do not know whether he has found out the reason. This year, with the 18-month period to top up $750 to enjoy the $300, could we find a way out to help these people who did not respond? Could not the $200 the last time, and $300 this time, be credited to them straightaway, into their Special Account for use at old age? There must be reasons why they are not responding to benefit from the $200?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Government is paying higher interest rates for the CPF Retirement Account. Could the individuals who do not want to get into share investments actually keep the money straight into the CPF old age account? That means, top up the $40,000 if they can afford to, and enjoy the higher interest, instead of going to invest outside.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST and business cost are of big concern. Many, including the Government departments, have raised their prices, not in the name of GST, but giving reasons that they have not increased for the last few years and they are asking the people to buy their reasoning. But the way people are fearing about the price increases, I think it shows that they are not accepting those reasons. It is good that the Government has come out to give the assurance that they would smack hard on profiteers. But our worry is that inflation would not be what the Minister had said last year, that is, a one-time 3% increase. It would look like maybe 5-7%. And what would happen then? Will there be a contingency plan to help out because cost of business will rise? Unions will be asking for higher wages and I think it is justified if inflation shoots up way above the 5-7%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I declare my interest as a retailer. Dr Wong Kwei Cheong has said about the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ALS and the retail business. I think it is real that the retail business is bad, and probably the Minister could look at the report and the survey submitted by the SRA and see how we could go about helping them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assets seem to be inflated. We tell our people that the living cost has not really risen that much. But when they measure it against the things that they want to buy, such as houses and cars, it seems to be a case of asset inflation. I also understand that there are a lot of loans taken to buy houses. Also, the credit card loans. At any one time in a month, I understand that credit card holders are owing $500 million. So is that an indication that our people are having a higher gearing than they should? Of course, employers look at cost and reacted to the 1 1/2% increase on the employer's CPF contribution. I think there is no quarrel. It is only fair that we pay up to the workers who have sacrificed during the recession years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only concern and worry is actually the cost in business. If inflation goes up by 5-7%, together with the implementation cost of GST, etc., would we be pricing ourselves out of the market? Would we fall into the trap of Japan that suddenly went into a position where they are now just finding out what had actually gone wrong? Our leaders are actually trying very hard to help Singaporeans cope. As our economy matures, we cannot expect the same kind of growth in Singapore. Our Senior Minister and our Prime Minister have told us that if we want quick growth we should go overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a lot of things have not been accepted by our people. I am rather worried, and I am not alone in this worry, to observe that all is not well beneath the good budget numbers. People seem to be afraid. There are many changes that have not been well digested and that may result in discontentment and resentment. The fact that we are so successful has a lot to do with being a cohesive and harmonious society. Our Prime Minister has recently cautioned the people not to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. According to the Prime Minister, the golden goose is of course the Government. Kill it, and that is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> it. I think no one can quarrel with him that much of our success has a lot to do with our Government, good government. And, granted, investors often cite our political stability, integrity and honesty of the Government as key reasons for investing in Singapore. But, on the other hand, we all also know, agree and accept that Singapore's success cannot be due to one midwife alone. No man is an island, and no government functions in isolation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some key pillars or social institutions that provide the superglue to our well-being and to our staying cohesive and harmonious. We have (a) tripartism - the equal role, cooperation and trust amongst the Government, employers and unions; (b) the very important ethnic and religious leadership. Their importance and influence cannot be under-estimated. Mutual tolerance, respect and understanding prevail. All have to live, work, compete and progress side by side. Chauvinism is not allowed. And the other key pillar is meritocracy. There is no nepotism here. Everyone has an equal opportunity, everyone progresses according to his talents, ability and willingness to work. And, at the same time, the talented are asked to show compassion. The better educated are asked to come out and lead and look after the less fortunate. We need good social community workers too, in addition to the good Government workers, bosses of industries, union workers. Therefore, for Singapore to succeed, we have to have good leaders all round in all these key institutions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success has shifted a lot of our values, as Dr Michael Lim has said earlier. We have become too materialistic. Our aspirations and expectations have multiplied manifold. Sir, personally, I think there is nothing really wrong with wanting to be rich, to live in a big house, drive a big car, dine in the best restaurant, so long as we continue to honestly work for our improvements and have a heart for the less fortunate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to play our part as good and loyal citizens. We cannot envy or be jealous of our brothers and sisters who do better than us. Directly, or indirectly, we all benefit from the contributions of one
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> another. We have to be grateful to the many leaders in the various bodies that lead and sacrifice for the well-being of our fellow men. So, therefore, we have to give them decent competitive compensations; otherwise they will not be motivated. So by and large, the rationale of paying market rates to attract the right talents works. However, there are many jobs - some very, very important jobs, thankless jobs - that money alone cannot buy. Worse still, money may buy the wrong candidates. Examples are politics, religious, charitable, social workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Let us take the religious workers. I believe religions all over the world today are finding it more and more difficult to attract people to serve their religions. Full-time people in the various orders are shrinking - priests, monks, nuns, imams, rabbis, pastors, and so on. These holy people answer the call of their God and they serve, believing that they will be rewarded in the next life when they are united with their God. Hindus who believe in reincarnation believe they will move up the social order if they do good now. While there are others who simply serve because that itself is satisfaction, that is reward enough.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in our well-being that we have amongst us good and responsible religious leaders. They are very powerful and influential amongst their followers. Under our multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-religious society, all our religious leaders and ethnic-based leaders have a very important earthly role to play. It is most fortunate that we have good and responsible leaders amongst us now, and it is also good that our Government provides assistance to ethnic-based self-help groups and religious bodies. And, in fact, I would suggest that the Government increase the grants to them to help them do an even better job. Some ask me, just how much should we pay to save our souls? How much should we pay to have a peace of mind? I think that peace of mind is worth it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Is politics simply a job? Ancient Greeks described politics as a supreme science of philosophy. Politics is about
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ethics, morals, ideals, and mankind itself. Politicians were well revered and respected then. They provided leadership and vision. They were people of character, integrity, virtue, dedication and commitment. They led the people towards a better future, a better tomorrow. Those were the days, so sighed many people around the world. Politics has become a joke. We hear of dirty politics, money politics. Thankfully, by the grace of God, probably the blessings of our multi-religious society, Singapore politics has not deteriorated to such a sad state. We still treat our Ministers with love and respect. Yet this high social standing is not enough to lure good people into politics. Our leaders have repeatedly expressed their concern. They conclude that much has to do with opportunities to make money outside. Therefore, they propose a market package to compensate these great sons of the soil to come forward and serve Singapore. I check around and I ask former leaders. None has any disagreement in wanting to pay our Ministers decently. The unknown factor is whether this market pay will draw us the right kind of candidates. But many still believe - I hope they are not wrong - that politics is more than just a job. It is a vocation, and it is dangerous to use money as the motivating factor. People who love money should not be allowed into politics. It is just too dangerous.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent stepping down of so many of our heavy-weight Ministers worries many of us. However, none of us believe that they were stepping down simply because of pay. Some went so far as to ask whether there were leadership differences in the top hierarchy. Will we ever know?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question here, Sir, is what can we do if (a) with the best of pay, we still cannot attract public-spirited people to serve the country; and (b) worse still, the wrong people are attracted? Do we have a better plan then? (c) The third group (the community leaders, the social workers, the grassroots leaders) - they play a very important role too in our social fabric. They are the unsung heroes. They spend their precious times, and often dig deep
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> into their pockets, to serve the less fortunate countrymen. They see their MPs and Ministers sacrificing for the good of all, so they come forward to serve. With full market pay now, many commented whether it is still necessary for them to serve - what more to serve free? These men come from all walks of life, and we have to admit that many of them are not less qualified than our politicians.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the social, charitable organisations? Are they going to be able to attract volunteer workers in future? Surely our values cannot simply be measured by dollars and cents. Parents often pin their hope on their children. Some hope their child will grow up to become a doctor, a High Court judge, a Permanent Secretary, or even a Minister. So this hope cannot be pay-motivated. I think it could be probably due to the respect the parents have for a particular honourable job.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service in the tripartism, where the Government was mentioned as one of the three legs, makes up the second component. And the recently proposed change in the medical benefits had angered quite a lot of them, if not all of them, and some cried foul, some cried a breach of trust, a breach of contract. So why was the outcry? Thankfully, the Prime Minister himself had come out to assure the civil servants that they are actually part of Government, and why should the politicians upset them. Some said, with all the changes, if they really would not be worse off, then, why change in the first place? I think the Government has done the right thing in setting aside in the pension fund a sum estimated to be equivalent to our outstanding pension liability. Can the Government do the same? If we look at the civil servants' medical cost with our huge surpluses, we can set aside a sum for those who are already enjoying the current life-time free medical service, whilst new entrants come in with a new scheme, like the way we did away with the pension scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. On the one side, we raise expectations, but on the other side, we cannot deliver, and that often
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> upsets the citizens. We are talking about moving into the next phase where all the more the people have got to rally behind the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this particular landed property sale. The Government has raised the hopes of private individuals when it announced the sale of small plots of land for individuals and small-timers to build their own dream homes. Nobody feels upset when lands were tendered out in large parcels. But when hopes were raised and not satisfied, frustrations and anger set in. Small-timers and individuals felt let down. Of course, the Government is right; the Minister is right to say, "Save our sympathies for the 3-roomers." But here we are talking about having raised their hopes, and we tell them, too bad, you have got to compete.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many, many more instances of unhappiness here, Sir. I shall not take more time to raise them. But I am trying to drive home the point that beneath the budget numbers, we have to look at the cohesiveness of our society. As we plunge into the next lap, the rulers and the subjects have to work even more closely. Everyone has a role to play. Every role has a dignity. Do not be mistaken that only the brains count.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, I would like to share a somewhat crude, but more apt, story - the body anatomy. The brain, the eyes, the mouth, the nose, the legs and hands were all arguing as to who is the most important part of the whole body. Every part has a very strong reason, and each cannot accept the other to be the more important. In that heated argument and commotion came a sudden squeak from the anus. Yes, the anus hole claimed it is equally important - it was modest enough not to claim to be the most important. All laughed. But after shutting the hole for a few days, a week, maybe two, the entire body parts blurred, sweat, shook, and they voted the anus hole to be the most important. They learned their lesson.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget has touched the hearts of many Singaporeans. When a responsible and forward-looking company does well, it will reward its workers with handsome bonuses and will channel part of its profits back to the company to invest into its future operations. The Singapore Government has done just that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a better than expected growth of 9.9% last year, the Government has decided to plough back part of the surplus to enhance the assets of Singaporeans, to invest in education and skills upgrading, and to develop an external economy. This balanced approach is indeed laudable. But not all Singaporeans seem to appreciate the balanced and forward-looking stance of this year's Budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business community, in particular, seems to have taken a somewhat short-sighted view of this year's Budget. One of their main disappointments is that there has been no cut in the corporate tax rates. This reflects a failure on the part of businesses to link this year's Budget Statement to that announced last year. Worse still, some employers, and even some Members of this House, including Mr Chiam, have expressed their unhappiness at the much awaited one and a half percent restoration to the employer's CPF contribution rate. Such griping will come to no good and will only result in generating workers' distrust in their employers. These employers certainly seem to have a short memory. If only they care to cast their minds back to 1986, they would surely remember the workers' gesture in accepting a drastic 15% cut in CPF, a 15% cut in their total salary. That 15% cut is 10 times more than the 1.5% restoration this year. Have employers conveniently forgotten the tremendous courage and sacrifice of their employees at a time of need? Have employers forgotten about the painful adjustments that their workers have to make to loan commitments and lifestyles? As it would have happened in other countries, our workers did not take to the streets. Instead they faithfully stood behind the reasons for the cut and helped companies pull out of the recession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several years of high growth, low inflation rate and after achieving an
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> outstanding productivity growth of 6.4% last year, the highest since 1984, employers have no case whatsoever for not endorsing the 1 1/2% CPF restoration. Let us also not forget that the employer's CPF contribution rate has only been restored to 20%, and not to the original 25%. The labour movement had not pushed for a full restoration to 25% because it understands the need for our companies to remain competitive. Our workers place a lot of trust in the tripartite relationship that we have built up very carefully over the past many years. The Government has kept its promise. It is now for the employers to positively demonstrate their commitment to this relationship.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another source of unhappiness stems from the raising of the salary ceiling for the Skills Development Levy from $750 to $1,000. As the Finance Minister has pointed out in the Budget Statement, over the years, collections through the Skills Development Levy have been falling. This is due to the reduction of the rate of levy from 4% to 2% in 1982 and from 2% to 1% in 1986. Also, fewer people earned monthly salaries of less than $750 with each passing year. Therefore, over the years, the cost to employers had actually been declining. In fact, the labour movement was hoping that the levy would be pegged at $1,500 salary level. Nevertheless, a gradual increase is still acceptable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who complain about the marginal increase in the salary ceiling of the levy are those who do not fully appreciate the importance of training of their lower-income employees. They do not realise that the SDF pay-out to companies is three times more than what is collected from employers each year. This means that employers can actually reap much more benefits from the SDF training schemes than what they actually pay. So my message to employers is simply: "Don't complain about pain, for if you train, you will surely gain."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to move on to another aspect of the Budget
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Statement. It has been stated that the Government's philosophy on education is to maximise the potential of every Singaporean. And, yet, we find that many Singaporeans are disillusioned that they cannot get a place in the local universities. Every year, when the GCE `A' level results are announced, we consistently note that there is a marked improvement in the overall performance of Singapore students over the previous year. Ten or 15 years ago, the number of students getting a minimum of two `A' and two `O' Pass levels used to be about 70% or 75%. This year, the percentages have surpassed the 90% mark to 91%. When our children do better in schools, it is only natural that they aspire for a university education. Although our university intakes have increased over the years, I am not sure if the projections of perceived demands of our economy vis-a-vis admission places are kept current enough. I wonder if we are too conservative in our admission policies. I understand that more than half of the 15,000 `A' level leavers who have applied to our universities each year are being turned away due to the limited number of places. Many of these students have to fulfil their dreams by enrolling in expensive overseas universities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a recent World Education Report, there are about 11,000 Singaporeans studying in overseas universities each year. This number is almost as large as the number of undergraduates in NTU. In other words, they could make up the enrolment size of another university. Have we taken into account this large number of returning graduates in our projections? Are we faced with a glut of graduates when they return to Singapore? Not at all. In fact, these overseas graduates get absorbed very quickly into our workforce and they draw salaries on par with local graduates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should a Singaporean aspiring to maximise his or her potential be made to take a very expensive route to a university education? Is it not possible to give Singaporeans a chance to pursue a degree locally? Why is a tight cap being applied to enrolment in the Open University? I realise that University expenditure and Government subsidy levels are very high.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> But can we do more to maximise the fullest potential of our prized resources? With both our universities adopting a modular credit system, the Ministry of Education should consider twinning local universities with reputable overseas universities for undergraduate studies. This would enable more Singaporeans to pursue a large part of their university education locally and at a lower cost than going overseas for three to four years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, we talked about making Singapore a regional centre for education. Neighbouring countries are now making great strides in this direction. Are we losing out? Perhaps, it is timely for the Government to set up a review committee on university education. Although in the past, steering committees have been set up for individual universities to chart their own direction, to my knowledge, an overall review of university education has not been done. Such a review committee can take a fresh look at university intake, curriculum, facilities and pay particular attention to the renewed manpower needs as we embark on a new dimension to develop an external economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I support the views of Mr Sinnakaruppan on education, I would like him to make a correction. I have not mentioned anything about the restoration of the 1 1/2 percentage point of the employer's CPF contribution. I have not mentioned that at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, if he has not mentioned, then I withdraw it. But he was quoting so much from the Straits Times that, I was not sure whether I was reading the Straits Times, or was listening to his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Sir, I rise to speak in support of the motion in the name of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various sectors of the economy have categorised the Budget, some as a "people's Budget", others as "one not so interesting for businesses". It is, perhaps, characteristic by now of Singaporeans to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> take almost for granted what goodies the Minister has to give. In most countries, people wait in fear of the Minister for Finance's budget for any new and increased taxes they may have to bear. But in our case, some people feel disappointed when it is another's turn to receive and no decrease in taxes is given.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the businesses' representatives feel a bit let down because of the corporate tax, now at 27%, was not lowered further. The lowering of the corporate tax was given last year and its full working has not even been translated. Is it reasonable or realistic to expect another decrease when the previous decrease has not fully been worked out for the fiscal matters?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern of businesses was the increase of 1 1/2% for CPF rates for employers - fears have been expressed that it will raise business costs further. We should remember, Sir, that businesses did well last year, and can therefore sustain the higher rate. We must bear in mind that profits were also raised by the better performance of the economy, and the increase in CPF rate is a restoration of an earlier rate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget is for the people. The Government will pay on behalf of the people in HDB flats, some months of payment in rentals, and service and conservancy charges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These transfers represent a positive action by the Government in transferring and directly assisting our people in making adjustments in the forthcoming GST. Beyond these fiscal incentives and transfers, I would like to focus a little on the message of the Minister in elaborating on the role of public policy for development by our Singapore Government. I am glad the Minister has come out very clearly to put in perspective the role the Government will still play in selective intervention and in providing the catalytic stimulus and competitive controls for sectors in our economy, amidst the current fervour of the free market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister made mention of the World Bank Study "The East Asian Miracle." The East Asian
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> miracle was not a miracle of free market. It was a miracle of competitive control and selective intervention. The major areas identified by the Study which governments should focus are (a) in macro economic environment, with the minimum of price distortions, (b) flexibility in labour markets and training, upgrading with wage flexibility, and (c) social solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also identified the intervention role of upgrading the economic structure through selective direct investments in strategic projects. To that extent, it will build up a $1 billion fund for Cluster Development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you allow me to add, one more important point in the East Asian miraculous success, and Singapore's as well - it is in adopting an outward-looking or an outward-seeking policy in our economic growth and development. All the East Asian economies that succeeded had Uncle Sam as their main market for their exports in the first instance. It was export-led growth, not import substitution and licensing that was the answer to growth and development. India lost decades in this. It was not necessarily the in-thing in the 1970s to believe in export promotion as a strategy of growth. Development economists were in two camps, the outward-looking versus the inward-looking camps; export promotion versus import substitution. It was outward-looking policies which won the day.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note that we are now encouraging our local businesses to go overseas, to build up the external wing to our economy, while continuing to attract foreign investment to Singapore. This is another aspect of the outward-looking, outward-seeking policies. However, while this is good for our long-term growth, it is useful to remember investing overseas does not add to our economic growth in the first instance. But it would add to our ownership of productive capacity. We are channelling investible funds overseas for overseas countries growth. We should not forget about the need for export
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> promotion for our own Singapore-based industries and to attract high quality investment here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister has set forth the Government's position in public policy for growth and development. It has also allayed the fear of many as to whether the Government will let unbridled free market to work out situations to the detriment of many people. The market will still be governed. Not only in education and health costs, but in strategic action to stimulate and catalyse growth in certain business sectors, the Minister has announced that the governing hand is still at work. This must be quite a relief because I believe in Singapore, the political leadership and Government is very important for economic growth and development. Without political leadership and Government, Singapore can only be a lesser version of Hong Kong. With superior political leadership and Government, Singapore is the cynosure of the world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like first to make some comments on what Mr Ling How Doong said earlier. He started his speech by explaining that the ageing process is universal and that countries are extending the pension withdrawal age. As he was making that statement, I was thinking that the logical extension to that argument would be to ask the Government to raise the CPF withdrawal age of the people. The Government is not asking for the withdrawal age of CPF to be raised but it is asking that the Minimum Sum to be set aside be increased.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point he made was that even $40,000 cash that is set aside is insufficient. I believe I heard him say so. I was thinking that if $40,000 is insufficient, why is he asking people not to set aside any sum at all? In fact, the Government is trying to be fair and reasonable, particularly to those people with property, and to ask them to set aside half the amount in cash.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bit disappointed, Sir, that he has even indicated that he expected the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> people to sell their property if they have no money. This is precisely what the Government is trying to avoid so that the people can set aside the money early and that they can remain in their own homes without having to sell their property.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, economic growth for 1993 at 9.9% is indeed a pleasant surprise. It surpassed the forecast for the year and is 4% higher than the economic growth of 5.8% registered in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is significant in the 1993 growth rate is the rate of productivity growth. At 6.4% productivity growth in 1993, it is double that of 1992 growth of 3.1% and four times that of 1991 at 1.5%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance promised last year that the CPF contribution rate will be restored if the economy does well and he has done so this year. I am pleased that the CPF contribution rate for employers will go up by 1(r)% and the employee's share will be reduced by the same percentage from 21(r)% to 20%. This reduction in the employee's share of the CPF is tantamount to giving the workers a wage increase and a bigger take-home pay at 1.5% on gross earnings. This bigger take-home pay could not have come at a better time with the implementation of the 3% GST. With other tax rebates and offsets, the workers who are careful with their expenditure and exercise thrift will end up much better off this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the financial year 1993, the Government received a higher revenue than estimated and had a lower expenditure than provided for, resulting in a sizable budget surplus of $5.5 billion. And $5.5 billion, Sir, is about one-third of the annual expenditure of around $16 billion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the approach adopted by the Finance Minister in distributing a part of the budget surplus in the form of rebates to our citizens after the financial year's account has been settled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the business community has been crying wolf giving the impression that nothing has been done for them. In fact, from this year, they will be enjoying a corporate tax reduction of 3%, from 30% to 27%. Though the loss of revenue was
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> estimated last year at $318 million, with the booming economy, I would imagine that the revenue loss would be much higher.
  <div align="center">
   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>
  </div>
  <br>5.18 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI has forecast economic growth this year to be in the region of 6-8%. If we achieve the 6-8% growth this year, we should be more than satisfied. Sir, what we should be aiming for is the real income growth. We must contain the scourge of inflation which can nullify our efforts to attain stronger economic growth. Surprisingly, the Minister has not indicated at what level the inflation rate should be contained this year. Is the inflation rate likely to breach the 3.5% level as experienced in 1991 when the economic growth was 6.7%?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take comfort in the Minister's statement that in this first year of implementation of the GST, the Government will be in a revenue negative position to the tune of $240 million. The Government will collect $960 million but give out $1,200 million in the form of tax cuts and rebates. This puts the Government in a strong position to counter any allegation that inflation is GST induced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Government has not introduced new measures to stimulate the economy further and aggravate the labour shortage situation and causing wages to rise artificially, there will not be the inflationary pressure to push the cost of operations up. Nevertheless, matters do take a turn which is unexpected. Fighting inflation, wherever the source is, will still be our top priority.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister has highlighted the need to improve the educational standards of our citizens and the value of skills training and upgrading. I am not as concerned for those who are still schooling but for those who are already in the workforce. Our economy is going through a process of restructuring. Not only foreign MNCs are relocating their operations, local companies are also doing likewise. It makes economic sense
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for companies to move to locations that meet their operational requirements especially those that need low skill and low wage workers. Even then for large countries, it is not difficult to recruit better educated and higher skilled workers at lower wages. Therein lies the intense competition for foreign investment and jobs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit must go to the Government for the success in bringing in sizable foreign manufacturing investments into Singapore. With manufacturing investments at $3.5 billion in 1992 and $3.9 billion in 1993, we have been able to create more employment opportunities for our people. It would be a pity if Singaporeans are not the direct beneficiaries of the higher value, better paying jobs, because they do not have the skills, or with older workers, their skills have become obsolete and no longer relevant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy for the ordinary workers to perceive the changes taking place. Left on their own, many workers do not see the need for skills upgrading and retraining. We cannot help but to get existing companies and even new companies to play a bigger part in worker training. I welcome the setting up of the $1 billion Cluster Development Fund with the Government playing an active role in developing the industry clusters. When doing so, the Government agencies should also look into the aspect of manpower and training requirements and see in what ways we can better utilise our workers, especially the older ones.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skills Development Fund (SDF) may not be able to fund the massive retraining and skills upgrading programmes required in this critical period of economic restructuring in Singapore. The Government could consider giving a bigger grant to SDF. The money invested in worker training will be worth while as we would then be keeping our workers in gainful employment for as long as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also tap the resources of the professional bodies in Singapore. Up to now, many professional bodies have confined their activities in the training
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and development of the members of their profession. The professional bodies should be encouraged to conduct training courses to lower level personnel in work areas related to them at the technician and tradesmen level. In this way, there will be substantial improvement in the overall skill standards of the Singaporean workforce. As much as it is important to serve our customers well, it is equally important that our co-workers possess the skills and knowledge to perform their functions well in the overall delivery of excellent service to the satisfaction of customers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's Budget is a very good one. I look forward to the Minister giving us many more such budgets in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, productivity, competitiveness, retraining, three very important issues for us in Singapore. The Finance Minister in his Budget Speech said, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We, in Singapore, can prosper and grow together with our neighbours and trading partners, if we remain competitive and productive.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speeches since 1992 has stressed the importance of remaining competitive, improving our skills and raising our productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for us to be able to carry out these objectives, the key challenge is the successful management of human resources. The most competitive nations in the 1990s will be those whose people have the right values, education system, motivation and attitudes, says the 1993 World Competitiveness Report. Therefore, soft assets do count in the hard world of competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nearly half of our workers have not completed secondary school. About one-quarter of these workers with less than secondary education are below 30 years of age and number 200,000. This large group of people who are all below 30 years of age will be in the workforce in the next 30-40 years and could become a source of great concern to the nation. What steps are being taken to ensure that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> we do not continue to have this trend of young people with low educational qualifications?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Labour Force Survey of 1992. Of the employed persons aged over 15 but under 20 years of age, there are 70,000 people and this does not include foreign workers. Of these 70,000 young workers, nearly 4,000 have never attended school or only up to lower primary level. Another 29,000 or 40% of our young workers below 20 have only primary or lower secondary education. How is this possible when we have had a universal and a highly subsidised education system for the last 30 years or so?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where have we gone wrong? Perhaps the Ministry of Education and other relevant organisations have to do some soul-searching and mind-scratching to find out what is the cause of these worrying statistics and how to prevent this state from continuing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one area that has to be studied is education for early childhood development. I am sure some of you will wonder what this has to do with the nation's productivity and competitive edge. Well, if we wish to succeed in our highly competitive region of the world which poses an economic challenge for us, then we have to look at the whole issue of national productivity, competitiveness and skills training from a holistic point of view.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, early childhood development has long term effects for human resource development and productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment in early childhood development education will help the nation by saving later on because it affects drop-out rates, learning achievements, readiness for learning and also impacts on performance in schools and on the job.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the well known advantages, early childhood development programmes are often dismissed on account of their costs. Channelling finance and other resources at a late stage, to improve the educational profile of our workers is itself unproductive in the context of having let a golden opportunity slip us by earlier on.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it not be more pragmatic to start investing in our people in early childhood and would not this course of action be more consistent with Singapore's philosophy of pre-empting future problems? Therefore, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Trade and Industry have to get together and look at the whole issue of early childhood development education, school and post secondary education, human resource maximization and job productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the other end of the age spectrum, workers who are over 40 constitute the largest group who either did not attend school or only completed up to lower primary school and these workers number about 150,000. Furthermore, these employees who are over 40 generally constitute a small percentage of workers attending retraining or upgrading courses. The culture of continuing education has to be imbibed by our people, especially our older workers. How do we go about doing this? The NTUC has made a start in this direction and so has the National Productivity Board, but much more has to be done so that we have an educated workforce. Again, the cooperation of a few agencies is required for this effort.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lack of education of our workforce is a major drawback for the upgrading of skills. The increasing of skills does not only have an economic focus but has social repercussions as well. Worldwide, the gap between the wages of skilled and unskilled workers has widened. With the abundance of cheap and relatively unskilled labour in the region, manufacturing industries that are labour intensive will move out of Singapore and this has been alluded to by the previous speakers. Our production will have to shift towards skill-intensive sectors in value-added industries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, according to the Labour Ministry's figures, the manufacturing sector has been shedding jobs since the beginning of 1992, resulting in a total net loss of 20,000 jobs so far. In five years, more than 100,000 workers in the electrical and electronic manufacturing sector may be out of work. Fortunately,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> however, those workers who lost their manufacturing jobs have easily found new jobs because of the current full employment rate in Singapore. However, this situation should not lull us into a false sense of complacency. We have to ask ourselves a few searching questions:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Are workers' skills acquired in their manufacturing jobs and who subsequently are displaced from manufacturing being put to good use in their new jobs? It makes little economic sense to provide workers likely to be affected by relocation with skills training if these skills are not utilised. Unfortunately, existing data does not capture this information. We have to overcome this deficiency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How much are the workers being paid in their new jobs? Do these displaced workers have to work overtime or take up two jobs to make up for their original pay? The latest estimates in 1989 showed that 44% of male workers over 30 did overtime work while 36% "moonlighted" in second jobs. With these added work commitments, workers are unable to make time for skills upgrading in their new jobs. There is the added social cost of spending less time with the family. Again, we have not instituted any database to capture this information.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of concern is that small companies (with less than 100 workers each) employ 40% of Singapore's rank and file workers. These number 400,000 in total. These small companies spend less than 1% of their payroll on training which is way below the national target of 4% set by the National Productivity Board. Large companies with more than 500 workers spend 5% of their payroll on training.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Stephen Lee, the President of the Singapore National Employers' Federation, has recently said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We must first help companies, especially the small local ones, to identify their training needs because many do not even know their own business.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, forcing them to meet targets of spending 2-4% of their payroll on training may yield no tangible benefit to the company or nation. According to Mr
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Stephen Lee, "they may end up sending staff for Lotus 1-2-3 courses, when the company does not even need computers."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Board set up a Management Guidance Centre in 1972 to provide companies with management consultancy services to help them assess training needs and benefits, but I wonder how many small companies have actually used this service. Maybe the Government could consider giving subsidies or tax incentives for companies seeking management consultancy services from the National Productivity Board. This could serve as an inducement to small companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another important fact to know in relation to small companies is that 70% of Singapore's small businesses fail within five years of start-up. This is according to a survey covering the 1980-90 period. This rate is higher than the international average of 50-60% for small business failures. This higher failure rate, coupled with a marked preference by Singaporeans for venturing into service-based businesses, are two obstacles to higher economic growth. The problem is that services tend to generate lower value-added output than manufacturing activities and so we have to moderate this impact of the poorer contribution of the service industry on the GDP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. M.S.S. EL-Namaki, a Dutch management expert, who conducted the survey on the failure rate of small businesses in Singapore, thinks that we should set up a "small business corporation" to spearhead the structural adjustments needed to pull local entrepreneurs up. We should consider adopting this suggestion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that needs our urgent attention is employee turnover or job-hopping. This is a serious problem in Singapore and affects business development. Frequent job changes by too many Singaporeans pose a huge barrier to the absorption of training as the learning curve for higher value-added activities is two to three years. This job-hopping adversely affects the enlarging of the trained labour pool which will in turn
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> affect the company's international competitive edge. To overcome this problem of job hopping, we have to increase the bonding between employers and employees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to one big study done in the US, companies that make it easier for employees to juggle their work and family responsibilities are rewarded by greater employee loyalty and lower turnover plus increased job satisfaction. The two companies that were studied offered work-family programmes and included the giant consumer and pharmaceutical company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and another company which is a medium-sized maker of automotive sealing products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study showed that employees who take advantage of work family programmes are more likely to participate in total quality management and other programmes that companies consider critical to their competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, without hard studies such as these, claims for all the wonderful things work-family programmes do can make hard headed policy makers like ours nervous and disbelieving because they used an untested hypothesis. However, now with proper studies, policy makers must shift their paradigms concerning the importance of bonding between employers and employees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new shift in thinking towards providing a family-friendly work environment is not only desirable but also inevitable. Let us therefore in Singapore be one of the first in the Asia-Pacific region to embrace a change that not only improves the quality of our work and family life but thankfully, at the same time, contributes to national economic wealth and improves our competitive edge. Thus, Sir, we can literally have our cake and eat it too, since in Singapore we espouse the twin goals of economic development and maintaining family unity in the face of progress.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal investigator of one of these studies said that work-family policies are often seen primarily as a way to attract women to a company but they
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have additional benefits for the company in increased productivity and also decreased job-hopping.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no study found evidence to support a fear common among managers that employees will exploit and abuse company programmes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, in Singapore, we have done a similar sort of study. The National Productivity Board and the Singapore Institute of Labour Study conducted a survey in 1992 on employee benefits. The two organisations suggested that companies should offer workers more perks that will help them meet family and social needs. Results of the survey indicated that the majority of companies in Singapore are convinced that this scheme could enhance employees' commitment to work. Up to two-thirds of Singapore workers and unionists support the scheme and feel that it would motivate employees to work harder and raise productivity. Mr Goh Chee Wee had this to say, "Well packaged benefits would motivate Singaporeans to work harder and stay with their companies."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the NPB-SILS survey showed an anomaly. What employers see as perks that will boost the quality of worklife for employees are often not provided by the employers. For example, 85% of the employers say flexible working hours are good, but only 18% practise them. While 60% advocate childcare facilities, only 2% have them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the cause of this gap between the employers' beliefs and their practices? Is the paralysis of action caused by structural impediments like the lack of know-how, tax incentives, etc? We have to address ourselves to this problem urgently.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore National Employers' Federation, with the Chambers of Commerce, should put their business heads together and work out policies and programmes for firms to become more family friendly. The motivation for this, Sir, need not only be to do the right thing by workers and their families, but to do the right thing by the companies, as these schemes will raise competitiveness and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> productivity. Why are employers then so tardy in addressing an issue of self-interest and also of national importance? The civil service as the largest employer has gone some way to encourage employee loyalty but could do much more and lead the way so as to prod the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another issue that impacts on our economic performance is our tight labour market. To achieve an annual growth rate of 6%, which is predicted for next year, Singapore would need to increase its foreign workforce by an average of 11% a year over the next three years, according to a private study. Employers faced with its tight labour supply in recent years have often pleaded with the Government to let in more foreign workers. However, a one-point rise in the local workforce would raise GDP by 0.3%, but a one-point rise in the foreign workforce would only add 0.1% to the GDP and therefore foreign workers are generally not as productive as the local workforce. Therefore, we should try to utilise the untapped labour market resources of housewives and older workers. A tripartite agency, consisting of Government, employers and unions, could be set up under the auspices of the Skills Development Fund to help retirees and housewives to look for suitable work and to train them for the required job.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pursuit of competitiveness contains many traps and pitfalls and we have to be aware of these. We have to learn to innovate and look at the problems from all perspectives. Singapore cannot win by trying to play the same game as some East Asian developing countries which have many young workers. Our population is getting older and our fertility rate is declining. Therefore, for us, it is high productivity jobs, and not just any jobs, that will translate into high national income.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are seeing now a change to capital-intensive operations. To fully utilise the capital investment, shift work may become a key factor in the new work order. With more workers on shift work, changes in the social support
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> structure will be necessary, for example, childcare services to cater for dual working families on shift work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to address all the urgent issues that relate to labour shortage, training and retraining schemes and retaining our competitive edge, I suggest that we should have a high-powered committee that will evaluate how to promote the quality of our worklife and our national productivity without compromising our family life. I made an appeal to the Prime Minister last year and I would like to reiterate that again, please. This committee should comprise Government, employers, NTUC and NPB and ordinary citizens who have families (both men and women). Singapore's industrial climate has been forged by a harmonious tripartite relationship. We now have to strive to a higher plane of industrial relations and family life that will promote higher productivity and better quality work and family life. We could heed the words of Professor Michael Porter from the Harvard Business School: "The only competitive advantage today that is sustainable is the capacity to improve and innovate." Let us therefore, Sir, improve our economic productivity and maintain our family cohesiveness by innovating at all levels of national life. To the three issues of productivity, competitiveness and retraining, let us add another equally important issue, and that is, family life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Finance Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am pleased that the Government has decided to plough back budgetary surplus to Singaporeans in the form of tax and public housing rebates, and increasing its contribution to Edusave and Medifund, among others. We see, with great satisfaction, that pensioners' concern that their pension will be paid has been adequately addressed. The setting up of a pension fund for public officers puts to rest their worry that their pension might not be paid. In so doing, the Government has recognised these pensionable officers' constitutionally protected pension as a liability while
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> relieving future taxpayers of the burden. I would like to join my colleagues to applaud the Minister for Finance for his prudence and long-sightedness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the business sector is said to be disappointed with the Budget. This need not be so if it remembers that the 3% corporate tax cut announced last year will take effect this year. The business sector cannot expect the Government's Budget to be "pro-corporate" year after year. And, Sir, in the same token, it is also timely to remind Singaporeans that a "pro-people" budget may not come every year as well. And it can only come about if all Singaporeans continue to work hard to increase their productivity. It is a fallacy to expect unlimited "goodies" every year, and it is good that the business sector has now found this out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this "pro-people" Budget also appears to be an expansionary budget with increased emphasis on improving social and economic infrastructure. So more jobs will be created. So workers in the already tight labour market will have more jobs to choose from. This is good and yet bad because if this situation is not properly managed, job-hopping will return, as the previous speaker has said. And productivity will fall as more workers suddenly feel that they have become indispensable and will bargain for the highest salary without matching it with their best effort.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An expansionary budget, coupled with the implementation of GST, will quite likely brew an inflationary economy. May I therefore urge the Government to continue to monitor prices of goods closely and to punish those who are found to be profiteering. If existing laws are inadequate to punish profiteers and the unscrupulous, then the Government should consider legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, increasingly more Singaporeans are cynical of Government's policies, however well-intentioned they may be. Many are of the opinion that the current budgetary surplus is the result of Government's "pay-and-pay" policies. Many do not realise that this is the consequence of strong economic growth last year. Many
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have argued that the Government is taking money from the people's pockets, and putting it into the Government's pocket. And with money collected from various sources putting into one pocket, ie, the Consolidated Fund, the surplus appears very large indeed and lends credence to the argument that the Government is making a lot of money for itself.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is a need to dispel this notion. The best way to do so is for the Government to show to the public where money collected from a particular source and for a particular cause goes to. Take the case of COE and road tax. Will it therefore not be worthwhile for the Minister to consider applying the COE and the road tax collections directly to benefit its givers? Would it not be better that these collections be channelled into a special fund, call it the "Road Improvement Fund", for use to improve roads, expand road capacity, build underground tunnels, for general road maintenance work, and even to subsidise public transportation to keep costs low, instead of blending this fund with other monies in the State coffers, unfortunately perceived by some as the Government "pocketing" the money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my suggestion that COE and road tax collections, and for that matter, any kind of collections, be used to benefit its givers is not new. We have already been doing this through the 4% cess, through the 1% SDF levy where collections are clearly seen to be spent to improve and promote the tourist industry, and to train and upgrade workers' skill respectively. It will be nice if Singaporeans could see, as much as is possible, that some money goes back to benefit them in a more personal and poignant way, on top of the rebates which benefit all across the board.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then, Sir, would some money go back to benefit the people? Even after giving the rebates and discounts, we still have an enviable budgetary surplus. Could we not set aside some amount of this surplus to a fund to be administered by the Ministry of Community Development for spending on the people at the constituency level? In other words,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> consider creating a "Welfare or Needy Fund" for needy constituents. Applicants for this fund will have to have a deserved cause to be supported by the constituency Citizens' Consultative Committee and endorsed by its Advisor. Applicants will have to be people with a dire and urgent need for money caused by unforeseen circumstances, such as dependants who suddenly lose their parents in an accident, or where the sole breadwinner dies without leaving any savings for the family. Some money may also be put aside to create a "Constituency Bursary or Scholarship Fund" where deserving students could be more easily identified at the constituency level. I must, however, add that the CCC will have to do a very careful and thorough study and to check on each case, which will be subject to further scrutiny by the Ministry of Community Development which will have its own stringent criteria and guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is just a preliminary suggestion. Perhaps officers of the Ministry could work out the details. Suffice to say that the intention is clear: let the people see that some of their money will go back to them in a use that touches their hearts more deeply. Even if he is not the direct beneficiary, I am sure he will still see and feel the joy of his neighbour's plight assuaged by financial assistance through the State at a time of acute need and great despair.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest I be misunderstood, I am not advocating a welfare state as such a scheme will only be in place so long as we continue to enjoy and maintain a budgetary surplus every year, and will only be granted to needy applicants, subject to very careful checks at both constituency and Ministry levels.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's economic performance was exceptionally strong. So the Government could afford to reward all by reducing taxes and letting us enjoy generous
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> rebates. Sir, despite this good showing of a robust economy, I am thankful that the Minister has sounded his gentle reminder to Singaporeans "to prize diligence, effort and enterprise above luck and quick gains."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned that some of us might have taken the Government's rewards for hard work for granted. That it is customary and has become the Government's duty to find some rewards for Singaporeans every year, never mind whether Singaporeans have put in sufficient efforts, or irregardless of the state of the economy. Even with so many rebates announced this year, how many will bother to translate the aggregate benefits into dollars and cents, and come to appreciate what the Government has done for them with the implementation of GST? Sir, it will be easy for many to feel the pinch of GST without realising the efforts put in by the Government to offset the impact. Sir, I dare predict that we will continue to hear more grouses and complaints after GST has been implemented.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it not therefore timely for the Government to gradually move away from giving fiscal incentives, no amount of which is ever enough? Discounts and rebates as incentives should slowly ---

  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will state (i) the number of Singaporeans who applied for permanent residence for their spouses in 1992 and 1993; (ii) the success rate by gender breakdown; and (iii) the economic profile of the unsuccessful applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In 1992, 6,546 spouses of Singapore citizens applied for permanent residence. The figure for 1993 was 6,929.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The success rates for 1992 and 1993 for male spouses were 68.7% and 77.8% respectively. The corresponding figures for female spouses were 76.5% and 78.5% respectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Immigration Department does not keep data on the economic profile of unsuccessful applicants. However, a sampling of the rejected cases showed that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Amongst the foreign husbands, 44% were unemployed while 52% were working outside Singpaore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) More than 40% of the foreign wives could not obtain PR because their Singaporean husbands were not gainfully employed. The balance of 60% were not successful for various reasons e.g. they were ex-work permit workers and had married their Singaporean husbands without the prior approval of the Ministry of Labour.
