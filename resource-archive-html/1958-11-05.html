<br><br>10.04 a.m.



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CONSTITUTION EXPOSITION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Participation by Government)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

permission  I  wish  to  make  a  statement   on   the

participation  of  the  Government  in  the  Singapore

Constitution  Exposition which is being  organised  by

the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce in celebration of the

achievement  of  a new Constitution next  year  giving

birth  to  a  self-governing State of  Singapore.  The

emphasis  of  this Exposition is national,  instilling

loyalty   and   pride   in  Singapore   and   in   its

constitutional development, for at this  time  of  the

celebration it must be the wish of everyone of us that

every  citizen  in our predominantly young  population

should share the significance and exhilaration of that

event.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Constitution is coming to us because of our

own  unity,  determination and  steady  constitutional

efforts, and it gives us the reality and the substance

of  freedom  in  our internal affairs. To  change  the

title  and status of Colony for that of a State  is  a

major and irrevocable step in our history and a matter

of great pride and joy for our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis of all exhibits in the Exposition will

be  on the achievement of self-government, but it  was

clear  that,  without major Government  participation,

the  emphasis would not be readily understood.  It  is

essential  that there should be a Government  Pavilion

to  emphasise the fact, nature, extent and reality  of

the  constitutional change and to  show  the  advances

already   made  under  the  impetus  of   an   elected

government  which we expect will be the  greater  when

the   fully   elected   Government   under   the   new

Constitution takes over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it is important to emphasise the wide range

of  services  which the Government  provides  for  the

welfare,  prosperity and security  of  the  people  of

Singapore.  The Government Pavilion will come  as  the

climax of our activities in civic education whose  aim

has been to ensure that the fullest and widest use  is

made  of  the  opportunity to  vote,  which  has  been

conferred by our citizenship legislation last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100,000 square feet have been reserved free of charge

for  the Government within the demarcated area of  the

Exposition.  The  Committee under the chairmanship  of

the Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr  M.

P.  D. Nair) has been preparing plans and estimates in



consultation  with the Ministries. It is  proposed  to

build  a covered space of 60,000 square feet. It  will

be  in  two parts, each facing on to the main axis  of

the  Exposition; one showing the Government's part  in

increasing the wealth and economic prosperity  of  the

country,  and  the  other showing the  wide  range  of

social services in health, education and welfare which

the  Government  provides for the people.  Details  of

cost  have not yet been worked out to an extent  which

allows the Govermnent to ask for a specific sum to  be

voted,  but  every  means is being sought  to  achieve

economy by using materials which will be required  for

other  purposes next year and by borrowing of material

and  equipment. Moreover, exhibits are being  designed

in  such  a way that they can be of long-term use  for

departmental activities afterwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the need to win the unity, understanding and co-operation of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



citizens  is  a  task as continuous as the  democratic

process itself, and I am sure this Assembly will  wish

that this exhibit should be of a standard to match not

only  the general standard of the Exposition but  also

of the theme of the new Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have another statement to make clear the

policy of the Government in relation to the recent ban

on   the  importation  of  publications  from  certain

publishers -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Surely

the Chief Minister does not wish us to be inundated by

a  series of statements before we have recovered  from

his first one?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Actually I take it that the Chief

Minister   would  welcome  questions  on   his   first

statement,  and therefore, perhaps he will  pause  now

and if hon. Members wish to ask questions on his first

statement, they may do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Am I right in believing, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that this Exposition is being organised

by  the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and  not  by  the

Singapore Government?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The Exposition is being organised

by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and the Government

is taking part in it and so is the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Am I right in believing that when

the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce mooted this idea, the

purpose was not as stated by the Chief Minister today?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> When they mooted this idea, the

Chinese Chamber of Commerce thought of a trade fair on

art  international basis, and when they  saw  me  they

felt   that  a  better  emphasis  would  be   on   the

achievement of self-government. Hence the name of that

trade  fair  has been changed to that of  Constitution

Exposition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Am I right in believing that, as a

result of the persuasive powers of the Chief Minister,

he  has  successfully engaged the Chinese  Chamber  of

Commerce in politics?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I have not endeavoured to

persuade  the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Perhaps  it

is  surprising  to the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  that

there are citizens in Singapore today who have a  keen

desire to show their loyalty to Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No one doubts the desire of

everybody  to  evince their loyalty. I am  asking  the

Chief  Minister whether this political slant that  has

been given to the trade exposition is a result of  the

intervention of the Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>BAN ON IMPORTATION OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PUBLICATIONS FROM CHINA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND HONGKONG</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May I now proceed with another

statement, Sir, in relation to the recent ban  on  the

importation of publications from certain publishers in

China  and  Hongkong? Sir, I would like  to  emphasise

that  this was not a change of policy but a tightening

up  of the application of our policy. Previously,  all

books   had   been  allowed  to  enter  except   those

specifically banned. This was appropriate  when  there

was  still a certain amount of freedom for publishers,

and  classics  and  textbooks in particular  were  re-published  untouched from the freer  days  of  Chinese

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the change of policy in China and the

subordination  of all publishing houses,  and  through

the  process  of rectification of all writers  to  the

Communist  Party, this laxity could not be allowed  to

remain  unchecked,  for with an import  of  a  million

publications  a month from China and Hongkong,  there

can  be  no guarantee that the assessment and  sifting

can  be  complete. It is therefore the  procedure  now

that  only  books which are specifically exempted  for

the cultural and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



academic  value of their contents, and which have  not

been reduced by editing, presentation or selection  to

the  level of Hsueh Hsi textbooks, will be allowed  to

enter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate, Sir, that this has caused temporary

hardship to those in the book trade, but every step is

being taken to speed up our processes of assessment of

existing books, so that exemptions among those already

here and for the future can also be given speedily. It

has  been  encouraging that the grounds of our  policy

have  been  generally  accepted  and  that  there   is

appreciation  of the need at this time  of  democratic

nation-building  to  prevent  the  weight   of   other

external ideologies and nationalisms drowning our own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the logic of citizenship in action, and it is

for us, by our mental reactions and by our actions, to

show  that  citizenship based on exclusive and  active

loyalty  to Malaya is a reality, and an axiom  of  our

political thought and action. If it can be shown to us

that  this  action  pf  ours  weakens  the  forces  of

democracy   or  inhibits  the  growth   of   our   new

patriotism,  then  we  are  in  the  wrong.   But   no

responsible   government  in  Singapore   can   accept

criticism based on any outlook which is not Malayan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that we cannot merely create a vacuum and

that  the ultimate answer is the production of writing

of  our  own with a Malayan atmosphere and  a  Malayan

outlook. I would appeal, therefore, to all writers  to

direct  their  thoughts and words  to  the  lives  and

aspirations and problems of the peoples of Malaya; and

to  publishers  in all languages to give  our  writers

encouragement by offering publication and distribution

facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot produce best-sellers straightaway, but now

is  the time for those who have had the benefit of our

rapidly growing education and who feel the new  forces

of   democratic   constitutional  nation-building   to

express that positive creative force for those who are

less  explicit and begin to make our own  contribution

to the world of arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I make the final statement, I would

welcome questions from the other side of the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to ask

the  Chief  Minister whether he is  aware  that  it  is

already  the  practice  and  a  fact  that  every  book

imported  from  China or Hongkong,  especially  in  the

Chinese  language, has been examined carefully  by  the

Chinese Secretariat before it is allowed to be sold  on

the market? Therefore those 53 publishers -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the hon. Member will

pause there and get an answer to his question.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I have lost the

trend of the hon. Member's question while listening  to

what he was going to say.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Member for Changi will

repeat his question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Chief

Minister  whether he is aware that it is  the  practice

for  the  Chinese  Secretariat to  examine  every  book

published  in  the  Chinese  language,  whether  it  is

imported from, say, Peking, Hongkong or Formosa?  Those

53  publishers who have been banned - many of their books

have already been -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Chief Minister has

grasped the question.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I said in my statement that

the  previous policy had been to allow these  books  to

come  in and the restriction was only placed on certain

books  which  were  banned. Because of  the  change  of

policy  of the Chinese People's Government and  because

of  the growing sense of nation-building in Malaya, the

Government  has  thought it fit and  proper  that  this

attempt  by  the  Chinese People's Government,  through

publications, to indoctrinate the citizens of Singapore

should be checked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Actually, Sir, my question is in

two parts. I want to ask whether the Chief Minister has

any adequate evidence to prove to this House that those

books which are allowed to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



imported - including a lot of classics by  Confucius  and

Lao-tze,  and  books on the arts, too, such  as  music,

medicine  and  science - have any political significance;

and  also whether the Chief Minister is aware  that  in

certain  universities and libraries there are thousands

of  books  classified as research  work,  such  as  the

classics, books on science or special studies, and  has

he  any  concrete evidence that those  books  have  any

political significance?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, if the hon. Member will step

into  my office and arrange an appointment with  me,  I

will  endeavour to show to him in secret  the  attempts

that have been made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I want an explanation from the

Chief  Minister, in public why the Singapore Government

has found 23 more publishing houses than the Federation

Government has discovered, to be subversive.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, in regard to that, I

understand  that  the Federation Government  is  asking

importers to take up separate import licences for those

publishers which were not listed by them in its earlier

ban.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Chief

Minister  has  appealed  to the  local  publishers  and

writers  to publish and write literature with a Malayan

outlook, there is one question I want to ask him. It is

this - can  he  inform this House whether it is  possible

for our local publishers and writers to publish classic

books on special studies'? Say, for example compare the

works  of Shakespeare with the Chinese classic The  Red

Chamber Dream.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I think the hon. Member has

not understood my statement well. I said, regarding the

classics,  books of art and science, so  long  as  they

have   not   been  contaminated  by  any   attempt   to

subordinate  them to the Communist doctrine,  they  are

not  going  to  be  banned. In fact,  they  are  indeed

welcomed. What I am appealing to is that, since we  are

all conscious of a new nation being born in Malaya, and

since we have each and every one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



of  us  declared that we love Malaya, surely there  are

bound  to be some people in Malaya who will be able  to

contribute in this world of art.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Can the Chief

Minister  give  an illustration of such a contamination

for the benefit of the public?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It may interest the hon. Member,

Sir, to know that I am having a White Paper compiled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the

Chief  Minister touched on Malayan loyalty.  He  has  a

suspicion that the books from China are going to  cause

the  Chinese in Singapore to withdraw their loyalty  to

Malaya.  Does  the Chief Minister know that  a  lot  of

books  from  Taipeh and Hongkong have been financed  by

the  U.S.I.S.,  and  that they  go  out  to  the  local

overseas Chinese calling on them to support the  Chiang

Kai-shek regime? Does the Chief Minister consider  this

also harmful to this country? If he wants to ban the 53

publishers,  can  he tell us how many publishers  there

are  in  Taipeh  and Hong-Kong who are  supporting  the

Chiang Kai-shek regime and trying to woo the support of

the overseas Chinese and who should be banned?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, in our desire and attempt to

build  up a Malayan nationhood, any attempt by  outside

forces to thwart that objective is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, your third

statement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DUMPING OF CHINESE TEXTILES INTO FEDERATION OF MALAYA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I have one final statement to

make,  Sir, and it is in regard to the decision of  the

Government  to  assist  the  Federation  of  Malaya  by

limiting  the  dumping  of  Chinese  cottons  into  the

Malayan  economic unit of which we are  a  part  and  a

beneficiary.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not concerned  now

with the details of the decision, but wish to emphasise

again  that criticisms must be related to the new stage

of our constitutional develop-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



ment.   It   is  the  clear  assumption  of   our   new

constitution   that  it  is  the  last   stage   before

independence  through merger with  the  Federation.  We

accept, with understanding but without loss of faith in

our ultimate objective, the position that it is not the

present  policy of the Federation that there should  be

merger now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Sir, Singapore cannot afford a running

bickering  battle  with the Federation  hoping  to  win

every time; for not only will that snot be to our long-term  economic interest, but it is no way to  show  our

readiness  to share our fortunes with them  for  better

and  for worse, in riches and in poverty. This does not

make  us a colony or a slave of the Federation, or  any

other  noun  which  is culled from  the  dictionary  of

denunciation.  We  must  be  realistic  and  even   the

partnership of equals and independents assumes a  great

deal of give and take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My appeal is, therefore, that in all our discussions

of  issues  of this kind we must start from  a  Malayan

assumption and we must show towards the Federation  the

consideration we expect from them. This may not  be  an

easy  policy to follow, but again we must realistically

face  facts and not ignore them. And one of these facts

is  that  if we claim to be a part of a Malayan  nation

seeking the rightful union which circumstances deny  us

today,  we must act as a part of a Malayan nation  here

and now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember the essential elements of policy such

as  citizenship, education and multilingualism which we

are  able to follow without question, and ask ourselves

before we let loose the full flood of criticism whether

the  issue  is important enough to put the constitution

and  the  policies  it enshrines in jeopardy.  Only  by

trial and error, approaching each issue reasonably, can

we begin to reach agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be the will and the mood; and then our

future  will be the stronger together, because  of  the

mutual  confidence, the mutual co-operation  which  has

been  worked out voluntarily. As each stone is laid  by

agreement and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



cemented by mutual respect and appreciation, the joint

home of Malayan independence will be the stronger  and

more rapidly built.

<div align="center"><b>FLOOD PREVENTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Communications and Works)</b></div>



<br><br>10.29 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some hon.

Members  will  probably have received,  communications

from  their  constituents as a result of the  flooding

caused  by  heavy  rain on Monday  last,  the  3rd  of

November,  and I think it may be useful if  I  make  a

statement  on  what has been achieved so  far  by  the

Government's flood control works; on what  remains  to

be  done; and on the broad picture, in short, as it is

today and as far as we can forsee it for the next  few

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had better start by enumerating some of the basic

simple points to which I have referred in the past  in

the  Assembly,  but which may not  be  clear  in  hon.

Members' recollection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is that we have to get the water

right  off the land and into the sea, or else we  have

to  retain  it  in a properly planned and  constructed

reservoir.  It  would  be  useless  to  approach  this

flooding problem on a short-term vote-catching  basis.

It  would be fairly easy sometimes to shift the  flood



water  off the land of political supporters and on  to

the  land of political opponents. But I would not wish

to  do that and I am sure that my honourable political

opponents on the Opposition Benches would not wish  me

to  do  it  to them. The only way to deal  with  flood

problems  is  by proper overall schemes after  a  full

study of the facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that flooding cannot be dealt with

as  simply  as some people suppose. It is not  just  a

matter  of deepening or widening the channels  of  the

drains.  If deepening brings the bottom of  the  drain

down to sea level, then the sea will flow up the drain

at  high tide, and this is not a desirable result. The

only way of stopping this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



is  to have a fairly expensive tidal gate at the mouth

of  the drain, such as we have put in at the mouth  of

the Geylang River.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, even where the land is above sea level,

deepening  of  a  drain may have serious  results.  It

lowers the water table and dries out the subsoil.  For

example,  in  the Queenstown area, the land  has  been

reclaimed by putting earth-fill on top of swamp mud. A

deepening of the drain would lower the water table and

dry  out the foundations and thus affect the stability

of the houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even where no buildings would suffer from deepening

the  drains, lowering the water table will  draw  away

the  water  from the roots of the farmers'  crops  and

then they cannot grow their vegetables for the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that flood difficulties are very

much  increased as development proceeds. This operates

in  two  ways. Firstly, every new piece of development

increases  both the size and the speed of the  run-off

of water. Along Bukit Timah Road, each new estate that

is developed sends more water down more quickly to the

lower  parts  of  the  roads. In the  same  way  along

Thomson  Road on Sunday last I was asked by  residents

to  look at a local flooding problem. Although it  was

some hours after the rain had stopped, I found a house

where  six inches of watery mud was still standing  in

and around the house and this was being accumulated by

being  trapped  between the old and  the  new  Thomson

Roads.  Residents nearby on the other side of the  new

Thomson Road telephoned me on Monday to say that their

houses which had never been flooded before, were being

flooded now. I have not yet got a final report on this

particular area. I quote it because it illustrates the

danger of new development sending flood waters down to

people at the bottom of the hills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development also causes flooding difficulties when it

puts  valuable  capital investment on  to  land  which

would  otherwise  have  been used  for  drainage.  For

example,  the  flooding below the Peirce Reservoir  to

which I was just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



referring  could have been dealt with by a  drain  out

towards Ponggol but before the drain could be surveyed

or  constructed  or even planned the appropriate  line

for  it  had been covered by development at  Serangoon

Garden Estate and that way out is now closed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point I should make is the problem of

achieving co-ordination between different authorities.

The  City  Council in the City area has to  deal  with



water  which  is flowing down to them from  the  rural

area  and  in the rural area the decisions which  have

been  or will be made about the three big City Council

reservoirs  in  the  centre of the island  affect  the

planning of flood control works from Mandai right down

to Potong Pasir. To co-ordinate plans between separate

authorities is never easy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth general point is that adequate flood control

schemes are very expensive. They not only take  a  lot

of   construction  work  but  they  also  involve  big

requirements for land; and in the overcrowded state of

Singapore, land requirement means also heavy costs for

land  clearance  and resettlement. Hon.  Members  will

have  seen  in the Press reports of the complaints  by

residents in the Aljunied Road area who were reluctant

to  move off the land required for the drains for  our

second tidal gate in the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for these general points which hon. Members

would  like  to  bear in mind as I go forward  with  a

brief  account  of  the flooding which  occurred  last

Monday  and  how  it  is related to  the  plans  which

Government has carried out or now has in hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no reports of flooding from the eastern side

of the island. The flood control scheme at Bedok seems

to have been 100 per cent successful. A little further

west,  in  the Geylang Serai area, our new tidal  gate

which  is associated with some drainage works  carried

out  by the City Council seems also to have been fully

successful.  Higher up in the Lorong  Tai  Seng  area,

there was some water lying about when I visited it and

I  am  afraid that situation will remain and will have

to be accepted until we have completed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



our second tidal gate in the Kallang swamp  on

the  other side of Aljunied Road and cleared the  land

and  dug  the drains which will carry the  water  away

from the Airport Road area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no reports of significant flooding from Potong

Pasir  but,  as I mentioned just now, there  was  some

local  flooding  all  the way  up  Thomson  Road  from

Kampong San Teng as far as the Sembawang Hills Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the eastern side of the island. As far as

reports  to  me  go, there was no  other  significant

flooding  there. The rainfall on the eastern  side  of

the  island  was not so heavy as the rainfall  on  the

western side of the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I pointed out earlier, development along the Bukit

Timah Road produces an increasingly rapid run-off  and

concentration  of  water along Bukit  Timah  Road  and

through  to  Orchard Road. Although the rainfall  this

year  was  very much less than it was in  the  serious

flood  period of 1954, the flood levels at the  bottom

of Bukit Timah Road were considerably higher than they

were  in 1954. For example, in front of the University

of  Malaya, there were 2½ feet of water and there were

three  feet  of water at the Orchard Road/Scotts  Road

junction, the water coming there from the same source.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flooding of this area is one of the major

problems  which  will have to be  dealt  with  in  the

future.  The  only practical solution is  to  get  the

water  away  from here by a very big ring  drain  run-

fling  along Whitley Road across Thomson Road  through

the south of Toa Payoh down to the Kallang swamp. This

will involve very large works and, consequently, a lot

of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further south, we have the very serious and rapidly

increasing  flooding  along  the  catchment   of   the

Singapore River. At Upper Queenstown, there was a  big

accumulation  of water and further down  in  the  low-lying  area, the floods were as much as three feet  in

depth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, flooding has been created where it had

not  previously existed by the very large  development

works being carried out at the head of the catchment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



This is the third major flood control scheme which the

Government is carrying out. Putting it briefly, we are

cutting through the line of the Railway and propose to

run the water away to the west into the sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an increasing flood area in the City

around  Robinson  Road,  Boon  Tat  Street  and  Cecil

Street.   My   colleague,  the  Minister   for   Local

Government, informed this Assembly in July  1955  that

the  City  Council  had  schemes  for  pounding  areas

beneath the area of Boat Quay and Telok Ayer at a cost

of  about $450,000. I have no recent information about

City  Council proposals for work in this area but  the

inconvenience caused to this vital commercial area  by

flooding must be considerable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not had reports of any serious flooding

further west in the Jurong and Ama Keng areas, though,

no  doubt,  in  any  heavy rain  there  will  be  some

accumulation of water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must not conceal from hon. Members that, had the

tide  been higher or had the rainstorm gone on longer,

the  flooding  in the areas affected on  Monday  would

have been considerably worse. The essential problem is

that  the water has to be got away to the sea, and  if

the  drains  are not big enough, it cannot  get  away;

there  is a bottleneck and the water lies around until

gradually  it finds its way out. This constitutes  the

special  danger for Singapore: whilst a  single  storm

will  clear itself in a reasonable period of  time,  a

succession  of storms can lead to a very  considerable

accumulation of water with all the very serious danger

and damage to crops, to property, to livestock and  to

commercial activities which are inevitably involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of flood control will, I am afraid,

remain  with Singapore for a good many years  to  come

and   will   involve  quite  considerable  cost   and,

consequently,  quite considerable taxation  before  it

can  be fully dealt with. In the 3½ years that I have

been  concerned  with this matter, the Government  has

spent,  exclusive  of  land  costs,  approximately  $1

million on flood control works and is committed  to  a

further  $1¼   million for completion of  the  Geylang

Flood prevention scheme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



and  the Ulu Pandan diversion of the Queenstown flood

waters. In addition, the City Council has done quite a

good  deal of work but I have not got precise  figures

for their expenditure. It is probably safe to say that

the  work done so far is only a small part of the work

and the cost which will be necessary to give Singapore

reasonable freedom from flooding in all areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon. Members are well aware of the serious effects on

Singapore  of the world trade recession and  they  are

also  aware  of the very considerable sums which  have

been  found, and necessarily will have to continue  to

be  found,  to  provide education for  our  enormously

expanding  school-age population and for  medical  and

other  social services. I do not want to prejudge  the

decisions  which may be made by successive Governments

after the next general elections. I cannot attempt  to

say what priorities may in future be attached to flood

control  schemes  on  the  one  hand,  and  to  social

services  or  to  other forms of  development  on  the

other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, no immediate prospect of this

Government  undertaking any new  major  flood  control

schemes apart from the completion of the works I  have

referred  to - at Paya Lebar, Geylang and Ulu  Pan-dan.

Because  of this, I have reluctantly agreed  to  allow



our  Drainage Adviser to retire. In the 3½  years  in

which  he  has been working here, he has  completed  a

massive job of making an overall survey of the  causes

of  flooding on this island and he has worked out  the

schemes which will have to be carried out in order  to

remove  the flood problem from us. He has also carried

out  the important scheme at Bedok and has got us well

advanced  with the schemes for the Geylang/Paya  Lebar

area  and  for Ulu Pandan. He has worked  under  great

difficulties  and his achievements have  been  limited

not  by  his capacity but by the ability of Government

to  finance  the  necessary schemes. It  is  with  the

greatest  regret that I have agreed to his  retirement

but  he does leave behind him the general plans  which

can  be brought into action at any time when the funds

are available.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Minister tell us the approximate cost of dealing  with

the Bukit Timah Road problem?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not think that it will be safe to

give any figure which could be relied on. There are so

many  unsettled factors at present that  I  would  not

care to attempt to give a figure which had any serious

meaning in it.

<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk and

distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of education in Singapore has been steadily

rising  since 1945 and the recurrent cost now  absorbs

as much as a quarter of Government revenue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Before the Minister proceeds, I

need the Governor's recommendation or consent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I have the

Governor's consent to proceed with the Second  Reading

and Third Reading of this Bill now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Thank you. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> As I have stated, the cost of

education  now  absorbs about a quarter of  Government

revenue. The reasons for this are well known.  It  has

been  Government's  policy to  expand  the  scope  and

provision  of  educational facilities. The  number  of

school-going children has steadily increased  and  the

cost  per  pupil has tended also to rise. During  this

time, the education rate on the value of property  has

been no higher than two per cent and it has yielded  a

mere  $1.6 million in 1957 against the total  cost  of

education  of  over  $57  million  in  1957.  If   the

education  rate  is  to remain an item  of  Government

revenue,  it  is reasonable to raise it in  conformity

with  the  increased cost of education. It is proposed

therefore  to  raise the rate to four per  cent.  This

will  yield an estimated revenue of approximately $3.4

million in 1959. The increased rate will be assessment

on  the value of property in the City and in the rural

area  for  next  year. Notices of such assessment  are

issued in November of the year before and in order  to

facilitate  the early issue of notices, I  have  asked

that this Bill be taken through all the stages at this

sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Assistant Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohd. Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> Sir, I beg to second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.47 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Explanatory

Statement   to  this  Bill  is,  I  think   the   most

illuminating statement of all time. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The purpose of the Bill is to increase the education

rate  from  two per centum to four per centum  of  the

annual value of rated property."



<br><br>It  is  exactly  what the amendment says:  put  "four"

instead of "two". What I was hoping the Minister would

do when he rose to speak in support of the Bill was to

explain  to  us  why the figure of  four  was  chosen.

Everybody has agreed that the education rate  must  go



up  with  the increase in cost of education. We  would

like  to know why he has arrived at the figure 4,  not

4.5,  5 or 5.5. There must have been some logical  and

cogent  reason why it was four and we would be obliged

if he would inform the House of it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. On the comment on the Explanatory

Statement,   I   think  the  matter   is   procedural.

Explanatory  Statements should purely be  factual  and



further  explanations  must be  given  at  the  Second

Reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir, with

great  respect  I was not criticising the  Explanatory

Statement as either incorrect or improper. I was  only

saying  that  it must have been the most  illuminating

Explanatory Statement to a Bill that we have  read  in

this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is in accordance with Mr Speaker's

ruling.



<br><br>10.49 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no

one is happy when rates and taxes are increased. Hence

we  have to examine the necessity for such an increase

and see that at least the increased rate should be put

to  good  use.  This  two per  cent  increase  is  for

education, a cause to which we are all committed,  and

the  expenditure on which has increased by  leaps  and

bounds  during the last few years. This  has  happened

because of the increase in the number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



children attending school and I do not see how  anyone

in  his  right senses can object to this two per  cent

increase.  But, as I said, we must see that  this  two

per cent increase will be put to good use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in this House has uttered more warnings than I

have  that we have to be very careful regarding public

expenditure,   particularly  on  buildings,   as   the

carefree  spending  days  of colonial  government  are

over.  My prediction has been proved correct. We  have

now  reached  the  end  of our  reserves.  Government,

however,  has  at last realised this and has  suddenly

stopped many projects approved by this House. But  the

building  of  more  schools and  hospitals  cannot  be

stopped.  It must continue, and more must be built  to

provide facilities for our growing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one case, I must say the Minister for Education

has  realised this and I congratulate him. After  much

persuasion, his Ministry has agreed to relax the rules

requiring spacious playing-fields before plans for the

building  of schools can be approved. I read a  letter

that I received from him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Kiau Nam School,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference our conversation, I write to confirm that

this  Ministry  has recommended to the Senior  Planner

(Development  Control), Singapore  Improvement  Trust,

the  building  of  Kiau Nam School  on  the  following

terms:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this Ministry agrees to the stipulation that

adequate playing-fields must be provided where land is

available, it is of the opinion that there  should  be

relaxation of standard where applicable, especially in

a  congested area where site for building  schools  is

scarce  and where the school serves a real educational

need. The general policy of this Ministry is that  the

shortage of playing-fields should not be considered as

a  sole  and insurmountable obstruction for a building

project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also confirm that the Minister is prepared to relax

the  requirement under Section 24 (e) of the Education

Ordinance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to cite this case because this clearly

shows  how money can be saved when you are building  a

school.  This particular school is housed in  a  large

attap  hut  where  500  students  attend  morning  and

afternoon sessions. The Trustees raised $60,000 bought

a piece of land of about $30,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



sq. ft. and submitted plans for the building of 11 semi-permanent  class, rooms costing about  $30,000.  These

plans  were  sent back with the information  that  they

might  be approved if a two-storeyed building were  put

on  the  land. Sir, a two-storeyed building would  have

cost  at  least $120,000 on this reclaimed land  which'

was  a  swamp.  With this approval by the  Ministry  of

Education,  the  school  will be  constructed  and  800

children will be able to attend and use 11 class-rooms.

All  this has been done by the voluntary effort of  the



people living in that area who felt the need to help in

building   the  school  for  the  children  who   would

otherwise  be playing in the streets and around  drains

and getting into mischief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot and must not stop our children from

receiving education because of a shortage of funds  but

we  must  see  that the best use is made of  the  funds

available.



<br><br>10.55 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish the

Minister for Education would listen very carefully  and

note what is being said. I am sure that the whole House

will  agree  that money must be spent most  effectively

and  wisely.  Sir,  I consider that  the  Minister  for

Education should not be portrayed as a bad man who  has

betrayed the cause of Chinese education. Now, this Bill

asks  for  more  money  from the predominantly  Chinese

community  of Singapore. Sir, all along, unfortunately,

our  courageous and hard-working Minister for Education

has been condemned and termed as a destroyer of Chinese

culture. If the Minister would take this opportunity to

compare  the  so-called Ten-Year Plan for education  of

the  then colonial Government with that of the  present

Government during the last 3½ years, it would help the

public,   especially  the  Chinese  intellectuals   and

Chinese  students, to know more exactly about  how  the

Government   spends   money   on   Chinese   education.

Nevertheless,  the  outcry  of  discrimination  against



Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



education is going on mainly on the question of capital

grant  for school buildings as applications for capital

grant  for Chinese school buildings seem always  to  be

delayed  by the Singapore Improvement Trust or  because

of  other  factors. But so far the Government  has  not

taken  effective  steps  to  help  any  Chinese  school

management committee to put up a building. It  is  also

very slow in granting such applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of the salary of Chinese school

teachers,  there  is an outcry against the  experienced

teachers  receiving less pay than some of their  former

students. In other words, the salary scale for  Chinese

teachers  is chaotic. Nobody understands why it  should

be  so.  Some say "Oh, we are experts, and we  must  be

specially  recognised." Others say,  "No,  the  Chinese

University degree cannot be recognised." I think it  is

high  time  for  the  Government to  give  a  clear-cut

statement  on this vexed question of the salary  scales

of Chinese teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is to urge the Government to give more

aid to the Nanyang University. Last month, the Minister

announced  that  financial aid was to  be  extended  to

Nanyang  University. I should imagine that if financial

aid  had  been  granted  two years  ago,  the  Nanyang

University would be in a better position today.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill which

is  to increase the education rate from two per cent to

four  per  cent will touch my pocket to the  extent  of

something like $10. I am quit happy to pay that because

I  know  that  I  am  getting much more  for  the  many

children  that I send to school. I think everybody  who

is  in a position to help Government in providing  more

money for the young people should rejoice at this  step

taken  by the Government to help the young people.  But

what is uppermost in my mind now is that there will  be

16,000 young students of about 12 years old sitting for

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



Government common primary examinations and the  result

of  this will be that 11,000 of such children will  be

thrown  out  into  the streets without  any  means  of

getting into a regular secondary school. Of the 11,000

children  who  will  be out in the  streets,  probably

1,000 or so will be lucky enough to get into afternoon

schools,   private   schools  or  Government   evening

schools, but there will still be that large number  of

about 10,000 young people who will not know what to do

with  themselves. I Think that with this  increase  in

revenue,,  we  must  find a way to  help  these  young

people. We must not leave them without employment  and

without anything useful for them to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly think, Sir, that the education that we

are  having now tends to make almost everybody a  pen-pusher.  We have many other lines that we must accept.

I certainly feel that in a large city we not only want



clerks, managers and business executives, but we  also

want  fitters,  electricians  and  plumbers.  We  want

people  not  only on the level of engineers,  who  are

highly  qualified people, but also those who will  be

just  able  to  effect some sort of  repair  and  help

themselves in seeking employment or earning a living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking that, for the 10,000 young people,

something  must be done for them. Some sort of  school

must be set up for them, a school that will teach them

a trade, to be able to repair simple faults in radios,

teach  them about simple plumbing lines, all sorts  of

things  at  a  level lower than even the Junior  Trade

School.  I  am thinking of this because it  will  then

enable the young people to know a trade and so earn  a

livelihood. If they cannot help themselves, they  will

be  a liability to society. If they cannot earn enough

money,  they will know where to get it, by fair  means

or  foul.  We should try to see that they are assisted

along correct lines and not be misled by criminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, apart from this question of young

children  and unemployment, there is the  question  of

Government policy in helping Chinese schools. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



happen  to  be  connected with  a  number  of  Chinese

schools,  being on the Board of Managers, and  in  one

instance I find that the Education Department has been

willing to help in recommending an acre of land in the

Tan  Tock Seng Hospital burial ground for the building

of  a school. But then it seems that the Department of

Education  is not influential enough to help,  and  so

the Land Office must also be brought into the picture.

The  Planning Department must also have its  say  and,



all  in all, the assistance to the school seems to  be

rendered  in such a fashion that it does  not  give  a

feeling  that  help  is being handed  over  willingly.

There   is  a  lack  of  co-ordination  in  all  these



Governments Departments - where one Ministry recommends,

the  other  Ministry holds it up. That  is  absolutely

bad.  I would say that if Government is going to help,

if the Minister says, "We will help certain schools in

certain  projects",  all the other  Ministries  should

assist  in  such a project. I have another case.  This

happens to be the case of a school of which I happened

to  be  Chairman. We built a school for 18 classrooms,

three  storeys high. We wanted to have another  storey

to give added facilities. I was a Member of the Select

Committee  on the Education Bill and we all know  that

there   is   always  a  lack  of  space   for   school

playgrounds.  The  Minister at that time  assured  the

Opposition that the problem of playing fields will not

be  an obstacle to school building and so on. However,

it  spells  quite  differently when it  comes  to  the

Singapore Improvement Trust. As my colleague, the hon.

Member  for  Paya Lebar said, the S.I.T. has  its  own

rule  to obstruct all these matters. We have been told

not to proceed with the building of another storey  to

provide added facilities to the children. There  is  a

lack of playing fields which, in this particular case,

comprises  five  or  six basketball  courts.  In  such

schools as the one in Telok Ayer Street and the one in

Clemenceau Avenue, there are no playgrounds at all.  I

fail  to see why we could not give a directive to  the

S.I.T. to assist Government in the execution  of  its

policy  by  helping  all people  who  are  engaged  in

education.

<br><br>11.07 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I welcome the

proposal of Government to increase this Education Rate

from  2  per cent to 4 per cent. When I looked at  the

Paper, as the hon. Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon

Mong)  said just now, I was shocked to see that 11,000

students will be left behind, not knowing what  to  do

unless assistance could be given from other quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that if we want peace and harmony in this

country,  the  fortunate people should help  the  poor

ones.  My  only worry is this - as the hon.  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan  Yew)  has  asked  just

now - how  did the Government come to this figure  of  4

per  cent? Is that the right figure that is needed for

this  education assistance? I do hope that  Government

will  think  carefully, but the  people  do  not  mind

contributing  more. Once and for all,  how  much  have

they  got to contribute; they get tired of having such

appeals over and over again.



<br><br>11.09 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question has

been  asked why Government has increased the Education

Rate from 2 to 4 per cent and not to any other figure.

The  reason  for  this  is  that  since  the  cost  of



education  is  continuing  to  rise,  and  since  this

Government will only plan for the next new government,

I  thought that the increase should be related to  the

education  expansion plan for next year.  Therefore  I

have chosen this rate, to ask for an increase of, as I

said  in my speech, from $1.6 million to $3.4 million,

an  increase  of  $1.8 million,  which  will  be  just

sufficient to plan for a standstill budget so that the

expansion which has been committed will carry on,  but

no  new  projects will be carried out  by  Government.

That  is the main reason for the increase from  2  per



cent to 4 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the concern of several Members over the

possibility  of  throwing out,  as  they  say,  11,000

children into the streets, I must say that this is not

a  correct  statement.  11,000 children  will  not  be

thrown into the streets. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



am  sure  some  of them will be given  places  in  the

Junior Trade School. Many of them will, of course,  be

admitted  into the evening schools run by  Government.

If  necessary, the evening schools will be expanded to



absorb   those   young  persons  whom  the   Education

Department  think will benefit by secondary education.

I  have stressed to this House quite a number of times



that  evening  schools cater for those  who,  for  one

reason   or   another,  cannot  gain  admission   into

secondary  schools,  but  that  they  will  be   given

education on subjects which will lead to their sitting

for examinations held by the Royal. Society of Arts or

even the Cambridge School Certificate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)

mentioned  the  case of his own school where  he  said

that  the  S.I.T. was obstructive. Well, this  is  the

first time that I have heard him air his complaint  in

public.  I have not personally been informed of  this.

If  he had told me personally about it, I am sure that



he  would have got all the co-operation from me.  Even

during  the Select Committee on the Education  Bill  I

stated  that the lack of playing fields should not  be

an  obstruction  to the expansion of school  building,

especially  in  areas  where there  is  congestion  of

buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) said

that  there are always delays in the matter of capital

grants.  He makes it out that the delay is always  due

to  Government, but I must say - I am sorry that  he  is

not  here to hear it - that usually such delays are due

to  the Committees of Management themselves. They have

been  repeatedly told to submit their claims or  their

application for capital grants before June in the year

before  the grant that is to be given. The reason  for

this is to enable the Government to vet the plans,  to

see   that   every  thing  is  in  order  before   the

application  is  put  down  into  the  Estimates   for

approval  by  this  House. Usually the  Committees  of

Management  of these schools come any time  they  like

with inadequate plans or inadequate requirements,  and

when they are asked to complete those requirements  or

to give us more information,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



they  usually take a long time; and when they do come,

it  is  usually after the Estimates have been prepared

and  they  have to wait for another year before  those

Estimates  can be put down into the budget. Therefore,

the  delay  is  not  due  to the  Government.  If  the

managers  o these Management Committees will cooperate

with  the  Education Department and  comply  with  the

requests  required, I am sure things would  have  been

dealt with more speedily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of teachers' salaries has also been

brought up. The recognition of qualifications for  the

purpose  of  fixing  salaries for the  teachers  is  a

question  that  is determined not by  me  but  by  the

independent   Public  Service  Commission,   and   the

teachers in Chinese schools are paid according to  the

decision of the Public Service Commission. I think the

question   of  salaries  especially  of  the   Chinese

teachers  will be resolved very soon. The hon.  Member

for  Changi  also  mentioned something  about  aid  to

Nanyang  University. Well, the  aid  to  be  given  to

Nanyang  University is based on the deficit  disclosed

in   the   accounts   submitted  by   the   University

authorities. Hon. Members must realise that we  cannot

give  more  than the deficit, otherwise it  will  mean

that  Government  will be enabling the  University  to

have  a  surplus, and this should not be  the  way  in

which public funds should be handled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi also touched on the black

name  supposed to have been associated with  me  as  a

destroyer  and betrayer of Chinese culture, and  asked

me  to  mention  something about the present  plan  in

connection with the Ten-year plan. The Ten-year  plan,

augmented by the Five-year plan, envisages expenditure

on   Chinese  education,  subject  to  correction,  of

course,  of  something  like $300,000,  or  less  than

$300,000  for  ten or fifteen years; whereas  in  1957

Members  will realise that on Chinese education  alone

the  Government has spent over $10-million as compared

with  the Ten or Fifteen-year plan envisaged  with  an

expenditure of only $300,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> How do you spend it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I think that is a sufficient

answer to those who say that I betray Chinese culture.

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>11.22 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  have His Excellency  the  Governor's

consent  to proceed with this Bill. Sir, I move,  "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the University of Malaya (Amendment) Bill,

1958, I want to draw Members' attention to clause 68 of

the  Schedule  in the Bill. Clause 68 as it  stands  is

incomplete  and  it had to be presented  in  that  form

because  the  question  of  the  appointment   of   the

Chancellor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



was  under  discussion by both the Governments  and  no

agreement  had been reached by the time this  Bill  was

presented.  My attention has been drawn to it  by  you,

Sir,  and  I  have given the undertaking that  at  this

sitting I shall have that clause deleted and I shall do

that at the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I touch on the features of this Bill, I want

to  say at the outset that University teaching in Kuala

Lumpur  is  not a new thing. Indeed for  the  last  few

years  University expansion has been taking place  both

in  Singapore  and i&' the Federation  of  Malaya.  The

expansion  in  Singapore is a natural thing  because  a

University  must grow. The expansion in the  Federation

of  Malaya  is  also  natural because  the  University,

although  situated  in Singapore, has  been,  in  fact,

serving both territories and it is our duty to see that

university  teaching is provided in the  Federation  as

well  as  in  Singapore. Members  will  recall  that  a

Commission  of Inquiry was appointed on the  University

of Malaya in 1957 under the Chairmanship of Dr Aitken,

Vice-Chancellor of the University of Birmingham. A copy

of  the  report  has  already been  presented  to  this

Assembly  and  I  am  sure Members  are  aware  of  the

recommendations of that Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development schemes recommended by the Aitken

Commission  have  been  the  subject  of  very  careful

consideration by both the Governments of the Federation

of  Malaya  and Singapore, and we have jointly  decided

that,   in  keeping  with  the  development   in   both

territories,  an  alternative  scheme  which  aimed  at

creating  two  Divisions  of the  University  of  equal

status - one in each territory - would be more appropriate.

A  local  Joint Constitutional Committee  and  a  Joint



Finance  Committee were then jointly appointed  by  the

two  Governments under the common Chairmanship of  Dato

Sir  Clough Thuraisingham and the Bill before the House

today is the result of the recommendations of these two

joint  committees.  I  want to  place  on  record  here

Government's  appreciation of the efficient  manner  in

which  the  two  committees have dealt  with  the  work

entrusted to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want Members to bear in mind that when they

consider  this  Bill  the  Federation  of  Malaya  has

emerged   as  an  independent  Nation,  and  that   in

Singapore  the  grant of full internal self-government

is imminent. These factors and the rapid growth of the

University  have  made  it  necessary  for   the   two

Divisions of the University to be created. I also want

Members  to  note that under this Bill, the University

of  Malaya will continue as one unit, but at the  same

time  the  two  Divisions  in  Singapore  and  in  the

Federation of Malaya will be given as much autonomy as

possible.  The present Constitution embodied  in  this

Bill   is  based  on  certain  criteria  which  would,

firstly,   maintain   academic  standards;   secondly,

preserve  the unity of the University and provide  for

central  co-ordination  and control  of  high  policy;

thirdly, accord to the Divisions the maximum degree of

autonomy  consistent with the maintenance of  academic

standards  and the preservation of the  unity  of  the

University;    fourthly,    permit    the     possible

establishment  of  any  future Divisions  or  separate

universities   with  a  minimum  of  difficulty;   and

fifthly,  be  simple  to operate  with  a  minimum  of

statutory  authorities and thus  incorporate  wherever

applicable   recommendations  made   by   the   Aitken

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to allay the fears of Members of this House,

indeed  of  members of the public, that the University

has  been  split  and  that  the  policy  of  the  two

Divisions may, in future, go contrary to each other or

may  even compete with each other. The provision of  a

small  single Central Council above the two Divisional

Councils of the two divisions will see to it that  the

University  of Malaya will have a single  policy,  and

that  the  interests  of  one Division  will  not  run

contrary  to  the  interests of the other.  High-level

policies  will be determined by this Central  Council,

while day-to-day administration of the Divisions  will

be  the responsibility of the Divisional Councils. The

principle of responsible government has been  followed

in  the  draft of this new Constitution so  that  each

authority in the University will be responsible to the

other.  For  example,  the  Central  Council  of   the

University



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



consists  of  the Chairman of each Divisional  Council

and the Chairman of the Standing Finance Committee  of

each  Divisional  Council, among  other  members.  The

chief  executive head of the University is  the  Vice-Chancellor  and  the  chief  executive  head  of  each

Division is the Principal and they are responsible  to

each   other   through  membership  of   the   various

authorities provided under the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slight difference in the membership of the

two  Divisional  Councils  in  that  there  are  three

Government  appointees  on  the  Singapore  Divisional

Council  as  against four appointees of the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong and one appointee of the Conference  of

Rulers on the Kuala Lumpur Divisional Council. I  want

to stress here that the difference in the Constitution

of  the two Governments has made it necessary that the

Government   representation  on  the  two   Divisional

Councils  should  be  different. The  connecting  link

between  these two Divisional Councils on the official

side  is  provided  by  the presence  of  a  Singapore

Government  appointee  on  the  Federation  Divisional

Council and a Federation Government appointee  on  the

Singapore Divisional Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My statement will be incomplete if I do not say

something  about  the Students'  Union.  I  know  hon.

Members  of this House are aware of certain statements

made  by  representatives of the University of  Malaya

Students'  Union  and also by other interested  bodies

against  the  decision  to provide  for  two  separate

Students'  Union - one  in  Kuala  Lumpur  and  one   in

Singapore - instead of allowing for a  single  Students'

Union  to look after the students in both territories.

I want to allay the fears of the students that this is



aimed  at  splitting the students or is  done  against

their  interest. I want to make it known, in the first

place, that the provision for two Divisional Students'

Unions is a logical consequence of the creation of two

largely  autonomous  Divisions,  each  with  its   own

Divisional Council which will be responsible  for  the

Constitution   of  the  Students'   Union   in   their

territory. Secondly, the provision of two separate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



Unions  is  really something done in the interests  of

the  students themselves. I am sure that  one  of  the

main  objects of the Students' Union is to look  after

the  interests and welfare of their members,  and  who

can  look  after them better than their own colleagues

in the same territory? Also, the Kuala Lumpur Division

being  a  new  division will have fewer students  than

Singapore   and,  as  such,  should  be  given   every

opportunity to develop their own Students'  Union.  It

must  be  considered that although conditions in  both

territories are largely the same, there must be  minor

differences  which  are  best  looked  after  by   the

students  themselves who are on the spot.  I  want  to

stress  that  the  provision of two  Students'  Unions

should not deter the students in both territories, and

indeed the Union officials themselves, from meeting on

an ad hoc basis to discuss matters of common interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these few new features of the University

of  Malaya, the old features of the University  remain

substantially the same under the new Constitution  and

I  am sure that the University will continue as a unit

to  provide  students  both in Singapore  and  in  the

Federation  the higher education needed. I  know  that

the  creation of these two divisions will require tact

and  foresight in the administration of the University

in  future, but I am sure that with goodwill from both

sides and from the top the future of the University is

assured. I cannot emphasize too strongly that when the

University has grown, just as both the Federation  and

Singapore have grown, something must be done  to  meet

the  new situation and this Bill now before the  House

is,  in  the  opinion of both Governments and  in  the

opinion  of  the experts who have studied the  problem

and  made their recommendations, the best way to  meet

this new development in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also to draw the attention of hon. Members to

the  fact that the Federation Bill is identically  the

same and it was passed in the Federation sometime last

month. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the policies that

have been pursued by the Federation Government make

this Bill the inevitable consequence, and no one is

alarmed that there will be a University in Kuala

Lumpur. The Minister for Education has wrongly

interpreted the fears in the minds of many of the

graduates of the University if he thinks that they are

afraid that the University will be split into two. It

is well to remember that, with a combined population

of somewhere in the region of eight to eight and a

half millionth people, Malaya can well afford to have

more than three universities - one in Kuala Lumpur and

two in Singapore. But what is in the minds of many of

the graduates of the University is that the logical

outcome of the policies of the two Governments would

mean that only Singapore students could be in the

University in Singapore, and only Federation students

could go to the University in Kuala Lumpur. Once the

resources of the University of Singapore - its

scholarships and its bursaries - are provided for by the

Government of Singapore, it means that the majority

of, if not all, the students will, in time to come, be

Singapore students, and the same situation holds true

with the students in the University in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one feature of the University of Malaya that was

prominent  in  all its products, is that  it  was  the

place where the intellectuals - the elite - of Malaya  met

on  common  ground.  Be they subsequently  leaders  of

social or political movements in the Federation or  in

Singapore,  there is among all these men  a  sense  of

being  one. They have gone through the same  mill.  If

the  University  of  Singapore and the  University  in

Kuala  Lumpur  are  to cater not  just  for  Singapore

students or for Federation students, but to cater  for

all  in Malaya, then I say we welcome the creation  of

more and more universities, be they in Singapore or in

the  Federation. But this can only be  if  the  fiscal

policies  of  the  two  Governments,  with  regard  to

subsidies  to  the  University  and  its  scholarships

policy, are so designed that each Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



ensures that a sufficient number of its students is in

the  other  division. Only in that way  will  the  two

divisions of the University - ultimately, I suppose both

will   become   full  universities  in   themselves - be

Malayan.  What  must be avoided is a  situation  where

they   become  irreparably  separate,  not   only   in

geographical location, but in its student  population.

It   is  because  of  this  that  the  students   have



strenuously fought for their right to form one  union.

It  is  not  because they feel that the Government  is



consciously  trying to separate them into two  student

groups.  But  if  you  keep the two  students'  unions

separate  and,  at  the  same  time,  make  sure  that

Federation  students go to the Kuala  Lumpur  division

and  Singapore students go to the Singapore  division,

then  you will have a situation where the two  student

populations are quite separate and distinct from  each

other.  I hope that it will not be impossible,  purely

from  the administrative point of view, to ensure that

both  the  Singapore and the Federation divisions  are

pan-Malayan, and not provincial divisions.



<br><br>11.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite

disappointed  when the hon. Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

said  that  the people of this country and this  House

are  not  alarmed at this Bill. Sir, it is with  mixed

feelings, I must admit, of course, not of alarm,  that

we  now  debate this Bill. Based on the  size  of  the

population  and  the  area, Singapore  and  Malaya  do

require  many more universities, and there  is  reason

for having a university in Kuala Lumpur. But we cannot

deny  the political fervour and political significance

that  are  attached  to this Bill. We  support  higher

education  as well as the desirability to  build  more

universities,  but  not at this juncture.  The  merger

between Singapore and Malaya is in poor shape, and now

we have this Bill and the Causeway clamp.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must regret that the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar  did  not give more emphasis to this point,  but

only  touched  upon  the Government's  policy  of  not

allowing Singapore students to study in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



Kuala Lumpur and that Federation students cannot  come

and study in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, I beg the Singapore Government to make a

statement that the introduction of this Bill was never

the  intention  of  the Singapore  Government  or  the

Singapore  Legislative Assembly. We do not  want  this

division.  We do not want this Bill. We prefer  to  be

called  the  Singapore  Branch of  the  University  of

Malaya.  We  do  not  mind  the  headquarters  of  the

University of Malaya being in Kuala Lumpur. We do  not

mind  former  Raffles College or the King  Edward  VII

College  of  Medicine now being called  the  Singapore

Branch  of  the University of Malaya. The significance

that  our  people should attach to the  University  of

Malaya  is that it belongs to the Malayans, not  Kuala

Lumpur Malayans or Singapore Malayans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must confess that the divide and rule tactics

of  the old colonial regime seem to have succeeded  to

some   extent,   and  our  people  are  now   dividing

themselves. Even in such a dignified and distinguished

institution  as  the University of  Malaya,  we  allow

stupid and short-sighted politics to get in.



<br><br>11.40 am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that

all the people in Malaya and Singapore always consider

themselves  as  Malayans. Nobody in  Malaya  has  ever

thought of Singapore as not being a part of Malaya  or

that  Singapore is a foreign territory. At the present

time, Sir, the two Universities are joined together by

a  supreme  Council  governing  the  two  branches.  I

believe  this is a good thing. It should be a  prelude

to  the creation of more universities. I hope we shall

have   not   only  just  two  Universities  but   more

universities, universities to be situated in the north

of Malaya, in Kuala Lumpur and in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole of South-east Asia, Sir, the University

of  Malaya is an important institution. My hope,  Sir,

is  that there will be universities situated all  over

Malaya, but that the students must come from all parts

of  the  country, including Singapore. If there  is  a

policy whereby



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



we  have a certain proportion of students coming  from

each  part  of  the country, then we  are  consciously

getting  the  best of the country to mix  together  to

produce  the  best.  We must not only  think  of  just

having universities for our own students, but I  think

it  would be a wise policy to have students from other

countries in South-east Asia joining our universities,

so that our ideals would be well known to all in South-East  Asia.  Not only that, Sir - many of  our  students

should go out and join universities in other countries

and  so get the best from foreign lands, and then come

back  and serve us, if we can have that, then we  will

not be, as the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar has said,

insular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders of tomorrow will not only be able to

understand  their own local problems but will  have  a

wider outlook in life. They will be able to know  what

is  going  on around them in South-east Asia and  also

what  is  happening in the world. If  we  can  achieve

this,  Sir,  then I say this Bill, which is  just  the

beginning of things to come, will be a good Bill, when

we have more universities to help our local boys.



<br><br>11.45 am.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chew, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> In reply, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar has said that  the

two  divisions should not be provincialised, that  is,

Federation  students  should  be  able  to   come   to

Singapore,  and vice versa, to study. I wish  to  draw

the  attention of hon. Members to the fact  that  with

the  movement of the Engineering Department  to  Kuala

Lumpur  - there  is only one Engineering Department  in

the two divisions - and the existence of the Faculty  of

Agriculture in the Federation, that will help  towards

that object, that is, help students from Singapore and

the  Federation mix together. Singapore  students  who

want  to  study engineering will have to go  to  Kuala

Lumpur,  and  where the Medical Faculty is  concerned,

Federation students will have to come to Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



for  their medical studies. We can expect that in  the

first  few  years of the development of the University

in  Kuala  Lumpur,  the  range  of  subjects  will  be

incomplete and, as I have said, with the siting of the

Engineering  Deportment and certain other  studies  in

Kuala  Lumpur, students will continue to go  from  one

territory   to   the  other.  The  present   financial

arrangements between the two Governments are only  for

a  triennial period, and the position will be reviewed

at the end of 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill itself, Sir, actually caters for all, and

not, as feared by the hon. Member for Changi, for only

one  section. He said that this is a divide  and  rule

matter. Well, I can assure him that it is not so. As I

have  pointed out in my speech earlier, the University

is  not  actually being split, but the  divisions  are

allowed  to  develop themselves. There  is  a  Central

Council, a supreme body, governing at the top, and the

two divisional Councils are given as much autonomy  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Serangoon has said that he

welcomes  the  creation of more universities  so  that

they  can  serve the needs of the country. I  wish  to

sound  a  warning  here: that,  firstly,  we  have  to

consider   the   finances  necessary  to   have   more

universities;   secondly,   we   must   relate    that

requirements to the needs of the country. We cannot go

on  producing  intellectuals who cannot  be  employed.

Although  they  are  employable, there  might  not  be



sufficient jobs for them. We must temper our needs  in

that  respect. I agree, in principle, of course,  that

we must expand our university education, but we cannot

expand without any limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. [Mr Chew Swee Kee.]

<br><br>Members  will  note that there is only one  Government

appointee on the Central Council which is the  highest

executive body and which makes recommendations to  the

Government  on  matters of finance.  It  is  therefore

important  that  there should be no mistake  that  the

Government  appointee on this Council  should  be  the

Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I move,

"one person appointed by the Council of Ministers of"

and insert "the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of

Education,".



<br><br>Here  again.  Sir,  the Council in  the  Kuala  Lumpur

Division  should have a Government appointee  in  that

division, and he should be the Permanent Secretary  to

the  Ministry of Education so that he can  co-ordinate

the policies in both the divisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 15, lines 24 and 25, to leave out "three

persons appointed by the Council of Ministers of"  and

insert  "the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury,  the

Permanent  Secretary to the Ministry of Education  and

the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Health.".



<br><br>Hon. Members will note that there are three Government

appointees  on the Singapore Divisional  Council.  The

purpose  of Government representation on the Singapore

Divisional   Council  is  to  look  after   Government

interests  and  to make certain that the  University's

policy   does  not  run  contrary  to  that   of   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the University is receiving a grant from the

Government, obviously the Treasury must be represented

on   the   Council.  It  is  also  obvious  that   the

educational interests must be looked after, since  the

University  is  an  institution  of  higher  learning.

Therefore,   the   Ministry  of  Education   must   be



represented  on this Council. And there  is  also  the

Medical  Faculty to be considered, and obviously  that

Ministry is an interested party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment therefore provides for the membership

of three Permanent Secretaries - the Treasury, Education

and Health - on this Divisional Council, so that there

will be no mistake regarding this representation on

the Council in future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang) (for the Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, with your permission, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the Improvement Rate of 2

per centum on the annual value of all houses,

buildings, lands and tenements within the City of

Singapore, fixed by the Singapore Improvement Trust

under subsection (1) of section 22 of the Singapore

Improvement Ordinance (Cap. 259) for the year 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this rate cannot by law exceed five per centum

on property within the City area. Hitherto, this rate

has always been two per centum and the Trustees

recommend no change in the rate for 1959. The approval

of this Assembly is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



again  required  for  this  rate  under  the  Singapore

Improvement Ordinance. This rate, which is in  lieu  of

the  improvement rate referred to in section 59 of  the

Municipal  Ordinance, is collected by the City  Council

and paid over half-yearly to the Trust. The monies from

this  rate,  together with the equivalent  Government's

contribution   under  section  23  of   the   Singapore

Improvement  Ordinance, are estimated at $3.53  million

and form one of the major items of revenue of the Trust

and  are  paid into the Improvement Fund. These  monies

are  spent on improvement schemes such as the rehousing

of persons, the opening of back-lanes, the provision of

open  spaces in congested areas, and generally  on  the

maintenance of the general improvement plan.

His Excellency the Governor's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $415,138

shall be supplied to the Government under the heads  of

expenditure  and  for  the services  specified  in  the

Schedule  contained in Sessional Paper No. Cmd.  34  of

1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for the various applications are

explained in the Sessional Paper but I should  like  to

take this opportunity to make some additional comments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to item 191 which is for Aircraft

Services,  I should explain that in so far  as  Malayan

Airways Limited are concerned, this refers to duty on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



petrol uplifted for other than scheduled flights,  that

is  for testing engines on the ground, for test flights

within the boundaries of Singapore, and so on. Duty  is

charged on such petrol at the time of uplift. Remission

of duty is made on the authority of the Minister and is

paid  from  this  vote.  Petrol  uplifted  for  flights

outside  the  boundaries  of  Singapore,  that  is  for

scheduled or international flights, is issued  free  of

duty  under  the  agreement with  the  company  and  by

arrangement  with the Customs and the oil company,  and

the question of repayment of duty does not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to item 196 which is in connection with

the conversion of a ward at Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  it

may  be  asked  why, with so many cases of tuberculosis

disclosed by the recent survey, a ward at Tan Tock Seng

Hospital   should  be  converted  into  a  hostel   for

Assistant Nurses. In the first place. Sir, there  is  a

serious  shortage of Assistant Nurses for  tuberculosis

work.  Recruitment  and training is  a  matter  of  top

priority. Recruitment will be difficult in any case but

training will be impossible unless accommodation can be

found   within   the   hospital  compound.   When   the

development  plans  for  Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital  were

implemented,  perhaps too much emphasis was  placed  on

ward  accommodation due, no doubt,  to  the  fact  that

standard plans were available and wards could be  built

in  groups  with  some ease. As a result,  the  present

position  is  that we have adequate ward  accommodation

but  no  hostel accommodation to cater for  the  urgent

need  for Assistant Nurses. In the circumstances,  Sir,

the  most sensible thing to do is to convert one of the

existing  wards,  which is at present standing  vacant,

into  a  temporary Nurses Hostel, particularly as  this

can  be  done very quickly and at comparatively  little

cost.  This does not mean, Sir, that we shall be  short

of  ward accommodation for tuberculosis cases.  In  the

first place, hon. Members will be glad to hear that the

results  of the recent survey were much more favourable

than  had  been hoped. Only one per cent of  the  cases

brought to light require hospitalization. To meet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



this  demand,  300  beds have been  made  available  at

Woodbridge  Hospital  where improvements  in  treatment

techniques  for  mental ailments  have  resulted  in  a

spectacular  reduction  in  the  number  of   patients.

Chronic   cases   will  be  accommodated   there.   The



accommodation at Tan Tock Seng Hospital should be quite

adequate to cater for the acute cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid:</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion committed to Committee of Supply.

<br><br>12.09 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The summary is at page 9.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 8-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $199,450 for Head 8 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 17-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $15,045 for Head 17 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 22-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $61,375 for Head 22 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 34-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,039 for Head 34 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 48-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $10 for Head 48 ordered to stand part of

the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 54-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $28,534 for Head 54 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 9-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,979 for Head 9 stand part of the

Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum of $1,979

is  in respect of two vans: one for the Directorate and

Administration  and  the  other  for  the   Engineering

Division of the Broadcasting Department. I notice  that

the amounts voted for both are identical: "Amount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



voted in 1957 ... $4,750; Amount spent up to 31-12-57

... $3,576; Outstanding balance ... $1,174";  and

then  for some curious reason the unforeseen revote  is

$1   less   in   the   case  of  the  Directorate   and

Administration van as against the Engineering  Division

van.  I  should  have thought that the engineers  would

have been more clever at saving the extra dollar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I regret that I cannot offer an explanation

without reference to my file..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,979 for Head 9 ordered to stand part of

the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 45-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $99,936 for Head 45 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 48-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $62,000 for Head D 48 stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary has informed  us  almost  casually

that, as a result of the investigation into T.B. in  a

recent survey, only one per cent of the cases have been

found   to   be   actively   infectious   and   require

hospitalization. That is a matter of profound  interest

to  Singapore and perhaps he could elaborate on that  a

little  more,  because, if there is a cutting  down  of

hospital  beds  for T.B. cases, one  assumes  that  the

Government  will  be  providing better  facilities  for

domiciliary   treatment   for   cases   not   requiring

hospitalization. That is a question on  which  I  would

like  an  assurance that home treatment or  domiciliary

treatment  is going to be better looked after  than  in

the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point which was mentioned, that 300 beds

in  Woodbridge  Hospital are being  provided  for  T.B.

patients,  one  would like to know whether  this  means



that  there  will be congestion or lack  of  sufficient

facilities   for  mental  patients  in  the  Woodbridge

Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we understand the need for training more nurses

at  Tan  Tock  Seng Hospital, there are  two  important

issues involved in this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>12.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> On the

question  of  the domiciliary nurses, I  can  give  an

assurance that that is so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> That better facilities are being provided

for  the domiciliary nursing by the Ministry; and with

regard  to the question of Woodbridge Hospital,  there

is  no  question of any exceptional congestion in  the

number of beds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have that

repeated  slowly  and  clearly, because  I  could  not

follow what he said?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think that will appear in our

Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I do not mean that the

Minister  was inaudible but the meaning was not  clear

and  I would be obliged if he would state clearly what

exactly he intended to say in reply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member then ask a

question as to what he wants to know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Like the Member for Tanglin, I

share  his anxiety about the shortage of accommodation

for  domiciliary nursing in Tan Tock Seng Hospital and

Woodbridge  Hospital, and I would  like  to  know  the

categorical answer to that anxiety.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I thought I had already answered.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to

enlighten  the House on exactly what steps  are  being

taken to increase the nurses for domiciliary treatment

and  what  numbers  are involved.  We  are  told  that

hospitalization cases are down to one per cent but  it

is  generally  known - subject  to  correction - that  the

number of infectious cases of tuberculosis are in  the

neighbourhood  of  five or six per  cent,  unless  the

survey  has  shown  something very  different  indeed.

There  is only one per cent of them to be hospitalized



and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



balance   have  to  be  looked  after  by  domiciliary

treatment through nurses, provided by the Ministry  of

Health,  going  into  the homes and  seeing  that  the

patients are under proper care.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I think the Hon, the Financial Secretary

has   already   indicated  that  one   per   cent   of

tuberculosis cases require hospitalization. Now  those

requiring     domiciliary    treatment     and     not

hospitalization  are  looked after  not  only  by  the

domiciliary nurses but also as out-patients. There  is

no  overcrowding of mental patients in the  Woodbridge

Hospital.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> That does not answer my question. The

question I am asking him to answer is this. I am quite

satisfied with the interesting statement of  the  Hon.

the  Financial  Secretary that only one  per  cent  of



infectious cases of T.B. require hospitalization. This

is  something revolutionary which we have not heard of

in Singapore before today and, it being a fact, so far

as  we  know,  that there are five per cent  cases  of

tuberculosis  in Singapore, what is happening  to  the

four  per  cent? It is not a question of over-crowding

at  the hospital. It is what new facilities are  being

provided  by the Ministry of Health to provide  nurses

so  that those who are not hospitalized are treated at

home and are properly treated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I have already answered that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $62,000 for Head D 48 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 59-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $19,626 for Head D 59 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 45-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $41,246 for Head D 45 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 56-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $29,900 for Head D 56 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $415,138 for the Heads of Expenditure and

for the services specified in the Schedule ordered to

stand part of the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion and Schedule reported, without amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the Motion put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $415,138

shall be supplied to the Government under the heads of

expenditure  and  for the services  specified  in  the

Schedule contained in Sessional Paper No. Cmd.  34  of

1958.

<div align="center"><b>POLIO EPIDEMIC</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Incompetence of Ministry of Health)</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion which

I am now moving asks the House to join me in deploring

the inept and incompetent manner in which the Minister

for  Health  and  his  Ministry have  dealt  with  the

current polio epidemic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to say at the outset that, as a

responsible law-making body, we should not  say  today

anything which might cause unnecessary alarm or  panic

amongst members of the population. What I have to  say

is  not about the rights and wrongs of medical opinion

on  the  use  of Sabin vaccine, but on the  completely

inept  and  incompetent manner  in  which  the  public

relations   have  been  handled.  At  the  outset,   I

apologise for having caused this inconvenience to  the

Minister  for  Health  who,  I  understand,  is   just

preparing  to  leave for his holiday in  Hongkong  and

Japan.  I  am  sorry that I have to bother  him  in  a

debate on this matter. But I would like to remind  him

that,  before  he  leaves for his holiday,  he  should

consider some of the points which I have to make.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the final medical judgment on the use

of  Sabin vaccine may be, whatever the pros and  cons,

everybody  that I have consulted agrees  that,  having

started  Sabin vaccinations, it is the  duty  of  this

Government  to Sabinise that section of the population

that  may be open to infection. It is the duty of this

Government  to  see  that that  is  done  efficiently,

quickly, and thoroughly under expert guidance. This is

a  purely  administrative job and there should  be  no

difficulty  in getting the whole mechanism  geared  up

in order that the operation may be completed with the

least possible delay. I have, however, this to say  on

the  other  aspect - the way in which this  problem  has

been   presented  to  the  people,   partly   by   the

incompetence  and ineptitude of the Minister  and  his

Ministry, and partly because of the cleverness of  the

colonial language Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no exaggeration to say that, as a result of the

often    contradictory    statements    issued     and

published - one  expert  of the  Ministry  contradicting

another  expert - there  has  been  a  general  loss  of

confidence  in the work of the Ministry.  Furthermore,

they  have allowed themselves to be drawn into a Press

campaign  which the Straits Times claims has  probably

forced  the Government into taking action with  regard

to  Sabin vaccine. Sir, an impertinent Press has  this

to say today:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second feature has been the use of vaccine to

combat  the epidemic. Publicity helped the authorities

to make up their minds -"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member disclose the name

of the paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> This is the editorial in the

Straits  Times published today. A group of journalists

found  great  pleasure  in believing  that  they  had.

rightly or wrongly, crowded the Government into taking



this action. I should hate to believe it is true,  and

I  would  be  prepared to listen to the facts  and  be

relieved to hear that that is not the case. But whilst

that  may  be  just the fault of the  newspaper,  this

sorry  record,  which  has led to  a  loss  of  public

confidence, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



primarily the responsibility of the Minister  and  his

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This business started with an article on the 8th of

October,  1958,  in  the Straits  Times - I  am  quoting

exclusively   from  this  colonial  English   language

paper - it says on page 9:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A private doctor commenting on the Sabin vaccine

last  night  said,  'It is still in  the  experimental

stage  in  Canada and the U.S. latest report  say  its

effectiveness has not yet been proved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There would probably be no harm in trying it here

but,  if  it  is not effective in giving immunity,  it

would  give  those who took a dose a  false  sense  of

security.'"



<br><br>On  the  11th October, the same newspaper  on  page  4

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is swimming dangerous while Singapore polio epidemic

lasts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes' says the Health Ministry, which has advised

parents  to  keep  their children away  from  swimming

pools,  since  the first warning of the  epidemic  was

given on October 1st.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No' is the apparent answer of the Education

Ministry,  which has done nothing to stop the  present

season of school swimming meets."



<br><br>Then says the report at the end of the article:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Education Minister, Mr Chew Swee Kee, the

Minister's Permanent Secretary, Mr Lee Siow Mong, and

Dr   Doraisingham  were  not  available  for  comment

yesterday."



<br><br>Then  on  the  12th October again on the  question  of

whether  schools should or should not  close  swimming

meets:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Permanent Secretary to the Health Ministry, Dr

M.   Doraisingham,  said:  'It's  for  the   Education

Ministry to decide.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Minister for Education, Mr Chew Swee Kee, said:

'I don't know . . . it's an administrative matter. Ask

my Permanent Secretary, Mr Lee Siow Mong.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Lee  said:  'I've been in close touch  with  the

Health Ministry and so far we have had no signal  from

them to cancel swimming sports, apart from the general

warning.'"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that the Straits Times?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes. 17th October, says the

editorial:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the wrong time for tranquillisers."



<br><br>General incitement to get people excited! And  on  the

18th October - a Press conference:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Health Ministry statement on the subject said:" -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



on page 9:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The Ministry has now decided to use this vaccine as

an  immunizing agent against the disease, but this has

nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  the  outbreak   now

prevailing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, the Ministry was not satisfied with this

vaccine  because sufficient experiments had  not  been

carried out to prove its efficiency or safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only recently has it been possible for us to say that

this vaccine can immunize a person and, if carried out

in  large  numbers, prevent  the  occurrence  of  the

disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this will not stem the present outbreak. An

expert  committee recently studied the  Sabin  vaccine

and  recommended  that  this should  be  used  without

delay - not   because   there   is   an   outbreak    of

poliomyelitis, but there is little reason to  postpone

its use any further.'...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminded that the Health Ministry had advised the

public  not  to have anti-polio injections during  the

epidemic,  Dr Doraisingham said: 'We advised  caution

in having prophylactic injections generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a very busy man and when you reporters ring me

up  I  cannot  explain everything  in  detail  on  the

phone.'"



<br><br>Sir,  I am glad to know that those engaged in the duty

of  looking after the public health are busy  people - I

should  hate  to  believe they are  not - but  I  wonder

whether  it is wise, in the midst of a busy programme,

to  carry  on telephone conversations with  the  Press

which  one  subsequently has either to  modify  or  to

deny, with  catastrophic result  in  loss  of  public

confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on 19th October came the announcement that the

Government  was going to use Sabin, and  the  friendly

Straits Times, under a headline, said:-



<div align="center">"MANY S'PORE DOCTORS WARN AGAINST VACCINE: DON'T BE GUINEA PIGS"</div>



<br><br>And that I call really helpful and friendly!



<div align="center">"<b>13</b> MORE HIT BY POLIO"</div>



<br><br>"thirteen"  underlined just to remind  everybody  that

there is some mystery attached to this number,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>"Biggest total for one day"</b> -



<br><br>a  Sunday  newspaper carried the banner headline,  and

went  right down to the bottom of the page  under  the

sub-heading "GUINEA PIGS" - before that it said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to Singapore's polio expert, Prof. J. H.

Hale, there are about 100 cases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



of non-paralytic polio for every paralytic case. At

this rate the number of people who have harboured the

disease in the current outbreak would be 11,800.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile many Singapore medical practitioners warned

their patients of the danger of being made 'guinea

pigs' of the Government's anti-poliomyelitis

vaccination drive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They told patients who approached them for anti-polio

doses: 'It may do more harm than good to'"-



<br><br>it continues on page 7-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'you. It's safer to go without it.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors interviewed yesterday warned that people

should  not  be  misled into believing  that  vaccines

against  poliomyelitis might become  a  practical  and

safe public health measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them said: 'The established objection to using

such  vaccines is that they are not absolutely safe - in

other  words,  there is a danger of their  contracting

polio after the inoculation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the germs are so readily transmitted from the

recipient to his contacts that it is quite impossible,

without   extraordinary  isolation   precautions,   to

prevent    their   escaping   into   the   surrounding

communities where they might cause an outbreak.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a garbled version of the British Medical Journal

publication  about experiments in the Central  Belgian

Congo - how one village got immunized, and an epidemic

broke  out in the next village, and so it went  on  to

the  next village, and the village in between got  it,

and  they had to immunize the whole lot, and everybody

was  safe.  Sir, having warned - of course, not  stating

categorically  themselves  but  just  quoting  medical

practitioners spreading this line - they then went on to

say on the 23rd October:



<div align="center">"SOS FOR MORE VACCINE TO MEET RUSH".</div>



<br><br>A sense of urgency, impending doom and disaster - S.O.S.

Meanwhile the Minister just merrily read all this and



added to the general comment. Said he at a Press

conference -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> What day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> 23rd October -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister for Health, Mr A. J. Braga, spent half

an hour at the Yio Chu Kang clinic today."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



Then Dr Doraisingham said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 100,000 doses we have requested would not be

sufficient to give vaccine to all children  under  the

age  of  10  but  in the case of live  vaccine - as  the

Sabin - it  can be expected that twice as many  or  more

are  likely to be immunized by the transference of the

virus from the vaccinated person to the unvaccinated."



<br><br>Sir,  this same spokesman for the Minister for  Health

had  said,  on  the  question of  transference,  in  a

written  question/answer interview with the Singapore

Standard the day before, October the 22nd, question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowing all this, why have you hesitated so long

before using the Sabin vaccine?"



<br><br>Says the doctor:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'When it is known that, in very rare instances, the

less attenuated forms of the virus can be excreted, it

is  possible  in  large countries such  as  India,  to

experiment with its use in isolated communities at the

risk  of subjecting the small population group to  the

prevalence of the virulent virus. Singapore is a small

place,  and what is a small experiment in an  isolated

population  becomes  a  national  experiment  and,  in

consequence,  extreme caution has to be  exercised  in

order  to  prevent a calamity arising  however  remote

that possibility might be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the reason for this cautious procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we are entirely satisfied that the use of this

vaccine   is   safe,  we  could  not   implement   the

immunization programme.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seriously doubt whether there should be all

these  untrained  Press Relations  officers  for  each

Ministry,  It may be an accurate, honest  and  a  fair

appraisal  of the medical situation. But to  tell  the

public,  when you had already decided to let  go  this

Sabin  vaccine, that there had been cases  (though  in

very  rare instances) where the less attenuated  forms

of  the  virus  can  be excreted - in  other  words  the

virulent  ones  can be excreted through  passage!  And

then to tell them the next day, "Oh, well, although we

have  got  only 100,000 doses, we are hoping that  one

fellow  will pass on to the next chap and  we'll  have

200,000, maybe 300,000 thereby Sabinising by passage",

having  the day before told the public that,  in  rare

cases, the virulent ones might be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



passed  on  by passage. Then on the 25th October,  the

Minister  on the front page:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...predicted today that the

present polio epidemic would die out within a month."



<br><br>Now,  Sir,  I do not know whether he did. If  he  did,

then  he  must  be  a very, very unwise  man,  because

nobody  knows whether it is going to die out within  a

month  or  not. But there was no denial. Knowing  that

the  Press  was already giving his Permanent Secretary

difficulties - so much so that he had to say  that  he

was  a  very busy man, he could not explain everything

in  detail over the telephone - why should the  Minister

open  himself to such constructions? Immediately after

that,  Prof. Hale, the only expert that the Government

has  got,  at  the same Press conference, said:  "Your

guess is as good as mine." Now is not that the kind of

thing that is calculated to bring the Minister and his

Ministry   into  ridicule  and  contempt?   Said   Mr

Braga - this is by way of exculpating his Government:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't give the vaccine at a large number of

centres  at  the same time, but we will now  be  in  a

position to run morning and afternoon sessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't yet know exactly what the new supply of

vaccine  will  cost,  but it will be  negligible - apart

from the freight charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have used Salk vaccine for 100,000 children would

have  cost $3,000,000 - three injections each at  $10  a

shot."



<br><br>Is  not that stupid, Sir, in the midst of a relatively

minor polio epidemic - I agree with the Ministry that it

is  so;  it  has not reached the proportions epidemics

have  often  reached  in  places  like  America -   but

nevertheless in the midst of a situation where parents

are scared stiff, in a near-panic over their children,

to  say. "Ah, well, you know, it is no use using  Salk

vaccine.  It  costs $10 per shot. Three times  ten  is

$30. It will cost in all $3-million. Therefore we  are

going  to  get  something free or at negligible  cost,

apart from freight charges."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mind the Labour Front Government saying

stupid  things to bring them to their doom. But  I  do

mind  Ministers, either through ignorance  or  general

lackadaisical  attitudes to matters  which  are  their

concern, saying things



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



which  exasperate the public, and convince  them  that

the Ministry, or at least the Minister in charge, is a

man  guided  by  the  wrong principles,  that  he  was

prepared to risk the lives of a hundred thousand  kids

because  he  was  going  to save  his  Government  $3-million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, patent medicine pedlars - the people who

manufacture  Salk vaccine - canvassed every Assemblyman.

They  sent  a  whole  lot  of pamphlets  and  leaflets



through the post, saying: what a wonderful thing  Salk

vaccine was. If only they could sell $3-million  worth

of Salk vaccine! I am told that it actually costs only

a  dollar per tube and three shots will cost $3. So if

the  Minister  thought he was going to pay  $3-million

for  it, they might be able to sell it to him for  $2-million  and  make a lot of money out of it!  But  the

stupidity of the statement, to which, of course, quite

rightly the Straits Times gave considerable prominence

on its front page, is enough to have sent any group of

intelligent  parents into a rage. What  I  am  at  the

moment amazed at is the calm and the resignation  with

which  they  have  had to put up in the  face  of  the

incompetence  with which this whole problem  has  been

handled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is what Professor Hale said - I do not doubt

that  he  is  a  polio expert and  that  he  has  been

investigating the use of the attenuated form of  virus

in  the  Sabin vaccine - but was this likely  to  induce

public confidence? At the same conference he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that the new supply will be used up

within five weeks, but Prof. Hale, who is scheduled to

leave  here  permanently in December, said  he  would

remain to see the job through."



<br><br>Now  that  is very kind of him, and quite proper.  But

then he went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...there would be keen interest in medical circles

in  other parts of the world in the large-scale  Sabin

vaccine  tests  taking  place  in  Singapore  and   he

intended to write a full report on the matter."



<br><br>Sir,  I  am  sure it is right and proper for  medical

science  that such large-scale tests should  be  fully

documented. Undoubted effectiveness and so on of Sabin

vaccine.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



But  to  tell the people of Singapore that  the  whole

medical  world was watching the situation and that  he

was  going  to write a paper on it! If the  Government

had  a Public Relations Department which knew its job,

it  would have told the Minister and his experts that,

however true that statement might have been, it is one

which  was  misconceived  and  calculated  to  destroy

public  confidence.  But,  having  gone  to  all  this

trouble to explain why Sabin vaccine should be used in

an  endemic area in the face of a rising epidemic - I do

not  know  whether this is the Straits  Times  or  Dr

Doraisingham - but it said here, right at the end of  it

all "European victim" -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The European boy aged 13 from Serangoon Gardens was

admitted to the R.A.F. Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Doraisingham admitted candidly today that the polio virus 'disdains all standard advice about

precautions to avoid it.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added: 'Without active immunisation, people are

really  helpless  in the face of  it - it  may  strike

anyone.'"



<br><br>Now,  was  it competence to say all these things  when

you  had the population already madly queueing  around

the two or three centres a day; parents waiting at the

break of dawn trying to get their kids vaccinated? And

you  went  on to say, "Well, we are helpless;  it  may

strike anyone". That means doom; that we die.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the same newspaper today has the impudence,

having quoted all those doctors to show why, in  their

opinion,  Sabin  (which  has been  given  considerable

publicity by courtesy of the Straits Times) should not

be used. It went on to say in the editorial:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Field trials last year in the Belgian Congo were

conclusive  (whatever the British Medical Journal  may

say)  both  as  to the safety of the vaccine  and  its

efficacy in stemming an epidemic."



<br><br>Sir, to the extent that this was the result of a Press

campaign which was beyond the control of the Minister,

he is not to be blamed. But knowing full well from the

very  beginning  that  the Press  was  making  this  a

popular  issue and was selling the story, it  was  the

stupidest  thing  in the world to have  allowed  three

spokesmen at any one time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



If  there was one expert, then only that expert should

have  expressed his opinion. But to have three persons

to  attend  the Press conference - one of whom  was  the

Ministerial  head (a person renowned for his  hunting.

shooting   and   riding  activities,  not   including,



unfortunately,  the hunting of the  polio  virus)  who

said  that it was going to end in one month, and  then

being properly contradicted by his polio expert, Prof.

Hale,   and   having  his  spokesman,  his   Permanent



Secretary,  to add that the polio could strike  anyone

without active immunisation. Was it necessary or wise?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope it is not asking too much of the Minister

before he leaves the day after tomorrow for Japan,  to

take  some  steps to make sure: first, that the  Sabin

vaccine is rapidly and effectively distributed to  all

who   require  it  in  Singapore.  This  is   a   pure

administrative   problem  which   can   be   overcome.

Secondly, if there is any doubt in the matter at  all,



an  expert  team  should be asked to come,  study  and

supervise  the  use of this vaccine.  Sir,  when  this

article  was  written  about  the  Sabinisation  of  a

quarter million people in the Belgian Congo, it  might

interest the Minister to know that there were no  less

than  five  M.Ds.,  all persons of great  professional

standing - Directors  of  Laboratories  in  the  Belgian

Congo  and  the U.S.A. and other research institutions

(I  may refer, for his easy reference, to page 187  of the  British  Medical Journal dated 26th July) - leading

the whole expert team to conduct tests. I would not be

unreasonable  if  I  suggested  to  him  that,  having

already  embarked on a nation-wide vaccination process

which we all hope will be thoroughly successful, there

is  no  harm in getting an expert team to see the  job

through.  In  the meantime he should stop  talking  in

three  voices. I know there is one school  of  thought

which  is  very unkind to the Minister when  it  says,

"Ah,  well, anyway, thank God, he is not here to  make

matters worse." I am hoping that, before he goes away,

he will try and do something to see that the machinery

runs smoothly and effectively.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not suggesting, for one moment, that we

should  be other than democratic in our dealings  with

the  Press.  But  I say this: that the Government  has

considerable powers of persuasion to bring them  round

to  see  that the selling of a story is less important

than  public morale, peace and tranquillity.  To  have

allowed  themselves  to  get  caught  up  in  a  Press

hysteria  which has led to such a state that you  find

the  vaccination centres besieger by  very  angry  and

very excited parents shows: (1) either the Minister is

incapable  of using his persuasive powers, or  (2)  he

does not understand that a great deal of harm has been

done to public confidence as a result of all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects to this. I am not asking the

Minister for Health to discover a cure for polio  when

the rest of the world have not gone further than Prof.

Sabin and Prof. Salk, but I am asking him, even though



we  have not got the cure, we should at least  try  to

prevent  a situation where everybody is in a state  of

anxiety.  Every  parent  who  has  a  child   in   the

vulnerable  age  group  is in a  state  of  fright - not

because  there  have not been polio epidemics  before,

there  would  have been some anxiety anyway, but  the

presentation  of  the  work of the  Minister  and  his

Ministry   has  led  to  a  general  loss  of   public

confidence  and the spread of alarm. I would  like  to

say  in this Assembly that it is our duty to check it:

(1)  to  ask the Press not to aggravate the situation,

and (2) to ask the Minister to get on with the job. He

has  decided  on Sabin. He has had his expert  advice.

Now is not the time to start an argument whether Sabin



should  have been used or should not have  been  used,

because all the experts are agreed that once you start

Sabin, you Sabinise everybody who requires it.  It  is

his  duty to do that, otherwise he will have the wrath

of more than the parents of a hundred thousand kids on

his head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House deplores the inept and incompetent

manner  in  which  the Minister  for  Health  and  his

Ministry have dealt with the current polio epidemic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the Minister for Health is more at

home  hunting big game in East Africa and fishing  for

small fish in local waters than he is in hunting  down

the  virus responsible for the present polio epidemic.

Sir,  as a fisherman, he is even known to have  fished



in  distinguished  company for very  small  fish  from

military  helicopters, and the excitement  of  such  a

novel method of fishing has caused him to become  less

and  less aware of the afflictions of ordinary mortals

like ourselves.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think at this stage it is

proper  for me to remind hon. Members of the  Standing

Order which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not  be  referred to except upon a  substantive

motion moved for that purpose."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see in the present motion anything about the

hon. Minister's fishing in Japan or elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, many people pay him a

compliment  when they refer to him as Dr Braga.  They

do  so  in  the mistaken belief that he has  dedicated

himself  to  the  destruction of  the  microbes  which

afflict human society. But unfortunately for us,  this

is  a sport in which the Minister for Health has shown

very little interest. It is not surprising, therefore,

Sir,  to find the Minister suddenly jolted into action

by  exaggerated reports appearing in the Straits Times

about  the extent of the polio epidemic. One does  not

have  to be associated with the Ministry of Health  to

know  that the administration of drugs which have  not

been  offered  for public sale should  be  done  under

experts supervision. It is now his duty, Sir,  to  see

that  this is done. The way in which he has dealt with

this  outbreak  of  polio epidemic  has  confused  the

general public. As a member of the public, and  as  an

elected  representative of the people, I must register

a  strong  protest at the deplorable way in which  the

Minister has dealt with the present polio outbreak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my leader has wished the Minister for Health bon

voyage  on  his departure for Japan on Friday.  May  I

take this opportunity, Sir, to send my best wishes  to

the people of Japan, and I trust, with a little effort

at  quarantine when the Minister arrives in Japan, the

authorities there will be able to control  polio  more

effectively than the Minister for Health has been able

to do over here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I had originally intended  to  make  a

statement  before  the business  of  the  day  on  the

question  of the outbreak of polio, the research  that

has been made and the final decision of the Government

to  release the Sabin vaccine, but the introduction of

this  motion by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  has

forced  me  to  hold my horses until  this  debate.  I

propose  now,  Sir, to give a full statement  on  this

whole  matter and that statement will cover the points

which  have been raised by the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar, who has a flair for playing to the gallery  and

making   political  capital  out  of  other   people's

suffering for the benefit of his Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, Sir, the only way in which some

precautions  could be taken against poliomyelitis  was

by  giving  standard advice. Until actively immunising

vaccines  were produced, the measures applied  to  the

disease  are given in the Report entitled the "Control

of  Communicable  Diseases in  Man"  published  as  an

official   report  of  the  American   Public   Health

Association.   That  report  from  the   "Control   of

Communicable Diseases in Man" published  in  1955  has

this note - "that the substance of this Report has been

accepted  by  the Ministry of Health for  England  and

Wales  and the Department of Health for Scotland  with

certain reservations to meet international commitments

and  agreements  and  differences in  legislative  and

administrative practice in Great Britain."  I  do  not

propose  to  burden Members with a detailed  technical

discussion. Suffice it to say that the standard advice

given  there has been repeated continually by  members

of my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



Ministry and by myself over Radio Malaya. We asked the

people  to  see that children wash their hands  before

and after meals and keep away from swimming pools, and

so  forth. But perhaps I might read one or two of  the

measures  recommended  in this  report  at  page  136;

Epidemic measures:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protection of children so far as practical against

unnecessary   close   contact  with   other   persons,

especially  with  other  family  groups  or  outsiders

during  epidemic  prevalence  of  the  disease.  Urban

schools should not be closed nor opening delayed,  but

intensive or competitive athletic programmes should be

postponed..."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, our health officers, sanitary

inspectors, health visitors and other staff have  been

actively  engaged in advising householders. Everything

possible  to  impress on the minds of the  people  the

need for taking these elementary precautions was made,

short  of  addressing  each and every  householder  by

letter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until immunising vaccines became available, such

advice  could  only  be given. Without  vaccines,  the

medical  profession  was,  in  fact,  helpless.   Hon.

Members  may  be  interested  to  know  that  even  in



countries  where  sanitary  conscience  and   sanitary

discipline  are highly developed and where people  are

likely  to  observe  the  advice  given  almost   with

religious  fervour, particularly in  the  face  of  an

epidemic, epidemic visitations have recurred. I  would

like  to  quote  from  the Epidemiological  and  Vital

Statistics   Report  prepared  by  the  World   Health

Organisation,  Sir, Volume II No. 7 of  1958,  on  the

question of the visitation of polio in other countries

as late as 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States in 1951 there were 28,386 cases

with  1,551 deaths - this was not taken over the  whole

area  but in the areas where polio had struck. In 1952

there  were 57,879 cases with 3,145 deaths;  in  1954,

38,476  cases with 1,368 deaths; in 1956, 15,140  with

unknown deaths (this is when the vaccine began  to  be

used);  and  in  1957,  5,903  cases.  In  most  other

countries  such as the United Kingdom, Italy,  France,

Sweden, Australia, the pattern of prevalence has  been

similar.  All the advice, however, does not appear  to

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



retarded  in  the  least  the  tragic  succession   of

periodic  outbreaks. In England in  1951,  there  were

2,614  cases, and in 1955 6,153. I am saying all  this

just to show that in the absence of immunising agents,

the   medical   profession  is   helpless.   All   the

precautionary measures taken were palliatives, both in

apology  for  our  helplessness  and  to  appear  that

something  is being done, however futile  it  may  be.

When   the  first  few  cases  of  poliomyelitis  were



notified in late September this year, criticisms  were

levelled  at my Ministry as to why active immunisation

was not carried out in order to prevent the occurrence

of such an outbreak as we now have in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give a short statement of the

visitation of polio in Singapore. In 1946, there  were

237  cases with an unknown number of deaths; in  1948,

there  were  over 200 cases with 21 deaths;  and  then

there was a steady prevalence. In 1949, there were  76

cases with 2 deaths; in 1950, 82 cases with 10 deaths;

in  1951,  81 cases with 9 deaths; in 1952,  55  cases

with  10  deaths; in 1953, 43 cases with 5 deaths;  in

1954, 71 cases with 3 deaths; in 1955, 24 cases with 2

deaths,  and then there was an outbreak in early  1957

of well over 100 cases with 7 deaths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures today, Sir, from an analysis which I have

got  here  of  cases from August to  October,  are  in

August 6 cases, September 32 cases, October 168 cases,

and up to 4.30 p.m. yesterday, 26 cases. I have got

the  breakdown figures, if any Members are interested,

the nationality and sex of the victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, poliomyelitis in man, Sir, is essentially an

infection of the gut - the alimentary tract in which the

virus  multiplies. In a very small percentage of cases

the virus enters the blood stream and subsequently, in

a  relatively few cases, may invade the nervous system

resulting in paralysis. An infection with polio  virus

does two things. Firstly, the gut becomes resistant to

attack.   Secondly,  it  produces   antibodies   which

circulate  in the blood stream and so neutralises  the

virus that may invade the system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the statements which I made over Radio Malaya

and  in the Press, hon. Members are no doubt aware  by

now  that  there are two types of vaccines  available.

One  the  killed vaccine, which is the Salk,  and  the



other  a  live vaccine, such as the Sabin. The disease

poliomyelitis is now known to be caused by three types

of  virus,  and to effectively immunise a person  with

the killed vaccine such as Salk, three doses are given

by  way  of injections at stated intervals, the  first

taking  6  weeks to be effective, and  the  last  dose

being given 7 months after the second dose. When  this

is  done  the body reacts to the vaccine and  produces

antibodies which circulate in the blood. It does  not,

however,  prevent the infection of the gut by virulent

organisms  nor protects any one who may be  incubating

the   disease   within  this  period.  Salk   vaccine,

therefore,  provided all the three  inoculations  have

been given, acts as a barrier against the invasion  of

the nervous system by the virus and so would prevent a

paralytic  attack.  Recent  evidence  shows  that  the

original  figure of 70 per cent protection of  persons

so  inoculated is incorrect and is found  to  be  very

much less. There is one thing certain that it does not

do, and that is, it does not prevent the infection  of

the   gut   and,  therefore,  does  not  prevent   the

inoculated person excreting the virulent virus and  so

cause  disease amongst the non-immune. To be effective

as  an anti-epidemic measure, the inoculation must  be

carried out on a very substantial scale and within  as

short  a time as possible. By the importation of large

quantities  of  the  vaccine  which  has  only  become

available recently, and by employing large numbers  of

persons  to  carry  out  the  inoculations,   and   at

tremendous expense, involving several million dollars,

it  is  theoretically  possible to  immunise  a  large

percentage   of   the  population  temporarily.   Such

vaccine,  however,  does  not  stop  an  epidemic   in

progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read the World Health Organisation

Technical  Report  of 1958 - this is the  World  Health

Expert Committee on polio - and I am reading at page 8:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In July 1956, during a period of rising incidence,

the   Chicago  Board  of  Health  initiated   a   mass

vaccination  programme in which 1,750,000  doses  were

injected  in less than two months. However, there  was

no demonstrable effect as to dampening the epidemic."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members of this House are aware how Government

has  been pleading with parents in the rural areas  to

bring  their  children forward to  receive  protective

inoculation  against  a far more dangerous  and  fatal

disease  than poliomyelitis, namely, diphtheria.  This

has  received  some success after prolonged  sustained

appeals.  The  response has been  poor  in  the  city,

possibly  because  it  involves  injections,  and  two

visits  must  be paid. Immunisation with Salk  vaccine

involves three painful inoculations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ideal immunising agent for Singapore, therefore,

is  one that should effectively protect the population

against  disease  and, more important,  one  that  the

population will readily accept. An even more important

consideration is that the vaccine should  be  safe  to

use,  and  I repeat that, Sir, "the vaccine should  be

safe  to  use". If there happens to be a vaccine  that

does  not  require  a  syringe  with  its  threatening

needle,  if  there  is one which is  pleasing  to  the

children  taking  it, if there is one  which  at  once

produces  full  resistance to invasion  by  the  polio

virus and further produces neutralising antibodies  in

blood  stream and it is at the same time safe to  use,

this vaccine would be the vaccine of choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much research has been carried out in this direction

and,   as   is  usual,  experimental  work  has   been

undertaken  in  regard  to  various  types   of   live

vaccines. Live vaccines will have the virtue of  being

administered  by the mouth, of effectively  immunising

the  gut  and  of producing antibodies  in  the  blood

stream.  The  problem  has been  to  develop  a  virus

considerably    weakened,   I   repeat,   considerably

weakened, yet possessing full immunising properties so

that  it  would  not  cause the disease  in  the  most

sensitive  of animals - animals far more sensitive  than

man is - when injected directly into the spinal cord.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, the co-ordinated series of

experiments were interrupted by an experiment  on  man

in Belfast with a strain of virus prepared in 1956 and

the  methods  used  did  not comply  with  the  strict

standards  set by the World Health Organisation.  When

live  vaccine  is  being  given  by  the  mouth,   the

attenuated virus infects the gut, multiplies  therein,

as  does a natural infection, and are excreted in  the

stools.   It  so  happened  that  in  this  particular

experiment in Belfast, the outgoing virus in a  number

of  cases  reverted  to full virulence.  That  is  the

virulence acquired through passage, and the experiment

was  found  dangerous and called off. That  experiment

produced  a real scare. It was widely publicised,  and

the  medical profession certainly and some members  of

the  public are aware of this experiment. The  dangers

inherent  in the experiment in Belfast did  not  deter

research  which continued, and it is now  possible  to

produce a live vaccine like the Sabin that would  both

be  safe  and would prevent the gut from such  further

invasion  of the virus and, at the same time,  produce

antibodies  in  the  blood stream, and  when  excreted

would not revert to virulence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late in 1956, a batch of over 10,000 doses of a

highly  attenuated vaccine produced by Professor  A.B.

Sabin,  and  which  conforms  with  the  World  Health



Organisation  Expert Committee's rigid standards,  was

sent   to   Professor   J.  H.  Hale,   Professor   of

Bacteriology  of the University of Malaya,  for  field

trials.  Professor Hale carried out experiments  among

European  and other volunteers with this vaccine,  and

over a considerable period of time, in order to assess

its  safety,  watching carefully to  see  whether  any

virulent virus would be excreted. Simultaneously  also

in  other  countries experimental research  with  this

type of vaccine was undertaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Sir, the World Health Organisation

had  appointed an Expert Committee comprising  eminent

virologists from twelve different countries to further

study  the  problem of poliomyelitis and  the  use  of

vaccine.  Now  the  members of  that  Conference  were

Israel,  Australia,  Scotland, Sweden,  South  Africa,

Singapore (Professor Hale



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



attended),  Japan,  Canada,  United  States,   France,

Poland  and  Russia. They sat in Geneva from  15th  to

20th July, 1957. The Report was published in 1958  and

that  Committee's Report was received by this Ministry

on   the  13th  of  August  this  year.  The  Ministry

immediately  entered into discussions  with  Professor

Hale,  who  was  a  member of that  Expert  Committee,

regarding  the  cautious statements contained  in  the

Report, but the discourse appearing on page 24 of  the

Report   shows  that  studies  with  the  most  highly

attenuated strains, one of which is Sabin, showed that

the  excreted  virus was harmless even when  injected

directly into the spinal cord of the most sensitive of

animals - animals  more  sensitive  than   man   is   to

poliomyelitis. The Committee itself was  so  convinced

of  its  safety  and  efficacy that  it  made  certain

recommendations which I will read.

<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> I was saying, Sir, that the

Committee of Experts was so convinced of the safety of

the  Sabin  vaccine that it also made recommendations,

which I am now reading from page 25:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After careful consideration of the data at present

available on the use of live attenuated polio  viruses

as   immunising  agents  against  poliomyelitis,   the

Committee  strongly recommends that  controlled  field

trials  be  carried  out for the  purpose  of  testing

further the value" -



<br><br>not the safety, which has already been established,



<br><br>"of  these agents. It recommends that these trials  be

done   in   special  situations  and   under   special

circumstances which are listed in more detail below",



<br><br>and the special situations which the Committee believe

will  lend themselves to this type of trial,  are;  in

the face of an impending epidemic, or at the periphery

of  an  already existing epidemic; where poliomyelitis

of  the  infantile type is endemic, and in particular,

within  those areas where signs are indicative  of  an

imminent shift to the epidemic form of the disease  to

reinforce  the  immunity  previously  produced  by  an

inactivated  virus vaccine. Now, Sir,  the  Committee

has  recommended that large scale field trials  should

now  be carried out, basing its considerations on  the

knowledge  available  up  to  July  1957.  This   was,

however, not the only evidence upon which I relied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote from the Annual Report of the

National Poliomyelitis Foundation covering the  period

July 1957 to 30th June, 1958.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three tests were carried out, one by Professor J. D.

Verlinde of the University of Leiden, Holland,  on  170



children  and adults in families of Faculty members  of

the  University. Next by Dr M. Ramos-Alvarez of Mexico

City  on  the detailed study of 3,000 children under  8

years  of age, and also by Professor A. A. Smorodintsev

of   the   Institute   of  Experimental   Medicine   in

Leningrad."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are cited in the Annual Report of the National

Poliomyelitis  Foundation, at  page  8.  In  the  last-

mentioned  field trials, the Russian professor  carried

out five or more serial passages. He cultured the virus

excreted  from the first batch of children and injected

them  into  the  spinal  cord of monkeys.  The  monkeys

showed  no  evidence of paralytic attack. Then  he  fed

that  culture  to  a  further  batch  of  children  and

repeated  consecutively five times or  more,  and  this

experiment  was  carried  out on  3,000  children.  The

efficacy  and  safety thus shown by Sabin vaccine  have

resulted  now in the Russians feeding 200,000  children

with  the Sabin vaccine as a preliminary canter. Mexico

is trying on 200,000 doses, and Czechoslovakia 200,000,

and the reason why the 100,000 doses now being used  in

Singapore are still under expert control, is largely to

comply  with the request of Professor Sabin  with  whom

Professor  Hale  has  been in constant  touch,  and  to

demonstrate to those who have doubts that  it  is  both

safe and efficacious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not a country as large as many others.

In  such  countries it is possible to test the  vaccine



out  amongst restricted communities without fear of it,

if  it is proved to be dangerous, spreading to the rest

of  the  community. Any disastrous experiment  of  this

nature  in  a  small place like ours  may  involve  the

entire  nation. That is the main reason  why  prolonged

studies  had to be carried out in Singapore  and  await

the results of studies elsewhere until we are satisfied

that it is safe to use it. It is of interest to Members

to  note that the tests conducted by Professor Hale  on

50  to 60 persons specifically for giving immunity  and

the assessment of safety showed that the virus excreted

in all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



cases were no more virulent than the weak virus put in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At or about the time that Professor Hale was

conducting his tests, many other matters were  engaging

the  attention of the Ministry, such as the  prevention

of  the  spread  of  diphtheria, the  anti-tuberculosis

campaign  and,  in particular, the cholera  problem  in

Thailand, the prevention of entry of which engaged  the

full  attention of the Ministry. Hon. Members are aware

of the success of these concrete actions. Singapore had

not  been visited by an outbreak of poliomyelitis since

January 1957. Outbreaks usually occur every 2½  to  3

years,  but  let me assure Members that when  cases  of

poliomyelitis  were being notified  in  September,  the

Ministry recognised the urgency of a decision regarding

the  safety  of mass use of live vaccine in  accordance

with  the  recommendations of the Report. The  Ministry

consulted  the  Federation  Health  Authority  and  the

Services  to  study  the problem. An  Expert  Committee

comprising the following studied the problem:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Medical Services, Singapore; the

Deputy  Director  of Medical Services,  Singapore;  the

Assistant   Director  of  Medical  Services   (Health),

Singapore; the Director of Medical Services, Federation

of  Malaya; the Virologist of the Institute for Medical

Research,  Kuala  Lumpur;  the  Assistant  Director  of

Medical   Services,   Singapore  Base   District;   the

Assistant    Director   of   Pathology,   F.A.R.E.L.F.;

Professor J. H. Hale; Professor G. A. Ransome; the City

Health  Officer,  Singapore; Dr A. W. S.  Thevathasan;

Dr B. R. Sreenivasan; Mr Yahya Cohen and Dr Foo Chee

Guan, and after studying this matter very carefully and

critically, gave its final recommendation on <b>a division

of   votes</b>   applied   to  all   but   the   Ministry's

representatives at the final meeting on  the  night  of

the 11th of October, 1958, that the vaccine is safe  to

use and should be employed without further delay.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate to interrupt the Minister

especially when he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



is  on  a very important point, but I must remind  him

that  we  are  in  a  debate  and  he  ought  not   to

demonstrate that he is reading too much.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Very well, Sir. I immediately consulted

Professor  Hale  who had been conducting  satisfactory

tests and the Director of Medical Services, Singapore,

after  which  we  authorised mass inoculation  and  in

accordance  with the specific directive  of  Professor

Sabin  given to Professor Hale that the campaign  must

be  done under his, supervision. Further supplies were

immediately  asked for. This decision was  in  no  way

precipitated by articles appearing in the Press or, in

fact,  by  any  suggested pressure. I  would  like  to

repeat that, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given the history of the decision right up to

the time of the decision of the release of the vaccine

and  I  can assure you, Sir, and Members of this House

that it was not precipitated by any articles that  may

have  appeared  in the Press or by any  pressure.  The

situation was ideal to use Sabin vaccine and to  prove

to  doubting  Thomases  the  efficacy  and  safety  as

recommended by the World Health Organisation  and  the

polio  experts  so  that in future  the  Minister  for

Health can authorise mass inoculation as routine. Hon.

Members know that 100,000 doses have been received and



are  being administered in various centres. The  virus

now  affecting the people of Singapore - and  I  am  now

giving  this as a matter of information to  all  those

interested - is  Type 1 virus. The virus used  in  Sabin

vaccine  is  Type  2,  but  evidence  has  shown  that

infection by Type 2 virus blocks the gut not only from

infection  of  Type 2 virus permanently,  but  against

Types  1 and 3 for a considerable time, and, in  fact,

no  Type  1 virus can affect anybody who is inoculated

with  Type  2  for a considerable time. Type  2  virus

cannot  at any time produce a Type 1 epidemic. Perhaps

I  should  read  some  of  the telegrams  that  passed

between  my  Ministry, Professor Sabin  and  Professor

Hale.  A  telegram had already been sent by  Professor

Hale,  but my Ministry did not hear anything,  and  so

sent a cable on 21st



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



October  to Professor Sabin of the Children's Hospital

Research Foundation, Cincinnati:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Further to Professor Hale's cable this Government

would  appreciate one hundred thousand doses  of  your

attenuated vaccine stop Will meet costs".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Sabin then cabled to Professor Hale in a

telegram which I will now read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pending receipt your letter can ship vaccine

immediately   after  I  know  plans   for   use   stop

Responsible   investigators  stop   Arrangements   for

clinical  and  laboratory surveillance stop  Regarding

administration during epidemic would agree only to use

of  Type two vaccine if prevalent viruses are Type one

or three - Sabin".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we sent this cable after having consulted

Professor Hale on the 22nd October to Professor Sabin:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Epidemic due entirely to Type one stop Investigation

and  administration of vaccine in hands  of  Professor

Hale  stop  Children three months to ten  years  being

given  Type two oral vaccine stop Four thousand  doses

already   administered   stop   Investigations    stop

Proportion of excreted virus tested pathogenicity stop

Virus isolation and typing is carried out on all cases

of   poliomyelitis  stop  Please  assist  one  hundred

thousand doses air freight vaccine as soon as possible

stop".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have got the final cable on the 23rd October:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shipping one hundred thousand doses Type two oral

polio  vaccine on PAA Flight eightthree  one  arriving

Singapore October twenty-seventh - Sabin"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions may have been asked, Sir, why the vaccine

originally   had  to  be  administered  at   the   two

clinics - at Lim Ah Pin Road Clinic and the Yio Chu Kang

Road Clinic. The vaccine which Professor Hale received

from  Professor Sabin was specially for  his  personal

use   in   field   trials  and  naturally   would   be

insufficient for the purposes of an immediate national

immunisation  programme. There  was,  therefore,  very

great need to limit the numbers. Also, apart from  the

city,  most of the prevalence was in the areas  served

by  these  two  clinics.  Until  large  stocks  became

available,  the  city could not  be  handled  and  the

logical  areas  would  be  those  two  districts.  The

Ministry is satisfied that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



with large quantities of the vaccine now available we

are able to immunise a very substantial proportion of

the non-immunised population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier, Sir, the first large-

scale  administration of Sabin vaccine should be,  in

accordance  with Professor Sabin's directives,  under

the supervision of Professor Hale. We are negotiating

to  retain  Professor Hale who is  due  to  leave  in

December  this  year  until this  epidemic  is  over.

Subsequent  administration of the  oral  vaccine  can



then be a routine measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether it was suggested that the

Sabin vaccine is still in its experimental stage, but

it  must be remembered that any vaccine is, in  fact,

still  in an experimental stage. The Salk vaccine  is

still  in its experimental stage, and there  is  much

dissatisfaction as to its efficacy, so much so that a

fourth  injection is now advocated, and I  would  now

like  to read from Medical News, which is a newspaper

for  physicians, dated 6th October, 1958.  It  is  an

American paper from Washington:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A nation-wide increase in paralytic polio

incidence   with  the  upswing  taking  on   epidemic

proportions in the Detroit area is adding  weight  to

the  arguments  of those who advocate a  fourth  Salk

shot.  Some  11 deaths in 162 paralytic  polio  cases

have  been  reported so far this year among Americans

who  received three shots of Salk vaccine. Under  the

circumstances,  the Public Health Service  said  here

that  physicians  may  want  to  recommend  a  fourth

injection to give their patients the maximum possible

protection."



<br><br>Now the Public Health Service authorities added:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Waning immunity could not be ruled out as one

possible factor in the development of paralytic polio

among  triply  inoculated persons  since  many  cases

developed   more   than  a  year  after   the   third

injection."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence in the Sabin vaccine, Sir, can be seen

in   a  personal  letter  from  Professor  Sabin   to

Professor  Hale - I am reading from the  original - dated

22nd October:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear James,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in receipt of the telegrams from yourself and

from  the Ministry of Health that were sent to me  on

October 21st and the one from the Ministry of  Health

sent on October



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



22nd in reply to the one that I had sent the day

before. I have not yet received your

letter."



<br><br>Then it goes on to describe the technical ways of

using it, and it finally winds up:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may be interested to know that a trial with

aliquots of this vaccine on 200,000 children has been

started in the Soviet Union and that another  one  is

soon  scheduled  to  start  on  200,000  children  in

Czechoslovakia.  Drs. Ramos-Alvarez  and  Gomez  have

already  completed  a  trial on  3,000  children  who

received  all  three types without any  complications

and  plans  are now under consideration for extending

these  tests  to an the 200,000 children  under  five

years of age in Mexico."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the criticisms of the apparent

contradictory statements by members of  my  Ministry,

it must be borne in mind that the information we give

to  the  Press  is often asked for by  telephone, is

edited and published. These statements were made at a

time when we were in no position to make any definite

statement  as to the use or otherwise of the  vaccine

when   its  efficacy  and  safety  was  still   under

discussion and no decision had yet been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the question of the cost of

Salk vaccine which was referred to by the Member for

Tanjong Pagar -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it in elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am not in the least bit

interested in the cost of the Salk vaccine. In  fact,

what  I  wanted  to impress on the Minister  is  that

nobody in Singapore is interested whether it costs $1

million  or  $3 million. All that they are interested

in  is  to  see  that  their children  get  the  best

possible  protection. I am not interested in  arguing

costs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I do not consider that elucidation, Sir,

because the hon. Member did refer to the fact that  I

mentioned  $10  in the Press as the cost  of  a  Salk

vaccine  injection, thereby involving the  Government

to the extent of $3 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister is not out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> That appeared, Sir, in the Sarawak Tribune

which was under discussion at the time of the Press

conference. It said here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be recalled that in April this year the

Director of Medical Services in Sarawak, Dr Glynn

Evans, in order to encourage the use of poliomyelitis

vaccine among the people here, announced that

vaccinations would be given free of charge until the

end of last May, when a charge of $10 per vaccination

was imposed."



<br><br>That was the cost of a Salk vaccine injection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question asked by the hon. Member

whether the Sabin vaccine would be rapidly and

efficiently distributed, my answer is yes. The

question is now being studied as to the various

centres in which it would be properly and efficiently

administered. It must be remembered that Professor

Hale has to keep this vaccine at a certain temperature

and there are certain technical matters involved of

which I am ignorant. The vaccine has to be made up,

sent out every morning and returned to him. He

personally supervised the administration of the first

batch that was given to him for field trials; and as

regards the other batch he has got technical men who

are fully trained and we will try and distribute the

vaccine in more centres. As to the necessity of an

expert team coming to supervise this, there is no

doubt whatsoever in my mind at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not in a position as the Member for

Tanjong Pagar is to make political capital of other

people's sufferings, but as a responsible Minister I

am fully aware of my duty to the public and to the

advancement of medicine.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, I was

prepared to keep quiet in this debate because I did

not wish to make political capital out of the

situation and also because I am not a medical expert.

But, I wish to say this, after listening to such a



lengthy and interesting debate in which the Minister

for Health suddenly became a polio expert overnight.

Looking at the motion charging



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



the Ministry of Health for the inept and incompetent

manner in which the current polio epidemic is being

handled, I think this may not be entirely due to the

polio epidemic itself but to the way Public Relations

officers have been releasing information to the

public. I wonder whether it is time for me to advise

Mr George Thomson to learn something from Mr Gary

Wang of the City Council. Sir, if that lengthy

analysis of the polio situation by the Minister for

Health had been published about a month earlier, I do

not think the mover of this motion would have taken

the trouble to waste his lungs in trying to seek cheap

publicity here.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did not quite catch the

expression. Would the hon. Member just repeat that

expression?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am sorry. I will withdraw

the expression "cheap publicity".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Government should learn a great

lesson from this motion. It is not for us now to

debate the merits or demerits of using Sabin vaccine.

What the Government should do is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Avoid the ugly situation on Monday when the

polio treatment centres were besieged by angry

parents;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Ministry should consider whether it is

wise for an observation team to be sent out to observe

and supervise that the use of this Sabin vaccine is

really effective, because we have already heard that

some authority has thrown some doubts on its efficacy.

I am sure the Minister will say, no, we are short of



hands to administer the Sabin vaccine and Professor

Sabin has specified that only Professor Hale in

Singapore is qualified to carry out this vaccination.

So, if Government doctors are not sufficient, then let



the Ministry appeal to private practitioners to

volunteer and help in combating this epidemic;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) I wish the Minister for Health would think three

times, not only twice, and postpone his annual holiday

to Japan. That will show us that he and the Ministry

of Health are concerned with our welfare;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) I am sorry I have to pass this remark on the

mover of the motion. He is trying to seek cheap

political publicity by making this - Sir, I beg to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The expression has been

withdrawn, but apparently not with effect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I will withdraw

the expression. I mean I wish to remind the hon. Member

for  Ponggol-Tampenis that if the mover of this  motion

is a regular goer to the Royal Island Club, is it wrong

for  the Minister for Health to be a regular hunter  or

fisherman?



<br><br>3.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the

mover  of the motion has stated his case in very modest

terms.  Personally, Sir, as a father and a  grandfather

of  many  children and grandchildren, the  first  thing

when  I take up the paper every morning is to find  out

what  the position is about this polio epidemic.  There

are  thousands  of parents in Singapore  who  might  be

doing   the   same  thing  every  morning  and   worry.

Personally, I believe in fatalism, but after taking all



the necessary precautions!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the public of Singapore should have protection

from  the Government. The Government owes that duty  to

the  public. Has the Government done its duty  in  this

case?  I am not going to make political capital out  of

this  motion at all. As I said, I am a worried man.  We

have had polio epidemics before - during the lifetime of

this  Government  - if I am correct. If that is so,  what

has  the  Government done since that time to prevent  a

recurrence  or take precautionary measures against  it?

The Minister for Health has read out reports, telegrams

and  letters  which  only date  back  to  September  or

October  this year, subject to correction. He  has  not

said that precautions were taken by his Ministry or  by

himself much earlier -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of explanation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, I did say that

experiments had been conducted since 1956 by  Professor

Hale.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thanks for the explanation, Sir. His

Ministry was doing something but could not do  much  to

prevent the epidemic from reaching this stage.  It  was

the   Government's   duty  to  have   taken   all   the

precautions.  Today  the  parents  are  living  in  the

greatest fear - what will happen next? it is my fear and

it  is everybody's fear. If it comes to a vote on  this

motion,  I will, of course, abstain, because I  am  not

going  to make political capital out of it. This motion

is  rather  late in deploring, because this  Government

has been found incompetent in every Ministry except the

Ministries held by the official Ministers, if I may say

so.  That  is why I will abstain if it is forced  to  a

division. Sir, I hope even now the Government will take

every  possible step to protect especially the children

from falling victim to this disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more thing I might touch upon, and that is the

hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar quoting from the Straits

Times.   This   paper  is  not  run  by  a   charitable

organisation.  It  is  a limited company  formed  on  a

commercial  basis. It is out to make as much  money  as

possible,  get as large a circulation as possible,  and

it  will  publish stories that will sell well. I  think

many  other papers are also run on the same basis. What

can  we get out of them? Nothing. So the Government and

we   ourselves  should  be  very  careful  about   what

statements we should make.

<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I came here this

morning   with  every  intention  of  criticising   the

Minister for Health and his Ministry for their slowness

in  creating  centres for vaccination and registration.

So  far  we  have  only two centres.  Daily  the  Press



reports  the  spreading of this disease.  Thousands  of

parents  every morning are attending these centres.  It

is  clear  that  these two centres are insufficient  to

cope with the work that is involved. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



know  why the Government has not provided more centres

and engaged more staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this shortcoming, Sir, after hearing what the

Minister  for  Health said just now, I  am  satisfied

that  the  Government has not entirely  neglected  its

duty.  It  has done its best in trying to prevent  the

spread  of this disease and, on the whole, Sir,  I  am

personally  satisfied that the Ministry of Health  has

not done too badly.



<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member



for  Tanjong Pagar has been very unfair when he  based

all  his criticisms on the Straits Times reports. Sir,

the  Member  has often said in this Assembly  that  he

does  not rely on the information in the Straits Times

and that only a small percentage of the population  do

read this paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I envisaged the type of argument that the hon. Member

would  advance in this debate and I have brought  with

me  several cuttings from both the Singapore  Standard

and the Straits Times. Sir, I believe that there is no

confusion  in  the minds of the people  of  Singapore,

because   of  the  factual  reports  that  have   been

appearing in the Singapore Standard, the Nanyang Siang

Pau  and  the  Sin  Chew  Jit Poh  and  various  other

newspapers. For example, Sir, I will read out a  Press

report which appeared in the Singapore Standard on 2nd

October wherein they said:



<br><br><b><center>"'Protect Your Children'</center></b>

<div align="center">POLIO WARNING TO PARENTS IN THE COLONY</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government last night warned parents to

take  precautions  against their children  contracting

poliomyelitis in view of the increase in the incidence

of the disease last month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Medical Services. Dr M. Doraisingam,

in  a statement, revealed that last month 32 cases  of

"polio"  were reported, 24 of whom were from the  City

area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-seven of these cases were under five years of

age, said Dr Doraisingam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director advised all parents and guardians that:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any child who has a fever, however mild, should be put

to bed immediately and a doctor called in."



<br><br>Sir, all these advices were given by the Doctor

through the Press and the Singapore Standard deemed it

fit to publish this in a factual manner. I think, Sir,

we should not believe anything written in a mad paper

and I believe sane people should understand the facts

quite clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, hon. Members of the Assembly are

quite aware that the Ministry of Health has no control

over the newspapers; for that matter, even the

Government has no control over them. We have allowed

full freedom to the Press and I do not think for a

moment that this is the sort of thing we should try to

control. I do hope that those people who have read the

Straits Times and all other newspapers would be fully

aware of what the Straits Times has been telling the

people. I do agree with the hon. Member in this

respect, Sir, that the Straits Times has exaggerated

many of its reports and distorted the facts in such a

manner as it has found fit to publish; but I do not

think for one moment that the Minister for Health or

his Ministry officials should be made responsible for

what has appeared in the Straits Times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have to say in this debate is this, Sir. The

people of Singapore are not in any way confused. They

have understood the position quite clearly. They have

observed the advice given by the Ministry officials in

this respect. They have understood what they should do

as a precautionary measure for their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I must say that this motion should not

have been brought into this House for discussion.

Whatever little confusion the people may have had is



now increased because of this motion before the House.

I hope, as a result of the publishing of today's



debate in the newspapers tomorrow, the people will be

able to understand the problem much more clearly and

know that the Minister and the Ministry of Health have

not been responsible for all the muddle which appeared

in the Straits Times.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

make  the  point  that  we can  all,  whether  in  the

Government  or  in  the  Opposition,  be  happy   that

although the methods of controlling and treating polio

are  still  in the early stage, yet some  progress  is

being  made. It is a matter on which I think we should

fix our attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1945, I was myself a victim of polio in a Japanese

prison  camp  and there was no treatment available.  I

well  remember  the feeling of despair  with  which  I

arrived  under American care in a hospital  in  Manila

and  received  the  final  diagnosis  there  from  the

doctors. However, now I am able to get along  with  my

two  legs  quite happily and the only inconvenience  I

suffer  is  that I cannot run and, as I  do  not  like

running,  I  suffer  no real inconvenience  from  this

affliction.   Since   those   days   13   years   ago,

considerable progress has been made but we must  still

recognise  that the science of medicine is  a  science

and  not a form of magic. We cannot expect the doctors

to  pull  out of the air a cure which will immediately

and definitely be final and absolute. The progress  of

science is much more moderate than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when we leave aside that aspect and the aspect

of  newspaper publicity which are almost irrelevant to

the  motion,  we  are left with, I think,  really  one

demand from the supporters of the motion, and that  is

that  there  should have been more  centres  and  more

staff  to deal with this outbreak. I think it is  fair

to  say  that the medical services have been expanding

at an enormous rate during the last few years and that

expansion  has  only  been  insufficient  because  the

demand  for  medical services has expanded still  more

rapidly.  Time  was when most people in Singapore  had

not  very  much  faith in Western medicine.  Today,  I

myself  receive frequent requests from people  in  the

countryside  to  try and get medical services  of  one

sort or another provided. The demand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



is  growing  everywhere  for  Western  type   of

medicine  and  the  result is that the  staff  at  the

medical   services   with   all   its   expansion   is

appropriate,  I  am  told, for a population  of  about

400,000  people  by  Western  standards,  whereas  our

population is about 1,500,000. Consequently, the staff

is  just not there for all the requirements and, if in

any attempt to deal with polio, staff were transferred

from  other essential work, it is by no means  certain

that  the  situation would really be changed  for  the

better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polio is a horrible disease with a high rate of

suffering and death attached to it, but there are many

other diseases in Singapore which do not get the  same

publicity; perhaps because they are continuous and  do

not appear in sporadic outbreaks, and perhaps they are

of   less  news  value.  But  you  cannot  forget  the

sufferers  from other diseases in demanding that  more

centres  and  more staff should be provided  for  this

particular disease. I should like to stress that point

because  the same sort of situation is going  to  face

Singapore  in  almost all departments  of  the  public

service,  as far as I can judge, during the  next  few

years. The demand for services from the Government  is

always  increasing, but the means of  supplying  those

services is at the moment not increasing or, where  it

is  increasing, it is not increasing at  the  rate  in

which   the  services  are  sought.  That  is  perhaps

inevitable  at  this stage because of the  adjustments

that are being made in the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing that does need to be borne in

mind.  Attacks should not be made which  fall  on  the

wrong people and which, in so far as the civil service

is  concerned, might lead to a loss of morale. I  have

no  doubt  that  in detail many things  can  be  found

wrong - medical services or any other services - but  that

does  not remove the much important fact that  a  very

great   many  things  are  extremely  right  and   are

extremely well done.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing

the  speeches  in this debate, I find that  there  is

something in the motion which merits the attention of

the  people. They want to know how the battle against

polio  is  conducted, who is directing operations  in

this battle, what he is doing and what he will do. We

have  heard that the expert for polio would  like  to

take  his leave arid go to England, but that he would

rather  remain here in order to see the whole  scheme

through.  Could the Minister also not  stay  back  in

Singapore  and postpone his holiday in order  to  see

the  battle  through? If people whose homes  are  not

here attach some importance to this battle, then  our

own Ministers should take a cue from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that the public are all confused.

They just do not know what to do. I have been talking



to  many  people and I have asked them, "Why  do  you

want  to take Sabin?" The answer is, "Oh, we want  to

immunise  our  children." But I have heard  from  the

Ministry  that the taking of this vaccine is  not  to

immunise the population but that it is something that

should  be  done  continuously, and so  on,  and  not

during an epidemic. I read again in one of the Sunday

papers  - I think it was the Singapore Standard - which

gave  a  detailed  report of an  interview  with  the

Ministry  of Health. There I read some other  reports

again  saying  that there are three types  of  virus:

Type  1,  Type  2  and Type 3, and that  if  you  get

yourself  immunised against Type  2,  then  there  is

still  a chance of your being attacked by Type  1  or

Type 3.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, it blocks Type 1 and Type 3.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes. Then we have been told too

that  the Salk vaccine condemned by the Minister  for

Health  is  not  effective but  Salk  is  praised  by

private  practitioners  as something  that  has  been

tested. Now all these are confusions. The people  are

confused;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



they get worried; they queue up at 3  a.m. in

the  morning to get their children immunised. We must

stop  this  scare. We must tell them the truth  about

what  the Government is doing in order to help pacify

them.  My colleague has said that the Government  has

done  very  well  or  has done its  best.  I  do  not

disagree  with him. The Government has done its  best

but,  just  as  a school teacher will  write  on  the

report  card  of a student we will say:  "He  can  do

better."  I  am  afraid  the picture  that  has  been

presented to us is not too good. I would say that  we

expect the Government to pacify the people by telling

them  exactly  what is being done for them  and  what

results  to expect, and so on. Let the whole  picture

be  cleared up and not left in this muddle  with  too

many experts voicing too many opinions, all different

from one another.



<br><br>4.12 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In reply, Sir. I do not want to

whip a beaten dog but I would like to suggest to  the

Minister  that  a few things could be done:  one,  to

restore  public confidence; two, to see that the  job

of distribution of the vaccine and the vaccination is

done strictly and effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to get his Expert Committee, who sat

and  deliberated  on  that W.H.O.  Report  after  the

Geneva  meeting of experts, to set out in  clear  and

simple   terms  why  they  agreed,  unanimously,   it

appears,  to recommend to the Government the  use  of

the  vaccine. That will dispose of the fear once  and

for  all  created  by  all  these  anonymous  private

practitioners  who get quoted in the Press.  Set  out

plainly  and  simply  why this  group  of  people - the

A.D.M.S.  (FARELF), the A.D.M.S. (Army),  the  D.M.S.

(Federation    of    Malaya)    and    the     D.M.S.



(Singapore) - having  considered everything,  recommend



it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is, what does the Government propose to do

to  make  sure that 100,000 vaccine doses are  speedily

administered, when it hopes to get more,  and  when  it

hopes  to get the whole process over? If the Government

would  do that, there would be a return of, at least - if  not of confidence - some reassurance that even if the

Minister  does  not know what is going  on,  there  are

people  there who do know so that even if the  Minister

is  away on his annual sojourn, there are other  people

there  who  will  get  on with the  job  and  see  that

everybody is immunised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived.

<div align="center"><b>RADIO MALAYA AND ITS FUTURE</b></div>

<br><br>4.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

by  the  time  I read the Government announcement  that

there will be a commercial service run, either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



parallel with, or as part of Radio Malaya  after  it

is  separated from the Federation service at the end of

this  year,  there was only time for me to  raise  this

matter on the motion for the adjournment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to express , my regret that an

important matter of policy should have been the subject

not of explanation first in this Assembly but of a bare

Press  announcement following a whole series  of  Press

speculations.  Even up to now, I do not  know  what  is

this  scheme to run a commercial radio as  part  of  or

parallel with Radios Singapore for 1959. I am therefore

not in a position to attack the scheme or to express my

support for it. I am therefore put in a position  where

I  have  to  ask the Government to let us know,  first,

what its plans are, secondly, why it proposed to change

the  policy  which was against commercial broadcasting,

and, thirdly, when it is to be introduced and by whom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I will not have the right to reply, I would like

to  make  some general observations on the question  of

commercial  broadcasting.  Sir,  when  the  House   was

afflicted  by Ministers who were very keen on publicity

and   propaganda,  and  we  were  informed   that   the

Government  was contemplating the running of commercial

T.V.,   there  was  a  sufficient  outburst  of  public

indignation  to  force the matter to go  to  a  special

Committee  which  deliberated  upon  it;  and  we  were

presented  with  its  Report  which  strongly   advised

against  it. That was in 1955.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in 1958, we hear out

of  the  blue  that we are going to have  a  commercial

radio  station.  I would say this. If  the  purpose  of

commercial  broadcasting is to hand over  an  apparatus

for the dissemination of information and propaganda  to

commercial  enterprise, then let me  state  my  Party's

position plainly and simply. We are not against capital

doing  business  in  Singapore.  In  fact,  we  welcome

foreign  capital to come and do business here.  But  we

will  strenuously  object to foreign capital,  or  even

local   capital,   not   doing  business,   but   doing

propaganda.  If  this  radio  station  for   commercial

broadcasting is to be leased or let or loaned either in

toto or from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



time to time to foreign business concerns, then let me

say  that the Government should think again before  it

embarks on this scheme. I am quite sure all Parties in

this  House,  and  even outside this House,  would  be

anxious to see that no political propaganda comes  out

of   such  a  vital  instrument  of  dissemination  of

information as the radio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we understand the problem that Radio Malaya will

face when it is split into two. It means, in fact,  if

not  almost  double, then nearly double  the  cost  of

running  Radio Malaya as one. From Press announcements

from  time  to  time, we are told that there  will  be

split  English  programmes and split Malay  programmes

but  that the Indian and Chinese programmes will still

be combined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it is a matter for regret that we, who are

directly concerned with these matters, should have  to

read  this  information from the Press. If  the  Press

already  knows, then we should have been  told,  lithe

Press cannot be prevented from knowing, then we should

have  been told and should have the whole picture  put

before  us  before  the  thing is  published.  I  have

certain  sympathies for Ministers and  civil  servants

who  find  themselves  having to  face  a  leak - either

official  or good guesswork on the part of  the  Press - but  this question of Radio Malaya has been  engaging

the  attention of the Press for a considerable  length

of    time.    When   everybody   knows    that    the

Federation - again in pursuance of the same policy which

has  split  the University of Malaya - is  intending  to

split  Radio Malaya, it is indeed a matter for  regret

that  we  still  do not know what the position  is.  I

would  like the Minister responsible to tell  us  what

the state of Radio Malaya is now, and what it is going

to  be  after  31st  December  or,  according  to  his

Director  of Broadcasting, after 4th January,  because

it  seems  that  programmes  cannot  be  split  except

beginning on a Sunday. Whatever it is, let us have the

facts.  Let us know what this commercial radio is  and

who  is  going  to  run  it; and  let  us  then  at  a

subsequent  date  have  a  full-scale  debate  on  the

matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

should thank the Member for Tanjong Pagar for having

obtained the right to speak on this issue and thus

give me the opportunity to speak on the same subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the split of Radio Malaya, we are going to have

Radio  Singapore. About two days ago I was  told  that

with the coming into operation of Radio Singapore, the

Teochew  dialect programmes will no more be  broadcast

from  the  station. Whether this can be  confirmed  or

not,  I  do not know, but there have been such reports

in the Press and rumours have been going round. I hope

it  is not true, but if it is true, then I cannot  see

any   reason  why  the  Teochew  dialect   should   be

abolished.  The  Teochew community in Singapore  is  a

very  large  community, I am sure that  every  Teochew

licence  holder  pays  as much as  any  other  licence

holder.  All have to pay $12 a year and a Teochew  who

has  a radio set at home also has to pay $12. Why then

should  he  be  deprived  of programmes  broadcast  in

Teochew?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar just now touched on the

commercial  aspect of Radio Singapore.  Now  if  Radio

Singapore  is going to become a commercial enterprise,

definitely it would welcome advertisements.  If  Radio

Singapore  is going to welcome advertisement,  and  it

does  not broadcast in the Teochew dialect, I am  sure

it will not be able to broadcast advertisements put up

by the Teochew community. If the Minister in charge

of   this   broadcasting   station   will   refer   to

Rediffusion, the Teochew community contributes most

of  the  income revenue. I was told that the  Teochew

dialect  was  introduced some time in  1949.  At  that

time,  Teochew listeners were tuning on to Peking  for

political  news, and Radio Malaya then  thought  that,

rather than have the Teochews of Singapore to tune  to

Peking, it had better introduce Teochew programmes  in

the  station, so that the Teochew community could have

entertainment, news and other items which the  Station

provides.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who can read will certainly get their news

from  the  newspapers, but those who cannot read  will

have  to  depend solely on the radio. What the Teochew

community wants is news and entertainment and it looks

as  if the Government is trying to deprive the Teochew

community  of this. Even in the District Councils,  we

are  going  to  have multilingualism and not  confined

only  to Mandarin. Any dialect will be allowed in  the

District Council meetings, and I cannot see any reason

why  broadcasting  in the Teochew  dialect  should  be

abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will be able to explain why

broadcasting in Teochew is going to be abolished  with

the coming into existence of Radio Singapore.



<br><br>4.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to

seek  information. I am told that I should  not  speak

because somebody has to reply. Is there any time limit

for this?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The adjournment was moved at 4.16 p.m.

We rise at 4.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I thank you for giving me this

warning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been speaking on Radio Malaya every year

during  the Budget sittings. Radio Malaya has  been  a

burden to the taxpayers. I have also pointed out  that

it  is the white man's heaven where he can get maximum

salaries and so on, and that it should be conducted in

such  a way that it should be .able to make both  ends

meet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is very surprising, Sir, that although every

year  this  House has been voicing concern over  Radio

Malaya, still we do not know what is happening  except

from  the Press. Of course, the Government always want

to  carry  out their policies with the help  of  their

Nominated Members or Ex-officios, and whatever they do

they  will try to present them as accomplished  facts.

But the Members on this side of the House, Sir, as the



taxpayers'  representatives, have  a  right  to  voice

their  concern, or at least to be informed as to  what

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



are  doing. They could even have  been  informed

this morning, but no statement was forthcoming. It  is

rather surprising and disgusting.



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  subject which the hon. Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  put  down  for  debate on the  motion  for  the

adjournment  was the future of Radio Malaya,  but  the

matter   in   which,  as  I  understand  it,   he   is

particularly interested is the announcement which  was

made  recently  that the Government  was  planning  to

operate  commercial broadcasting in 1959, and he  also

asked   for   further  information   in   respect   of

speculations  which had appeared in the newspapers  in

regard  to the arrangements for broadcasting  as  from

January next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can outline very briefly what has happened

since December last year when an official announcement

was  made  by  the  Federation  Government  that  they

intended to withdraw from the then Pan-Malayan  system

of  broadcasting and to set up their own  Broadcasting

Department.  They  wrote an official  letter  to  this

Government in the same month - in December 1957 - and they

asked  our agreement that a Working Party should  meet

with  representatives of both Governments  to  explore

the  way in which this split could come. At that time,

I think it was thought that there might be some way in

which  the  headquarters of the Pan-Malayan Department

of  Broadcasting in Singapore could  in  some  way  be

physically  split so that half went to the  Federation

and  half went to Singapore, and that with the nucleus

of  that  headquarters  in both  places  it  would  be

possible   for  the  two  department  of  broadcasting

immediately to operate independently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examination that was made by the Working Party in

February this year made it clear that a scheme of that

kind  was not, in fact, practicable, more particularly

because  it would have entailed the transfer of  staff

and  the  staff concerned could not be transferred  to

the  Federation without their consent. Moreover, there

were a number of technical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



matters involved in which it would certainly not  have

been   possible   to   remove   the   operation    and

responsibility from Singapore; in particular, as  hon.

Members  will  know, the shortwave transmitters  which

serve the Federation are located in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further formal approach was made by the Federation

Government to this Government in May this year  as  to

the  ways  in  which the split could take place.  They

suggested  in  that  letter that a  Negotiating  Party

should    be    appointed   to   devise   satisfactory

arrangements whereby the services which the  Singapore

Department of Broadcasting would still have to  supply

to  the Federation Department could be supplied  on  a

mutually agreed basis. They listed in their letter the

services  which they calculated that they would  still

require  to  derive  from Singapore  after  the  split

between  the  Departments had officially taken  place.

Examination was made of the services which they  would



still require and this Government replied agreeing  to

the  invitation  to  enter into negotiations  on  that

basis.  Those  negotiations are still being  conducted

and have not yet been concluded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested, Sir, that the Government had been

remiss  in  not making some further statement  in  the

Assembly  on this matter of the splitting  up  of  the

Department, but I would remind hon. Members that there

was  a passage in the Governor's speech in April  this

year  in which it was stated that this split was going

to  take  place and that the Federation hoped that  it

would  take  place from the beginning  of  next  year.

Moreover,  in  September this year, when  a  financial



motion came before the House, reference was again made

to  the  split which would take place in January  when

provision was sought for an appointment of a  Director

of  Broadcasting, Singapore, in place of the  previous

Pan-Malayan   Director  in   charge   of   the   Joint

Department.  Until the negotiations  currently  taking

place are completed, I cannot inform the House exactly

what  the  arrangements will be, or what the  services

will   be,   which   the   Singapore   Department   of

Broadcasting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



will  continue to provide for the Federation,  but  it

seems  fairly clear that, initially at any rate,  both

the  technical  services which are now provided  under

the   Pan  Malayan  arrangement,  that  is,  for   the

shortwave  transmitters and so on, and  the  programme

content  of  which  a  large part  of  the  Federation

programmes   are   supplied   from   Singapore,   that

arrangement initially will have to continue. I do  not

myself envisage that, as on the 1st of January  or  on

the  4th  of January, there will be suddenly any  very

great difference either in the Singapore programmes or

in   the  Federation  programmes.  It  will  take  the

Federation  Government  some  time  to  build  up  the

necessary  resources to operate their  own  department

and  to furnish a higher and higher percentage of  the

programmes for consumption in the Federation,  and  it

will  therefore be a gradual and not a sudden process.

I  think, Sir, that makes it sufficiently clear to the



House  why,  in  fact, up to now  there  has  been  no

further  information to give to the House beyond  what

has   already  been  stated  and  was  stated  in  the

Governor's  speech, that this split  would  be  taking

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now, Sir, to the announcement which was made

in  regard to commercial broadcasting and that it  was

the  intention of the Singapore Government to plan for

this  broadcasting  to  be  started  in  1959  by  the

Singapore  Department of Broadcasting.  That  was  the

purport of the announcement, Sir, and the reasons  for

this  are,  broadly - the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar

did,  I  think,  suppose correctly what those  reasons

were,  or anyway the second one - the first one is  that

broadcasting is, I think it will be conceded,  a  very

popular form of advertising and it has proved  a  very

profitable  form  of advertising in  other  countries,

particularly  in  certain  other  countries   in   the

Commonwealth. I can instance New Zealand  and  Ceylon,

and  even  in a small place like Fiji, where they  are

able to operate a commercial broadcasting service at a

profit. In a place like Singapore, where there is  not

only  a  large  urban  population with  a  substantial

consumption of consumer goods but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



where  Singapore is also, as it is in so  many  other

matters, geographically very conveniently situated as

a centre for a region, it is clearly a place in which

there  is  room for a commercial advertising  service

and  for which I think there is undoubtedly a demand.

There  will be substantial advertising revenue coming



forward if such a service is stated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason for this, Sir, is the one which

the  hon.  Member  mentioned,  that  up  to  now  the

operation of a Pan-Malayan Department of Broadcasting

has not cost the Singapore Government very much. With

the  proposed withdrawal of the Federation from  this

service,  it  is  going  to  become  more  and   more

expensive  for the Singapore Government  to  maintain

the existing standards of programmes on the existing,

what  I  may  call the national, service  and  it  is

hoped,  by  means of a commercial service, to  offset

and   to  more  than  offset  in  the  long  run  the

additional  expenditure  which  will  fall   on   the

Singapore  Government  in  maintaining  its   present

services.  I  would  reassure  the  hon.  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar by saying that there is no intention of

handing over this commercial broadcasting service  to

any  commercial  operator. It  is  intended  that  it

should be run by the Department of Broadcasting,  and

so  by the Government, and therefore there is no risk

of  the business or political propaganda about  which

he expressed certain apprehensions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Queenstown, Sir, referred to

the  number  of Chinese dialects on Radio Malaya.  He

enquired   whether   there  was  any   intention   of

withdrawing  the present programmes in  Teochew.  The

Government, with the Department of Broadcasting,  has

been  examining this particular subject of the number

of  dialects  in which the Department of Broadcasting

(Chinese Programmes) are at present transmitting  and

they  are  at present transmitted in seven  dialects.

That  means  that,  in  fact, no really  satisfactory



programmes can be given in any particular dialect. It

is the inten-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



tion  that  as from the beginning of next year  there

should be a reduction in the number of dialects  used

in  the Chinese programmes, and the intention is that

they  should  be reduced to three - Mandarin,  Hokkien

and  Cantonese, this decision has been  taken  after

consultation with a number of influential  bodies  in

Singapore  and  it has also been taken  in  agreement

with  the  Federation Government,  but  if  the  hon.

Member  wishes to make any particular representations

on   behalf  of  the  Teochew  broadcasts,  I   would

certainly be prepared to look at them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you.



<br><br>4.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am so sorry to hear that

the  Chief  Secretary has confirmed that the  Teochew

dialect  has  been  thrown out  of  the  broadcasting

programmes. Sir, can the Chief Secretary confirm  the

figure  published  by the Department  of  Information

Services  that the Teochew community is over  200,000 - a  figure equal to the Cantonese community? Can  the

Chief  Secretary give an explanation why, if this  is

the  case,  he  should deny the Teochew community  in

Singapore their privilege to listen to items from the

radio which they want to hear? Is the Chief Secretary

ready to admit that Singapore today is suffering from

political instability, and that this situation is due

to  the  illiteracy of the population  and  to  their

political apathy? So, in view of this, should not the

Government  fully utilise the broadcasting programmes

to  educate the illiterates through a mass  education

programme, thereby killing this political apathy  and

abolishing  illiteracy and thus  achieving  political

stability?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
