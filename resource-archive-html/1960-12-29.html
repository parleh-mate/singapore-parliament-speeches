<div align="center"><b>RESIGNATION OF MEMBER</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to inform honourable Members

that at 13 minutes past 2 o'clock today, I received

a letter from the Member for Hong Lim, Mr Ong Eng

Guan, which reads as follows:

<pre>

`Mr Speaker,

Legislative Assembly of Singapore.



Sir,



 I herewith tender my resignation under section 42

(2) (f) of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in

Council, 1958, from the Legislative Assembly of

Singapore with immediate effect.



                          Yours faithfully,

                           Ong Eng Guan

                   (Assemblyman for Hong Lim).'

</pre>

<br><br>In accordance with the relevant section, the seat

of the Member has become vacant, and under section

44, I shall duly report the vacancy to the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara, and the vacancy shall be filled by

election in the manner provided by or under any law

for the time being in force in Singapore.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PRESS PUBLICATION COMPLAINT BY MEMBER FOR HONG LIM</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the 23rd day of December, 1960,

the  then hon. Member for Hong Lim drew my attention

to  that  day's  Straits Times  containing  what  he

described  as  an account of that day's proceedings,

that is to say, the proceedings in the matter of the

motion  moved  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister   in

relation to that Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article in question was captioned. "Ong must

cite law to back his motion". The Member referred to

two paragraphs therein and invited my opinion as  to

whether - to  quote  his words - "any  of  the  passages

referred to is a matter which is sub judice".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then expressed the opinion that there was no

matter which could be considered sub judice at  that

moment, the expression "sub judice" being used  with

reference  to a court of law. Hon. Members  will  of

course know, for example, that under Standing  Order

No.  19  relating to the contents of  questions,  no

question may be asked which reflects on the decision

of  a court of law and no question shall be asked on

any  matter  which is sub judice;  and  again  under

Standing  Order No. 46 relating to the  contents  of

speeches,  reference cannot be made  to  any  matter

which  is  sub judice except by means of or  in  the

course of consideration of a Bill when reference may

be  made, but only in such a way as will not, in the

opinion  of  the Speaker or Chairman, prejudice  the

interests  of parties thereto. I might add  that  in

the  application of those Standing Orders  the  term

"sub judice" has been construed to have reference to

matters  pending  in  a  court  of  law  and  in   a

Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The then Member for Hong Lim, however, in response

to  my  enquiry, stated that he wished to raise  his

point as a matter of privilege, drawing my attention

to  the fact that the report was contained not  only

in the Straits Times but also in other newspapers. I

do  not think that the fact that the same report or

article  is  contained in more  than  one  newspaper

could  make any difference to a ruling as to whether

there has been any breach of privilege.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passages quoted by the then Member for Hong

Lim as being in breach of privilege of this Assembly

are-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This right has been admitted in the case of the

House  of  Commons and in all Legislatures patterned

after it."



<br><br>The  right  referred to has reference to  the  right

mentioned in the article in the two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



passages immediately preceding the passage quoted.

These two passages read as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Ong's motion not only asks the House to

rescind the Speaker's ruling but also claims that

the Assembly has no powers either to condemn him or

seek his suspension if he does not apologise or

repeat outside the Assembly the "malicious

falsehoods" he is accused of having made in the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It, in effect, challenges the constitutional

principle  that  the Legislature  has  the  inherent

right,   as   stated  in  Standing  Order   56,   of

"proceeding  against  any member  according  to  any

resolution of the Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that is to say, the second passage

quoted  by  the  then  Member for  Hong  Lim  is  as

follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last Monday, the Speaker ruled that under Standing

Orders the Assembly had powers to discuss the motion

and,  if  the  evidence warranted it,  to  find  the

member guilty of `dishonourable conduct'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said that the Assembly had inherent powers,

should a member be found guilty, to suspend or  even

expel him."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the first passage, it is apparent that

it  merely purported to be an analysis of the  legal

position which in fact had been urged by the  Deputy

Prime Minister in his speech delivered when he moved

the  motion, as is apparent in the next  passage  in

the article in question which reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dr Toh, in his speech on Monday, had cited cases

to show that the Singapore Assembly had these rights

too."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the second passage, it appears to be

a  paraphrase  of  what I myself  said,  albeit  not

exactly  a  complete  or  accurate  paraphrase.  The

passage  has been taken out of context and  must  be

considered  in the light of the following  paragraph

which reads:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, he expressed doubts as to what extent the

extreme powers of expulsion and suspension could  be

exercised by the Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the then Member for Hong Lim in drawing my

attention to the passages quoted by him and by using

the  term  "sub  judice" sought to  infer  that  the

passages are in the nature of comment calculated  to

prejudice  the proceedings pending on the motion  of

the  Deputy Prime Minister, then I am bound  to  say

that  I  disagree;  I take the view  that  there  is

nothing in those passages, more especially when  not

read  out of context, which can be said to have that

effect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must not be taken to mean that I am ruling

that  any  person who publishes any matter which  is

prejudicial  to proceedings pending in the  Assembly

must  necessarily be in breach of the privileges  of

the  Assembly. Such a publication must, to my  mind,

first  fall  within the mischief of the  Legislative

Assembly  (Powers  and Privileges) Ordinance,  1955,

which   in   section  24  specifically   makes   the

publication  of certain statements and  writings  an

offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event, therefore, I cannot say that there

has  been  prima  facie any breach of  privilege  in

relation  to  the matters raised by the then  Member

for  Hong Lim and do not therefore propose  to  take

any further action in the matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PRESS PUBLICATION STATEMENT BY WORKERS PARTY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> My attention has been drawn to a

statement purported to be issued by the chairman  of

the Workers Party and published in the Straits Times

of  Saturday,  December 24th, 1960. The  publication

reads as follows:



<br><br><div align="center">STATEMENT BY WORKERS PARTY</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SINGAPORE. Fri.- The Chairman of the Workers Party, Mr David Marshall, today issued this statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first meeting of the new executive committee

of the Workers Party repeats that the Workers Party

is  not  associated with Mr Ong Eng Guan  and  had

never  been associated with Mr Ong, but  expresses

its  sympathy and respect for the heroic effort  of

Mr  Ong in struggling against the attempt  of  the P.A.P.  Government to silence him and  nullify  the

choice of the people of Hong Lim."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will recollect that on the  19th  day

of  December, 1960, before the Deputy Prime Minister

moved his motion in relation to the then Member  for

Hong  Lim (Mr Ong Eng Guan), I went to some  length

to indicate that in my view, the motion should on no

account  be  considered as a motion of  censure  and

punishment  moved in the interests of Government  or

of  individuals  in the Government,  but  should  be

treated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



as  a  motion  which  related  to  the  dignity  and

prestige of this Assembly and therefore was a motion

in  the interests of the Assembly as a whole. I went

on  to say that if the House was satisfied that  the

conduct of the hon. Member for Hong Lim was such  as

to  be an affront to its own dignity and prestige in

the  sense inter alia that that conduct had  brought

discredit  to  the  House as a whole - not  merely  to

individual  Members of the Government  Parliamentary

Party or indeed to any other Member of the House  or

to  persons  outside the House - then the House  might

feel itself justified in condemning or censuring the

hon.   Member   for  Hong  Lim  and  thereafter   in

proceeding  to  consider what punishment,  consonant

with  its  powers,  it should mete  out  to  him.  I

finally  stressed that the motion would and  had  to

proceed  as a motion which affected the House  as  a

whole  and  which  invited the House  in  the  first

instance to say whether its dignity and prestige had

not been affronted by the conduct of the hon. Member

for Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, therefore, the statement by the

Chairman  of  the  Workers Party is  prima  facie  a

gross,  wilful  and scandalous misrepresentation  of

the  proceedings of this Assembly within the meaning

of   subsection  (1)  (c)  of  section  24  of   the

Legislative   Assembly   (Powers   and   Privileges)

Ordinance, 1955, and I have accordingly referred the

matter to the State Advocate-General for such action

as he may think fit to take under that Ordinance.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,   I  have  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara's

recommendation that this Bill be proceeded  with.  I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Main Estimates of Revenue

and  Expenditure for the public service  during  the

year  1961 have been considered and approved by  the

Assembly at its last sitting as Sessional Paper Cmd.

No. 26 of 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now necessary to give legislative approval

to  the  expenditure  of the  sums  shown  in  these

Estimates  and  the  annual Appropriation  Bill  now

before Members is intended so to provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 97 (1) of the Singapore

(Constitution)   Order   in   Council,   1958,    an

Appropriation  Bill  containing  under   appropriate

heads  of  expenditure, the sums of money which  are

required  for  the  several services  of  Government

shall   be   introduced  into  the   Assembly.   The

Appropriation Bill lays out all the amounts approved

by  the Assembly in the Estimates of Expenditure and

arranged  under  the Heads of Expenditure  shown  on

page 31 of Cmd. No. 26 of 1960. These sums shall  be

paid  out  of  the Consolidated Fund  and  once  the

Appropriation Bill has been approved,  the  Minister

for  Finance  will  be empowered to  issue  warrants

authorising expenditure up to the amount under  each

Head in the Appropriation Bill to be paid out of the

Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PROPERTY TAX BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,   I  have  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara's

recommendation  that this Bill  be  proceeded  with.

Sir,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this Bill is to provide for the

levy  of  a tax on immovable properties in  lieu  of

rates leviable under the Municipal Ordinance and the

Local  Government Ordinance, 1957, as on integration

of  the City Council into the Central Government, it

will  be  no  longer proper to levy Local Government

rates  on lands and buildings, since these are  made

on the basis of services and utilities of equivalent

value  being provided from the revenue so  obtained.

It  will be necessary, therefore, to introduce a new

system of taxation to replace these rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill follows closely the procedure

laid down in the Local Government Ordinance for  the

assessment   of   annual  value  of   property   and

collection of rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, rates are collected for the City area

under  powers  contained  in  the  Local  Government

Ordinance   and  for  the  rural  areas  under   the

Municipal  Ordinance. The consolidated rate  payable

in  respect of properties in the City area is now 36

per cent and section 7 of the Property Tax Ordinance

lays  down  that the property tax payable each  year

shall be at this same rate of 36 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some areas outside the City limits are, however,

paying rates at less than 36 per cent applicable  to

the  City  area.  It is intended  to  continue  this

practice of charging lower rates for rural areas and

the  first proviso to section 7 enables the Minister

to  direct that the rate or tax in such areas  shall

be such rate or rate less than 36 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax proposals for 1961 are briefly as

follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, properties within City limits are

assessed at 36 per cent and properties in the  rural

areas  are assessed at 14 per cent, 18 per cent,  20

per cent, 23 per cent, or 36 per cent consolidated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



rates. Instead of this multiplicity of rates,  there

will  be  only  three  rates  of  Property  Tax  for

occupied  lands, which will be 36 per cent,  27  per

cent and 18 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Properties at present paying 36 per cent rates

will continue to pay 36 per cent Property Tax on the

annual  value  ascribed to the property.  There  are

certain areas which previously were outside the City

limits  but  which have been brought into  the  City

area  by  the Local Government Ordinance,  1957,  as

defined in the First Schedule to the Ordinance. They

comprise  largely the areas at Pasir Panjang,  Buona

Vista,  Ulu  Pandan, Holland Road and  Ulu  Kallang.

These  areas were assessed at 23 per cent when  they

were in the rural areas and the assessment of 23 per

cent  was continued, although they were brought into

the  City limits with the coming into force  of  the

Local Government Ordinance. These areas will now pay

the rate of 36 per cent instead of 23 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a number of housing estates in the

rural  areas which pay 23 per cent assessment.  They

are  Adelphi  Park,  Sembawang Hill,  Thomson  Rise,

Windsor Park, Serangoon Garden, Seletar Hill,  Opera

Estate,  Spring  and Bedok Estates,  Hongkong  Park,

Bukit Timah Park and King Albert Park. These housing

estates  have enjoyed urban facilities as  lighting,

water, roads and so forth, and will therefore pay 36

per cent rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 27 per cent rate areas will include areas at

present paying 19 per cent, 20 per cent and  23  per

cent.  These  areas  will include  properties  lying

within-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) ½ mile on either side of Bukit Timah Road

from   approximately  8  ½  m.s. and   along

Woodlands Road up to the Causeway;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) ½ mile radius of Nee Soon and Chong Pang

Villages  and ¼ mile on either side of  Jalan

Kayu;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) areas at Serangoon, Paya Lebar, Bedok,

Changi and Loyang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining parts of the Island were previously

paying 14 per cent or 18 per cent. They will now  be

assessed at 18 per cent. These areas comprise-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the present undeveloped western portions of

the Island, i.e., Jurong;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the undeveloped northern and north-eastern

parts  comprising  Bukit Panjang,  Sembawang, Serangoon and Katong;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) some of the surrounding islands, i.e.,

Pulau Ubin, Pulau Tekong Kechil, Pulau Tekong

Besar, Pulau Blakang Mati, Pulau Bukom, Pulau

Bukom Kechil and a few other islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above rates will be payable on houses or

occupied  lands.  The rate for vacant  lands  is  at

present 36 per cent for properties in the City  area

and this 36 per cent for vacant lands will apply  to

the 36 per cent areas for 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate for vacant lands in the 27 per cent and

18  per cent areas will be at 18 per cent and 12 per

cent respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the proposals will be gazetted shortly

and  a  plan  will be made available for  inspection

showing the rates applicable to the whole Island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposals are not final and the public will

be  given an opportunity up to 31st March, 1961,  to

make representations regarding the inclusion of  any

particular  area  or locality in one  of  the  three

rates of tax proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated in my Budget Statement that the

present   practice   of   assessing   owner-occupied

properties on favourable terms is irregular and that

it  is  intended to stop this practice. However,  in

order  not  to  penalise  owner-occupiers  of  small

properties, the rates of taxation will be  fixed  at

less  than the general rate. It will obviously  take

some  time for the owner-occupied houses to  be

re-valued  at the proper values. Until the re-valuation

of  these  properties  has  been  completed,

owner-occupiers will continue to pay property rates at the

proposed   rates   on  present  values.   Similarly,

provision  is  also  made in respect  of  industrial

premises   in   order  to  ensure  that   industrial

undertakings are not hampered through the  operation

of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to withdraw the exemption of land

and  buildings  used  as public burial  and  burning

grounds and certain institutions fostering the  arts

and  sciences  which  are at present  exempted  from

payment   of   rates  under  the  Local   Government

Ordinance or the Municipal Ordinance on the  grounds

that these organisations are run on commercial lines

and  they  charge fees or levies for their services.

However,   provision  is  made  for   exemption   of

deserving cases of this nature and of buildings used

exclusively   for  purposes  conducive   to   social

development.  Provision  is  also  made   to   allow

statutory   bodies   to  pay  half-yearly   to   the

Government an equitable sum in lieu of property tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to make it mandatory for any

person who owns property which has not been assessed

to  give  notice thereof to the Chief  Assessor.  It

will  also be mandatory for him to notify the  Chief

Assessor  when a building ceases to be  occupied  by

the  owner thereof and is let. Because the tax is  a

tax  on  the  ownership of property irrespective  of

whether  it is occupied or not, refunds of  tax  for

"letted"  buildings  which  have  become  unoccupied

during the tax year will cease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special provisions have been made for assessment

of taxes on new buildings, buildings which have been

rebuilt  or  enlarged, properties assessed  for  the

first  time, and properties which should  have  been

assessed for rates under the Municipal Ordinance  or

the  Local Government Ordinance prior to the  coming

into  operation of this Ordinance but have not  been

so  assessed. It is provided that in all these cases

the tax shall be payable from the date of completion

of  the  building or in the case of land  from  such

date,  not  being more than six years prior  to  the

date on which the property is first assessed, as may

be  determined by the Comptroller. In cases where  a

building ceases to be occupied by the owner  and  is

let  or where the rent thereof is increased, the tax

payable from the date of such letting or increase of

rent  is  to be calculated on the basis of a revised

value  which  may subsequently be ascribed  to  such

building. Provision has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



also  been  made  for any annual  value  or  revised

annual  value  ascribed  to a  property  during  the

second  half of any year to remain the same for  the

ensuing year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure for hearing of objections on

assessments  has  been  completely  revised  by  the

establishment of an impartial Valuation Review Board

and for appeals to the High Court. The Bill provides

for  temporary deletion from the Valuation  List  of

properties  in respect of which notice of  objection

to  revision  of annual value has been received  and

for  interim  payment on due date of taxes  on  such

properties   based  on  current  valuation   pending

adjudication  of  the  objection  to  the   proposed

revision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to say that it is not

intended to levy Education and Improvement rates  of

4  per cent each, and that these two sections in the

Education and Planning Ordinance will be repealed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  are one or two aspects of the Bill upon which

I  wish to touch. The first, Mr Speaker, Sir, which

I  think  is  a very serious one, is the  Minister's

statement that in future it is not proposed to  give

refunds  in respect of unoccupied property. And  the

basis  for  the  change  in law,  it  would  appear,

according  to  the  Minister, is  that  as  this  is

considered to be a property tax, therefore the  mere

owning  of  the  property should  attract  the  tax,

whether  or not the property, in fact, produces  any

income.  That, Mr Speaker, Sir, is a  very  serious

statement  for the Minister for Finance to  make.  I

personally  cannot  see  any  difference,  from  the

taxing  point of view, whether property is immovable

or  movable. The Minister for Finance says  that  if

anybody in Singapore should be so foolish as to  put

his surplus money which is lying in the bank without

earning  any  income,  on a  piece  of  land  which,

through circumstances beyond



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



his control, ceases to produce any income, then that

property is still liable to tax. Contra - if he  keeps

his  money  lying idle in the bank not  earning  any

income,  as  the  Minister has not  yet  decided  to

introduce  a  capital tax, he would be  exempt  from

taxation  in so far as his idle money is  concerned.

What  then is the difference between tile two! If  a

man  shakes a leg a bit and wants to help  me  State

and himself, anti invests his money anti puts it  to

some profitable use, then me Minister says, "Because

it is a property tax, I must tax you on the property

even  though it does not earn any income." Supposing

a  person owns 10 houses in, say, North Bridge Road,

and if a slump were to come - it might yet come within

the  time of the present Government, some say it  is

already  here - then  that person who  has  10  houses

unlet  would  have to pay tax at 36 per cent.  Where

does  he get his money from to pay this 36 per cent?

He  will  end  up  in ruination,  and  so  will  the

property  market.  And  it the  property  market  is

brought  to ruination, Mr Speaker, Sir, me  economy

of Singapore also would to a large extent be ruined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would ask the Government to reconsider this

proposition  very seriously; even the  principle  is

unacceptable. I can see no justification for  saying

that merely because you own property, you should pay

tax  on  it. I think the property should be  put  to

some  use in respect of which the State is providing

services.  That  is the basic proposition  on  which

municipal assessments are levied, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

and not because you own property. The mere owning of

property, from a municipal point of view,  does  not

attract  rates. But if the property  is  of  such  a

nature  that  it  attracts  municipal  services   to

itself, or the preservation of which depends on  the

provision  of adequate municipal services,  then  in

return for those services a rate is levied. That  is

the  basis on which municipal rates are levied.  The

Property Tax says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An Ordinance to provide for the levy of a tax on

immovable properties in lieu of the rates previously

leviable ...'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



Apparently the Government has forgotten the basis on

which  this rate was levied by the City Council  and

rural authorities. All they are interested in is the

monies  which they can collect, not the purpose  for

which the monies are collected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a house falls vacant, Mr Speaker, Sir, then it

is  not  using municipal services -it is  not  using

water;  it  is  not using light;  it  is  not  using

sewerage  facilities. What are the facilities  which

the Government is providing in respect of that house

on  which  they  claim  a 36 per  cent  tax?  It  is

inequitable; it is scandalous. If that sort of thing

is  allowed  to come about, Mr Speaker, Sir,  there

will be no building estates built in Singapore.  The

Government  has  already  stated,  in  the  building

sector anyway, that it is both an enterprise between

the  Government and the private sector in order that

adequate housing might be provided for Singapore  in

future years. Government hopes to build 9,000 houses

next year. I do not think they will, but if they  do

build,  it will be a very good effort. But according

to  plans, we need at least 15,000 to 20,000  houses

per  year  if we want to provide for the  increasing

population, not to catch up, but merely  to  provide

for   the   increasing  population.  If   Government

introduces  legislation which is going to  not  only

discourage but also stop private development then  I

cannot see how it is going to bring adequate housing

accommodation   to  Singapore.  My   experience   of

Government  is that they say one thing and  they  do

another.  They  say they want to encourage  housing.

They  say,  "We  want to encourage people  to  build

houses." I ask the Minister for Finance: does he, in

all  seriousness, think that this  omission  of  the

refund   of   tax  now  possible  under  the   Local

Government  Ordinance, whereby a person whose  house

is  unoccupied can go to him and claim a refund,  is

going to help housing projects in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a person, or a company, who has 20

acres  of  land and who wants to develop  it.  Under

present  conditions it is very difficult to envisage

or to forecast



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



whether  all those houses built  on  the  land

would  be bought or taken up by persons who want  to

buy  houses.  Let us assume that that  person  is  a

venturesome  sort of developer, and he develops.  If

he  sells  as much as 50 per cent of the  houses  to

begin with he is lucky, Mr Speaker; the rest of the

50  per  cent  lie vacant and idle. As  soon  as  he

receives  a  certificate  of  occupation  from   the

relevant  authority, the vacant houses will  attract

property  tax.  What happens to  the  developer?  He

faces  ruination. He is paying a tax of 36 per  cent

on  the balance of the developed property. And  what

is  the  annual  value under the Property  Tax?  The

annual value, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the rent at which

it  may  reasonably be expected to let from year  to

year. So it attracts tax at once and the position is

that  he will have to contribute 36 per cent to  the

Government by way of tax until such time as  he  has

disposed of his property. This is not the Ordinance,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, that is going to  help  bring  a

building boom to Singapore. If anything it is  going

to  help  kill it. The P.A.P. Government has  nearly

killed  the  building industry, and this  Bill  will

surely  help to put the industry into a  coffin  and

place it well and truly seven feet under the ground.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Six or seven?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> An extra one foot for the P.A.P.

Government! So that is the position which will ensue

if  this Bill is passed without the provision  which

is  now  already  contained in the Local  Government

Ordinance.  Other  than that,  Mr  Speaker,  it  is

merely  a duplication of the existing provisions  in

the  Local  Government Ordinance and  the  Municipal

Ordinance, except that it gives the Minister  a  lot

of  powers  personally, which the  Local  Government

Ordinance did not give to the City Council as  such.

If  the powers are used wisely by the Minister, well

and  good.  But if the Minister does not  use  those

powers  wisely, but uses them in an oppressive  sort

of  way,  then there again it is going to be  a  bad

thing.  Mr  Speaker, I am against the policy -  that

Ministers  should be allowed wide powers in  respect

of which the public at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



large  do  not  know what line each  Minister  would

adopt.  The  provisions should be  embodied  in  the

Ordinance itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, immovable property and investments, Mr

Speaker,  are  matters  in  respect  of  which   the

investing public must be satisfied that the position

will  be stable for a number of years. If exemptions

of  this  nature  are to be left to  the  individual

discretion of the Minister, I am suggesting  to  the

Minister  for Finance that that is not the best  way

to inspire confidence in the investing public. Under

the  Municipal  Ordinance, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  there

were  circumstances where areas which were not given

all  the municipal services were not liable  to  the

complete 36 per cent rates. I hope the Minister will

keep  that  in mind when he considers these  various

areas  from  the point of view of the varying  rates

which he intends to tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain areas in Singapore, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  which  do  not have a supply  of  electricity.

There are other areas which do not have a supply  of

water.  There are yet other areas which do not  have

the   sewerage  system  installed.  These  are   all

municipal facilities in respect of which this 36 per

cent  is  being  levied by the Government.  How  the

Minister is going to sort out these things  area  by

area,  I  do not know. But I do hope that  when  the

Minister does make these levies, he will see that he

holds  a balance between all the areas, and that  in

respect  of each of those areas which does not  have

all  the municipal facilities, an adequately reduced

tax is imposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other innovation to the Property Tax Bill

which  was not in the Local Government Ordinance  is

the provision whereby industrial premises could also

be exempt from the 36 per cent taxation as envisaged

for the rest of the properties. I do not propose  to

touch  upon  this matter, because my colleague,  the

Member  for Cairnhill, will deal with it. But  I  do

wish  to  press upon the Minister for  Finance  this

position: that I think this Bill, which proposes  to

levy   a  tax  on  unoccupied  property  which   had

previously been rented, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, Sir, is going to have the certain effect of

not encouraging builders to build in Singapore.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

the  Budget speech, the Minister for Finance  stated

that  in  regard to rural areas, it was not proposed

to  increase  the rates other than where  there  had

been  improvements, such as roads,  lighting,  water

and  electricity. But in his speech this  afternoon,

he  has  told us that at the present time there  are

five types of rates - 14 per cent, 18 per cent, 20 per

cent,  23  per  cent  and 36 per  cent,  and  it  is

proposed to reduce this number to three - 36 per cent,

27  per  cent and 18 per cent. Therefore, by a  mere

manipulation  of  reducing five types  of  rates  to

three,  those  that  are in the lower  rates  become

affected.   In  the  case  of  14  per  cent   rate,

therefore, there is already a proposed increase of 4

per  cent. In the case of the 20 per cent and 23 per

cent  rates, there is therefore a proposed increased

of  7 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Over and

above  that,  the Minister is proposing  that  where

there  are  housing estates developed in  the  rural

areas, these will be rated at 36 per cent. There is,

therefore, an overall increase throughout all  rural

areas  in Singapore. He has said, Sir, that  in  the

case  of  vacant land in the city area,  it  is  not

proposed to reduce the present rate of 36 per  cent.

The  36 per cent will remain. But in the case of the

other  areas, although the present rates are 27  per

cent and 18 per cent, it is proposed, if I heard him

rightly,  to  reduce it to 18 per cent  and  12  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to industrial premises, the Minister

proposes  that  they  should be given  this  special

inducement  in  order that there can  be  a  greater

inducement  for the industrialisation of  Singapore.

Sir,  new  industries  can  come  in  under  pioneer

status, and as a result of that, there is a sort  of

monopoly.  New industries can also claim a five-year

tax  holiday.  These  are, in a way,  very  material

inducements to capital to come and open up factories

in  Singapore. But to suggest that by giving special

rates in regard to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



property  tax,  there  is  going  to  be  a  further

inducement  is,  I  think,  not  quite  right.  What

capital  is more interested in is not the few  extra

dollars  that  can  be saved by a reduction  in  the

rates  of  the property tax, but rather in a  stable

political climate and industrial peace in Singapore.

The Ministry of Labour and Law is doing its best  to

secure  industrial peace, with the  co-operation  of

the  T.U.C., although reports would appear that  the

T.U.C. and the Minister do not see eye  to  eye  on

this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  merely wish to add to what the  Member  for

Farrer  Park  has  said about paying  assessment  on

vacant  houses. Even at present, when  the  rule  is

that  you  can claim a refund of tax on houses  that

are  vacant,  the  refund is not given  blindly  and

haphazardly.  The  assessor  will  have  to  satisfy

himself  that those houses that are vacant  are  not

kept  vacant purposely for the benefit of the owner.

For  instance, some owners keep their houses vacant.

They purposely put up very high and impossible rents

to  keep  them  vacant in order to  sell  them  with

vacant  possession so that they would get  a  higher

price.  Cases like that do not get a refund. I  know

that.  I  have seen some people who have  claimed  a

refund,  and  I  have seen them  having  to  produce

evidence of their attempt to get their house rented,

and  at  a reasonable rate. So there is a precaution

already  existing. If it is in the  Minister's  mind

that  owners of houses could be working against  the

interest  of  the State for their own benefit,  that

is,  by keeping houses vacant, then I would like  to

point  out that that is not so. Precautionary  steps

are being taken by the assessors.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a

saying that when you scratch a Tartar you will still

find  a  Tartar. Here on the question  of  taxes  on

property,  we  find the S.P.A. displaying  the  true

nature of their political sympathies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to meet the point raised by the Member for

Farrer  Park and the Member for Mountbatten that  it

is iniquitous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



to  tax  on unoccupied houses. The Member for Farrer

Park  says that, in the past, services were provided

when  houses were occupied, and when they  were  not

occupied,     municipal    services     were     not

enjoyed - services like water, light, gas and  so  on.

Therefore,  in  such instances, when the  house  was

vacant, there was no case for levying a rate.  There

may  be a point to that if it is a matter purely  of

the  Minister for Finance. But I would  dispute  his

contention  that  the  State does  not  provide  any

service  whatsoever to the owners of vacant  houses.

For  one  thing, the police maintain law and  order.

Therefore,  they  safeguard  the  owners   of   such

property  from  being plundered.  But  this  is  the

point.  Today  we know that there is a  shortage  of

housing.  It  is very difficult to get accommodation

at  reasonable rents. There is no excuse  whatsoever

for  any large number of houses to go vacant for any

long  period  of  time. If that happens,  it  merely

means  that the land-owners are charging too high  a

rent.  This being the case, it is only fair,  taking

the  long-term view of their net income,  that  they

should  pay  tax  during  the  periods  when   their

property is vacant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that there is a slump - one does not

know,  of course, what the future governments  would

be  then,  of course, the situation may arise  where

there  is  a surplus of housing and many houses  are

vacant,   although  the  rents  charged  are   quite

reasonable. In that event of course, there would  be

a  case  for reconsidering the position. But in  the

present circumstances, where there is a shortage  of

housing, it is absolutely scandalous that any  large

numbers  of houses should be vacant. If the  tax  on

vacant  houses  will  have the  effect  of  inducing

landlords to lower their rent, then I think we  will

have achieved a very desirable social objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards stopping private development, I think

the  Member for Farrer Park is fully aware that  the

large  housing estates which have been built in  the

last  few  years have not been built to be let  out;

they have been built to be sold to individuals, very

often on some instalment basis. So this question  of

the building estates being hard hit by this tax does

not arise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill says that I promised

during  my Budget statement that there would  be  no

increase  in the rates of tax in the rural areas.  I

said  nothing of that sort. In fact, I went to  some

lengths to explain that the rates in the rural areas

were  low  in  the past for historical  reasons,  as

Singapore  was then developing and there was  plenty

of land then. But that is not the situation today. I

clearly  hinted that there would be slight increases

in the rates of tax in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards special treatment for industries, I

think the Member for Cairnhill missed the point.  It

is  not  merely that prospective investors will  get

the  benefit.  The principal beneficiaries  will  be

those  who  are  already running factories  in  the

rural areas today. They should be cushioned off from

any increase in costs. Perhaps I should explain that

in  the  rural areas, rates may have been  increased

anywhere between 5 possibly to 10 or 12 per cent  on

general  properties, and we intend to exempt  owners

and  operators  of  industrial  establishments  from

these  increases, so as not to increase their  costs

of production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill also misunderstood the

point about tax on vacant land. In the city area the

tax is 36 per cent. The tax on vacant land at 36 per

cent  remains there. In the rural areas the tax  was

formerly  9  per  cent, consisting  of  5  per  cent

improvement  rate  and  4 per cent  education  rate.

Therefore,  what we are doing is not to  reduce  the

tax  on  vacant  land  in the  rural  areas  but  to

increase  it.  I hope I have resolved satisfactorily

the various misunderstandings which have arisen over

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

question  on  the  Second  reading  just  now,   the

Minister  said that the exemption to be  granted  on

industrial   premises  does  not   mean   only   new

industrial premises, but it is also meant  to  cover

industrial premises already in existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Budget speech, the Minister said that

1960 has been a very good year and everyone has been

making  money. Yet we now hear from him that capital

has  to get an extra inducement after making so much

money, that they should not be asked to pay the same

amount  of Property Tax, but that in order for  them

to  enjoy a very good year a little bit better,  the

Property Tax, as far as they are concerned, if  they

have  industrial premises, will be reduced.  Whereas

against  that,  it  is suggested  that  on  dwelling

houses in the rural areas the rates should be jacked

up  somewhat  in order that, according to  what  the

Minister  has  said, there can be a fairer  rate  of

property taxation.

to  the  contents  of  the  Bill  and  any  reasoned

amendment which raises matters not included  in  the

Bill shall be out of order.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was merely trying

to reply to something which the Minister for Finance

had  said. He made the promise that if a slump  were

to  arise,  he  would  think of  introducing  a  new

provision to the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I can only allow the Member

for  Farrer  Park to speak if he will specify  under

which  clause he hopes to bring that subject in.  If

there  is  no  clause, then, of  course,  he  cannot

speak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, under the Property Tax Bill, the

Minister  has wide powers to exempt properties  from

taxation.  He  may exempt or reduce.  Sir,  could  I

speak  on that aspect of the matter? I think  it  is

clause 7, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can the Member for Farrer Park

satisfy me that what he wishes to say is governed by

clause 7?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The proviso to clause 7, Mr Speaker,

Sir, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Provided that the Minister may by order published

in  the  Gazette  direct that  the  tax  payable  in

respect of properties within any area or areas shall

be  at such a rate or rates being less than the rate

prescribed  by  this  section  for  such  period  or

periods as may seem equitable to the Minister:'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"as may seem equitable to the Minister" - Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I am suggesting to  you,  Sir,  that

where  properties cannot be let and  the  owner  has

honestly tried to let them, then equities do  arise,

and  probably  the  Minister may  then  be  able  to

proceed under that proviso.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Quite a very skilful manoeuvre! But I

suppose the Member for Farrer Park can suggest  that

the rate should be .01 per cent or so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, Sir. Might I draw the attention of

the Minister for Finance to section 110 of the Local

Government Ordinance? Sir, the question of a  refund

even  now  is not a matter of right. It is a  matter

which   the  ratepayer  has  to  satisfy  the  Chief

Assessor in fact. The mere fact that the property is

vacant does not of itself exempt it from rating.  He

has  to satisfy the Assessor under section 110  (4).

Sir,  what I am suggesting to the Minister is  this:

that  where  an  owner  under the  Local  Government

Ordinance  could  have satisfied  the  Assessor  and

thereby  obtained  an  exemption  from  payment   of

assessment, in those circumstances, could I  suggest

to  the  Minister that equities would arise  and  he

could then exercise his discretion?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I doubt very

much  whether clause 7 of this Bill empowers  me  to

act in that way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, it does.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It does not. In any case, it is

not  intended to cover such cases. So  I  think  the

Member for Farrer Park was just taking this point to

ventilate  his  grievances about the tax  on  vacant

houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Have you a vacant house?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  beg  to move. "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to strengthen the

hands of the Government in its determined efforts to

combat  illegal immigration into the State.  Because

of   the   open  nature  of  its  coast  line,   its

comparative prosperity based on an entrepot  economy

and  stable conditions and the proximity of numerous

islands   in  its  neighbourhood,  the  problem   of

preventing illegal immigration into Singapore is not

an  easy  one.  The problem has been accentuated  by

recent  amendments to immigration laws,  which  have

drastically  reduced the number of  immigrants  into

the  country.  Active measures have  been  taken  to

prevent  such  illegal immigration by  the  combined

efforts  of the Customs, Immigration, Marine  Police

and  the  M.R.N.V.R.  These measures  have  produced

results,  but it is felt that the Government  should

be  given more legal powers to have a better control

of  the  situation and to deal more effectively  not

only  with  illegal immigrants who have entered  the

State, but also persons who assist in bringing  them

into  Singapore.  It is with these objects  in  mind

that  the  Immigration (Amendment)  Bill,  1960, is

introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill now gives power to the

Controller of Immigration to declare the presence of

a  person  unlawful at any time if he  is  satisfied

that  the person is a prohibited immigrant  or  that

any material statement in the application



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



for   his   permit  or  certificate  was  false   or

misleading.  Under the existing law, the  Controller

can  only  declare  the presence of  such  a  person

unlawful  within  two years after his  arrival.  The

effect of such a declaration is that the person will

be liable for removal from the State by order of the

Controller subject to appeal to the Minister. It  is

considered  an unsatisfactory position  whereby  the

Controller  is only allowed to declare the  presence

of  such  a  person unlawful within two years  after

arrival.  The  Controller should have  discretionary

power to remove him from the State at any time after

his entry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill amends the Immigration

Ordinance  to  authorise the seizure, detention  and

forfeiture  of  any vessel below 75 tons  which  has

been  used or is about to be used for the commission

of  an offence against the Immigration Ordinance  or

any  regulations  made  thereunder.  This  amendment

therefore  covers  the  seizure  and  forfeiture  of

vessels  used for the purpose of bringing in illegal

immigrants.  An order of forfeiture  of  vessels  is

only  made by the court and shall be made if  it  is

proved  to its satisfaction that an offence  against

the Ordinance or any regulations made thereunder has

been  committed and that the vessel was used in  the

commission of such offence, notwithstanding that  no

person  may have been convicted of such offence.  It

will  be  seen  that forfeiture of a vessel  now  by

virtue of the new definition "vessel" in clause 2 of

the  Bill includes everything found in it, and  this

amendment  is  made  with a view  to  deterring  the

owners   of  small  craft  from  engaging   in   the

profitable   business   of  smuggling   in   illegal

immigrants  into  Singapore. The majority  of  these

illegal immigrants enter Singapore by means of small

craft  from the adjacent islands. Under the existing

law,  a taikong of a small craft bringing in illegal

immigrants can only be charged with the abetment  of

the  commission  of  an offence and  experience  has

shown  that the punishment meted out to them  is  no

deterrent to prevent them using the same boats again

and  again  to  bring in illegal immigrants.  It  is

hoped  that  this  amendment will  be  an  effective

deterrent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends the immigration

Ordinance by putting the onus of proof on  a  person

who   is  charged  and  who  has  no  valid  permit,

certificate,  pass  or any other document  or  other

evidence accepted by the Controller as evidence that

he  is a lawful resident, that he has entered or

re-entered or remained in Singapore lawfully. Under the

existing  law, the Immigration Department  has  been

handicapped  in  its  work of prosecuting  in  court

those  illegal immigrants, who have already  entered

the  State, because it has to prove that  they  have

actually  entered  Singapore  unlawfully  and  often

unless  these  persons admit that they  had  entered

illegally,  it  is not possible for the  Immigration

Department to prove that they had done so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has given sufficient

indication that it is doing and will do all  it  can

legally,   administratively  and  industrially   and

through  its  encouragement of  trade  expansion  to

secure  the  social and economic well-being  of  its

citizens.  This  Bill, which  is  aimed  at  illegal

immigration,   is   another  additional   means   of

protecting  the economic interests of  its  citizens

and safeguarding their employment opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



Negara's recommendation for this Bill and  I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now iead  a  Second

time.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, as can be seen from the Comparative

Table  attached to the Bill, follows the pattern  of

the consolidation of the legislation relating to the

administration of Muslim law in the  States  of  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the establishment of a

Majlis  Ugama  Islam to advise the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara on matters relating to the Muslim religion in

Singapore.  It establishes a general endowment  fund

to  be kept by the Majlis Ugama Islam and this  will

enable the Majlis to deal with wakaf, nazr and other

trusts  which are intended for Muslim religious  and

charitable  purposes.  The  endowments  at   present

administered  by  the  Muslim and  Hindu  Endowments

Board will be transferred to this Majlis. The Majlis

Ugama  Islam  is  made  the trustee  of  all  Muslim

religious  trusts,  including  mosques  and   burial

grounds,  and it is also given the power,  with  the

approval  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, to  collect

zakat  and  fitrah to be used for Muslim  charitable

purposes.



<br><br>3.52 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER(Mr G. KANDASAMY) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinctive features of the Muslims Ordinance

in  Singapore  and in particular the powers  of  the

Shariah  Court are retained in the Bill. The Shariah

Court  has  been,  I  am glad to say,  a  successful

experiment in Singapore and the Bill seeks to retain

and  in certain aspects to extend the powers of  the

Shariah Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also does not follow the legislation in

the Malay states of the Federation in the punishment

of  Muslim offences. Provision has been made for the

punishment  of  cohabitation  outside  marriage  and

enticing an unmarried woman from her wali as  it  is

considered  that these provisions are  necessary  to

secure  compliance with the provisions of  the  Bill

relating  to  the solemnization and registration  of

Muslim marriages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its broader aspects, Sir, the Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



aims  at  re-organising  the administration  of  the

Muslim  law  and  Muslim religion in Singapore.  The

mosque will be the centre of Muslim activity in  the

various   parts   of  Singapore.   There   will   be

constituted a mosque area, daerah masjid, around the

mosque  and the Muslims living in the area  will  be

given   an   opportunity  to  take   part   in   the

administration of the mosque and its activities. The

Imam  of the mosque will be paid by the Majlis Ugama

Islam,  and if he is suitably qualified, he will  be

appointed  the Naib Kathi to solemnize and  register

Muslim  marriages  in the mosque area,  to  register

consent divorces, and he will also be appointed  the

Collector  for the purpose of collecting  zakat  and

fitrah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majlis itself, although it will be the nominal

trustee  and  will  supervise all  Muslim  religious

trusts,   will  appoint  local  trustees  for   such

religious  trusts. Although the Bill  provides  that

notwithstanding  any provision in any  written  law,

instrument or declaration, the Majlis shall  be  the

sole  trustee of all religious trusts, in  practice,

the day-to-day administration of such trusts will be

left  to  the  trustees, whether  appointed  by  the

instrument or declaration or by the Majlis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central organisation for the solemnization and

registration  of Muslim marriages and divorces  will

remain with the Shariah Court and the Kathis. It  is

proposed  that the post of Chief Kathi be  abolished

and that there should be, in the first instance, two

Kathis to deal with marriages where the woman to  be

wedded  has  no wali and where the wali  refuses  to

give his consent to the marriage, and with marriages

where  the man to be married already has a  wife  or

wives living. Other marriages may be solemnized  and

registered  in  the  mosque  area  where  the  bride

resides  by the Naib Kathi of the mosque  area.  The

Naib  Kathis will not be paid by the Government  but

will  be entitled to retain the prescribed fees  for

the solemnization and registration of the marriage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shariah Court will continue to deal with all

cases of disputed applications for divorce. Divorces

by  consent will be registered by a Kathi or a  Naib

Kathi.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is intended that the Bill be referred to a

Select Committee, I do not propose to deal with  the

other detailed provisions of the Bill at this stage.

I  would add, Sir, that the Bill has been considered

in  detail by the Muslim Advisory Board and that  it

has been approved by this Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b>

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bill  before   us,   "The

Administration of Muslim Law Ordinance" is a  hybrid

one  and  the clauses have, in some instances,  been

taken out in toto from the Muslim Law Enactments  of

Selangor,  Pahang and Penang. For this reason,  Sir,

if  not  for  any  other, I welcome  the  Minister's

proposal to commit the Bill to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the first Muslims Ordinance, 1880, was

introduced in Singapore, the lawmakers then  had  in

mind  not so much the desire to control the  way  of

life  as  a  whole of the Muslims of Singapore,  hut

rather the object was to lay down certain principles

of  Islamic  law  which  had  been  abused  by  some

sections   of  the  Muslim  population   and   which

conflicted  with  the  non-theocratic  laws  of  the

State.  In fact, the provisions of the first Muslims

Ordinance never went beyond that. The intention  was

specific  and  to  the point where,  in  effect,  it

became  merely an accessory to the existing laws  of

the  country, although it was part and parcel of the

Statute Book.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments were made to the Ordinance from time to

time,  but  even so the guiding principle was  never

forgotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill, Mr Deputy Speaker, goes beyond

the   original  Muslims  Ordinance,  1880,  and  the

Muslims Ordinance, 1957, both of which, if I may say

again,  tended to accord certain principles  of  the

Muslim  law  with  the existing civil  laws  of  the

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I welcome these new additions for the

effect  it  would have in regularising the  code  of

conduct of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



certain  aspects of Muslim law. But,  Sir,  what  we

agree  to  do  or not to do in this Assembly  is  not

enough  if we do not carry the support of the people

Outside.  Doubts have been raised by Muslim scholars

as  to  whether this Assembly can introduce  such  a

Bill.  And  here,  Sir,  the  question  is  not  the

academic question, similar to the one we debated not

so  long  ago, of whether this Assembly is competent

to  debate the issue under our Standing Orders,  but

rather   whether   in  a  non-secular   State   like

Singapore,  Islamic laws can be  enacted  to  govern

Muslims   in   their  way  of  life.   Some   Muslim

theologians  hold  the view that under  Islamic  law

only a Muslim Government can enforce the laws of the

Koran,  like  the  Government of the  Federation  of

Malaya whose State religion is Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, before I go any further, I would like to

stress  for  the  purpose of clarification  to  this

Assembly  and also to the Press - The Malay Press  in

particular  - that I am not here giving my  views  on

the  Islamic law but rather expressing the views  of

Muslim religious leaders outside this Assembly.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, there is then again another group of Muslims who contend that the provisions

contained  in this Bill are not enough to cover  all

aspects  of  Islamic  law, even  to  the  extent  of

gaoling  a  Muslim for non-observance of  his  daily

prayers  and  fast, both of which to  a  Muslim  and

under  Islamic laws are the pillars and two  of  the

five   fundamentals  upon  which  Islamic   religion

stands.  Sir,  these are some of  the  thoughts  now

occupying  the minds of some, if not all,  religious

leaders since this Bill was published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now, Sir, to touch on some aspects of

the  Bill which I feel require re-thinking. The most

important parts of the Bill, as I see it, are  Parts

IV (dealing with financial problems), V (Mosques and

Religious Schools), and IX (Offences). Under  clause

59,  a  General  Endowment Fund will be  established

into  which  all zakat and fitrah collected  by  the

collectors will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



be  paid.  Clause  73 enables the Majlis,  with  the

approval  of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  to  make

rules "to prescribe from time to time the amount  of

zakat  and  fitrah  to be paid  by  all  Muslims  in

Singapore", and also the distribution of  the  zakat

and fitrah to those eligible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Mr Deputy Speaker, arise two points. The

first  is  the  determination by the  Majlis  of  the

amount  of  zakat and fitrah. Now, how and  in  what

manner, and by what means, and by what yardstick  is

the Majlis to determine the amount? Is this going to

be  another Assessment Department of the Income  Tax

Office?  For  all I know, it could be  an  arbitrary

decision  depending upon the whim and fancy  of  the

members of the Majlis. Fitrah, of course, is not  so

difficult since the calculation is based upon a flat

amount,  whatever the means of the person concerned,

that is to say, those who are not exempted. But when

it  comes  to  zakat, the question of determining  a

person's property upon which a tithe of 2½ per  cent

will be imposed is a highly complex operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the method of distribution and

entitlement  thereof. In Singapore  today,  Sir,  we

have   public  assistance  by  the  Social   Welfare

Department, which pays a mere subsistence  allowance

to  those unemployed. Under Muslim law, the poor and

the  needy will be amongst those first eligible  for

the  distribution  of zakat and  fitrah,  and  these

people will probably be the same people who are also

eligible for public assistance. Now, Sir, is it  the

Government's  intention, once the Bill becomes  law,

to  withdraw  public assistance from those  who  are

eligible for zakat and fitrah? It may well  be  that

the  individual  shares of zakat  and  fitrah  could

amount  to  more  than the pittance  they  get  from

public assistance. I hope it is not going to be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, Sir, we Muslims in Singapore (at least

the  good Muslims) pay two types of what we may call

taxes -  one to the Government in all forms, and  the

other in the form of zakat and fitrah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to clause 77 which prohibits a person

from erecting a mosque,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



without the approval of the Majlis. Sir, this raises

a  very  serious  question. Since the  time  of  the

Prophet,  there  has  been,  to  my  knowledge,   no

religious restriction on the building of a mosque. I

know  this provision is taken from the Selangor  and

Penang  Muslim enactments. But I would like  to  ask

the Minister: why introduce it here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the Offences section which is in

Part IX. Part IX begins with clause 126 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Save as is otherwise in this Ordinance expressly

provided  this  Part  of this Ordinance  shall  only

apply to Muslims.'



<br><br>I  repeat,  Sir,  "shall  only  apply  to  Muslims."

Further  on, under the same Part, clause 131  is  on

cohabitation  Outside marriage. This  clause  states

that  any man or woman who cohabits outside marriage

shall   be  guilty  of  an  offence  and  shall   be

punishable  to a fine not exceeding $500  or  for  a

term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or  to

both.  Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, this means  that  if

you  (anonymously)  were to cohabit  with  a  Muslim

woman  outside  marriage, the Muslim  woman  can  be

sentenced to six months' imprisonment and to a  fine

of  $500,  but you will go scot-free. That  is  what

this  clause  means.  Where  is  the  equality   and

justice,  Sir? My information is that  under  Muslim

law  both  should  be punished.  I  would  seriously

suggest,  Sir,  to the Government that  this  clause

should be totally deleted. In fact, Sir, even in the

Malay  States,  i.e. in the Federation  of  Malaya,

where  the  State  religion is Islam,  there  is  no

provision of this nature in the Muslim enactments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I know that both the Minister and

the State Advocate-General have put in hours of work

in compiling the Bill. I hope their efforts have not

been  wasted, but I would appeal to the  Government,

on  such  a  highly controversial subject,  that  it

would  be better to go slow on the Bill and  not  to

rush it even in Select Committee. No one. Sir, least

of  all myself, can speak with any authority on  the

Muslim religion. We have to seek outside advice, and

the Select Committee is the best place for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also appeal to all concerned that in

moulding this Bill into its final



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



form, both sides of this House should work as a team

and  party politics should not be brought in, either

into this Assembly or into the Select Committee.  In

this connection, Sir, on a parting word of advice to

the  Minister, I would advise him to print  as  many

copies as possible of the Malay version of this Bill

for distribution to Muslim leaders and organisations

throughout   Singapore  long   before   the   Select

Committee begins its deliberations.



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, the Administration of

Muslim  Law  Bill,  which has  been  tabled  by  the

Minister  for Labour and Law today, is a Bill  which

could, be described as creating a new chapter in the

history of Singapore consonant with the Constitution

of  Singapore,  which enunciates the protection  and

safeguard of the islamic religion of the Malays  and

Islamic people of Singapore. I do not wish to  dwell

at  length  on  this  point because  this  Bill  was

actually promulgated on the advice of many religious

experts,  and  it has received the blessing  of  the

Muslim  Advisory Board, and their views and findings

have been accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of zakat, we are adhering to the

school of thought called Shafei. On the distribution

of  the  zakat, it will be distributed according  to

the provisos contained in the Muslims Ordinance. For

instance,  in  the Muslims Ordinance  the  tithe  is

divided  into  eight persons because  two  of  these

conditions are absent in this law, and another  one,

the  ibni sabil  which  is  non-existant  in  this

country.  There  are only six left.  So  only  those

people  who  qualify under those six conditions  are

eligible.  There  should be no  controversy  arising

because there is provision for the mufti to give  it

his ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the question of building

mosques.  This has never happened, but according  to

the  Shafei  school of thought,  if  there  are  two

mosques  in  the  same area, then  they  should  set

different times of prayer. This is merely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



to  prevent  two  mosques in the same  kampong  from

being  erected  which  will  eventually  result   in

misunderstanding  among  the  people,  but   if   it

happens,  as  it  does  happen  because  of  certain

misunderstandings, a group decides to erect a mosque

and  then  not  far  away, say, 10  feet,  there  is

another  surau built, then it is with this  in  view

that  we  have  made  provisions  to  restrict   the

building of mosques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, on the offences, we merely punish

people  of  Islamic faith who commit  the  offences.

There  are  other religions where, when you  are  in

love  with each other, no problem arises; it is  not

an  offence. But in Islamic law, the marriage should

be  solemnized before a priest or imam and witnessed

by witnesses. So it is necessary that the Muslim who

commits the offence should be punished. However  if

a  free  thinker  cohabits with  a  woman,  that  is

another  matter. On this aspect of  the  Bill,  too,

this  has  been  discussed at great  length  by  the

religious leaders. However, as a result of the  wise

decision of the Minister for Law to commit the  Bill

to  a  Select Committee, it is hoped that many  more

religious leaders who are experts on Muslim law will

come  forward  to give their views and  opinions  so

that  the  incidents that took place with regard  to

the Muslims Ordinance will not happen again.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, as a Muslim, I

support  this Bill in principle. Mr Deputy Speaker,

this  is an important Bill as it affects the  Muslim

community  in  Singapore  and  because  the   powers

therein  are wide, and are more closely  related  to

the  Muslim people in Singapore. I am of the opinion

that it is not for me to discuss this Bill. I am not

competent to do so. It requires religious experts to

be  able  to  discuss  this  Bill.  However,  as  my

responsibility  in  this Assembly  is  to  draft  an

Ordinance in the interest of the State of Singapore,

I will give this Bill my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



consideration and careful study. However, as  stated

by  the  Member for Geylang Serai just now, as  this

Bill  should be given thorough consideration by  the

whole  Muslim  community, it is  proper,  therefore,

that  it should be translated into Malay and  copies

of it distributed to all Muslim organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for  National Development  said  that  the

Administration  of Muslim Law Bill did  not  receive

the   response  as  should  be  expected  from   the

religious  experts. The reason why no  response  was

forthcoming   was  that  they  were  not   able   to

understand  the  provisions of the  Bill.  Moreover,

even  those  who  have  a knowledge  of  the  Muslim

religion  do  not  have a proper  knowledge  of  the

English language. So I support the suggestion by the

Member for Geylang Serai that the Bill be translated

into  Malay  and  copies of it  distributed  to  the

various Muslim organisations. Let us not accept this

Bill just because it has been approved by the Muslim

Advisory  Board. It is not enough,  because  I  know

that  although the Muslim Advisory Board is the body

to  advise  the Government on religious matters,  it

does   not  reflect  public  opinion.  So   at   the

suggestion  of  the  Minister  for  Labour  and  Law

himself  to  commit the Bill to a Select  Committee,

which is a commendable step, I welcome this Bill  in

the hope that it will be enforced in the interest of

the Muslim people in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to remind the

Government about is that the Bill can be modified to

fit   in  with  our  wishes  but  the  question   of

enforcement is a matter which must be given  careful

thought. From the provisions of this Bill,  I  think

powers  have  been vested in the Majlis Ugama  Islam

which  will  issue rulings, administer finances  and

decide  on  administrative  matters  concerning  the

erection of religious schools and so on. Members  of

the Majlis Ugama Islam will be nominated by the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara. I only wish to remind  that  this

Board should not be a place where people merely wish

to  be nominated for the sake of being nominated. It

may well be that although they are of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



the  opinion  that a certain matter is contradictory

to  the Muslim law, they, as nominated members,  may

not dare to voice their opinion openly. Because they

are nominated members, therefore, their interest  is

in being members of the Board and nothing else. What

we hope is that the members of this Board will serve

on the Board to discharge truly their responsibility

towards the religion of Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point which impresses me, Mr Deputy Speaker,

is when the Parliamentary Secretary stated that when

people  cohabit, the punishment is imposed  only  on

the  Islamic  people. According to the Parliamentary

Secretary,  this  is  because the  Islamic  man  has

committed  the offence. If considered carefully,  he

said  originally  that the aim of the  Bill  was  to

abide  by the provisions of the Constitution. It  is

expected  that  the Constitution will safeguard  the

provisions of the Islamic law. We should be able  to

guide  the  people of Islam along the right  Islamic

path  for the reason that the Islamic law cannot  be

applied  to  non-Muslims. So I  strongly  urge  this

matter  to  be  carefully considered in  the  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to

Chairman and seven other Members to be nominated  by

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the provisions of the

Pineapple  Industry Ordinance so as  to  give  legal

effect   to  Government's  policy  for  the  Malayan

Pineapple industry contained in Command Paper No. 24

of 1960 which was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



tabled  in  the  Legislative Assembly  on  the  25th

October,  1960. Corresponding legislation  has  been

passed by the Federation House of Representatives on

the 30th November, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Malayan Pineapple Industry Board,

which  consists of seventeen members, has been found

to  be too unwieldy, and clause 2 reconstitutes  the

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present functions of the Board are not

precisely set out and have been re-drafted in clause

4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered that there is no room in the

Board   for   two  full-time  senior  Administrative

Officers, and clause 5 abolishes the statutory  post

of Chief Executive Officer and transfer to the Board

the  power  to  appoint such staff as  it  considers

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For flexibility and efficiency, the statutory

Executive Committee is also abolished and its powers

transferred to the Board under clause 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to give effect to the

proposal to raise the rate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



of  tax on private lotteries which I mentioned in my

Budget speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, promoters of private lotteries pay a

tax  of  20  per  cent on their gross  receipts  and

operators of fruit machines pay 20 per cent on 137½

per  cent of their net takings. For reasons which  I

have   fully   explained  in  my  Budget  statement,

Government  considers it just and  proper  that  the

rates  of tax be increased in respect of these  from

20 per cent to 30 per cent.

<div align="center"><b>RUBBER ESTATES ASSESSMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second read.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Deputy, Speaker, I have the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

recommendation to proceed with this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this Bill is to give effect to

the  changes  in  the  rate of assessment  on  large

rubber  holdings  which  I announced  in  my  Budget

Speech on the 29th of November.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, when the price of rubber is under 20

cents per pound, the estate owner pays 1 per cent of

the price as assessment. The maximum rate payable at

present  is 3¼ per cent and this applies only  when

the price exceeds 35 cents. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

you  will see that at the present price of about  85

cents per pound, an estate owner pays only 2½ cents

per pound. This is considerably



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



lower than the export duty on  rubber  in

the  Federation.  When  the price  of  rubber  moves

upwards, this disparity becomes even greater.  There

is  no valid justification for this anomaly and  the

scale which is set out in clause 3 of the Bill  goes

some way to reducing this disparity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter which I wish to draw

attention  to. This is that land in Singapore  could

be  put  to  better use than for rubber plantations,

and  so  I  propose, as a measure to discourage  the

alienation of land for rubber, to impose a quarterly

rate of $8.75 per acre on land under immature rubber

or   where  the  trees  have  been  abandoned.   The

necessary  provisions  are contained  in  clause  3,

paragraph (a) and clause 4 of the Bill, while clause

6  provides for the necessary returns to be made  by

estate owners to the tax department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Kandasamy,. I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, to leave out lines 11 to 17 inclusive

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Provided that in respect of any such rubber

estate or part thereof in which no rubber trees  are

tapped  or in which the rubber trees are not  tapped

to  the  satisfaction of the Comptroller  the  owner

thereof shall pay to the Comptroller a rate of eight

dollars  and seventy-five cents per acre or part  of

an  acre  in respect of such quarter in addition  to

the   rate   ascertained  in  the  manner  hereafter

provided."; and'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for amending the proviso in clause 3 is

to close up the loopholes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



which  the original proviso has. Under the  original

proviso,  the owner of a rubber estate  could  evade

tax  by tapping trees once or twice a quarter.  They

would  then  have  to pay the rate  for  the  rubber

produced,  and  as  this would be very  little,  the

assessment would be small. The new proviso therefore

allows  the  Comptroller to require payment  of  the

rate  for untapped trees if he is not satisfied that

the yield is economic.

Negara's recommendation that this Bill be proceeded

with. I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this Bill is to give effect to

the proposals to reduce the rate of personal

allowances on income tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



and to provide for an "earned income relief" which I

outlined in the Budget Statement.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "earned income" for the purposes

of the new tax relief is provided in clause 2 of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed reductions in the rates of relief are

contained  in  clause  3.  The  allowances  will  be

reduced  to $2,000 for an individual and $1,000  for

his wife. These deductions will bring our income tax

rates  closer to those of the Federation. The impact

of these reductions is diminished by the new "earned

income  relief"  which is provided  under  the  same

clause  of  the Bill, and is set at 20 per  cent  of

earned  income  subject to a limit  of  $1,000.  The

average  worker  will hardly be  affected  by  these

changes in the tax structure, because the 20,000  or

so  new tax payers will only have to pay a total  of

$750,000  per  annum or an average of $37  each  per

year. The maximum amount any new taxpayer will  have

to  pay is $20 a year if he is a bachelor and $50  a

year  if he is married without children. The maximum

payable by any new taxpayer with three children will

be  $12.50 a year. I am sure, Sir, that Members will

agree that this is neither iniquitous nor a hardship

on   the  lower  income  groups.  As  I  have   said

previously, the average family in Singapore does not

pay  income  tax  until  their  earnings  from  work

reaches the region of $500 per month, even with  the

proposed  reductions of personal allowances.  It  is

relevant also to note that for a family of five with

an  income  of less than $10,000, or for  a  married

couple without children, with an income of less than

$9,000 or for a bachelor with an income of less than

$8,000,  the tax in Singapore is lower than the  tax

in  the Federation. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir,  it

cannot be said that our tax rates are onerous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

of  vessels enter port and leave the harbour. It  is

an  international custom for all vessels  to  fly  a

flag  of  that  State which it is  visiting.  It  is

desirable,  therefore, that in Singapore  we  should

have the possibility of distinguishing vessels which

are  owned by the Singapore Government from visiting

vessels  and  other  trading vessels  which  may  be

registered in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Marine Ensign will be flown by all

marine craft in the service of the Government  or  a

statutory  board, say, for example,  when  the  Port

Authority  is formed, light-houses, signal stations,

piers   and  wharves  owned  or  operated   by   the

Government or statutory boards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly adopts the State Marine Ensign

as described and shown in Paper Misc. 6 of 1960.

<div align="center"><b>SUSPENSION OF MEMBER</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

-[19th December, 1960]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House condemns the Member for Hong Lim

for  his  dishonourable  conduct  unbecoming  of  an

elected  representative of the  people  in  that  he

repeatedly used his privilege in this Assembly as  a

cloak for spreading malicious falsehoods to unjustly

injure innocent persons both inside and outside this

Assembly;  that he be suspended from the service  of

this  Assembly until such time as (i) he  apologises

to this Assembly for his dishonourable conduct; (ii)

he  unreservedly withdraws his unfounded allegations

against  the  Prime Minister and  the  Minister  for

Labour  and  Law; and (iii) he assures the  Assembly

that he will not persist in abusing his privilege in

this  Assembly  by  uttering  malicious  falsehoods,

unless  he  be  prepared when challenged  to  repeat

outside  the  Assembly the charges he makes  in  the

Assembly."-(The Deputy Prime Minister).



<br><br>4.55 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr

Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the motion standing in my name

be adjourned sine die.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, six days ago, the former Member for Hong Lim

stated that he would substantiate all the things  he

had  said.  This  was reported in page  44  of  your

unrevised transcript of proceedings on that day.  At

that  time, he begged for time to collect more facts

so that he could prepare his case. This is quoted on

page  45  of the unrevised transcript. He wanted  an

adjournment  to give him a chance to  delve  further

into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not in the Chamber, Mr Speaker, this

afternoon when you made your announcement  that  the

former  Member  for  Hong Lim,  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan,

tendered his resignation to you at 2.13 p.m. today.

This  last-minute reversal of stand,  after  stating

explicitly that he intended to substantiate  charges

which  we believe to be false, speaks for itself.  I

had  expected  him,  honour  bound,  to  pursue  the

allegations  he had made in this House. However,  in

view of the fact that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



he  has  changed  his  mind 17  minutes  before  the

sitting  of this Assembly, I have to move  that  the

motion  that is before the House should be adjourned

sine die.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this adjournment sine die is that

since  Mr  Ong Eng Guan, the man who has  made  the

allegations, is no longer a Member of this House, it

will  be better to have the allegations investigated

and  conducted outside this Chamber. It is intended,

therefore, to set up a Commission of Inquiry with  a

High Court Judge as Commissioner to investigate  the

truth of the allegations that have been made against

two  Ministers.  It is our hope that the  Commission

will  commence its hearing and complete its findings

as  soon as possible so that they could be tabled in

this  House. Thereupon, I shall ask for this  motion

to be put back on the Order Paper for debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Inquiry Report has been tabled in this

House, steps will be taken to hold a by-election  in

the constituency of Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is really in two parts.

The Question is, "That the debate be now adjourned."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate be now adjourned.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Resumption of debate, what day?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sine die.
