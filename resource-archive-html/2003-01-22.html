<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CONVENTION AND EXHIBITION CENTRES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and   Industry   how  will  Singapore's  convention   and

exhibition centres be affected by the recently  completed

multi-million  dollar convention and exhibition  hall  in

Yogjakarta.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the S$10 million

Jogja Expo Centre in Yogjakarta was opened last year.  We

understand that its main purpose is to provide a platform

for   small   and  medium-sized  enterprises,  especially

vendors  of  arts and craft, to showcase and  sell  their

products.  Given the richness and diversity of Indonesian

products  in  this area, such a centre  is  important  in

promoting commerce.  As its primary focus is on  domestic

trade

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>

fairs  and  conventions,  the  Jogja  Expo  Centre   will

complement rather than compete with Singapore,  which  is

targeting    mainly   international    exhibitions    and

conventions.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, it was reported

in the newspapers on 9th December that Yogjakarta intends

to  establish some direct trade routes with  the  region.

Because  of  its landlocked nature in the  past,  it  had

always  been operating through Bali, Jakarta  and  Medan.

One  of  the options is to establish direct trade  routes

with  Singapore.   In view of this, what  is  Singapore's

position  with regard to this intention on  the  part  of

Yogjakarta?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mdm Ho is quite right

about  Yogjakarta's intention to boost its  role  in  the

region.   They  are  trying to promote  themselves  as  a

cultural,  educational and tourism hub  to  compete  with

Bali  and  other centres of attraction in Indonesia.   We

see  this  as complementary with us.  The more  links  we

have to the region, the better.  It enhances our role and

we also want the various centres of commerce in Indonesia

to succeed.  So, it is complementary.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> It is also understood that

Yogjakarta is known to be a nest for fundamental Islam in

this  part  of  the world.  In view of its  intention  to

establish  direct  trade links via Singapore,  how  would

this impact our security and competition in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> We have trade links with

all  parts of the world.  We have trade links with  parts

of  the  world which are politically stable  as  well  as

those that are politically complex.  I do not think  that

we  should be distracted from providing this connectivity

where  there is business to be done.  If there is a  case

for  security  measures, when it comes  to  relationships

with  particular  cities  or  countries,  that  would  be

undertaken  in  a sensible fashion.  But  it  should  not

distract  us from being able to conduct trade  and  boost

commerce with all countries in the world.

<div align="center"><b>SENNETT ESTATE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Upgrading)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chiam

See Tong -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To ask the Minister for National Development

whether the recent decision to upgrade Sennett Estate  is

based  on  the Estate's eligibility or is it a result  of

the  promise  made  by  the Prime Minister  in  the  last

General Election.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Question

No. 2, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the decision to

upgrade Sennett Estate is based on the eligibility of the

estate  as well as the Prime Minister's promise  made  at

the  last  General Election.  All private  estates  which

apply  for upgrading under the Estate Upgrading Programme

will be ranked and selected based on factors such as  the

age  and  condition of the estate, the level of community

bonding  and the level of support for the programme.   At

the  last  General Election, the Prime Minister  promised

that Sennett Estate would be considered for upgrading  if

residents   showed  that  they  supported  the  programme

offered by the PAP candidate for Potong Pasir.  After the

General  Election,  both  candidates  for  Potong   Pasir

publicly  affirmed  that the majority of  Sennett  Estate

residents had given their votes to the PAP.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Can the Minister of State

please elaborate on the extent of upgrading that is going

to be provided?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, the details of the

upgrading for Sennett Estate are still being worked  out.

I  think  it  would  be premature  for  me  to  make  any

definitive statement to that effect.

<div align="center"><b>THREAT OF TERRORISM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question

[20th January 2003],

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House (a) acknowledges that the terrorist

threat to Singapore is real and serious; (b) supports the

firm  actions the Government has taken against the threat

to   the  security  of  Singapore  posed  by  the  Jemaah

Islamiyah  group and other militant and extremist  groups

in  the region; and (c) endorses the recommendations  put

forth  in the White Paper on The Jemaah Islamiyah Arrests

and the Threat of Terrorism, contained in Paper Cmd. 2 of

2003,  to  counter the terrorist threat by (i)  enhancing

the  security  measures;  (ii)  policing  the  spread  of

terrorist and extremist ideology; and (iii) strengthening

our  social cohesion and religious harmony.". - [Mr  Wong

Kan Seng].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, thank you for accommodating me.   I,  too,

would like to support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it is very disturbing to read the contents

of  the  White  Paper and how it would affect  Singapore.

So,   I  fully  agree  with  the  comments  made  by  the

Government  to respond in a robust manner,  and  that  we

should  indeed  respond  to a threat  which  will  really

threaten our national security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said by many speakers about how

Singaporeans  ought to respond to this threat  by  groups

such  as the JI.  I do not wish to cover the same grounds

because,  by and large, I agree with all of the  comments

made.  But I would like to make a few comments from  just

one single aspect, and that is from my perspective as  an

employer and as a corporate citizen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the speeches made, we can see that it is

important  to  respond to the threat  from  two  somewhat

opposing ways.  One is that we have to be extra-vigilant.

We  cannot  allow potential threats to be  diminished  or

left  unchecked.  But, on the other hand, we cannot allow

ourselves  to become overly cautious or overly suspicious

about Muslims in general.  Because this would then result

in a great divide in our society, and our society is just

not  about Singapore alone.  It is also about our  Muslim

neighbours.  So, if we do not approach the issue in a way

that  it should be sensibly approached, we can provide  a

very fertile soil for extremists to exploit the situation

and to make political capital out of a very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>

sensitive    situation   just    by    simply    alleging

discrimination against a particular racial  or  religious

group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As employers, we face these concerns. We are in a

much more precarious situation compared to the man-in-the-street.   Because when an individual decides to  take  an

overly  suspicious stance with his Muslim  neighbour,  we

can  probably stop at that.  But this is not one man with

tremendous  irrational  fears.  But  when  employers  and

corporates behave that way or have that sort of  feeling,

then  the  consequences, indeed, can  be  magnified  many

times over, and it would then not be unreasonable for the

Muslim   community   to  think  that   they   have   been

disenfranchised and marginalised, and for  them  to  feel

discouraged and depressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as an employer, I would like to call on

fellow  employers to make that special effort to  ensure,

and  to be seen to be ensuring, a level playing field  in

terms   of   employment  and  treatment  of  our   Muslim

counterparts.  When the JI paper was first  presented,  a

number  of  employer  organisations indeed  came  out  to

affirm  the  importance of abiding by the  principles  of

meritocracy  to  ensure  that job applicants  are  judged

solely  based on qualifications, experience and  also  on

other  objective measures.  This is very important.   Not

only  must we be doing this, we must also be seen  to  be

doing this.  So our employment processes and our business

dealings  with  our Muslim counterparts must  be  utterly

transparent.  And this is even more important, given  the

fact  that we have a somewhat high unemployment situation

where we get hundreds of applicants per job, and it is so

easy  to  cry  foul and allege discrimination  against  a

particular grouping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a practical note, as employers, it would be very

difficult for us to sniff out potential terrorists.  From

the  profiles of the arrested JI members, it would appear

that they are very ordinary folks.  So, it would take  no

less than the ISD to identify them and to round them  up.

From  a  statistical point of view, we are  also  talking

about  small numbers against a very large group of Muslim

citizens.  Therefore, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>

statistical  chance  of letting a terrorist  through  our

organisation, I think, is also quite low and remote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point here is that, on the part of employers,

there  is no need to develop elaborate processes to sniff

out   so-called  potential  terrorists.   But   what   is

important for us to do, as I said earlier on, is to  make

that  special  effort to be fair, and to be  seen  to  be

fair, in our treatment of our Muslim employees.  We  must

simply not let the situation get out of hand.  Because if

we  do  so,  we  might have to face  up  to  demands  for

positive discrimination for groups, which feel they  have

been   treated  or  discriminated  against,   for   their

particular  problems to be specifically addressed.   This

is  the  case  in  the  US  when  they  have  legislation

specifically  drawn up for minority groups and  also  for

women.   So,  we  do not want legislation to  be  enacted

because  it  is cumbersome, and it is counter-productive.

But, as employers, as corporate citizens, we have got  to

preserve  that right against legislation and,  therefore,

we  must do everything we can to be ever mindful that  we

are seen to be treating our Muslim counterparts as fairly

as  possible.  Our Muslim community too, on  their  part,

can also contribute to this mutual tolerance, respect and

moderation,  because we have a collective interest  here.

We  have  a collective interest about our well-being  and

our  national  security.   Together,  we  have  much   to

achieve, we can triumph.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I too rise in support of the motion  moved

by the Minister for Home Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, as many others before me have done, to

also  applaud the Ministry of Home Affairs for initiating

and  publishing the comprehensive, frank and  penetrating

White   Paper  on  the  historical  existence   and   the

clandestine  activities of the Jemaah Islamiyah,  leading

to  the  arrest  of  several of their  members  and  also

highlighting  the seriousness of the threat of  terrorism

Singapore faces.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I am heartened by the fact that what

initially  appeared as scepticism among certain  quarters

in  resurfacing  the Jemaah Islamiyah  issue  by  way  of

debating the published White Paper in this House has  now

turned  into  a  positive and lively  public  debate.   I

believe  it  has  created greater  public  awareness  and

stimulated intense discussion among Singaporeans  of  all

races.   What  is important is the fact that Singaporeans

are  now  more  wary that the threat of  terrorism  is  a

serious  matter  and driven primarily  by  global  forces

beyond   our   shores.   Discussing  and  debating   this

sensitive issue in such an open manner, both publicly and

in  this House, again sends the signal to the world  that

not  only  are we maturing as a society but also presents

us  the  opportunity  to desensitise  this  issue,  which

affects  the  Malay/Muslim  community,  and  consolidates

Singapore's  fortification against terrorism.   It  helps

focus it into a Singaporean problem rather than just that

of a particular community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the uncovering of the JI's clandestine

activities, the Government has taken many firm steps such

as   implementing  defensive  security  measures  at  key

installations   and  buildings,  and  tightening   border

controls.   Recognising  that  terrorism  world-wide   is

funded  by  money-laundering operations,  Parliament  has

also  given the mandate to criminalise terrorist  funding

and  that  this new law is coming into effect later  this

month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this is integral in the wide range of

initiatives  being  taken to combat terrorism.   Policing

and  crippling the flow of funds to and from illegitimate

sources  is necessary to prevent another potential  Bali-like  incident  where the terrorists feel  pressured  and

were compelled to do something, because the funds were in

their  hands  to conduct such extremist acts.   In  these

aspects,  we  must  remain at least one but,  preferably,

several steps ahead of the terrorists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, owing to the distinctive religious

dimension  in today's terrorism, tackling this danger  by

means   of  just  defensive  security  measures  is   not

adequate.    A   more   holistic  dual   track   approach

encompassing hard and soft measures is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>

necessary  to achieve overall effectiveness  in  stamping

out  terrorism.  According to terrorism expert, Dr  Bruce

Hoffman,   the   defeating  of  the   Al-Qaeda   requires

pinpointing the "inner logic" that "motivates  terrorists

and animates terrorism".  The same holds true for the  JI

and   other  religiously-driven  extremist  and  militant

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the JI issue afflicts the Muslim community, it

is  encouraging to note that the Malay/Muslim  community,

religious  and mosque leaders have come out  strongly  in

support of the White Paper and condemning the JI and  its

extremist agenda, and also acknowledging that such groups

are  a  menace to our society.  Many measures  have  also

been  proposed to check and prevent the emergence of such

groups again in the future.  Measures ranging from taking

stock  of  the curriculum of Islamic religious education,

registering  qualified asatizahs, or religious  teachers,

to  sanctioning  foreign  religious  speakers  have  been

mentioned  by  the Minister-in-charge of  Muslim  Affairs

yesterday, and also by several of my Malay colleagues  in

this  House  who have spoken earlier.  These  are  either

already implemented or are being seriously considered for

implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, while such measures are necessary and

important, I believe that the long run measure should  be

to  ensure that the Muslim community is equipped  with  a

sound  and  rational knowledge of Islam  as  well  as  an

appreciation of the other major religions in our country,

in  consideration of the multi-racial and multi-religious

context within which we all live.  A proper knowledge  of

Islam  will  help in preventing the infection of  deviant

ideas from taking root among Muslims here.  Knowledge  of

other religions would help in enhancing the understanding

and  the preservation of harmony among the various racial

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Sundays ago, my constituency's IRCC organised a

visit  to the various places of worship within the  Pasir

Ris area.  We started with the Pentacost Methodist Church

where, after a briefing of the history of the church  and

its activities, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>

were  invited to join in the service.  I was subsequently

surprised   in   being  called  upon   to   address   the

congregation  and was later told that  I  was  the  first

Muslim  to have done so.  I told them that singing  hymns

and saying the Lord's prayer was nothing new to me, as  I

attended Presbyterian High, a missionary school during my

secondary  school days, and yet I am still  very  much  a

Muslim today.  We all laughed through it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, in May, while being in the United States,

I  had  the  opportunity to join in a community gathering

near  the  hotel where I was put up.  A pastor generously

approached  a black Muslim attendee to start the  meeting

with  a prayer.  He graciously replied by requesting  the

pastor  to  open with the Lord's prayer.   After  several

enthusiastic  echoes  of  "Amen"  from  all,  the  Muslim

community  leader lamented that this too was no different

from   the  prayer  of  Muslims!   It  is  apparent  that

communities,  wherever they now live in  the  world,  are

generally   making  efforts  to  bridge   the   gaps   of

understanding   between  Muslims  and  non-Muslims,   and

especially so since after the 9/11 unfortunate  event  in

2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Chinese majority non-Muslims, whether Buddhists,

Christians or Taoists, should also reciprocate by  making

an  effort  to understand and know more about true  Islam

which  is  truly  a  religion of  peace,  but  which  has

regrettably  been subjected to extreme misinterpretations

by   irresponsible  Muslims  and  non-Muslims  to  wholly

advance their personal agenda.  The Minister-in-charge of

Muslim  Affairs,  Dr  Yaacob, again  yesterday  and  also

several   other  Malay  colleagues  of  mine   have   all

elaborated  on  the subject of Islam at length  in  their

speeches in this House over the last two days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank all my non-Muslim colleagues

who  have spoken so eloquently in support of the need for

and  the  benefit of more public education on the various

religious  and  cultural practices of the  racial  groups

here  and  also the need to strengthen the links  between

our key ethnic groups.  Only through such initiatives and

concerted action of greater

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>

communication  and involvement with each other  could  we

achieve  better  understanding, which  would  lead  to  a

stronger  bond  and  trust between  the  major  races  in

Singapore.  We should capitalise on the current  positive

mood   and   push  for  attitudinal  change   among   all

Singaporeans, Muslims or non-Muslims, to take  the  issue

of  strengthening  harmony and  social  integration  more

seriously than ever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the concern of potential discrimination

at the workplace, it is heartening that there is a strong

call  among  workers of different races and religions  to

uphold the principle of meritocracy.  I also applaud  the

effort   of   NTUC,  the  Singapore  National  Employers'

Federation  and  the  Singapore  Business  Federation  to

jointly   craft   a   'code  of  responsible   employment

practices'  which  recommended, among  others,  to  adopt

consistent   and   objective   selection   criteria   for

employment   and   to  avoid  discriminatory   rules   in

considering promotion and advancement opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to call upon employers of large and

small companies, MNCs or local SMEs, as Mrs Fang Ai  Lian

has  also done so a moment ago, to continue to adopt such

fair  and  equal opportunity employment practices  as  we

have   done  so  all  this  while.   Discriminating   and

sidelining  Malay/Muslims in jobs if they  could  perform

just  as  well as any other Singaporean would  not  augur

well for our society.  As Dr Yaacob, Dr Wang Kai Yuen and

several  others have pointed out, many Malay Singaporeans

have  been  performing  better and excelling  in  various

fields.  Unless equal opportunities - and I would like to

stress here, equal opportunities on the basis of our time-tested  meritocratic principles are created for  them  to

progress  alongside other Singaporeans  -  the  community

will  be  denied  of  role  models  to  catalyse  further

progress.   It  is  a  known  fact  that  societies   and

communities  blessed with successful role models  develop

greater confidence to undertake more difficult challenges

in every facet of life and tend to progress faster.  When

this happens, the entire

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>

society  benefits from it.  As the saying  goes,  success

breeds success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it has to be borne in mind that a

Malay community which is discriminated against and denied

of  opportunities, in spite of putting in  best  efforts,

will  degenerate  and turn into a disgruntled  community.

Over time, if not managed, an underclass, in the sense of

groups  who  have  lost  all hope and  dropped  out  from

Singapore's mainstream society, will emerge.   I  do  not

think I need to describe what such a scenario would  mean

to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Government would never allow the

emergence of an underclass in our country.  But  I  think

it  is  important that we bring this perspective  in  the

context of the current discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Dr Wang Kai Yuen's speech in this House

yesterday, he noted that many Muslims could not reconcile

themselves that the JI members are bad Muslims  and  were

just  carrying out their Muslim duties when  they  joined

the JI organisation in defence of Islam.  As a matter  of

further clarification, Sir, it is important to note  that

the  JI  members were well aware of what they were  going

into  when they decided to be a part of the JI.  As noted

in  the  White Paper, they were willing participants  and

well  immersed  in extremist activities long  before  the

September  11  incident  and  their  subsequent  arrests.

Their plans to attack targets in Singapore go back to the

mid-1990s  and  intensified  after  September  11,  2001.

Considering also the above-average education that most of

the   JI  detainees  have,  it  is  imperative  for   our

Singaporean Muslims to know and are convinced that the JI

members know exactly what they were getting into and  the

potential  devastation  they would  have  caused,  should

their plans be successfully executed.   Both Muslims  and

non-Muslims  would have been victims of their  aggressive

acts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, while the White Paper focuses on

the  JI  perpetrating terrorism under the  cloak  of  the

Islamic  faith,  it  must also  be  borne  in  mind  that

terrorism is,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>

by  no  means,  bounded by religion.  The  Oklahama  City

bombing  by Timothy McVeigh and the sarin gas  attack  in

underground  subways by the Aum cult in  Japan  are  some

terror  acts  that  come to mind.  As such,  Singaporeans

must  always  be on guard against not only religious  but

also other forms of extremism to help the Government and,

for  that matter, ourselves, as Singaporeans, to  protect

lives and property, and preserve the inter-ethnic harmony

that  we have painstakingly built since our independence.

The conclusion of the White Paper is apt in reminding  us

that,  given the nature of the terrorist threat  we  face

today,  preservation of harmony is paramount to  ensuring

Singapore's continued well-being.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Thank you, Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  for letting  me  speak.   Today's

debate  is  important because we are discussing  a  topic

that  has affected and will continue to affect the  lives

of all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 30-odd years, we have enjoyed peace and

prosperity.  Then came September 11 which shook the whole

world.  To many Singaporeans, this tragedy opens the eyes

of  many to the dangers that could fall upon them.   This

fear  was confirmed when we discovered a terrorist  group

and  arrested  15 members of this radical Islamic  group,

Jemaah  Islamiyah,  in  December  2001.   They  had  very

sinister motives, including bombings of foreign embassies

and even local targets, like Yishun MRT Station.  Then in

August 2002, ISD arrested another 21 persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the message is very clear.

We  better  get  to understand and expose  the  terrorist

network and the dangers they pose before our citizens get

hurt  or  killed.   Judging from  the  information  being

covered  and linking this with other countries' findings,

this is going to last a very, very long time.  Therefore,

this  White  Paper is timely.  Because  of  the  in-depth

discussion  on  the terrorist operations and  the  people

involved,  this White Paper is a must read  for  all  who

cherish  this place.  It provides an important source  of

information  and  understanding for the average  citizen,

who must know, by now,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>

how  close we were to tragic happenings of the kind  seen

at  Bali where more than 200 lives were lost.  They  will

better  appreciate why we took such swift actions against

these anti-national elements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is that the terrorists are

at  our doorsteps.  We must do our utmost to prevent them

from  spreading  their network, and this is  where  every

citizen  counts in our approach to block, frustrate,  and

to   check  their  activities  and  movements.   We  must

remember  our  security is under attack, and  unless  our

citizens show their determination and resolve to  protect

what  we  have  built up over the years,  we  may  suffer

severe damages to lives and targets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper showed clearly the targets these

people  are gunning - MRT stations, shopping and  crowded

places,  places  of  worship,  airports,  and  many  soft

targets  - where civilian casualties will be high.   They

are not worried about killing Muslims, Christians, Hindus

and  foreigners.  To them the ideology comes first.  They

want  to  create  chaos  - security,  racial,  religious,

social and economic chaos - preventing investors to come,

and  disrupting  and  destroying the  infrastructures  we

built.   This  is a national issue.  And all  races  must

band  together  and not let these anti-national  elements

break  us  apart.  We have come this far through  working

together  and  enjoying the benefits of  strong  economic

growth,  good education, medical care, good housing,  and

security.  We walk the streets safely.  Do not let  these

be  taken  away.  These are all worth fighting  for,  and

dying  for.  We must not give these up easily by allowing

these people to throw a spanner into our society and make

our  Chinese  and Indian communities distrust  the  Malay

community, just because they happen to embrace Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media, television, radio and newspapers have put

Muslims in the limelight because of events like September

11,  and the carnage at Bali.  Our Malay community, being

Muslims,  have been drawn into this.  Moreover, of  late,

our  Malays have become more pious and religious.   Their

dressing and social behaviour have also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>

changed.    There  is  nothing  wrong  in  being   pious.

However,  these changes and trends have made the  Chinese

and  Indians colour their attitudes towards them.   I  do

not  think  this is racial in nature.  I  blame  this  on

human  nature's  association  of  thoughts,  trends   and

events, that have made them feel this way.  I think  this

attititudinal change happens everywhere.  We have seen it

happening  in the United States, Australia, Britain,  and

even  in Belgium in a place called Antwerp.  But we  must

take  swift  action not to allow this  to  sow  seeds  of

distrust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years since independence, at the ground

level, each community has contributed to the closely-knit

society of multi-racial living and that probably helps  a

great  deal during such trying times.  However,  we  must

never take things for granted.  We must move forward  and

continue to work on this foundation, reinforcing the need

to  live together harmoniously, and giving assurances and

words of comfort to each community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the many statements of support from the Malay

community,  especially outsiders,  help  to  give  strong

signals of assurances to the non-Muslim communities, that

the JI is the work of a minority of Muslims, and that the

majority  of Malays are against their actions and  wrong-doings.    Moderate  Malay  leaders  must  not  let   the

extremist  minority call the agenda.   Non-Muslims  watch

the  reactions of our Malay community towards this  White

Paper  because non-Muslims want assurances, and investors

also  want  assurances.  Yesterday, my  colleague,  Ahmad

Khalis,  told  this  House  that  more  than  127   Malay

organisations  have  openly  come  out  to  support   the

Government's action and condemned the JI.   This  is  the

most  significant  stand and speaks well  for  the  Malay

leadership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I read the headline article on 14th January,

"Let's  All  Back JI White Paper - Urges  the  leader  of

Khatijah  Mosque", I see it as a good and  clear  signal.

Other  organisations, like Pergas, the Singapore  Islamic

Scholars and Religious Teachers Association, have come

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>

out  in  support.   The  latest MUIS'  statement  on  the

correct  practice  of  Muslims is most  welcomed.   This,

coupled  with  my  Malay parliamentary colleagues'  press

statement,  condemning the JI and its  extremist  agenda,

augurs well for all of us, especially the non-Muslims and

those who want to invest here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Muslims need these kinds of assurances, that the

JI  is an extreme group rejected by the community, and to

dispel  the misconception that Islam is the cause of  the

problem.  In fact, my MP colleague, Ahmad Khalis, made  a

good   and   spirited  speech,  to  respond  to  concerns

expressed  by some quarters, including views by Ayatollah

Khomeini  in  1984 and philosopher Rogers  Scruton,  that

Islam  does  not mean peace.  It is important  that  such

views be challenged, so that Muslims and non-Muslims will

not support these serious charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper highlighted that many of the JI

members learned their radical views from foreigners.   So

when the Straits Times on 17th January reported that some

mosques  regularly  invited PAS  politician-cum-religious

leaders to preach at the mosques, I was shocked.  PAS  is

a  political  party  in Malaysia, advocating  an  Islamic

state.   They control two states in Malaysia -  Trengganu

and  Kelantan - under Islamic rule.  Their brand of Islam

is  too  extreme.  They are proposing hudud laws.   I  am

against intolerance to other religions.  In Singapore, we

have  separated politics and religion.  So,  how  can  we

allow  such  religious teachers, with a strong  political

stand  of  creating  an  Islamic state  in  Malaysia,  be

allowed to preach and advise?  I think the mosque leaders

are too naive to believe that giving them a list of "do's

and don'ts" would stop them from preaching their brand of

Islam.   Their  very  presence is a show  of  acceptance.

This  mixing  of politics and religion, and  sending  the

wrong  signals  to  non-Muslims  and  Muslims,  is   very

discomforting  and not reassuring.  You are  giving  them

space and, worse still, credibility, to preach under  the

guise of piety and religion.  The mosque leaders must  be

aware  of  the  sensitivities of the  other  communities,

especially in the light

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>

of  the  present circumstances.  The vetting  of  foreign

religious  leaders, be they Muslims, Christians,  Hindus,

must  be  careful and discriminating.  In a  multi-racial

and  multi-religious  society, the  use  of  religion  in

festering dissent and discord is serious because religion

evokes emotion and passion, and is beyond reasoning.   We

must avoid this at all costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past two days of debate brought into focus the

question: are Malays being marginalised in a meritocratic

society?  The article "From the Gallery" by Tan Tarn  How

gives  a broad coverage to this issue.  A community  that

is  marginalised  because of race and  religious  beliefs

works  against  the  interest of a  multi-racial,  multi-religious  society,  and  this  is  exactly  what   these

extremist  groups want to see it happen.  So, if  we,  as

leaders,  and the press, push this line of argument  that

the Malays are marginalised, then we are playing into the

hands of the JI.  The Prime Minister had given figures on

the  improved  performances of Malay  students  over  the

years.   Dr  Wang  Kai Yuen restated  it  yesterday.   Mr

Yatiman   Yusof  and  Mr  Zainudin  Nordin  rejected   Mr

Shanmugam's call for some form of affirmative action  for

Malays.   They  do  not want symbolic icons  of  success.

They want to be at the top on their own merit.  They have

come  this  far  on their own; so there is  no  need  for

special treatment.  They do not want to devalue the Malay

community's position in society.  So, let us  be  on  our

guard  -  affirmative action is potentially divisive  and

has other undesirable consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are under the watchful eyes of the JI. So, every

possible  avenue must be closed to them because JI  comes

in many guises and forms.  We must not give them space to

operate.   Their teachings must be challenged, and  their

wrong-doings  exposed.  Singaporeans  of  all  races  who

believe in peace and prosperity must call the agenda, and

work out a strategy to stop this.  This strategy involves

the  strengthening of our security at every level of  our

society.  In other words, every citizen must be on  their

guard  to report any suspicious activity or personnel  to

the authorities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the Chinese and Indians, attitudes of

prejudice  must  give  way to one  of  understanding  the

trauma  that our Malays are going through.   If  we  seek

assurances  from the Malays, we, especially the  Chinese,

must  give them the assurances that there will be no  job

discrimination  against Malays as this  is  happening  in

some firms.  To do likewise, is to play into the hands of

JI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we can overcome, if each and every

Singaporean understands the threat posed by  the  JI  and

acts  as a lookout post for our security men.  This vital

cooperation will make whoever wants to take on us,  think

twice, before trying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this White Paper.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.

I would like to thank Dr Tan for his support of the White

Paper  and the support of the Malay/Muslim community.   I

would  just  like to clarify a point that he has  raised,

because I think it is useful to clarify in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers that were invited by the mosques, go

through  the  vetting  process  and  they  have  to   get

clearance from MUIS.  The speakers that were featured  in

the article were speakers who were invited by the mosques

long  before they became PAS members.  They were  invited

in  their  own right as religious teachers.   But  having

said  that,  Sir, I would just like to assure  the  House

that we will step up our measures to ensure that whatever

they  do in Singapore, we will monitor very, very closely

in  terms of what they do and what they say.  So far,  we

have not had any incidents, especially with this group of

speakers, in terms of the views that they have presented.

But, we have also in the past, rejected permission sought

by  some  mosques to invite some of the foreign speakers.

So, I would like to assure the House that the process  is

in place, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  this

debate.  During

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>

the  last 12 months, I visited countries in Asia,  Europe

and  the Americas on various assignments.  Every  time  I

went  through an airport, the strict, and sometimes over-zealous   security   checks  and  stringent   immigration

procedures, served as a constant reminder to  the  threat

of  international terrorism, and the threat is real,  and

countries around the world are dealing with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrest of the 15 JI members in December 2001

shocked us.  And, this White Paper forced many of  us  to

take cognisance that the threat is nearer to home than we

would  have otherwise thought.  Our Government is  taking

this  threat seriously and is dealing with it.  And,  now

it  is  up to us Singaporeans to recognise the issues  on

hand, and to work together and to support our Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> have spoken eloquently in support of

this  motion.   I  would  like  to  add  two  points  for

consideration.  In addition to the recommendation in  the

White  Paper  on strengthening social cohesion,  I  would

like to suggest that sports can play an important role in

community  bonding  and  nation  building.   Sports   cut

through  barriers of race and religion.  No  matter  what

level  of sports that you play or take part in, there  is

no  discrimination against Muslims, non-Muslims, Chinese,

Indians, or Malays.  In sports, one set of rules  applies

to  everyone, no matter what is the colour of your  skin,

hair,  eyes  or your beliefs.  Through sports,  we  build

friendship  and  strong bonding afterwards.   During  the

Asian   Games  and  the  Commonwealth  Games  last  year,

Singaporeans, regardless of race and religion cheered our

champions,  whether it was Li Jiawei,  our  table  tennis

champion, or Abdul Halim bin Haron and Ibrahim Sihat, our

weightlifting  champions,  or  Remy  Ong,   our   bowling

champion.   We  cheered as one, and  we  cheered  as  one

nation.  Whenever our football team played, thousands  of

Singaporeans went to support them.  When our team lost or

played  badly,  we  felt  disappointed,  frustrated   and

sometimes even angry when they were trounced.   But  when

they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>

triumphed or showed courage and real fighting spirit,  we

cheered  as  one  and  we  felt  proud  as  Singaporeans.

Players  or supporters - we are one - regardless of  race

and religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday morning, I hosted a breakfast for my

colleague  from the International Olympic  Committee,  Mr

Kip Keino.  Mr Keino is a two-time Olympic gold medallist

and  a  two-time Olympic silver medallist  and  he  is  a

legendary runner from Kenya.  Mr Keino reminded  me  that

sports  is  a  unifying force that unites  a  nation  and

promotes peace and harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I would like to raise is one

on  employment  of Singaporeans.  A number  of  our  hon.

Members   have   touched  on  the  code  of   responsible

employment  practices that was set  up  together  by  the

Singapore   Business  Federation  and   NTUC.    In   the

introduction of this code, it states, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore's society is multi-racial, multi-cultural

and   multi-religious.   Employers  and  employees   must

appreciate  the  diversity  of  the  workforce  and  work

together  in harmony.  Employers should treat  all  staff

fairly  and continue to recruit, based on skills, merits,

experience, capability and relevant job experience.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support this code of practices. My

experience in running a group of companies with more than

2,000  employees has taught me that the best  recruitment

policy is one based on meritocracy.  For companies to run

efficiently and provide the best services or produce  the

best  products,  make a good return to  the  company  and

shareholders so that there will be job security for  each

and every employee, everyone in the company has a part to

play  and every employee has to be qualified and  is  the

best  person for the job.  This is especially so  in  the

increasing  competitive environment, whether  locally  or

internationally.  Sound and viable companies provide jobs

and  security  and  contribute to social  stability.   We

should,  therefore, continue to uphold the  principle  of

meritocracy  and at the same time, there should  not  be,

and we cannot allow, discriminatory practices against any

employee that is based on race and religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore's context, I believe that most of the

employers are fair-minded

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>

and   professional.    For   those   few   who   practise

discrimination,  I  think they  should  be  educated  and

corrected.   The Singapore Business Federation  and  NTUC

will have a big role to play in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during this period of economic uncertainty, we

should continue to concentrate on education, training and

skill development, so that each and every Singaporean  is

employable and has a bright future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  the

debate on this very important matter facing us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the issues before us are multi-faceted. On

the  one  hand,  we are facing a serious  threat  to  our

internal security.  On the other hand, we are faced  with

the  philosophical  issue  of  religion  and  religiosity

amidst  rising  global  religious  revivalism.   Yet,  on

another front we are challenged to ensure that our social

cohesion remains strong and intact.  All these, with  the

background   of  increased  globalisation  and   economic

uncertainty,  certainly  not  the  best  of  times,   but

persevere  we must, to ensure the continued  survival  of

the generations to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for speakers on the last day of such a

debate is always to say what has not already been said  - it  is indeed a challenge.  Much has been said about  the

damage  that  terrorist acts will do to any society.   We

have  seen the devastation of the irresponsible  acts  of

September 11 and October 12, not to mention the many more

by  Al-Qaeda  and the JI.  Sir, the extent  of  terrorist

acts  that have been linked to the JI has been documented

in a report entitled, "Indonesia's Terrorist Network: How

Jemaah  Islamiyah  Works", prepared by the  International

Crisis  Group (ICG).  For example, the report linked  the

Christmas Eve bombings of December 2000 to JI, noting the

impressive planning and coordination work that took place

in the attack.  It reported that the network ensured that

bombs were delivered on Christmas Eve 2000 to 38 churches

or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>

priests  in  11 cities.  Nineteen people were killed  and

some 120 wounded.  These are very serious attacks planned

by  people who have no qualms about taking the  lives  of

innocent  people.   These  are the  people  whom  we  are

talking  about  today.    Singaporeans  cannot  take  the

threat lightly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must also recognise that although the ISD

has  succeeded  in  thwarting the  plans  of  the  JI  on

Singapore  targets, we can see the subsequent costs  that

we have to pay to-date.  More manpower and resources have

to  be  deployed  at  all our Checkpoints  and  important

installations  like  Jurong  Island.   The  Minister  for

Defence  has already said that defence spending for  this

year   will  be  increased.   These  are  important   and

necessary to prevent a catastrophe that will cost us  not

only millions of dollars but possibly lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper is very explicit in its discussion

on  the  implications of the threat of terrorism  on  our

social  cohesion.  I have, as have many  others  in  this

House, spoken on this issue.  In the past year, much  had

already been done.  There is heightened awareness of  the

need  to  understand and appreciate each other's  beliefs

and  practices.  There has been a visible increase in the

number  of  visitors to places of worship  like  mosques,

churches  and  temples, in the name of  improving  mutual

understanding  and tolerance.  Several Members,  however,

have  also  highlighted  that  strengthening  our  social

cohesion needs more than organised visits to these places

of  worship.   Indeed,  often  times,  these  visits  are

organised  by  and for grassroots leaders  and  activists

who,  many  of  us know, are often already the  so-called

converted.  In any case, how many more mosques,  churches

or temples are there to visit?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the relevant Ministries and security

agencies   will  continue  to  be  vigilant  in  ensuring

Singapore's  security,  and the grassroots  organisations

actively organise programmes to facilitate cross-cultural

understanding, the question we have to ask ourselves  is:

what is our role as individual members of the society in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>

ensuring  our  own security?  We are not expected  to  be

vigilant or to track every suspected character that lives

in  our midst.  But we can ensure that we actively invest

in  our social relationships such that we are comfortable

and  confident of the level of trust that  we  have  with

each other, with the people who live around us.  For  all

those  Singaporeans out there who are  not  activists  or

have  not participated in grassroots activities, what  is

your role in ensuring and strengthening our social bonds?

More  generally,  have we invested  sufficiently  in  our

social  relationships with the people around us?  At  the

most  micro level, do we know our neighbours well enough?

These  questions  had  been raised yesterday.   How  many

neighbours who live in the same block of an HDB flat does

the average Singaporean know?  What about within the same

RC zone?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are these questions important? Our housing

policy  ensures  that we live among the different  ethnic

groups.   The level of trust that we have of  the  people

around  us  will ensure that our social cohesion  remains

strong.  It will also act as a deterrence for individuals

to  get  involved in acts that will hurt the people  that

are close and mean something to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the psychological profile of the JI members, as

reported  in  the White Paper, noted that they  had  high

level  of loneliness.  Perhaps they may also not be close

to  their  extended network, let alone their  neighbours.

The point I am making, Sir, is that social networking  is

an active process that requires effort and time.  We need

to  reflect  on  the value we place on such relationships

and act upon it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have often heard the common response of the lack

of  time as a reason for not participating in grassroots-organised  activities.  Many will also say  they  do  not

even  have  time  to interact with their neighbours.   If

this  is true, we have to ask ourselves: where will  this

lead  us to in the long run?  If there is one thing  that

we  can  learn from this JI episode it is that we can  no

longer take our social relationships for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>

granted.  We need to consciously find time and invest  in

these relationships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is also more critical is the inter-ethnic

relations between neighbours.  What is the current  level

of  inter-ethnic  relations in our  neighbourhoods?   The

housing policy has been in place for many years now.  But

anecdotal  evidence, however, suggests that  relationship

is,  at  best, superficial.  The grassroots organisations

can  do  their  part in organising activities  that  will

facilitate  interaction.  But if we do  not  embrace  the

value,   we  will  continue  having  the  same  converted

individuals attend those functions.  Perhaps,  grassroots

organisations  should consider reducing the  geographical

focus  of their activities to a smaller number of  blocks

of   flats  to  encourage  more  micro-level  interaction

between   neighbours.   This  is  not   to   micro-manage

relationships between neighbours but to facilitate  their

interaction, knowing how critical such relationships  are

in ensuring a continued level of trust amongst residents.

We  have heard anecdotal incidences of people not wanting

to  be  in  the  same lift with members of  other  ethnic

groups  following the news of the JI arrests  last  year.

Such  unwanted  incidences can be avoided  if  neighbours

really know and trust one another.  Cumulatively, it will

ensure a higher level of trust between people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper is not only a call for

Singaporeans to wake up to the impending danger  that  is

lurking  outside  our doorsteps.  It  is  also  a  gentle

reminder for us to reflect within ourselves some  of  the

fundamental  values that we uphold.  Are  we  willing  to

leave  our  comfort  zones and  be  part  of  the  larger

network?  The bottom-line goes back to Singaporeans.   Do

they  feel  compelled enough to answer this call  or  are

they  comfortably living within the four walls  of  their

own homes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper also raises the important, though

rather  abstract, issue of religion and religiosity.   It

is  indeed  complex  - for one it is  supposed  to  be  a

private and individual affair - but at the same time,  it

has implications for a larger community.  Indeed, we used

to think of religion as being part of a private space of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>

the  individual  and  have left it  to  that  space.   We

separate religion from the affairs of the state precisely

because we know the complications that will arise  if  we

did  otherwise,  especially in a multi-religious  society

like ours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the complexity of religion

cannot  be  sufficiently underscored.  In  any  religion,

there   exist   fundamental   doctrines,   often   times,

manifested   in   various  forms.   Varying   behavioural

manifestations  of followers are used  as  indicators  of

variations in the interpretations of these doctrines.  No

religious  community  is spared from  dealing  with  such

complexities.  The complexity is acknowledged  by  social

scientists  who  study religiosity.  As  a  psychological

construct, these scientists agree that religiosity  is  a

multi-dimensional phenomenon.  They view  religiosity  as

more  than  just  a  behavioural  manifestation  of   the

religion.   It  includes  both  intrinsic  and  extrinsic

commitments  to  the  religion.  It  is  thus  even  more

difficult  for those outside any community to  comprehend

that very complexity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Muslim community is put on the spotlight

and its members have struggled to explain variations that

exist  within the community itself.  Some have said  that

the  doctrines  are  there and  it  is  the  individual's

personal choice to follow for at the end of the  day,  it

is  between him and his Creator, while others believe  it

is  their  duty to ensure that those who steer  away  are

brought  back to the right path.  With so many  different

tenets  and  doctrines,  the  fundamental  question  that

arises  is  what makes one a good Muslim.   For  example,

what makes a wife beater, who piously prays five times  a

day but works irregularly and does not support the family

financially, more or less of a Muslim, compared to a non-tudung wearing single mother who works hard and struggles

to provide food on the table for her children?  Who is to

pass  judgment?   Muslims and non-Muslims should  refrain

from   making  judgments  about  individuals,  based   on

whatever criteria.  Perceptions are inevitably made  from

such judgment and, if not checked, these perceptions

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>

may  translate into prejudices and prejudiced behaviours.

To  facilitate interactions, especially cross-culturally,

we  should remain non-judgmental and learn to accept  the

person who he or she is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the spiritual vacuum experienced by members of

the  JI has been highlighted as one of the keys to  their

vulnerability.  Exploited to the extreme, they  are  told

that   to  be  a  good  Muslim  and  to  guarantee  their

afterlife,  they have to subscribe to jihad, even  if  it

means  hurting and sacrificing fellow Muslims.  The White

Paper  thus  calls  for  a self-regulating  mechanism  to

ensure that the likes of the JI members are not exploited

by religious teachers, like Ibrahim Maidin.  Sir, indeed,

some  scholars  have  argued  that  the  rise  of  global

religious revivalism is due to a spiritual vacuum created

due to modernisation and complex urban living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a more fundamental issue to this, ie, the

need   for  a  set  of  guidelines  that  perhaps  allows

religious  teachers to help Muslims  know  what  are  the

parameters  of  behaviours and expressions  of  religious

piety, within the context of a multi-racial society, that

gives them the assurance that they are indeed being  good

Muslims,  and practising the religion well,  as  much  as

they are being good citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs

yesterday noted that Muslims are duty-bound to contribute

towards the development of a good society.  Indeed,  this

is  part  of what being a good Muslim entails.  The  goal

for  each individual should be the betterment of  society

as  a  whole.  I am confident that every religion,  Islam

included, espouses towards this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in relation to the call for a self-regulating

mechanism,  I am heartened that the Muslim community  has

taken the recommendation positively.  Last night, a group

of  Muslim  residents, including a couple  of  grassroots

leaders,  came to see me to say that they would  like  to

register  the religious classes that are being  organised

in   their  neighbourhood.   I  welcome  their  voluntary

gesture and directed them to the mosque in the area which

is in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>

process of compiling a list of Muslim residents to  refer

to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been much call for the moderates in

the Muslim community to speak out and denounce terrorism.

Implicit  is for Muslims to exercise moderation  and  not

allow  extreme  elements  to take  over  the  community's

agenda.   Sir,  Islam  is about moderation.   The  Friday

sermon  of  17th  January this year,  just  last  Friday,

delivered   in   mosques  all  over   Singapore   clearly

emphasised  this point.  The Imam quoted the  Prophet  as

saying that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This religion (Islam) is a simple religion. And

should  anyone  make it rigid (by going to the  extremes)

the religion will eventually overcome him.'



He went on to explain:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Indeed to propel our community forward, we have to

be wise and tactful.  We must avoid coming near to any of

the  two  extremes.   At one end,  there  are  those  who

neglect religious duties, no prayers, no fasting, no good

moral  character,  and the list goes on.   On  the  other

hand,  there  are those who exaggerate the  teachings  of

Islam  and  promote chaos and disturbances wherever  they

are.   They  isolate  themselves, have  their  own  rigid

interpretations,  and plan for the demise  of  their  own

community.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same sermon, the Imam also highlighted the

role of the Muslim community, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The community of Islam must be exemplary. It must

set  the  highest  standards of performance  and  be  the

reference  point for others.  It must avoid excesses  and

extravagances  and  static rigidity  and  extremism.   To

strike  a  middle course of action, to be  steadfast  and

consistent, to know what to accept and what to reject, to

have principles and at the same time remain adaptable  is

probably  the  hardest test of the  human  character  and

social viability.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, Islam is about moderation and the

Muslim  community  is committed to upholding  this  value

steadfastly.   This  is  also  clearly  stated   in   the

statement  by  MUIS on the White Paper.  MUIS  urges  all

mosques,  Muslim organisations and the Muslim  public  to

uphold  the  true teachings of Islam and  its  values  of

moderation, tolerance and mutual respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we grapple with the

challenge of religious revivalism, we are confronted with

the issue of common spaces.  Where are these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>

common spaces?  What are the guidelines towards behaviour

in  these  common  spaces?   Essentially,  common  spaces

should  minimise  differences and maximise  commonalties,

that  is, a space where members share values, aspirations

and  motivations,  with  the  betterment  of  the  group,

community or society as a whole, as the desired  outcome.

These  are  universal values that should be  accepted  by

every  religion.   Thus, Muslims should feel  comfortable

that  being part of the common space does not  make  them

any  less  Muslim.  MUIS must take the  lead  in  helping

Muslims  in this regard.  There will always be  room  for

private spaces but we cannot remain in the private  space

alone.  We need to be part of the common space in a multi-racial and religious context, like Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as much as the White Paper has unequivocally

emphasised  that  the issue is about  terrorism  and  not

Islam, many in the community still feel that they are  in

the  spotlight  yet  again.   While  the  Malay  MPs  and

community  leaders continue to motivate the community  to

move  on  and  move forward, the process can  be  further

facilitated  by  members of the other communities.   Life

should go on and should not be affected by this incident.

The  other  communities  should also  assure  the  Muslim

community  that  they are still as comfortable  with  the

Muslims  as before.  If there should be any questions  or

doubts  that arise, they should be dealt with immediately

and  not  be  allowed to brew.  The Malay  MPs  have  met

members  of  the Chinese media and clan associations  and

are  heartened to note their continued understanding  and

support  for  the  Muslim  community.   The  channels  of

communication are open at the community level through the

IRCC or direct to the authorities, like MUIS, should  any

clarification be needed about the Muslim community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we started 2002 with the

news  of  the arrest of the first batch of JI operatives.

We  have  started 2003 debating on what we should  do  to

ensure  that  our  society continues to  function  amidst

these  serious threats and challenges.  I wonder  how  we

will start

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>

2004.  But however it may be, I am confident that we will

weather this storm together and come out of it as a  more

cohesive and resilient society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, in the last two days,

several MPs and the Minister for Home Affairs have spoken

of the need to break the silence on the JI and the threat

of terrorism.  The fervent encouragement to draw out both

Muslims  and  non-Muslims to engage in open dialogues  to

discuss  their  fears, suspicions and  aspirations  is  a

necessary phase in the healing process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a diverse people, our multi-racial society can

only  progress  to the next phase, if we can  bring  down

walls  and  dare  to bare our all to  one  another.   The

public  denouncement  of  the sins  of  the  arrested  JI

members  and  the  united  stand  taken  by  the   Muslim

community   and   our  Muslim  political  leadership   in

condemning the terrorist activities are reassuring to the

non-Muslims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a multi-racial society, we have thrived on

diversity  and  learned  to  create  unity  in  diversity

through  mutual  respect,  tolerance  and  trust.    Such

evergreen  and enduring values have guided the  different

racial groups through many crises and for as long as they

are  preserved  as our living code, I believe  they  will

continue to guide us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Indonesia, we saw the constant denial that

the  island states have terrorists in their midst,  right

up  to  the Bali bombings.  During the regime of Suharto,

although  more  stringent  measures  were  taken  against

Islamic  extremists, there was also a lid  put  to  avoid

mentioning names.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the timely release of the White Paper, three

daunting  questions  before  us  are:   would  democratic

political  decisions  be sufficient  to  stamp  out  such

clandestine  terrorist  activities?   Should  we  go  for

military  response  and how will  the  social  fabric  be

affected?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer these questions, we have to be clear that

the war against the terrorists

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>

and  JI is a war fought by all Singaporeans.  We have  to

be  aware of the threat terrorism poses, the need  to  be

vigilant  and  how as a people we must work  through  our

differences  to foster closer ties so as to  prevent  any

cleavage  in  our  social fabric  caused  by  those  with

ulterior motives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to touch on the threat of

terrorism  and  JI.  Sir, terrorism has reared  its  ugly

head  in Southeast Asia and Singapore has not been spared

as   two  groups  of  JI  terrorists  were  arrested  and

detained.  As recounted by some MPs before, these  groups

had  plotted  to bomb not only US interests in  Singapore

but also strategic local sites in a bid to foment discord

between Singapore and Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the JI activities were first made known in

December  2001,  Singaporeans had a rude awakening.   The

manifestations  of  their  terror  activities   and   the

discovery  that  these cells exist in our  midst  sent  a

chill down the spines of many Singaporeans.  Suddenly our

stable   business   environment  and  lucrative   tourist

industry are affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious concern is the fear of a bomb explosion

that  could  destabilise  our  infrastructure,  and   the

terrorists would have achieved its goal of creating chaos

and  animosity  in yet another icon of the  world.   This

fear  continues to haunt many Singaporeans, as  witnessed

by  their  public expressions that they avoid individuals

draped  entirely in robes and with slits  for  the  eyes.

Also,  places frequented by Caucasians, such  as  Holland

Village  and Boat Quay, are pegged danger areas by  these

fearful  Singaporeans.    Such emotions  in  Singaporeans

will  impact the social interaction amongst the different

racial groups.  Singaporeans need to be educated more  on

Islam  and  the practices of the Muslims.  Psychology  of

the  human  mind is such that when one knows little,  one

fears a lot; and that can be overcome through knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is that both Muslims and non-Muslims are living in fear and suspicion of one another.

The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>

Muslim  fraternity  feels that they are  under  scrutiny,

that they are being blocked out of many opportunities  in

getting a job, or a promotion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the non-Muslims who have been

constantly reminded to be more sensitive of their  Muslim

friends,  feel  that they have already accommodated  much

and that it is time for the Muslims to reciprocate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that we commence a series of PR

campaigns  to  inform, create awareness and  educate  the

public on how to deal with crisis, tense relationship and

forge common goals and identity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very nature of the JI terrorists is to break

society.  In response, all Singaporeans need to be closer

and stronger as fellow brothers and sisters.  This social

unity is vital.  Although we can have all the legislation

and security measures in place, cohesion and unity cannot

be  guaranteed.   All  it takes is a small  incident  and

another  similar strife at Ayodhya, India,  where  Hindus

and  Muslims  were  formerly living peacefully  together,

could erupt in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to touch on the need to be

prepared and be vigilant at all times.  The globalisation

of  terrorist activities meant that Singapore is  exposed

to a number of terrorist groups like the JI, Red Army and

Tamil Tigers.  Singaporeans must be aware that there  are

many, among us, who can be exploited by such groups.   We

need  to know who is who in the list as the numbers  grow

so that we can be vigilant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago, Business Times carried an article

on  the  courageous Balinese reaction to the bomb blasts.

I  think  the  actions of Bambang, a Balinese  of  Indian

descent and who is also a Hindu married to a Muslim, is a

fine example for non-Muslim Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an era where nothing is certain, we need to be

ready and have a prepared

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>

mindset for the worst so that when the worst does  occur,

we know what to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foremost in the minds of many Singaporeans is the

question:  why is it that it has taken the Government  so

long  to  present  the facts to the  public?   And,  more

importantly,  why  was  there no  earlier  detection  and

action  taken  to  nip the problem  in  the  bud  at  the

earliest  sign  of suspicion?  Were we not  playing  with

fire  when we did nothing to put off the sparks when they

were first detected?  Have we given a fair trial?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here, it is necessary to explain and reinforce

to  the  public that we could not apply the same criminal

proceedings  to solve the terrorism issue; otherwise,  we

would  never be able to comb through the whole JI network

in Singapore and disbanded two cells.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action taken in the ultimate has to be swift,

ie,  detention  without trial to terminate  mischief;  as

otherwise,  we could not have broken these terrorists  up

before  they  let  off  the  truck  bombs.   We  have  to

understand that Singapore is a high value target  despite

all measures taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I would like to touch on the way forward for

us.  Whilst the JI network in Singapore may seemingly  be

disrupted by the arrests of the JI terrorists and may not

pose an imminent threat, a larger looming concern is that

the insidious terrorist activities can actually undermine

the inter-ethnic peace and harmony that Singaporeans have

built  up  over the years.  It is important to  reinforce

the point raised in the White Paper - that the two groups

arrested  represent only a small, isolated group  of  the

larger  Muslim  population.  Their "sins" against  fellow

Singaporeans have no bearing on the other Muslims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I condemn the terrorist activities as "sins"

because  they were meant to be senselessly and  viciously

directed at the innocent and peace-loving Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we had witnessed the joyous outbursts of some

individual Muslims on the 9/11 incident, in the  case  of

the JI

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>

arrests,  the  JI  activities had  elicited  a  different

response from the Muslim community.  The Muslim community

has  openly condemned the JI agenda.  Such a stand  taken

by the Muslim community has given much reassurance to the

other  racial  groups  of the allegiance  of  our  Muslim

brothers and sisters to Singapore as a nation and  fellow

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim community as a whole will have to move

forward  to  play  the red alert and trigger  the  signal

whenever  they come across any deviant character.   As  a

community,  the Muslims must inculcate the resilience  to

bring to task the deviant Muslims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that this microscopic scrutiny of the

extremists  is  causing awkwardness and uneasiness  among

the  Muslims.  Efforts have been made to showcase  inter-racial and inter-religious harmony.  I was told that  for

many  on  the  ground,  they all  seem  over-zealous  and

artificial.   Scratch the surface layer a bit deeper  and

we will find tension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to dissipate such emotions is to encourage

more dialogues and sharing among the different racial and

religious groups.  I am encouraged by the sharing of  one

Malay  professional lady, in one recent feedback session,

and  she spoke openly about her feelings and asked:  what

is  it that the non-Muslims would like her to clarify for

them?  She explained the values and virtues of the Muslim

faith  and dispelled the notions that all clad-up Muslims

are suspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She commented that the increased religiosity among

Singaporean  Muslims is not an attempt at isolation.   In

fact,  it  is about being a better Muslim and that  meant

being  a  better  person and, in turn, a better  citizen.

She  also  spoke  of  being  more  warmly  treated  as  a

Singaporean while in Laos than when she is in  Singapore.

To  quote  her,  "Here, I am seen as a Malay Muslim  girl

first, and Singaporean as secondary".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My initial response to her observation was that all

visitors always feel like kings and queens because of the

special efforts

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>

that  the  host  would  accord to  them.   We  know  that

familiarity breeds contempt, and once you are used to one

another, you do away with formalities and niceties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on her comment further, I asked myself if

there  is  a  need  to revisit our often take-for-granted

attitude.  When there is a patch in a relationship to  be

mended,  it  is  good  to be aware of  the  need  to  re-establish these formalities and niceties, as such efforts

reassure   the  desire  to  want  to  work  out  positive

outcomes.   So,  perhaps, social groupings  should  begin

some refresher programmes on inter-relationship skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the grassroots organisations should start a

Conversation series in small groupings of not  more  than

30,  to  encourage  more sharing among  the  multi-racial

groupings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also dispel suspicion and avoid criticism

when  we  observe differences in practices.  For example,

we  should not see it as wrong if a Muslim woman does not

shake hands with her male colleague.  She is behaving  in

a  proper  manner as prescribed by her faith.  We  should

not be suspicious but be respectful of that.  In fact,  I

was told that conservative Indian ladies too do not shake

hands  with men.  We should take heart that we  are  far-removed from really knowing the practices of other  races

and religions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, we must have a ready mindset to embrace

and  learn from the experiences of others.  For  example,

the  Sikh  communities in the US had stepped  forward  to

talk  about  their faith in the light of  racial  attacks

after 9/11.  All Singaporeans could similarly do more  of

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bottom-up approach is the responsibility at the

individual  level  and must be the way to  move  forward,

complementing  the  top-down  approach  as  seen  in  the

setting-up of IRCCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans, including Members of this

Chamber, feel that the way to move ahead is not  to  have

more control and legislation, but to prevent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>

economic   and  social  disenfranchisement   among   some

minorities,  which  might  give  rise  to  more  would-be

terrorists.  I was told that many Malay taxi drivers have

been  relating the sad fate of fellow Muslims  finding  a

job, due to racial discrimination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, I would like to share that statistics from

the  Ministry of Manpower showed a "more or  less"  equal

distribution of the unemployed among the Malays,  Chinese

and   Indians.    Very  often,  it  is  a   question   of

competencies,  not race, that mattered in job  selection.

However,   we  have  to  note  that  the  perception   of

disenfranchisement, which might be contrary  to  reality,

takes  on  a  dose of reality itself when it is  repeated

enough.   And  there will always be people  who  wish  to

exploit this gap between perception and reality.  We need

to  remind  employers to be more open and transparent  in

their selection and hiring practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on managing inter-racial

harmony  at the workplace and creating more awareness  in

the institutions of learning on the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper is silent on how relationship

at   the  workplace  ought  to  be  managed.   Whilst   I

understand  that  employers and union leaders  are  being

briefed  on  the  White Paper, I am  concerned  that  the

operational people-managers and informal leaders  at  the

workplace  to-date have not received proper  guidance  on

how  to  deal  with sensitivities concerning  our  multi-racial workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casual approach towards the terrorist threat

adopted  at  work  so far has resulted  in  many  at  the

workplace taking the situation lightly.  This is  clearly

demonstrated by the few reported incidents of  bomb  hoax

at workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another disturbing observation is that some

individuals   at  the  workplace  are  taking   political

advantage  of the situation for their short-term  agenda.

We  are hearing more allegations of racial discrimination

in recruitment and promotion

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>

exercises.  This gets picked up and, rightly or  wrongly,

the sympathies go to the aggrieved party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here is where we want both employers and union

leaders to play their part to remind informal leaders  at

workplace to be quick to dispel such allusions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I speak this from a personal experience. Not

too  long  ago,  a colleague at work informed  me  of  an

incident  with the mother of a young Muslim  recruit  for

the  job of an apprentice.  She came to the workplace  to

sign  the Training bond as a guarantor for her son.   She

informed  the  executive attending to her, that  her  son

would  not be able to perform work every Friday  from  12

noon  to  3  pm  because  of prayers.   In  response,  my

colleague  advised that the job could not  accommodate  a

long  break of three hours and that it would be good  for

her son to rethink about the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to acknowledge that the workplace is

common  ground  for all.  It is sometimes  difficult  for

employers to draw a line between accommodating employees'

requirements and getting the job done.  This is not about

marginalising the minority race, but the need to preserve

common identity in a common place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for the community at large to

know that selection and promotion are guided by criteria,

and if applicants do not qualify, it is because they have

not  met  with  the  criteria and not because  of  racial

discrimination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my colleagues before me, I would like to

comment  on  my hon. colleague, Mr Shanmugam's  statement

about  "a small measure of affirmative action" to  enable

more  Malays  to occupy important posts.  I am  happy  to

note  that,  in this instance, our system has been  doing

that for the latter, starting from the highest office  in

Singapore.   We  had a Malay President  in  Yusof  Ishak.

There  are  also other top positions in both the  private

and Government sectors held by Malays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of Dr Tan Cheng Bock's rejection of the

suggestion of marginalisation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>

of   Muslims,  I  would  like  to  point  out  here  that

everything else being equal, it is important that, in the

final  analysis, when picking a candidate for a position,

it   goes  beyond  considerations  of  meritocracy.    In

reality, factors that align the affinity of the candidate

to the job and the people around are just as important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in connection with promoting inter-racial

harmony at the workplace, I would like to propose  for  a

series  of awareness programmes on how to deal  with  the

sensitivities  of  the  multi-racial  workforce  at   the

workplace.   In  fact, to begin with, I am  proposing  to

incorporate  a Certificate and Diploma module  on  inter-racial  relationship  in  Human Resource  and  Industrial

Relations  programmes  so  that  people-managers,   union

leaders  and,  subsequently, the workforce, will  acquire

the  necessary  knowledge and skills  to  deal  with  one

another more sensitively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in order to make these programmes

accessible, I hope that the Skills Development Fund (SDF)

would  consider  giving  these programmes  the  necessary

funding  so  that companies will be more  ready  to  send

their employees.  More importantly, we want to bring home

the point that 9/11 and the subsequent arrests of the  JI

members  have  certainly changed our  modus  operandi  at

work.   And  multi-racial  relationship  management  must

become the core curriculum at the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the workplace, we should also look at the

schools,  JCs  and tertiary institutions.  The  terrorist

issue  and  threat of the JI are here to stay.   The  3Gs

will  be  living  with this threat and  all  the  related

sensitivities.   This is a special  group  that  we  must

garner  to  understand and appreciate  what  the  JI  and

terrorist threats are all about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge for schools to initiate discussion on

the  White  Paper.   It needs special  study  in  the  GP

curriculum.  With a good appreciation of the complexities

of  the matter, our 3Gs would be better prepared to  deal

with the issues that threaten us.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, going forward. We should no longer be

moaning  over  whose responsibility it is  to  drive  the

unity  of  Singaporeans, but rather as Singaporeans,  how

and  what should we do to ensure the strengthening of our

social fabric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have boldly and clearly clarified that

Malay/Muslims  are not marginalised, we must  make  every

effort  to  erase such notions and talks.   Efforts  must

come  from both Muslims and non-Muslims.  We could  learn

from  the constant mutual assurances between the  Muslims

and non-Muslims in the UK.  We should also heed the words

of  US  President George Bush, "Islam is  a  religion  we

accept, but not Al-Qaeda".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Sir, similarly, we should also heed these

words.   If  an individual is not promoted  to  a  higher

position,  or selected for a post, it is because  he  did

not  meet  the  criteria needed for  the  post,  and  not

because of race.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion standing in

the  name  of the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Wong  Kan

Seng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper clearly sets out the history

and  the  nature of the threat of terrorism in Singapore.

It  also  recommends bold initiatives to deal  with  this

threat.    Many   of  us  have  assumed  that   terrorist

activities in Singapore only started in 2001,  after  the

September 11 attack on the World Trade Center and that it

has  ended  with the recent arrests of the JI  activists.

The  White  Paper  shows  us  otherwise.   Terrorism   in

Singapore dates back a long way and it is far from  being

eliminated.   It is a deep-rooted problem.  It  threatens

the  stability and security of our society.  It needs  to

be  addressed  thoroughly and seriously.   On  the  other

extreme, there are also people who are paranoid  and  see

terrorists  everywhere.  There is no need  to  over-react

and,  as  a result, strain inter-relations.  We  need  to

have a balanced approach.  The White Paper is, therefore,

a timely document that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>

provides some guidelines for dealing with this issue.  It

also  reminds  us  that terrorism is a  problem  for  all

Singaporeans.   Government's efforts alone  will  not  be

enough.   We  must work together to deal  with  it  as  a

united people

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the three key recommendations set out

in the paper, ie, to enhance security measures, to police

the threat of terrorism and to strengthen social cohesion

and  religious harmony.  These are the three  pillars  of

our  counter-terrorism strategy.  I would like  to  share

some of my views and suggestions in this respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I agree with Mdm Ho Geok Choo that we must

be   prepared.   We  must  prepare  our  people  for  the

eventuality  of an actual terrorist attack in  Singapore.

Sir,  I  am fully confident of the effectiveness  of  our

security  measures  and the capability  of  our  security

agencies  to  manage  and minimise the  terrorist  risks.

However,  we must not and cannot afford to be complacent.

We  must recognise that there is a possibility, remote as

it  may  be,  that  a terrorist incident  could  actually

happen  in Singapore.  As documents released recently  by

the  Ministry  of  Home Affairs have shown,  had  we  not

caught the JI terrorists in time, a major incident  could

have  taken  place.   If  and  when  this  happens,   the

psychological impact on our people could far outstrip the

physical  impact  of the incident.  More importantly,  it

could create a rift among Singaporeans of different races

and religions.  It could threaten the cohesiveness of our

society.  The multi-racial and multi-religious society we

have  so painstakingly built over the last 30 years could

easily  be  destroyed overnight.  If  this  happens,  the

terrorists   would  have  achieved  their  objective   of

destabilising the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that other than enhancing physical

security  measures,  we need to also prepare  our  people

psychologically  in  the  event  that  an  incident  does

happen.  To do this, I would like to urge the Ministry of

Home  Affairs  to  consider a public education  programme

aimed at informing our people what they ought to do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>

and  what  they  ought  not to do in such  eventualities.

This  is  no  different from our effort  to  prepare  our

people in Total Defence.  The recent bomb hoax at Holland

Village  is an example of how an ill-informed public  may

be  used  to  propagate damaging rumours that  may  cause

panic among Singaporeans.  Therefore, being well-informed

is   a   crucial  element  of  our  preparedness  against

terrorist  attacks.   For  example,  we  must  constantly

remind  our  people that should an incident happen,  they

should  not  panic  and should not  jump  to  conclusions

prematurely.  We should also remind them not  to  aid  in

propagating   unverified  rumours  or   to   inform   the

authorities  when they become aware of such rumours.   Of

course,  this  needs to be done carefully so  as  not  to

create unnecessary fear among our people.  The key is  to

let  them  know  what to expect and what is  expected  of

them.   This way, they would be psychologically  prepared

and  would not be caught by surprise.  The impact of  any

incident can then be better managed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we need to strengthen the resilience of

our  people,  especially the younger generation,  against

distorted  teachings.  The White Paper showed that  among

those  arrested, all, except two, are of average or above

average   intelligence.   They  are   not   ignorant   or

destitute.   They  are fully aware of their  actions  and

deadly  serious about their missions.  What  disturbs  me

most  is  the ability of the terrorist network to attract

intelligent people and sometimes respectable  members  of

our  society  to  join  in their  cause.   Investigations

showed that one of the recruitment techniques used by the

JI   network  is  through  seemingly  innocent  religious

classes.   These classes have far-reaching  influence  on

the  impressionable  minds of our  younger  Singaporeans.

The teachers abuse the trust and betray the confidence of

their  students.   Then  they bind  their  recruits  with

threats  of  infidelity  if they choose  to  leave  their

organisation.  Such techniques are frightfully similar to

those  used by secret societies in the past.   The  long-term  solution to terrorist threats is to find a  way  to

disrupt  their  recruitment process.  I believe  that  we

must deal with the root of the issue.  We must strengthen

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans' resilience against recruitment  efforts  by

the  terrorist network and we must do so right  from  the

start, among our younger Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, I would like to suggest that we

revise and update our school curriculum, for example,  in

the  National  Education  Programme,  to  include  issues

relating to terrorism.  Young Singaporeans must be taught

the values of social cohesion and religious harmony.   We

must  inculcate  in  them  the  basic  values  of  mutual

respect,   mutual   tolerance  and   mutual   acceptance,

regardless  of race and religion.  These values  must  be

transformed  from academic knowledge into a way  of  life

for   all  Singaporeans.   This  way,  when  our  younger

Singaporeans come across teachings that do not conform to

these  basic values, they would then be able to  question

the basis of such teachings rather than being taken in by

their  emotional appeal.  If they have been  taught  from

young that it is wrong to take away lives, they will then

have  strong moral courage to resist the call to be  part

of  a terrorist plan to kill innocent people.  Therefore,

I  would  like to urge the Ministry to work closely  with

the   Ministry  of  Education  to  review  our   National

Education Programme for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to strengthen religious harmony and foster

greater  mutual understanding and acceptance, we need  to

create  more channels for communication among the various

ethnic  and religious groups.  We cannot deny  that  many

differences do exist among different religious and ethnic

groups.    To   do   so  is  being  unrealistic.    These

differences  are a result of our cultural  heritage,  our

life  experiences and our religious beliefs.  Even within

the same religious group, there are differences.  I am  a

Christian.     There  are  many  different  denominations

within  the  Christian  faith,  with  varying  practices.

Similarly,  among  the  Chinese,  there  are  also   many

different dialect groups - Teochew, Hokkien, Cantonese  - some  do not even talk to one another.  However,  on  the

other  hand,  there exist many similarities  among  these

different  groups.  We share the same land, we share  the

same  community,  we  share  the  same  consequences   if

terrorism

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>

is  allowed to grow in Singapore.  Many of the  potential

conflicts  stem  from the lack of understanding  of  each

other.   Such  misunderstanding,  if  not  resolved,  may

eventually   lead   to  distrust  and   eventually   even

animosity.  To avoid this, we must acknowledge and accept

the   differences,  but  emphasise  and  build   on   the

similarities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Inter-Racial Confidence

Circles is a good start.  Perhaps it would be useful  for

the  Ministry  of  Community Development  and  Sports  to

consider  organising  more regular  dialogues  among  the

various  groups at the national level.  For  example,  we

could consider an annual forum where leaders from various

religious  groups,  as well as grassroots  organisations,

can  gather  to  share their views and  concerns.   There

could  be  open sessions as well as closed-door sessions.

This  will provide a platform for sensitive issues to  be

discussed  and differences to be resolved in  an  orderly

manner.   It will also provide an opportunity for greater

interaction among the leaders and, hopefully,  this  will

lead  to greater understanding and tolerance.  This forum

can  also be used as a platform for the religious leaders

to  proclaim  statements on their stand  with  regard  to

religious  harmony.  Such proclamation will  serve  as  a

constant  reminder and a useful guide for the  respective

believers  and followers.  This forum can also  become  a

symbol, an icon, of our commitment to social cohesion and

racial harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we debate in this House

how to tackle the threat of terrorism, we must not forget

to  recognise  the  good  work put  in  by  our  security

agencies.   The  Home  Team,  in  particular,   must   be

applauded for the effective intelligence they managed  to

gather  and the swift and decisive actions that followed.

It is through their relentless efforts that our homes are

safe from the terrorists and we can all sleep soundly  at

night.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I support the motion to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>

endorse the recommendations proposed in the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take this very serious topic in a more light-hearted manner. There were two families staying in the

same  block  of  flats and they did not interact  between

themselves, not even greeting each other when they met in

the  lift.   One night, they were laughing, cheering  and

even   held  each  other's  hands  in  jubilation.   Why?

Because   the  Brazil  soccer  team,  which   they   both

supported,  had  won  the  World  Cup.  So,  this  common

interest of theirs had bridged the gap between them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me touch on Part V of the White Paper on

strengthening social cohesion and religious harmony. Over

the  years,  the Government has been promoting  religious

harmony  and as a result our people are living in harmony

here  in  Singapore.   In  order to  enhance  our  mutual

understanding, we have to first learn and understand  the

differences  among  us,  so that  we  would  be  able  to

accommodate, tolerate and live with each other.  However,

we  are  a multi-racial and multi-religious society.   In

order  to  enhance  our cohesion,  I  think  it  is  more

important  that  we  recognise our similarities  than  to

emphasise  our differences. There may be some competition

between  a hawker who sells apples and another who  sells

oranges,   although  the  fruits  they  sell  are   quite

different. But when someone advocates that it  is  better

to eat vegetables than to  eat fruits,  I am sure the two

fruit  sellers will take a common stand and be united  to

argue otherwise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from knowing and understanding the activities

of  the  terrorists,  I think we should  use  our  common

interest  to  enhance social cohesion.  In  our  society,

which  is  multi-racial and multi-religious, undoubtedly,

we  need  to examine the differences between the  various

ethnic  groups.  But let us not forget that we have  many

things  in  common too! For example, we  are  all  peace-loving  people, we love our family, we love  our  country

and,  at  the same time, we like to celebrate the various

festivals.  Whether you are a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>

Christian, a Buddhist, a Hindu or a Muslim, you would pay

a lot of attention to our respective ethnic and religious

festivals.   Just  as  we  enjoy our  reunion  dinner  on

Chinese New Year's Eve, our fellow citizens of the  other

ethnic    groups    enjoy   their   respective    festive

celebration.  However,  the joy and  happiness  of  these

festivals are not confined to our own community  only.  I

am  sure  you have this experience.  During Hari Raya  or

Deepavali,   you  would  have  your  Malay   and   Indian

neighbours knocking  at your door and offering you  their

traditional  delicious kuehs and  tid-bits.   During  the

Chinese  New Year festivities, they may also turn  up  at

your  flat to wish you Happy New Year and enjoy your  new

year goodies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christmas, Deepavali, Hari Raya and Chinese New

Year  light-ups  are enjoyed by everyone,  not  just  the

individual  community. I am sure  all  of  us  enjoy  the

festive  mood. So, let us all live happily and peacefully

together.  There are differences between us, but  let  us

look   more   at  our  similarities  and  less   at   our

differences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that we periodically

and  systematically create this kind of festive mood  for

our  people. This is particularly useful in  our   multi-racial society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A foreign friend once told me that racial harmony in

Singapore  is not bad.  But there seems to be a  lack  of

communication and exchanges among the different cultures.

Everyone seems to be living in their own quarters with no

feeling  for  other  communities.   He  may  be   a   bit

exaggerating,  but it is true that quite  a  lot  of  our

people  are  not  showing interest and  concern  for  the

happenings  in the other communities. We should  try  and

encourage  our  people to seek and get  into  the  common

space  among  us.  When  we are  faced  with  a  cultural

conflict,  the more common points that we have discovered

among  us,  the  easier  it would  be  to  iron  out  the

differences  among  us.   So, if more  opportunities  are

created   for  us  to  celebrate  the  various  festivals

together, it would be useful for us to resolve the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>

differences,  if any.  We should learn to appreciate  our

counterparts   in   the  other  communities   for   their

contributions to our nation building, and make it a point

to show such appreciation.  There could be more exchanges

among the various cultures through various campaigns, get-togethers  and even through the media.  This  will  go  a

long way to enhance our social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, allow me to present my views on some of the

other  points  in  the  White Paper.   The  organisation,

planning  and  scheming of the terrorists  right  at  our

doorstep  are real and serious.  We should  also  have  a

long-term  plan to counter such threat to  our  security.

These  terrorist activities, if successful, would  impact

not  only  our  present generation, but also  our  future

generations.  So, we should bring this White Paper to the

schools   and   include  its  contents  to   the   school

curriculum,  according to the educational levels  of  the

students.   We  could  simplify the  contents,  even  use

cartoons  or comics to teach our students, so  that  they

would  also  know  and understand the activities  of  the

terrorists.   One  day,  if  we  were  to  encounter   an

unfortunate incident in Singapore, then our people  would

be psychologically prepared to face them, and would  have

better  understanding  and tolerance  among  our  various

ethnic groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Muslim compatriots in Singapore are just as

peace  loving  as we are.  We know that. Whether  we  are

Malay, Indian or Chinese, we should trust one another and

be  united  to  fight  our  foreign  intruders  together.

Otherwise,  we would fall into the hands of  our  foreign

intruders.  Let us settle all our differences through our

similarities  and  common space.  Let us  be  united  and

build  up our common aspirations, common wishes to settle

the differences in our society so that we can have better

mutual tolerance, thereby enhancing our social cohesion.

doubt that many in this House may inadvertently feel that

they are suffering from an overdose of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>

the  debate  on  terrorism.  Many of the statements  made

would,  by  now, have a familiar ring tone.  Nonetheless,

even at the risk of sounding like a broken record, I feel

compelled to lend my voice to this chorus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since as MP of a constituency, I feel duty-bound to

residents  of the community I represent on a  subject  of

such  critical  importance.  I  therefore  beg  for  your

indulgence, Sir, and Members of this House as I  give  my

response to the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion speaks of countering the terrorist

threat in a three-fold manner, like by enhancing security

measures,  by  policing  the  spread  of  terrorism   and

extremist  ideology,  and  by  strengthening  our  social

cohesion  and  religious harmony.  Like my  parliamentary

colleagues who have spoken before me, let me say, at  the

outset,   that   I  support  this  motion   because   the

consequences of terrorism, if left unchecked,  are  grave

and unimaginable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the Government for having the moral

courage  to table this motion to debate the White  Paper,

even  though  it  may  once again  put  our  Malay/Muslim

community  under  the spotlight.  It is unfortunate,  but

not  unprecedented.  Recall the anguish  felt  among  the

Chinese community at the chauvinistic tactics employed by

Tang  Liang  Hong, two elections ago.  Each time,  issues

like  the Chinese Language, or Nantah, are brought up  in

its various forms, a raw nerve is struck.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, like many of my parliamentary

colleagues  before me, urge all Malay/Muslim Singaporeans

to  view  this debate positively.  It is not intended  to

highlight the Malay/Muslim community's deficiencies,  but

to  air the issues in a calm and rational manner so that,

collectively, we may find solutions to the problems  that

confront  us all.  It is a mark of our nation's  maturity

that  we  can  openly  and honestly discuss  issues  like

these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, over the last two days, my

parliamentary colleagues have freely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>

brought  and  frankly  discussed  numerous  awkward   and

sensitive  issues  relating to race and  religion.   This

attests   to   our  confidence  with  the   majority   of

Singaporeans  with  regard to such  potentially  divisive

issues.  It also reflects our beliefs in the strengths of

our  inter-racial ties which have been painstakingly  and

deliberately cultivated over the last three decades.   It

is  an  affirmation  that  the majority  of  Singaporeans

believe  in our multi-racial and multi-religious  compact

and that they are moderate in their practice of religion,

not  just  Muslims,  but Buddhists, Taoists,  Christians,

Hindus and others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Economist in its November-December 2002 issue

aptly commented:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Secrecy and centralisation are useful watchwords in

a  conventional war ..  But if the war against  terrorism

is  going  to  last  for years, the governments  need  to

mobilise  their people.  The way to do that is  to  treat

them  as  adults  and  give them as much  information  as

possible  without compromising sources of intelligence  - even if this does cause a few sleepless nights.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now offer my own perspectives on the

responses we need to take to combat the terrorist threat.

I  suggest a four-pronged approach to JI, three of  which

echo  what  the  White  Paper proposes.   The  conceptual

framework  is  that  of a series of enlarging  concentric

circles, with widening application and impact.  These are

the   four  P's  of  pre-emption  of  terrorist  strikes;

propagation   of  Islamic  truth;  progression   of   the

Malay/Muslim community; and promotion of inter-ethnic and

religious harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, pre-emption of terrorist strikes. At the

centre  of  the  series of circles are the hard  security

measures   we  need  to  take  to  prevent  and  pre-empt

terrorist  strikes.  We need to improve the  security  of

key installations and targets.  We need to tighten border

controls.  We need to choke off funds meant for financing

terrorism.   We  need to have superior  intelligence  and

surveillance against the "super-terrorism" we are facing.

I   am   comforted   that  the  Government   has   stated

unequivocally in the White Paper that it has taken these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>

steps  and  more  to  harden Singapore against  terrorist

infiltration and attacks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government not to let up on these

security  measures  as  they  give  the  population   and

investors alike assurance that Singapore is clearly among

the  safest  destination  in  the  region.   Indeed,  the

international community working in Singapore  viewed  the

arrests  as  evidence of an effective security  apparatus

that  gives investors confidence in our country's ability

to thwart all manner of threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been murmurings about the long jams at

the  Tuas and Woodland Checkpoints.  But I strongly feel,

and  I gather that many other Singaporeans also, that the

strict   border  checks  should  not  be  relaxed.    The

resulting inconvenience is but a small price to  pay  for

our social, economic and political security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our homeland security lattice, no matter

how  sophisticated, can only do so much, because the  Al-Qaeda  threat is global, and therefore the front  against

terrorism must likewise be global.  Our neighbours,  with

some  of  whom  we have occasional tiffs,  are  similarly

victims of terrorist attacks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that Southeast Asia nations will be able

to put aside our differences to confront the common enemy

that can wreak havoc on our very existence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, propagation of Islamic truth. It has been

said  that  the  war on terrorism is 95% ideological  and

only  5% military.  There is a Chinese proverb that says,

zhan  cao chu gen.  We need to remove the sinister  roots

from  which  the  terrorist tree grows and  cut  off  the

supply  of  new  recruits.  We need a counter-propaganda,

not  of  half-truth and twisted teachings that sowed  the

seeds  of  JI.   We need to debunk the myth  that  "true"

Islam  equals  fundamentalist and militant  Islam.   This

will not be easy.  Because, Islam, like Christianity,  is

by  nature  monotheistic, preaching one way to salvation.

Fiery   itinerant  Islamic  teachers  and   mullahs,   if

unchallenged  and  unfettered, may not  be  teaching  the

correct interpretation of their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>

faith  and,  indeed, even mislead people  into  believing

that jihad and martyrdom is the one-way ticket to heaven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some influential western scholars, like Samuel

Huntington,  have taken a pessimistic view  that  Islamic

teaching  has  no  room for pluralism.   Instead,  Muslim

communalism will grow and lead to inter-religious  strife

and  eventual  Balkanization, that is, disintegration  of

the   nation  state  along  religio-ethnic  lines.   That

conception  cannot and should not remain unchallenged  by

Muslims  in Singapore.  Otherwise, we risk the return  to

the  dark days of communal strife and the undoing of what

our founding fathers have fought so hard to accomplish  - the  establishment  of  a  multi-racial,  multi-religious

Singapore.   Therefore, the Malay/Muslim  community  must

affirm the moderate non-sectarian nature of Islam and the

nation-building role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that, in recent days, shortly

after  the  release of the JI White Paper, many religious

leaders and organisations from the Muslim community  have

come  forward to state their stand, and argue  for  self-governance,  and  to take the necessary steps  to  ensure

that itinerant teachers and self-styled mullahs will  not

be  permitted to propagate heretical teaching and  poison

the   minds  of  our  younger  Muslims.   I  think   this

proactive, firm and united stand has done much  to  allay

any anxieties and prejudices the non-Muslim community may

have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, progression of the Malay/Muslim community.

Sir,  the  White Paper has noted that the JI  network  in

Singapore  comprised generally people  with  average,  or

above average, intelligence, and who cannot be classified

as  being  socially disadvantaged.  Yet, one cannot  deny

that  the  risk  of being influenced by the  JI  movement

could  be  greater  among  the  weaker  members  of   the

Malay/Muslim community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large issue facing us then is how to bring

further  economic and social progress to this  community,

in particular, to the weaker members of the community, so

that they do not feel left behind in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2328</b></font><br><br>

this  age of rapid gobalisation and technological  change

and, therefore, become easier prey to deviant teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I am keenly aware of the sensitivity faced

when we raise this question among our Muslim friends.  My

parliamentary colleague, Mr Shanmugam, has spoken of this

on  Monday.  The reality is that each race has its  share

of members who lag behind their compatriots, economically

and  socially.   Sir,  I  am not  suggesting  affirmative

action.   So,  in  this  sense,  I  am  not  even  mildly

heretical.   In  fact,  I do not think  that  affirmative

action  is  necessary at all.  This is  because,  as  the

Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs has noted, the Malay

community in Singapore has, in many ways, made  its  mark

in our society.  It has also been making great strides in

closing  any  gap with the other communities.   For  this

reason,  I think what is needed is for self-help  groups,

like  Mendaki, to press on with their efforts, especially

to  raise the educational attainments and quality of life

of the weaker members of the Malay/Muslim community, thus

further  uplifting and achieving higher overall  averages

for  the community.  Other self-help groups, such as CDAC

and  SINDA, could also work together with Mendaki towards

this  end,  as an added, tangible sign of solidarity  and

unity among the different races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, promoting social and ethnic-religious

harmony.   At the largest circumference of the  strategic

framework  for tackling JI is the need to enhance  social

harmony  among  the various ethnic and religious  groups.

Sir,  the need to do so is really unquestionable.  Social

and  religious harmony are seeds that must be sown in all

areas  of  public life in Singapore - schools, workplaces

and  communities.  The national schools,  in  particular,

are undoubtedly the crucible for multi-racial living.  We

must teach our children to be colour blind, and celebrate

harmony  amidst diversity.  More activities  designed  to

promote  racial and religious harmony should be  planned.

For  instance,  there  could be more designated  projects

related  to  our  cultural and religious diversity  where

students of different races are required to work together

in groups.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage and create opportunities for

students of different races to interact and make  friends

with  each  other  from as young an age as  possible;  in

fact, from pre-school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to watch out for the unwitting

formation  of  enclaves  in  schools  because  groups  of

students  may unconsciously clique and engage each  other

in   a  particular  language,  and  thus  could  alienate

students  of other races, who may otherwise feel  out  of

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is natural for people of the same colour to

congregate.   We  do  so overseas to gain  a  measure  of

security and for purposes of identification.  But,  doing

so  in  Singapore, could also raise social  barriers  and

hamper more meaningful inter-racial interaction.  Certain

sports,  like basketball or sepak takraw, tend to attract

participation  from specific groups in schools.   Without

restricting  choice, schools must make  every  effort  to

complement  such  propensities  for  specific  groups  to

coalesce  around  certain sports and  games,  with  other

activities that have wider appeal to all races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, grassroots organisations and

grassroots  leaders  must likewise be  committed  to  the

multi-racial ideal in planning activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commonly observed that Malays are under

represented  in grassroots organisations.  The  non-Malay

community,   especially  the  Chinese  majority,   should

redouble  their  efforts  to  reach  out  to  the   Malay

community  and  make them feel comfortable.   They  would

have  to get rid of any residual practices and prejudices

they  may have, which may hinder Malays from joining  the

grassroots  organisations and cause them  to  concentrate

almost exclusively on their own mosque-based activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, though the incidence of this today

could  be  considerably lower than before, I do  hear  of

complaints from the non-Chinese community that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2330</b></font><br><br>

some   grassroots  organisations  still   conduct   their

meetings    in   Chinese,   without   formally   offering

translations  in  the other languages.   There  are  also

complaints that some non-Muslim grassroots leaders  still

remain  insensitive to the Muslim's food requirements  at

functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These perceived prejudices, if unchecked, could

drive a wedge between the Malay/Muslim community, already

forced  into an uncomfortable period of introspection  by

the  JI  events  and  the  other  races,  especially  the

Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having Singaporeans of different races and religion

dining  together  and  visiting each  other's  places  of

worship   is   definitely  a  good   start   to   greater

understanding  of the different races and  religion.   In

fact,  when I was in Florida last December, I read,  with

some  satisfaction  in the local newspaper,  that  in  an

attempt to imbue greater understanding about Americans of

different religions, the Muslim organisations in  Florida

are  initiating visits to different places of worship for

Americans  of  all  creed.  However, attempts  to  foster

greater  understanding and confidence among the different

races  and  religions clearly cannot stop at this  rather

symbolic  and significant superficial level.   Confidence

and  trust in a person can only be built when we  get  to

know  each other personally, and the best way to  achieve

this  is through working with each other.  Hence, at  the

community  level,  we must encourage  more  residents  of

different races and religions to come forward to work  on

community projects together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in my constituency, Malay and non-Malay grassroots leaders admitted that they have come to

understand  each other much better after working  closely

together  on a New Year Charity Lunch project  for  needy

residents  of  all  races, where they personally  had  to

prepare  lunch  for  the  residents.   There  were   some

tensions in the first year when they organised the lunch,

as   the   non-Muslims  did  not  fully  appreciate   the

requirements  of  the Muslims regarding food  preparation

and  cooking.  They felt that the Muslims were just being

difficult and uncompromising.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2331</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, which is the second time they are

organising the lunch, the tension has dissipated, through

greater  understanding and a give-and-take attitude,  and

now  there is even greater rapport and camaraderie as the

different races work together for the common good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, I urge all Singaporeans to

extend  common  courtesies to one another, especially  to

those  of other races, since as a friend of mine quipped,

"Inadvertently, in a multi-racial society like ours, each

of  us  is an ambassador of our own race."  For instance,

HDB  flat dwellers, and even office workers, who  are  in

the  lift  together,  can smile  and  greet  each  other,

instead  of  staring  at the floor,  at  the  lift  floor

indicator,  or worse of all, at the ceiling, which  seems

to be the lift habit of most Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Code of Religious Harmony

proposed by the Prime Minister as a means to highlight to

all   religious  leaders  that  peace  on  earth  is  not

incompatible with peace in heaven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the IRCC and Harmony Circles will need to

continue their efforts to promote understanding and inter-religious   or,   as   some  one   has   termed,   inter-civilisational dialogue.  Such dialogue can  be  expanded

from   the  conventional  ones  of  philosophy,  history,

culture and those in the humanities, to other aspects  of

human  life,  since Islam is concerned with the  complete

way of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, a truly meaningful common action agenda

among  the  various ethnic and religious  groups  can  be

formulated  and  carried out in the near future  for  the

betterment of all men, women and children, regardless  of

the  colour of their skin or the religious headgear  they

wear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, as the Minister for Home Affairs

has noted, some Singaporeans have questioned if we should

keep  revisiting this subject; if it might not be  better

to  go  about  our  daily lives, rather  than  inevitably

putting the spotlight on the Malay/Muslim community  each

time  we  talk  about September 11, the  JI  arrests  and

terrorism.  They fear that this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>

incessant   reminder   could  instead   become   negative

reinforcement.  However, as noted by Rohan Gunaratna, the

battle  against terrorism has barely just begun.   It  is

likely  to be a persistent flu bug that is hard to  shake

off and, if left alone to fester, could turn fatal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial and religious harmony, as history and

experience  have shown, is not a natural phenomenon.   It

is  far  more natural for people of the same skin colour,

creed  and  language,  to  feel  an  affinity  and   thus

congregate.  Hence, we must continue to actively  promote

social harmony among Singaporeans of different races  and

religions in response to the terrorist challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this multi-religious and multi-ethnic ecosystem

we  currently  have is man-made, as with many  things  in

Singapore, we must continue to maintain and improve  upon

it.   Left alone unattended, it will start to fall  apart

if  extremism starts to gnaw at its seams.  The reminders

and  debate  about  the  dangers  of  allowing  extremist

elements into our shores must therefore continue, as  the

battle  is  far from over and is likely to  be  long  and

arduous.   Furthermore, this battle is not a conventional

battle.   It  is a contest over ideologies,  over  values

and,  therefore, must be fought on all fronts  and  would

require  the  help of every Singaporean - yellow,  brown,

black or white.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I wholeheartedly support the

motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore prides itself as an open economy. It is

an  undeniable  fact that we have prospered  and  got  to

where  we  are  today by being a very open society.   Our

people  had moved ahead by assimilating the best  of  the

East  and the West.  Whether it is the best practices  in

business,  technology,  the  arts  or  fashion,  we  have

learned,  absorbed, and localised it into something  that

is  distinctly Singapore.  But, as with all things,  with

an  open  economy, we take in both the good and the  bad.

While it was sobering to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2333</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans  to  learn  of  global  terrorism,  it   was

shocking to discover that the brand of militant Islam has

infiltrated into our region, and into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper has so clearly put forth that

certain  members of our citizenry have been indoctrinated

with these virulent teachings.  They saw no contradiction

between living in a prosperous and harmonious society  of

ours,  while  serving  in  a militant  group  that  would

destroy  any society and anyone that does not believe  in

their brand of religion.  In their pursuit of achieving a

supra-national  goal,  they  are  prepared  to  sacrifice

lives,   regardless  of  race  or  religion.   They   are

dangerous  people who could, in just one act of violence,

destroy  what  several generations  of  Singaporeans  had

built  and  achieved.   We stand to  lose  a  lot.   They

threaten  our  way of life and threaten the open  society

which  is vital for Singapore's prosperity.  We stand  to

lose  the confidence of international investors.   As  we

make  Singapore  into a more diversified  and  knowledge-based  economy,  all  the more we  need  to  attract  the

foreign talents and investments.  Many jobs are dependent

on the stability and the continued assurance of stability

in  Singapore.   Our  pillar of  inter-racial  trust  and

tolerance that has served us so well - all races  working

together  towards  the  goal of a  meritocratic  society,

equal   opportunities  for  all,   an   upward   mobility

irrespective  of  our  current  station  in  life  -   is

threatened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in essence, we stand to lose

the future for our children.  It is a shock that Al-Qaeda

linked  elements are in our midst.  So, we must send  the

message,  far  and  wide, down to every  level,  reaching

every member of the Singapore family, the severity of the

issue  confronting  us.   Whilst the  initial  shock  and

disbelief  may  have diminished over time, this  security

issue, and the implications, cannot be brushed aside  and

wished away.  Many Singaporeans still think it will  just

go  away.  Well, it is not a sudden apparition that would

disappear  with the blink of an eye.  As the White  Paper

has traced the origins, this strain of terrorism

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2334</b></font><br><br>

has   mutated   and  festered  around  the   region   and

contaminated our shores a decade ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we may have crippled the in-country JI cells,

the  region  around  us continues to  remain  hotbeds  of

terrorism.   While  some  governments  are  hampered   by

domestic agenda, others continue to offer sanctuaries  to

these  terrorists,  and the sources  of  this  fanaticism

continue  to  provide the spiritual,  organisational  and

financial  support  to  continue  to  subvert  legitimate

governments and societies, Singapore cannot let its guard

down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot ring-fence Singapore. As such, I believe

it  is  time to impress on one and all that in  order  to

keep terrorism away from our shores, it requires each and

every one of us to do our part.  As a people, we must  be

prepared to take the long-term view and take the measures

to  ensure  that we preserve the society, as we  know  it

now.   Let  us not delude ourselves that there are  quick

fixes  or, worse, believe that the issue has been  fixed.

As  a  phenomenon  that originated from  the  pan-Islamic

revivalist  movement from the Middle East and  its  reach

fuelled  by  petro-dollars, the  transnational  terrorist

network  of Al-Qaeda and its JI associates will be  major

security challenges for years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while I hear some quarters talk about alienating

decent people, about the uncomfortable glare of directing

the spotlight on certain segments of our population, bear

in mind that we have no other options.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security threat is real. The JI members in

Singapore  had  gone  for  military  training;  organised

themselves for subversive action and had even met  fellow

activists in the region secretly in order that  they  may

harness and direct resources and efforts towards the harm

of  our fellow citizens.  We have to expose these people;

take  long-term measures to ensure any others are  rooted

out  and ensure new ones have little chance to take  root

on our shores and spawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like my other parliamentary colleagues, I

applaud the steps taken by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>

the Government to safeguard our key installations.  These

measures must be continued to ensure that we are  a  hard

target.  The enemy is cunning and evolving.  Inter-agency

cooperation  must  be  enhanced;  new  organisations  and

institutions formed, and our Government must ensure  that

we  have the latest technology and informational tools to

combat this enemy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond physical security, we have to raise national

awareness,  keep our guard up and act with  one  resolve.

Each  of us has a role.  Now that there is full awareness

of  the  insidious nature of the JI operatives,  we  must

look  out  for instances of aberrant and deviant pockets.

We must be vigilant at all times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only through the information of one concerned

Singaporean that ISD had the first specific lead on Aslam

and  from  that point, the whole JI network in  Singapore

unravelled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe vigilance must be practised at different

levels  to be effective.  While the Government  will  not

let  up  on  its stringent vigilance, I believe religious

bodies,  parents  and  families can play  very  important

roles in this challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be assured of the vigilance of the religious

bodies.   Why  religious bodies?  Because we are  dealing

with  an extremist ideology and in this current instance,

it  happens to be a deviant strain of Islam.   But  under

different circumstances, it could happen under the  guise

of  any  other religion.  History has ample  examples  of

extremists using religion as cover for their activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, all religious bodies must take stock and be

on  the lookout for attempts to use their religious bases

for   political  agenda.   In  the  White  Paper  on  the

Maintenance  of Religious Harmony in 1989, the  Singapore

Government  had clearly stated the principle of  rigorous

separation of religion and politics.  Thirteen years  on,

this  is still as valid and must be strictly adhered  to.

Our  religious bodies must find avenues to reaffirm  this

commitment in order that Singapore can continue to  enjoy

inter-racial harmony.  No one should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2336</b></font><br><br>

take  advantage  of the religious freedom that  Singapore

practises to perpetuate other foreign agenda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious bodies and leaders must have their feelers

out to detect those who stray and have ways to draw these

followers  back into their folds or choke off support  so

that virulent teachings do not spread.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message to our Muslim citizens is very clear - you are not alone in tackling misguided individuals

intent  on  using  religion for  extremist  acts.   Every

religion  is  at risk and every religious  body  must  be

alert  and proactive in ensuring their followers stay  on

their religious paths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the vigilance of Government and religious

bodies,    parents   and   families   must   also    take

responsibility.   While  the JI detainees  are  above  28

years,   we  know  that  some  of  the  more  charismatic

religious leaders were able to penetrate homes  and  took

advantage  of  teaching platforms  to  proselytise  their

extremist  views.  Only parental good sense and  judgment

would  ferret  out  these imposters  and  eliminate  this

avenue of contamination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can we do to enhance our social cohesion

so  that  we  can  confront and manage  any  events  that

threaten to tear us apart?  The respect that we must have

for each other's religions and cultural spaces cannot  be

under-estimated.   We  must continue  to  take  steps  to

ensure  that our entire social fabric remains strong  and

intact.   The  advent  of the IRCCs and  Harmony  Circles

already  provide  us  with  the  tools  to  develop   the

continued understanding and rapport amongst our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inter-racial, inter-cultural and inter-religious understanding and rapport is very important.

It is all too easy to take a simplistic view of this, but

we  cannot.   We  have  our very own unique  pluralistic,

secular  and multi-racial identity that we must  preserve

at  all costs.  Any dismantling of this will lead to  our

downfall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot fully anticipate what would hit us next.

The foe will certainly evolve new strategies to undermine

security and stability even as we take measures to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>

fortify ourselves.  But if we can build this great  sense

of  unity  as one people - investing time and  effort  to

understand  our fellow citizens better, accommodate  each

other  with all outward manifestation and affirmation  of

support  for  each other - then can we  tackle  any  such

threats  as  one  united people with no  in-fighting.   I

second the call by so many hon. Members that this is  the

time  to  drop  any reservations, come out from  all  our

comfort zones and erase any fault lines between the races

by  all  of  us getting into the mainstream of  Singapore

society.  It is with this national fortitude that we  can

weather  any  threats that threaten our social  cohesion.

In  many ways, this is a call to Total Defence for  every

Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many of us serve National Service and are

equipped with the skills to defend the sovereignty of our

nation,   every  Singaporean  can  also  participate   in

National Service on a daily basis through:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full hearted participation in the IRCCs and Harmony

Circles, giving life to the ideals of these bodies;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build on the trust and respect that we have for each

other;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do our part to ensure foreign subversive elements do

not drive wedges among us; and, finally,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build our "internal strength".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a long road. I had begun by saying that we

must  take  a  long-term view.   We  must  persevere.   I

reiterate  that there are no quick fixes and it  requires

hard  work  on  everyone's part.  Let us be  prepared  to

defend  what  we  have.  Pull together and  redouble  our

efforts.  Again, I repeat, we have no other options.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  the

debate.  As the last person in the long list of speakers,

I  find  that almost all the points I want to raise  have

been touched on by the Members. Nevertheless, in view  of

the  importance  and significance of the White  Paper,  I

must still show my support for the motion by the Minister

for Home Affairs. I will briefly touch on five aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the release of the White Paper is a

reflection of the high degree of transparency on the part

of  the Government. At a dialogue session of the Feedback

Unit, many participants endorsed and commended the manner

in  which  the Government tackled the matter,  and  hoped

that  the  Government  will do likewise  in  other  major

issues  and  policy-making.   From the  reaction  of  the

people, we observe that our society has matured,  and  we

are  able  to openly discuss sensitive issues  like  this

without incurring any intense reaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should commend and reward the officers

of  the  Home Ministry for their contribution, especially

the  ISD  officers.   They  are the  unsung  heroes.  But

because  of  the secret nature of their work,  we  cannot

openly  commend them.  And I hope that they will  receive

some form of appropriate commendation and reward.  At the

same  time,  we  must ensure that they are provided  with

enough  manpower and resources in order to continue  with

their  arduous responsibility of safeguarding our  social

stability and  national security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should not direct our spear or point our

fingers at the Muslim community.  This is unfair to  them

because maintaining racial and religious harmony  is  the

duty  and  responsibility of everyone. These JI activists

are just a handful of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>

dangerous  elements.  They do not  represent  the  entire

Muslim community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the big Singapore family, we have to

be united to support our Muslim brethren.  Although there

are certain non-Muslim people who have a wrong perception

of  the  Muslim  community, we need  to  correct  such  a

misconception.   We  have to try to make  the  non-Muslim

community  understand that our Muslim brethren are  peace

loving  and  patriotic fellow citizens. We must  exercise

tolerance  towards them.  We should not fault  the  whole

community just because of a few black sheep among them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell a story. In the Sung Dynasty,

there  was this great writer by the name of Su Dongpo.  I

believe you must have heard of his name.  He was a devout

Buddhist  and had a good friend who was a Buddhist  monk,

named  Fo Yin.  The two of them enjoyed debating  on  the

teachings of Buddha.  One day, while they were practising

meditation, Su Dongpo asked the Rev. Fo Yin, "What  do  I

look  like?"  His monk friend answered, "You are  like  a

Buddha."  Su Dongpo was very pleased to hear that.  After

a  while,  the  monk friend asked him, "What  do  I  look

like?"  Su  Dongpo thought it was a good opportunity  for

him to make fun of his friend. He said, "You look like  a

heap  of  cow  dung!"  When Fo Yin heard  this,  he  said

nothing  and  smilingly nodded his head.  Su  Dongpo  was

very  pleased with himself, thinking that he  had  won  a

battle of wits against Fo Yin.  When he returned home, he

boasted to his younger sister, Su Xiao Xiao, how  he  had

won  over  Fo Yin.  On hearing this, Su Xiao  Xiao  said,

"Brother, you are wrong.  You have actually lost  to  the

Rev. Fo Yin.  Because Fo Yin's mind was full of Buddhism;

what  he saw before him was nothing but Buddha.  But your

mind  was full of cow dung, that is why you only saw  cow

dung."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, how should our non-Muslim

communities  perceive the Muslim community?   A  mind  of

Buddha, or a mind full of cow dung?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Muslim community should also make

their  stand clear to all Singaporeans.  They  should  be

explicit in their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>

stand  and  draw  a  line  between  themselves  and   the

extremists.   They should not let the other people  think

that  since they are Muslims, they would sympathise  with

the  JI  because of their religion.  Therefore,  I  fully

support  our Malay MPs and the Muslim leaders  for  their

statements.   But  more  has  to  be  done.   The  Muslim

community leaders should explain to all Singaporeans  how

do  they  practise their religious teaching in  a  multi-racial,  multi-religious  society,  and  how  they  would

strive  to integrate with the mainstream to make  greater

contribution  to  our society.  They should  ensure  that

their  followers would not make narrow interpretation  of

Islam  and shut themselves up in their cocoon, alienating

from society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my conversation with the people, certain Chinese

are  quite confused on certain religious issues, eg,  the

wearing  of  the  tudung.  They asked me  whether  it  is

compulsory  for  Muslim women to  wear  the  tudung,  and

whether  it  is true that when wearing the  tudung,  they

cannot  shake hands with other people.  They are confused

about these issues.  So, if we want to make progress,  we

have  to  make a breakthrough. When the non-Muslims  open

their arms to welcome the Muslims, the Muslims should  be

open  minded and be prepared to work together to  achieve

greater religious harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the JI incident must certainly be an eye

opener   for  all  the  religious  groups  in  Singapore.

Therefore, I fully support the religious leaders' attempt

to  formulate a code of conduct governing their religious

teaching.  We should not mix politics with religion.   We

have  to  emphasise the social functions of religion  and

urge   all   the   religions  to  fulfill  their   social

obligations.  Water can float a boat;  it can also sink a

boat.  Religion can do the same to our society and to our

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For human beings, clean water is a basic necessity

to  sustain life.  Frequent drinking of water can cleanse

out  all the toxins in our body.  A good religion is like

pure water.  It can cleanse up the soul of a human being.

For  example,  the  universal love of  Christianity,  the

mercifulness of Buddhism, the appeal for charity and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>

good  conduct of Taoism, and the peace advocated by Islam

-  all these are aimed at making one a better person  and

to lead a positive way of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, impure water will bring about

diseases.   If  a  cup of water has been  poisoned,  when

drunk,  it will slowly damage the nervous system, kidney,

liver and, eventually, cause death.  A religion that  has

been  distorted  and  misused by other  people  can  also

slowly  corrode our mind and we can be led astray  to  do

things  which are detrimental to ourselves and  to  other

people, just like what the JI has done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a higher plane, for example, rainwater can bring

moisture to the earth, bring forth all living things.  If

water  is  properly controlled, it can irrigate land  and

generate electricity.  But, on the other hand, a  rampant

flood  and inundation will cause devastation to land  and

properties,  and  even loss of lives.   Religion  is  the

same.   Good religions serve to cleanse our mind and  the

followers  are urged to engage in charity work and  bring

good  to  society.  Therefore, we must endorse  what  the

religious  groups have done in Singapore, in  setting  up

hospitals,  nursing homes and other social welfare  work.

They  offer services to people, regardless of their race,

language or religion.  Such social services will help  to

promote religious harmony and mutual trust, and serve  to

promote prosperity of the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if a religion is solely

preoccupied with its evangelical work and increasing  its

fold  or,  worse,  if it is misused by other  undesirable

elements,  it will bring about social disintegration  and

the  break-up  of  the  nation.  Therefore,  the  various

religious  leaders,  whether  Buddhist,  Hindu,   Muslim,

Christian  or  Taoist, should constantly be mindful  that

the  JI  incidents could well be repeated  in  their  own

religion.   Therefore, they should be   vigilant  against

these  undesirable  elements which  twist  the  religious

teachings to incite hatred, and harm the social  security

and peace.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-religious society like ours, we have to

emphasise  the  common ground, and not  the  differences.

More  important is that we should respect  the  faith  of

others when we engage in evangelical work.  We should not

denigrate   other  religions.   When   they   carry   out

evangelical work, they should curb the excessive zeal  of

their  followers, so as not to hurt the feelings of other

religious groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a saying, "Be magnanimous to others,

but  be  strict to oneself."  We should not expect  other

people  to respect us when we ourselves do not  show  our

respect  to them.  Therefore, we have to be exemplary  in

our  conduct, whether we are Chinese, Malays or  Indians.

As  long  as we are Singaporeans, whether we are Muslims,

Christians, Buddhists or Hindus, every one of  us  should

learn  to become a better person, eg, respect others,  be

considerate to others, show concern to others, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only when we have won the respect of others

can  we  influence  them  so as  to  reform  society.   A

harmonious and gracious society starts from the heart  of

the  people.   It  cannot be achieved through  Government

legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I see no need for this role. Our

hon. Members have had three days of debate on this, and I

will  not try to agonise them further.  But if they  bear

with  me, I will just spend a bit of time to try to round

up  what all the hon. Members have said in the last three

days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank  all the Members of this House for expressing their

views  on  the White Paper and for their strong  support,

across all the parties, for the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years ahead, the broad recommendations in the

White  Paper will have to be implemented effectively  and

sensibly,  and  in  concrete terms - practical  measures.

But let me state this very clearly.  The White Paper does

not offer a panacea for the complete and permanent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>

eradication  of the terrorist threat that we  are  facing

today.  The White Paper's recommendations are actions  we

can  develop and pursue domestically.  These actions  are

necessary.   But we must not be under any illusion  that,

by  themselves,  they are enough.  For one  thing,  as  I

mentioned  in my speech two days ago, this  is  a  threat

which is rooted outside Singapore.  The threat cannot  be

eliminated  by  Singapore's action alone.   Domestically,

the   recommendations  in  the  White  Paper   are   just

directions  which we can develop and pursue.   But,  even

then,  these  do not foreclose any other good  ideas,  or

options,  or suggestions or avenues which may be  helpful

in dealing with this terrorist threat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to enhance security, we will continue to make

ourselves  a harder target for the terrorists.   We  will

continue  to  develop strong, practical  and  sustainable

defensive measures.  Some inconvenience to our life, such

as  traffic  jams at the checkpoints, cannot be  avoided.

It  is a price worth paying for better security.  I share

Mr  Chiam See Tong's view that even one bomb going off in

Singapore  is  one  bomb  too many.   But  there  are  no

guarantees  - such as the one sought by Mr Steve  Chia  - which  can  insure Singaporeans against the  violence  of

terrorism,  whether  it  is  spotted  outside  or  inside

Singapore.   Indeed,  as several Members  of  the  House,

including   Mrs   Lim   Hwee  Hua,   alluded   to,   more

realistically,  Singaporeans must get involved  and  take

ownership  of  this  national  threat  to  our  security,

because  it confronts all of us - Muslims and non-Muslims

alike.  Singaporeans cannot afford to hold the complacent

belief  that  the  Government  will  always  insure  them

against a terrorist incident - that there can never be  a

bomb  going off in Singapore.  No government can  provide

this  assurance,  no  matter how  well  prepared  it  is.

Singaporeans,  like  the  young people  whom  Prof.  Chin

referred  to,  do themselves a disservice,  if  they  are

apathetic  and leave it to the Government  to  deal  with

this  threat alone.  Neither can they afford  to  believe

that  this  threat is not real, like some  of  those  who

attended  the  Feedback Unit's session and who  expressed

doubt about the genuineness of this JI case.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2344</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both groups, if they have no sense of the clear and

present danger terrorism poses to their life, will  be  a

liability  to  our  national effort to instill  vigilance

against  this  threat.  Whether it is the  fight  against

crime or drugs or, in our present case, the fight against

terrorism, it is citizens' involvement and support  which

are  vital.   The  strongest  defensive  measure  in  any

country against terrorism is always the vigilance and the

resilience of its citizens and residents.  This can  come

about  only  if  citizens  share  in  the  concerns  over

terrorism  and take ownership in helping to  tackle  this

threat.  And I agree with Mr Gan Kim Yong that we  should

prepare  our people on what to do when a bomb  should  go

off.   We  will  do  this  through  a  national  security

awareness  campaign  or programme  starting  next  month.

But,  have  no  illusions about it  too.   No  number  of

campaigns  or amount of national education is enough,  if

the people themselves do not treat this threat seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the concern of a Muslim Singaporean who gave

the  crucial  lead  to  ISD's uncovering  of  the  Jemaah

Islamiyah in December 2001.  He is not alone.  There have

been many like him who have felt that sense of civic duty

to   step  forward  and  report  what  they  believe  are

potential security threats.  Since September 11, we  have

received numerous reports from the public which have been

helpful  in  the  work  of our law enforcement  agencies.

Unfortunately, we have also received numerous hoaxes  and

pranks   which  have  strained  and  wasted  our  limited

policing resources.  That is why the police will  take  a

very serious view of anyone who either perpetrates a hoax

or who spreads rumours which generate anxiety, tension or

distrust, especially between our ethnic communities.   If

anyone in good faith observes something which he feels is

of  potential security threat or concern, he  should  not

start a rumour, but instead report it immediately to  the

authorities,  so that it may be effectively  and  quickly

investigated and verified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Ong Chit Chung and Prof. Chin Tet Yung

pointed  out  that,  given the nature  of  the  terrorist

network, counter-measures should have a regional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>

dimension.  This is a valid observation.  I believe  that

governments  in  the region and beyond realise  this  and

recognise   the   value  of  developing  and   mobilising

collective  resources and knowledge  to  deal  with  this

terrorist threat.  Indeed, efforts are always ongoing  to

expand  the level and extent of cooperation and exchanges

within  the region.  Frankly speaking, this may be easier

said  in  the  case  of  some  established  domains,  eg,

intelligence  and exchange and perhaps, more challenging,

in newer areas, such as collective action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, we are committed to giving all

practical  assistance  to our foreign  partners  who  are

serious  in  fighting this terrorist  threat.   This  has

included,  and  will continue to include, access  to  our

detainees,  where they are relevant to  the  cases  under

investigation    or   prosecution   by   these    foreign

governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to translate into action the

second  recommendation of policing against terrorist  and

extremist  ideology, our Muslim leaders from the  various

organisations  will have to work closely  together  in  a

consultative  and  open manner.  They  must  ensure  that

their  efforts are understood by the community at  large,

and  not  in  any way be seen to undermine the legitimate

religious pursuits and interests within the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must get our focus right. As Mr Zainul Abidin

Rasheed rightly concluded, this is an ideological battle,

and  Muslim Singaporeans must not allow themselves to  be

subverted  and  be a party or proxy to  such  threats  by

terrorists.   The  Jemaah  Islamiyah  detainees  are  not

marginalised  individuals  driven  by  a  deep  sense  of

grievance against Singapore society or by the feeling  of

discrimination  and oppression in Singapore.   They  were

driven  by the misguided belief in the vision of a Daulah

Islamiyah - an Islamic regional state - to be achieved by

revolutionary  force.   The  centre  of  their   regional

Islamic state is not Singapore, but Indonesia.  In  fact,

the  Singapore JI is only a district-level  unit  of  the

Malaysian Jemaah

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>

Islamiyah branch, whose leaders are in Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need our Muslim MPs, ulamas, asatizahs and

community  leaders, therefore, to be united, in providing

a  clear direction to the community to counter and reject

extremism,  extremists  and  terrorist  ideology.    They

should   set   aside  their  individual   interests   and

differences  and come together to face the common  threat

with determination and perseverance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Ahmad Khalis explained, our Muslim leaders

have  an  important role, not just to  guide  the  Muslim

community,  but also to correct erroneous perceptions  of

Islam  which  may  be purveyed by the  ill-informed.   In

addition,  they must help to turf out the dangerous  few,

who,  as  Mr  Heng  Chee  How  argued,  purvey  extremist

ideology even as they hide within, and prey on our larger

Muslim  community.  As my colleague, Dr Yaacob,  put  it,

every   myopic,  extremist  or  radical  view   must   be

challenged and exposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, tackling the third

presentation  in  the  White Paper of  strengthening  our

social  cohesion and religious harmony is  a  fundamental

and  on-going  enterprise in our  nation-building,  which

preceded  the  terrorist threat, and which will  continue

even  after it is over.  Every country needs to form some

conception  of the kind of society it wants to  be.   For

Singapore, since its independence, this has been that  of

a  secular multi-ethnic meritocratic nation state.   This

is  the best political structure, which ensures that  our

various ethnic communities, regardless of their numerical

size,  can be equally assured of enough space to  thrive,

promote and pursue their religion and culture in relative

freedom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an ethnically plural society, the secular state

is  centred upon a common civic space which can bind  all

the   ethnic   communities.   This  space  is  determined

significantly by the separation of politics and religion.

If we allow politics and religion to be mixed, we will be

brewing  a  very  powerful amalgam, which  will  pit  one

ethnic  group  against  another  in  ceaseless  political

competition.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Prof. Chin and other MPs argued in this

debate, the secular state which rests on the condition of

keeping politics and religion separate, is not just good,

but  necessary for Singapore's survival.  It allows  each

community  to pursue its ethnic interest, so long  as  it

does  not  undermine the political cohesion as a  centre.

No  single  community can push for the maximum space  for

itself  without restraint and not expect a reaction  from

the other communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my colleague, Dr Yaacob, that in

Singapore  we  must  achieve  unity  in  diversity.   The

stronger the bonds at the centre, the deeper the level of

inter-communal tolerance and trust, the greater the space

for  diversity  for each community.  No single  community

can grow beyond what the whole society can accommodate at

any  point  in time.  The alternative to this arrangement

is  an  unmediated free-for-all political society,  where

every  community self-centredly pushes for maximum space.

In   such  a  situation,  the  majority  community   will

eventually  subjugate,  overwhelm  the  minorities,   and

communal conflict and competition will inevitably be  the

order of the day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, several MPs spoke about the

need  to develop and expand dialogue and the common space

among the communities.  Indeed, this is what we have been

practising all these years since independence.  While  we

can  continue  to  enhance  the dialogue  between  ethnic

communities in order to deepen inter-communal  bond,  the

effort, although important, is not enough.  Singapore  is

too  small  a country to afford the coming of  a  society

where we can have any community withdrawing into its  own

cocoon  and  living separate and cut off from  the  rest.

Commitment and participation in the common secular  space

is   vital,  so  that  all  Singaporeans,  regardless  of

ethnicity,  are  collectively  anchored  and  engaged  in

defining  a national space where the Singaporean identity

is rooted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are considerations which must guide the

conduct of all communities,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>

even  as  they  pursue the developments of ethnic  issues

close  to  their hearts.  Singaporeans can be both  pious

Muslims,  Buddhists,  Christians  or  Hindus,  and   good

citizens at the same time.  To be both, they need  to  be

able  to  appreciate the line between the  obligation  as

citizens   and  their  duties  as  religious   faithfuls.

Although   the  strengthening  of  social  cohesion   and

religious  harmony  is a stable and  vital  part  of  our

nation  building, the current threat of terrorism  raises

the subject more urgently in our consciousness today.  In

a  way,  the  JI  arrests  are a  wake-up  call  for  all

Singaporeans.   The current threat of terrorism  has  the

real  potential of unravelling what we have achieved  and

fracturing  our  communal  relations  which,  even   when

mended,  will be permanently scarred and never quite  the

same again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's state of social cohesion is a dynamic

and  evolving one over the last 37 years.   It  does  not

start  or end with the White Paper.  As Ms Indranee Rajah

noted,  there  are echoes of the past surfacing  in  this

debate  because  the issues of race  and  religion  in  a

society  such  as  ours  are  deeply  embedded  and   are

perennial  concerns.  But, as Dr Wang  Kai  Yuen  rightly

observed,  we have not stood still and we have come  some

way,  and there is still a long way to go in this journey

of nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of ethnic harmony in Singapore today

has  allowed  us  sufficient confidence  to  discuss  the

difficult issues related to the threats of terrorism in a

mature,   rational   and  balanced  manner.    This   has

characterised our dialogues with the community, and I  am

glad  that  it  has also been largely reflected  in  this

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly impressed and taken by the stout

rejections by several MPs, like Mr Hawazi and Dr Wang Kai

Yuen,  of  the  caricature of the Malay community  as  an

under-performing, discriminated, ethnic group, who  needs

a  handout  by  way of affirmative actions  in  order  to

succeed.   They argued, rationally, on the basis  of  the

fact  and  rightly collected feedback  and  not  on  some

individual perceptions and loose anecdotes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two MPs mentioned that there are issues still to be

resolved  in  our ethnic community which are relevant  to

social cohesion.  I agree.  Because ours is not a perfect

society.   None is.  The important thing is that  in  our

society,  if  a  person  has a genuine  problem,  he  has

effective avenues for redress, including resorting to the

law  for  protection and support.  Are there  individuals

who  have  grievances in our society?  Of  course,  there

must be.  Every society has its share of them.  Are there

problems  and  issues in the Malay community?   Obviously

there are.  Not just in the Malay community, but in every

community.   There are some who perceive  that  they  are

discriminated because of their age or their gender,  too.

But,  does  this amount to marginalisation of  an  entire

community  outweighing  all  the  facts  which  tell   us

otherwise?   Or  worse,  is this  reason  for  anyone  to

cynically   dismiss   the   findings   of   a   team   of

psychologists,  counsellers, professional  investigators,

and the detainees themselves, about the motivation of the

JI  detainees?  We must not legitimise the JI  terrorists

as  some kind of a victim of society.  Whatever the  case

that  may be in countries elsewhere, this is not the case

here.  If this theory of marginalisation is correct, then

how do we account for the highly educated, and successful

professional  people, with PhDs, graduate  qualifications

and some from western universities and businessmen in the

leadership    of    the   Malaysian   Jemaah    Islamiyah

organisation,  which our JI network  is  subordinate  to?

And  these  leaders  are the product  of  an  affirmative

action policy, the bumiputra policy which favours them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on social cohesion, and

especially inter-ethnic harmony, we have done well.   The

fact  that  we can discuss such issues candidly  in  this

House  is one's reflection of the greater confidence  and

maturity.  However, this is not to say that there  is  no

room  for  growth in the strength of our social  cohesion

and  the  quality  and  the  depth  of  our  inter-ethnic

relations.   Far from it.  Otherwise, we would  not  have

made it a key recommendation in this White Paper.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonding our people and nurturing social cohesion is

a  perpetual  and continuing enterprise.   It  is  always

dynamic,  which  means  it can either  grow  stronger  or

weaker,  over time, depending on what we do as a  people.

We  must  therefore jealously guard what we have achieved

and build on the accumulated social capital of trust that

the last 30 years of communal peace have afforded us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that we come out of

this  debate more sober and clear eyed over the terrorist

threat  that we are now facing.  But we must by no  means

be  intimidated.  We must be vigilant, but not  paranoid.

We  must  live with courage and not be cowed.  The  White

Paper  has  given  us an opportunity to publicly  discuss

sensitive  issues of race and religion.  In the  face  of

adversity,  there  is  also  a  valuable  opportunity  to

galvanise  and mobilise our ethnic communities to  affirm

and   strengthen  our  values  of  mutual  tolerance  and

communal trust.  This we must do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has, in fact, been a whole new energy in inter-ethnic engagements following September 11, and the JI

episodes.   There is support of effort by the Government,

like  the IRCC, but just as encouraging, there have  also

been  initiatives  by  the various ethnic  and  religious

groups  on  their  own to reach out,  make  contacts  and

enhance interactions and understanding, whether it be  by

way of mutual visits to places of worship, or small group

discussions on religious practices and values.  As Mdm Ho

Geok  Choo said, this congruence between the efforts from

the  top  and  the efforts from below in our  society  is

important, because the quality of inter-ethnic  relations

cannot  be  decreed by the Government, or willed  by  the

creation  of  formal structures, but must  ultimately  be

fleshed  by the substantive participation and involvement

of  ordinary  citizens  in their daily  interactions  and

contact  with  each  other as they go about  their  daily

lives.   They  must  take  a personal  responsibility  to

promote  inter-racial interactions.  They must reach  out

to  one another.  If we continue to nurture mutual  trust

and attachment in the relations between our communities,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>

I  am  confident that we will prevail over the  terrorist

threat  and a peaceful multi-ethnic Singapore as we  know

it  today  will  survive and continue for generations  to

come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House (a) acknowledges that the terrorist

threat to Singapore is real and serious; (b) supports the

firm  actions the Government has taken against the threat

to   the  security  of  Singapore  posed  by  the  Jemaah

Islamiyah  group and other militant and extremist  groups

in  the region; and, (c) endorses the recommendations put

forth  in the White Paper on The Jemaah Islmiyah  Arrests

and the Threat of Terrorism, contained in Paper Cmd. 2 of

2003,  to  counter the terrorist threat by (i)  enhancing

the  security  measures;  (ii)  policing  the  spread  of

terrorist    and   extremist   ideology;    and,    (iii)

strengthening our social cohesion and religions harmony.
