The Special Select Committee was set up on 14th September 1990 and its Report was presented to Parliament on 19th November 1990, as Paper Parl. 8 of 1990.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Select Committee nominated the following persons to the President for appointment as nominated Members of Parliament:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Associate Prof Maurice Choo Hock Heng; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Mr Leong Chee Whye.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the President, by instruments dated 22nd November 1990, appointed Prof Choo and Mr Leong as nominated Members of Parliament for a term of two years, with effect from 22nd November 1990.
  <br>

   <b>MR J.B. JEYARETNAM</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Former Member for Anson)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh</b> asked the Prime Minister why has the Government so far refused to agree to be bound by the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the action brought by the former Member of Parliament for Anson for a declaration that he never ceased to be a member of the Sixth Parliament until its dissolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Senior Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Lee Boon Yang) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has asked me to answer this question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no reason why this appeal must go to the Privy Council. Mr Jeyaretnam seeks a declaration which will over-rule his criminal convictions. This is not possible under our law. Even the Privy Council had admitted in their judgment that this was the law and hence advised him to apply for a pardon.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, is the Senior Minister of State aware that a High Court Judge has commented rather harshly on the wavering stand adopted by the Singapore Government? First of all, not claiming diplomatic immunity for the High Commissioner and then, according to the Judge, blowing hot and cold, claiming diplomatic immunity for the High Commissioner. This, Sir, would certainly give Singapore a bad name.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Education (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is aware of the problems which parents face when they try to admit

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> their children into schools in Singapore on their return from overseas job assignments. Currently, parents have to approach the schools directly to see if the schools have vacancies. Alternatively, parents have sought assistance from the Ministry's Pupil Placement Section to place their children in suitable schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is doing a comprehensive study of the problems which parents face concerning their children's education when the parents have to live or work overseas, sometimes for extended periods. The establishment of Singapore schools overseas, such as the primary school to be set up in Hong Kong next year and the provision of boarding facilities in secondary schools in Singapore, will help to alleviate these problems. However, more can be done.
  <br>

  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh</b> asked the Minister for Education if he will justify the Government's decision to increase school fees from 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has not increased school fees. The Government has increased miscellaneous fees which are used by the schools to defray expenditure on teaching materials and equipment and to carry out educational projects. Expenditure by schools on such items amount to $29 million in financial year 1990 as against revenues of $25 million at the present rate of miscellaneous fees. The deficit for financial year 1990 is therefore $4 million and this deficit will increase in financial year 1991 if miscellaneous fees are not raised. The increases in the miscellaneous fees, which comprise $1 per month for students in primary schools, $1.50 per month for students in secondary schools, and $2.50 per month for students in junior colleges, centralised institutes and pre-university centres, are modest and well within the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> capacity of parents to pay. Furthermore, Sir, as I have stated in my speech at the Schools Council Dinner on 24th November this year, if parents require financial assistance to pay the miscellaneous fees, this will be provided generously.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, as I have said, the cost of education must go up because we intend to improve the quality of education in Singapore. The major part of the cost will be provided by the Government and the miscellaneous fees, which amount to some $30 million a year, form only a very small fraction of the over $2 billion which the Government spends on education each year. However, it is not right, neither is it desirable, for Government to pay all the costs of education. Parents should pay a small part of it. This is to emphasize and make the point to parents that they have a responsibility for the education of their children. In any case, Sir, if parents have difficulty in paying schools fees or miscellaneous fees, assistance will be provided.

  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will give the House details of the agreement between Singapore and the United States government under which the United States will be granted military facilities in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we offered to host some US facilities last year, we had two objectives in mind. First, by bearing a share of the burden of hosting US facilities we hoped to make it easier for the Philippine Government to assure its people that the Philippines is not alone and that there are others who are prepared to share the political
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> burden of hosting US presence in this region. Singapore has publicly supported the presence of US bases in the Philippines. Second, we wished to encourage the US to continue to maintain its military presence in this region. We believe that a sustained US presence will maintain the balance of power in the wider region, reinforce the stable and peaceful regional environment and enable the countries in Southeast Asia to concentrate their resources on economic development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and the US Vice-President Dan Quayle on 13th November 1990 gave effect to this offer. As the two leaders said after the signing of the agreement, it is "concrete evidence of the determination of the US to retain a military presence in Southeast Asia for the foreseeable future."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facilities we are offering to the US are located at Paya Lebar Airport and Sembawang Wharves as well as space for a small office at Clifford Pier. These are not new. The US have been using them in the past and their usage will now be enhanced under the MOU. The US Air Force will send aircraft to Singapore several times each year on training deployments of several weeks and the US Navy will increase the duration and number of its ship visits to Singapore. The first US deployment under the MOU is expected to take place in March next year. To support these visits and deployments, the US will increase the number of its Naval and Air Force personnel assigned to Singapore to about 95 from the present 20 or so on a year-round basis. Some additional 75 Air Force men and women will come to Singapore on temporary duty in connection with each training deployment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following principles are written and enshrined into the MOU, namely: recognition and respect for the sovereignty of Singapore; respect for the laws, including the Constitution of Singapore; the judicial process must not be impaired.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOU states clearly that we have jurisdiction over all offenders. As in all cases involving foreigners, the Attorney-General will have the responsibility to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> determine whether to take legal proceedings after studying investigation reports by the Police. This is the normal process which applies to offenders irrespective of their nationality.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the House may wish to note that the US and the Five Power Defence Arrangement countries have been using Singapore's facilities such as Sembawang Wharves and Paya Lebar Airport in the past. We have not had any problems with either the US or the FPDA countries in the past. The MOU with the US merely formalises the arrangement for the US to continue using our facilities. We do not expect to encounter any problems with the US over this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Is the Minister aware that while making it easier for the Philippines, the agreement has drawn forth strong criticisms from other countries around South East Asia and that some of these criticisms have been directed at the prolonging or inability to realise ZOPFAN in the not too distant future? Would the Minister comment on this, please?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, not at all. Our neighbours have not reacted adversely to the MOU - not Malaysia, not Indonesia.

   <b>INTRODUCTION OF UNLEADED PETROLS</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the Minister for the Environment)</b>
  </div>
  <br>12.50 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the last Budget debate on 19th March 1990, I informed this House that my Ministry was conducting a feasibility study on the introduction of unleaded petrol in Singapore. I have the pleasure to report, Sir, the completion of that study.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, epidemiological studies have proven that exposure to high concentrations of lead can damage the central nervous system and can cause degenerative diseases of the brain. Everyone of us is vulnerable to these damaging effects caused by exposure to lead, especially our children. In Singapore, Sir, the main source of lead in the air is vehicular emissions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, my Ministry has progressively reduced the lead content in petrol in Singapore. Since 1987, the lead content of our petrol has been 0.15 g/litre, down from the 1980 level of 0.84 g/litre. As a result of this change in our petrol quality, the level of lead in the air measured at our roadsides has decreased from 1.85 ug/Nm3 in 1980 to the current level of 0.30 ug/Nm3. This is well below the 1.50 ug/Nm3 guideline level recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we may have been successful in reducing the level of lead in the air, our efforts will be negated by our growing car population. Mr Speaker, Sir, the study conducted by my Ministry has concluded that if the lead content in our petrol is maintained at the current level, the growth in car population will result in rising lead levels in the ambient air. To prevent this from happening, the solution is to promote the use of unleaded petrol by our cars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on my Ministry's findings, out of the total of 332,000 petrol-driven cars registered in Singapore, about 90% or 300,000 cars are able to switch over to unleaded petrol. The remaining 32,000 cars, which are mainly cars older than seven years, cannot use unleaded petrol.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it will cost the oil companies more to produce unleaded petrol. Countries that have introduced unleaded petrol have found that motorists are not likely to switch to the use of unleaded petrol if the latter costs more at the pump. This is true even in countries such as Germany where the "Green Movement" is active and public environmental awareness is strong. To encourage greater use of unleaded petrol, a price differential in favour of unleaded petrol is normally
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> introduced at the pump through fiscal measures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote the use of unleaded petrol in Singapore, the Government will also create a price differential in favour of unleaded petrol. With effect from 1st February 1991, the ad valorem duty on unleaded petrol will be reduced from 50% to 48%, subject to a floor price of 60 cents per litre. At the same time, an additional tax will be levied on leaded petrol to make it about 10 cents per litre more expensive than unleaded petrol.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further measure to phase out leaded petrol in the long run, the Registry of Vehicles will, with effect from 1st July 1991, require all petrol-driven cars imported for use in Singapore to be able to run on unleaded petrol. In the meantime, Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will work with the oil companies and motor traders to provide advice to motorists on whether their cars can switch to the use of unleaded petrol.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from lead, vehicular emissions also contain other harmful pollutants like unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. To reduce these pollutants, we have imposed regulations since 1984 to require petrol-driven cars in Singapore to comply with certain emission standards that are equivalent to the standards used in Europe. These standards were made stricter in 1986.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of unleaded petrol, Singapore can further improve her present high standard of air quality. This is achievable through the use of catalytic converters on our cars. Catalytic converters convert unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides in vehicular exhaust emissions to safe gases, namely, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water. But because catalytic converters will be damaged by lead present in leaded petrol, they cannot be introduced until after unleaded petrol becomes widely available and is used in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the eventual widespread use of unleaded petrol in mind, my Ministry, together with the Registry of Vehicles, will, with effect from 1st January 1993, introduce new and stricter emission
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> standards which, given today's state of automotive technology, can only be complied with through the use of catalytic converters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to conclude my statement by summarising the measures that will be implemented:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) From 1st February 1991, a price differential in favour of unleaded petrol will be established through the reduction of the ad valorem tax on unleaded petrol downwards from 50% to 48%. For leaded petrol, an additional tax will be levied to make it about 10 cents per litre more expensive than unleaded petrol;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) From 1st July 1991, all petrol-driven vehicles imported for use in Singapore will have to be able to use unleaded petrol; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) From 1st January 1993, a stricter emission standard for all new petrol-driven vehicles will be imposed. At the level of current technology, these standards can only be complied with through the use of catalytic converters.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have four clarifications to ask the Minister:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Will leaded petrol be continued to be available for use by the older cars?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Since any increase in petrol price will obviously affect the motorcyclists as well, can the unleaded petrol be also used in motorcycles?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Whilst the Ministry of the Environment introduces stringent control in Singapore to improve our air quality, what measures will be taken on Malaysian vehicles, particularly the heavy diesel vehicles entering into Singapore if they do not meet our smoke emission standards?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Is unleaded petrol used in other countries and do they have price differentials between leaded and unleaded petrol? How successful are they?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Ibrahim Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Ibrahim Othman (Bedok GRC):</b> Sir, I have the following questions for the Minister:
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Is there any increase in sickness arising from lead in petrol to justify having unleaded petrol?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Will the car engine and its performance be affected with the switch to unleaded petrol?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Would the Government consider giving incentives to owners of old vehicles that cannot use unleaded petrol to enable them to change to newer cars?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) With the increase in production cost of unleaded petrol, would the Government consider reducing further the tax so that we can encourage more motorists to switch to unleaded petrol?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tiong Bahru GRC):</b> Sir, I applaud the Minister's move. The question at the back of my mind is on the tax structure which has been changed to encourage motorists to use the new unleaded petrol. Is there any intention to revert to the old tax structure the moment leaded petrol is no longer in use? In other words, will the tax be increased again in future?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I support the Minister's view. But I am wondering why we must encourage motorists to use unleaded petrol at the expense of penalising people who will continue to use leaded petrol because it is expensive to convert to unleaded petrol and it is also not easy to convert too.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> First of all, I will answer the questions raised by Mr Chin Harn Tong. The first question he asked is whether leaded petrol will continue to be made available in Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, we will not be stopping the sale and use of leaded petrol in Singapore because, as I mentioned in my statement just now, about 32,000 cars, which cannot use unleaded petrol, will still have to rely on leaded petrol. So the sale of leaded petrol will still be continued in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question he asked is about the Malaysian cars. First of all, I will have to inform this House that, on average, about 3,500 Malaysian diesel vehicles ply the Causeway every month. And of this figure, about 20% of them do not comply with our stringent 50 HSU Vehicular Emission
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Standard, which, incidentally, is also the standard used in Malaysia. At my meeting with my counterpart, the Malaysian Minister of Science, Technology and Environment, in Kuala Lumpur last week, I did raise this issue with him. I am happy to say that I am pleased with the outcome of my talks with him. Malaysia is now considering restricting vehicles which do not comply with the 50 standard HSU from entering Singapore. Indications are that the Malaysians are equally interested in protecting their air quality. We have agreed with the Malaysians, Sir, on harmonising Vehicular Emission Standards eventually, including petrol quality.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Hon. Members</b> must have read from the papers that a Malaysia-Singapore Joint Committee on the Environment will be formed comprising Environment officials from both countries. And this Committee which will start work from January next year will, amongst other things, look into similar Vehicular Emission Standards that can be adopted and enforced in both countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question raised by Mr Chin Harn Tong is on whether motorcyclists can use unleaded petrol. Mr Speaker, Sir, all the major motorcycle makes in Singapore can switch to unleaded petrol. But before doing that, I would advise the owners of these motorcycles to check with the dealers to find out whether they can really switch to unleaded petrol. But the majority of them, as far as I know, can.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether unleaded petrol is used in other countries, the answer is yes. Over 60% of petrol sold globally is unleaded. In fact, unleaded petrol is available in countries like Australia, USA, Japan, Canada and the EC countries. Unleaded petrol in what was then known as West Germany was introduced about six years ago and in the case of West Germany, unleaded petrol is cheaper by about 10 cents per litre compared to leaded petrol. In West Germany today, about 65% of petrol sold is unleaded. The United Kingdom introduced unleaded petrol initially with very little price incentive. Consequently the use of unleaded petrol initially remained very small. But when tax incentives were brought in to make unleaded petrol
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cheaper, the use of unleaded petrol grew from almost nothing to more than 25% within less than six months. Whereas in some Southern European countries, such as Spain and Portugal, very little incentive was provided and therefore the use of unleaded petrol in these two countries amounts to only less than 1%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ibrahim Othman has asked whether there is an increase in diseases or something to that effect which makes us decide to switch to unleaded petrol. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is more preventive because exposure to lead has been known to cause mental retardation. It has also been known to cause still-birth and affect the intelligence level of developing children who are exposed to lead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his question whether we need to keep the price down, Mr Speaker, Sir, financial measures are necessary to create a kind of price advantage for unleaded petrol and hence to encourage motorists to switch to its use. We have looked into several measures and options and we have come to the conclusion that the measures, which I have announced in my statement, will approximately keep the tax revenue neutral.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question by Mr Choo Wee Khiang, I did not quite get his last question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I support his view, but the point is that we should encourage motorists to use unleaded petrol. The price of leaded petrol should remain as it is. In fact, the price should be reduced to induce more motorists to convert their cars to use unleaded petrol and not at the expense of penalising the existing motorists.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> As I have mentioned just now, Sir, financial measures are necessary to create this price advantage over unleaded petrol and hence to encourage motorists to switch to its use. The measures which we will be taking, as announced in my statement just now, will approximately keep the tax revenue neutral for the range of petrol prices which we have experienced in the last year. In order to encourage people to use unleaded petrol, what Mr Choo is suggesting

  <br> is that we should keep it lower than what it is available now. Apart from revenue considerations, the tax on petrol is also meant to achieve the other two objectives, namely, to discourage vehicle usage as a means to control our traffic congestion, and to encourage conservation of energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered my question on whether the tax will be reverted to the old tax structure the moment leaded petrol is no longer available.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that question is best addressed to my colleague, the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mountbatten):</b> In relative terms, you are already punishing or penalising those who cannot use unleaded petrol. So why further increase the tax?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Yap is not asking a question, he is just making a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> You would be reducing the tax for those using unleaded petrol. Similarly, you will be increasing the tax for those who cannot use unleaded petrol. Even without increasing the tax for those who cannot use unleaded petrol, you are already penalising them. There is already a relative difference in price. So why further increase the tax?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I better make it clear that it costs more to produce unleaded petrol. In any case, in case Mr Yap does not know, the majority of these 32,000 cars which cannot switch to unleaded petrol belong to the category of the BMWs, Mercedes, and so on. So, I think, they should have no problem in paying.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> But I thought the cut-off age was seven years. Earlier when I listened to the Minister, he said that cars older than seven years cannot use unleaded petrol. How is it there is this reference to Mercedes and BMWs in his answer?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have got the list. Although the cut-off age is seven years, the majority of the 32,000 cars which belong to this category are the BMWs, Citroens, Ferraris, Jaguars, Saabs, Volvos and Renaults. But the most important thing is that we have to create a price differential in order to encourage the 300,000 car owners to switch to unleaded petrol. And experiences from other countries, which do not provide this incentive, show that they just do not want to switch to unleaded petrol. So we have to maintain this differential to make it worthwhile for people to switch to unleaded petrol.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether he is implying that the majority of the existing motor vehicles will not need a converter to use unleaded petrol. Is the Minister suggesting that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> The answer is yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, will such usage give rise to mechanical problems for motor vehicles?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> The answer is no, Sir. The converters will come into the picture only when we introduce stricter Vehicular Emission Standards, which we intend to do in 1993, when we further reduce the limit of emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. That is the time when we have to use converters and converters can only be used if unleaded petrol is made available because lead attacks converters and renders them ineffective. So this is Stage 2 of our plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Koh Lam Son -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Koh Lam Son (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, I do not think the Minister has answered the question whether unleaded petrol has any adverse effect on car engines. I believe that if unleaded petrol is of a certain grade - I think they use the term "RON" - if it is below 92, there can be an adverse effect on the valves of the engines. I would like the Minister to give some assurance on that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Koh is right in the sense that a car is designed to operate at a minimum octane number. Therefore, using a lower octane fuel, leaded or unleaded, will damage the engine. So if a car can use unleaded petrol,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> there will be no danger provided the correct octane fuel as specified by the car manufacturer is used. The oil companies will provide premium grade unleaded petrol (octane Number above 95)and also intermediate grade unleaded petrol (octane Number 91 to 95). So these are available and it should not pose any problems to the 300,000 cars which will switch over to unleaded petrol.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your indulgence to ask the Minister another question? Currently, there are a number of old cars whose owners have paid their quota premiums, ie, to extend the use of the car for another 10 years. There will come a time when leaded petrol is no longer available. How shall we take care of these owners who own cars beyond 10 years?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say that leaded petrol will no longer be available. For as long as there are cars which need to run on leaded petrol, leaded petrol will be available.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Sir, how can the Minister speak on behalf of the refineries?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a question has been asked and my answer is to put at ease the minds of the car owners whose cars cannot use unleaded petrol. In fact, the question has been asked earlier by Mr Chin Harn Tong whether the sale of leaded petrol will still be made available and the answer is yes. Subsequent to that, Mr Chng Hee Kok has asked what will happen to the old cars when leaded petrol is no longer available. My answer is: as long as there are cars which need leaded petrol, leaded petrol will be made available. I am not speaking on behalf of any oil company.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the Minister could clarify to the House. By switching from leaded to unleaded petrol, the fuel consumption of vehicles will definitely go up. Secondly, from my experience, if you were to change from leaded to unleaded petrol without a converter, the engine will give rise to a knocking sound which will damage the car engine.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Choo Wee Khiang has got the whole thing mixed up. Unleaded petrol is petrol which does not contain any lead additive. Lead has traditionally been added to petrol as an anti-knock compound to boost its octane quality. And octane is a measure of a petrol's ability to effectively fuel modern automotive engines. By using advanced petroleum technology, we no longer need to rely on lead to achieve the octane needed by a particular engine. So switching from leaded to unleaded petrol will not in any way affect the consumption of the car. It is a matter of whether we still need to rely on lead to achieve the octane number required or not. We now have substitutes which are safe and therefore we do not need to rely on lead any more. In fact, unleaded petrol will provide all the benefits of power and performance without emitting lead into the atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> I thank the Minister. The Minister sounds like an engine specialist. My concern would be the general concern of the motorists and I hope the Ministry will further promote and market this particular idea so that unleaded petrol will be widely accepted by Singapore motorists.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Architects Bill will repeal and re-enact with changes the existing Architects Act (Cap 12). The main objective of the Bill
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is to permit registered architects to team up with allied professionals to form multi-discipline partnerships and limited liability companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the existing Architects Act provides for the registration of architects in Singapore. This is to regulate their qualifications and their practice. At present, architects are allowed to practise only as sole proprietors or in partnership with members of their own profession. This restriction severely hampers the growth of our architectural consultancy firms.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of partnerships, every partner has to shoulder the onerous burden of unlimited liability for acts committed by other members of the partnership. This discourages the formation of large consultancy firms. The partnership cannot also expand easily without the unanimous consent of all the partners. Every introduction or retirement of a partner is regarded as a cessation of the previous partnership. Clients often react adversely to such changes and interruptions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today's development projects are bigger in scale and far more complex. These projects require integrated design inputs from a team of architects, engineers and allied professionals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several developed countries including the USA, the UK, Canada and Australia have, for some years now, liberalised their rules to allow architects and engineers to practise through limited liability companies. Even Malaysia and Hong Kong have similarly liberalised their laws. These countries have created a conducive legal environment for their consultancy firms to expand and compete favourably in the international consultancy market. Our consultants are at a disadvantage when competing in overseas markets as they lack the size and track record to compete with the established consultancy companies from the other countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In revising the existing Act to allow multi-disciplinary corporate practices with
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> limited liability in Singapore, my Ministry has studied the corresponding legislation of the above-named six countries and we have learned from their experience. We have adopted or adapted parts of their legislation that are applicable to our conditions. Sufficient safeguards have been incorporated in the new Bill to protect public interest and to ensure that commercial considerations do not compromise the professionalism of incorporated consultancy firms. I will discuss these safeguards in further detail.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect consumer interests, the Bill contains the following provisions to ensure that the professional accountability of registered architects is not diminished in any way:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, all professional services must still be provided under the control and management of a registered architect;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, all architectural plans must be signed by registered architects; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, any consultancy firm constituted as a limited liability company must have at least $1 million paid-up capital and be insured against professional liability.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard the professional character of consultancy firms, the Bill contains the following provisions to ensure that the consultancy firms remain under the control of professionals:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Every director of the company's board must be either a registered architect or an allied professional; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Not less than two-thirds of the shareholdings of the company must be owned by registered architects and allied professionals. The Minister may, however, specify a lower proportion in relation to a particular company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Members may like to note that all the other countries also maintain regulatory safeguards to ensure professional accountability. However, most do not impose on these companies special requirements of paid-up capital, shareholding and directorship. While such liberalisation is our long-term aim, my Ministry prefers a cautious approach of gradual liberalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also introduce the use of practising certificates for registered architects. Unlike the present Act, the Bill provides that once an architect is registered, he will remain as a registered architect until he is de-registered by the Board of Architects. However, he cannot practise architecture in Singapore unless he has a valid practising certificate, which is issued on an annual basis. This requirement eliminates the current problem where an architect can escape disciplinary action by simply failing to renew his registration, thereby getting himself de-registered. This follows the provisions of the Medical Profession Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, the Board of Architects will have greater disciplinary powers and new grounds for disciplinary actions, mainly to deal with misconduct, if any, by multi-discipline consultancy companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Board of Architects have also been expanded to allow the Board to establish trust funds, either alone or jointly with other professional bodies, in order to promote learning and education connected with architecture.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Architects Bill is linked to the Professional Engineers Bill, which I will be moving later, and the Land Surveyors Bill, which the Minister for Law will be moving at the next sitting, through the definition of allied professionals for the purpose of multi-discipline corporate practice. They should therefore be considered together by Parliament and brought into operation simultaneously.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill marks an important milestone for the course of professional practices in our construction industry. The Bill has been drafted by the Attorney-General, in consultation with the Board of Architects, and officers from my Ministry. The views of the Singapore Institute of Architects have also been sought and taken into account.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would however like to give an opportunity to individual professionals, as well as other professional bodies in the construction industry, to present their views on the new provisions which affect them. Therefore, I propose to refer the Bill to a Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is important because it affects the work of the architects. In fact, this Bill is linked, as the Minister has rightly pointed out, to the Professional Engineers Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to ask the Minister a few questions. Some of the questions do cover the Professional Engineers Bill which the Minister will be moving later. So I hope he does not mind if I ask questions that cover both Bills.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question I would like to ask is how do the existing Architects Act and the Professional Engineers Act presently restrict architects and professional engineers to practise only as sole proprietors or in partnerships consisting only of members of the same profession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is: what are the advantages for architects to practise in the form of companies? The profession of architecture, like all other professions, requires the qualified person to be professionally responsible for his work. Thus, the new Act in allowing the practice to be incorporated into a company negates his professional responsibility. Will the responsibility of an architect be reduced as allied professionals become his partners of an architectural practice?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. The intent and scope of this Bill is similar to the Professional Engineers Bill which follows, and my comments on this Bill applies to both Bills.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has one of most vigorous building programmes in the world. Our rate of building - both residential and commercial - surpasses most major cities. The world's tallest hotel, the most successful public housing programme, architectural flair and engineering ingenuity, I think Singapore has them all. To maintain this reputation of impeccable expertise, regulatory legislation governing the industry should correspond with this milieu of increasing professionalism.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Bills to tighten control of architects, engineers and land surveyors and promote large multi-disciplinary professional consultancies in the building industry are therefore very timely.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Singapore enjoys the reputation of being relatively corruption free, we all know that private businesses can never be totally free of corruption, ie, illegal gratification to allow the cutting of corners and the substitution of inferior materials. Any dishonest act, fraud or accepting of illicit commissions may result in wrong or poor choice of materials. This will compromise the integrity of the design and the building. The result is putting at risk many lives. I think the New World Hotel tragedy is still fresh in our minds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three new Bills will raise safety standards and cope with all conceivable contingencies, be it a high-rise fire or a mild earth tremor. Although no one can prevent natural disasters, such as earth quakes and typhoons, we can reduce their adverse impact and minimise the incidence of man-made crisis through proper control on the conduct of people responsible. We may not be able to prevent a crisis, but we can at least prevent such a crisis from becoming unmitigated disasters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a small country with our people as our greatest asset, optimising use of such limited resources is paramount. Formation of larger and multi-discipline consultancies, as encouraged by the Bills, is a step in the right direction. The pooling of resources will result in economies in use of administrative and management resources. It will also improve the quality of our manpower.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end result, it is hoped, will be to help local firms compete better and more effectively against foreign corporations and more successfully in the international arena.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, however, Sir, to raise one point with regard to the powers endowed upon the new Boards of Architects and Professional Engineers. Under clause 30 of the Professional Engineers Bill, the pecuniary
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> penalty that may be imposed on an engineer is $20,000 whereas that to be imposed on an architect under clause 27 of the Architects Bill is only $10,000. I cannot see why there is this distinction when in reality the architect is as influential, if not, more so than an engineer in a building project. The proposed penalties for the engineer and architect should, in my view, in fact be reversed. If nothing else, they should remain the same. I hope this matter will be taken up at the Select Committee level. I welcome and support the Minister's intention to commit this Bill to a Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Chee Whye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Chee Whye (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would appreciate very much if the Minister for National Development could comment on the merits and demerits of a system of regulation and licensing that separates the private sector members from the public sector members of the same profession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 3(1) of the Architects Bill and, for that matter, if I may refer also to clause 3 of the Professional Engineers Bill, exempt specifically acts and omissions of Government, including acts and omissions of public officers, from the provisions of the Bills. I am aware that the existing Acts which these new Bills intend to replace also carry the same clauses. But in the eyes of a layman, it would appear strange that the same people in the same profession, doing comparable jobs, should be treated differently, perhaps even discriminatingly. Whether a building or a structure is built by Government or by the private sector, it should have the same professional standards, not just for the submission of plans but for the entire professional practice. Of course, we are aware that there are differences between Government buildings and Government practices compared to the private sector. Government organisations do not carry the same liabilities as those in the private sector. Correspondingly, public officers carry a lower risk and therefore the reward considerations are different. At the same time, we are also aware that public officers in fact do apply themselves to obtain the same high professional standards that are set out in the Bills but they do so voluntarily, not compulsorily.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no doubt that Government itself has good internal disciplines and standards that ensure the practices for the public sector are unquestionably high. Yet, in spite of this, and perhaps because of this, I would urge the Minister to consider whether it is in fact better to give greater transparency to the kind of internal regulations that are available now in the Government Ministries by writing them into the Bills and then making exceptions so that public officers, where it is necessary, can be treated differently.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I press for a more uniform system of handling for the same profession even though I feel that it is possible that you will get more inconveniences within the Ministry and perhaps even more internal cost? But there are benefits to a more equitable system that we should consider. A more even-handed system of regulation within the same profession will be in the public interest as well as in the interest of the profession, particularly since it is Government's intention to equate pay and compensation of the private sector with the public sector. It allows people in the same profession to sit down together and consider their common aspirations, their common problems, sympathetically. Hopefully, the results of such an exercise would be better understanding, better laws for the future, lower costs for buildings in both the public sector as well as the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are moving into a very challenging decade and to maintain our competitiveness, we must require that the public sector work hand in hand with the private sector. Therefore, it is imperative that we should try our utmost to break down any walls that exist between the two sectors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that today our regulators and public servants are doing their best to reach out and understand, but allow me to share with you my experiences. In the past, as a civil servant, I tried my best too to understand and to work closer with private enterprises and citizens in order to further their interests. But there was always a gap that existed between us. Today, I believe I know why the gap exists. It is as if a rock wants to come closer to an egg. Can a rock truly understand the fragility of an egg?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we already have today one of the world's best operating environments for business. If we are to progress we may need a rethinking of the fundamentals to carry us to new heights. In the words of George Shaheen, world-wide managing partner of Andersen Consulting:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Breaking down walls ... reshape the very boundaries of a business. An organisation is a living, evolving entity. All the parts must be aligned to support a clear corporate vision. If we manage any of these elements in isolation, that effort is bound to be, at best, disappointing, and possibly disastrous."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I want to thank the Members who have spoken in support of this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I pointed out in my speech, this Bill is related to the other two Bills, the Professional Engineers Bill as well as the Land Surveyors Bill. I am not surprised that many of the comments made in fact straddle all these Bills.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock raised the question of the advantages of corporate practice and the disadvantages of the present sole proprietorship or partnership requirement. Sir, section 17 of the present Architects Act prohibits a person who is not an architect from offering architectural services. If a team of architects and engineers forms a partnership and carries on business as a firm, that firm will contravene section 17 because the engineers in such a firm will be purporting to offer architectural services when they are in fact not registered as architects. Similarly, architects in an engineering partnership cannot offer engineering services. So when a partnership, whether it is a partnership of architects or engineers, offers to do something, all the members in the partnership are in fact offering to do the same. So obviously, engineers cannot offer to do what the architects offer and vice-versa.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company incorporated under the Companies Act is a separate legal entity from its shareholders. But section 8 of the Architects Act only allows natural persons who possess the prescribed qualifications to be registered to offer the services of architecture. So even if all the shareholders are architects, the company, as a distinct separate legal entity, cannot offer, because the company cannot be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> registered as an architect. The company is therefore prohibited from offering architectural services under the present Architects Act, and the same comments apply to the Professional Engineers Act. So these sections in the present Acts, in fact, restrict both architects and engineers from practising together because every partnership must be made up of people of the same profession. But once they form themselves into a company, as will be allowed under the provisions of the Bill, the company is a separate legal entity and distinct from its shareholders. The company continues whoever leaves or joins, and it is not affected by the death, bankruptcy or retirement of any of the shareholders or directors or employees of the company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in my Second Reading speech, at present, when you want to bring in a new partner, all the partners have to agree, and legally the partnership has to cease and a new partnership has to be formed. And all the people for whom the partnership is doing work will have to be informed that the old partnership has ceased and a new one will take over the responsibilities and liabilities and so on. Many clients are very upset because they do not know whether the responsibilities and liabilities that they have entered into with the old partnership will be carried over into the new partnership. But a company can carry on regardless of who owns it, or who are the directors, or who are its employees. It is a separate and distinct entity. Of course, a company has to comply with the formalities and the requirements laid down in the Companies Act and this relates to all aspects of the company's formation and operation. But this is not an onerous requirement, because there are many compensating advantages. For one thing, it is easier to raise finance for a company than for a partnership as the security can be more readily created by the assets of the company. The tax position also is very much simpler for a company and overall taxation is likely to be lower since the company tax is lower than the highest personal income tax. All salaries, including directors' fees, are deductible before the calculation of profit for corpo-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> rate tax purposes. Moreover, an interest in a company may be given more readily than in a partnership. In other words, you can bring in new shareholders much more easily than you can bring in a partner into a partnership, and you can bring in new people either by making them directors, employing them, or making them shareholders, and you can bring in non-architects. Another important advantage is that it is far more easy to remove an unsatisfactory director than it is to remove a partner.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for these reasons, architects have for some time been very keen that they should be allowed to form themselves into limited liability companies. But, of course, not all architects may choose to follow this route. Architects can choose the most suitable form of practice for their particular circumstances, according to their size, their aspirations and the type of clients they have. And there will be many architects who may still prefer to continue to work as partnerships. So they can, under the Act. It gives them various options.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan also raised the question of professional responsibility. The architect's professional responsibility, or in the case of the engineer, his professional responsibility is not diminished in any way by practising in a corporate framework. An architect, for example, practises his profession in two distinct ways: one, which is professional; the other, commercial. The incorporated company allows wider scope for the practice to expand, as I have already explained. But the registered person who signs the plans, whether as an architect or engineer, is governed by a set of professional code of conduct provided under the Act in his personal capacity, and he is personally liable for disciplinary action should he breach any of these provisions in the Act. There is therefore no reduction in the professional responsibility of an architect or engineer if he chooses to have his practice incorporated as a company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the questions raised by Mr Chng. I think basically he made the point that the quality of buildings has to be ensured. Of course there are many things that go into this, not just architects and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> engineers, but also the provisions in the Building Control Act, and so on. I think Members will remember that as a result of the Hotel New World disaster, the whole Building Control Act was amended and there is far more teeth in the Act now to ensure that buildings are properly constructed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng also raised the question of penalty - why under the Professional Engineers Bill it is $20,000, and under the Architects Bill it is $10,000. I think it is a bit invidious to make comparisons. Some may say that the architect dresses up a building, but the engineer in fact provides the structure. So while the building may look ugly, you can live in it. If the building is weak and it collapses, the responsibility is that much more. But I take the point and I think we should consider this matter at the Select Committee stage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Chee Whye, Nominated MP, touched on clause 3(1) of the Architects Bill and also clause 3 of the Professional Engineers Bill. This is a standard clause. And as he pointed out, it is in the present Act and it is also found in many other Acts. It does not mean that a Government officer is free from liabilities. This Bill that we are now considering covers the registration of Architects and the practice of the profession in the architectural field. This registration as architects does not apply to the Government. Government of course employs architects who are qualified and they may be graduates, or with other qualifications. But the Government buildings under the Building Control Act are not required to comply with the provisions of the Building Control Act. We went through this quite extensively when we considered amendments to the Building Control Act. And the point we made was that in fact the Government buildings are subject to far more stringent requirements than the private sector buildings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not intended that by putting in this clause public officers will be free from any liability. If a public officer, acting on the direction of the Government, does something and, say, a building collapses, people are hurt or killed, the Government can be sued. In fact, the officer concerned can also be sued although he will be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> indemnified by the employer, in this case, the Government. He can also be sued. But what this means is that - this is a strictly legal point, and in fact I wish I had the Minister for Law here to expand on this - the engineers and architects who work for the Government need not go through the process of registration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the other points that the Member has made that the professionals in public sector should work closely with the professionals in the private sector - I take them completely, and I think they are very valid and we are doing everything possible to have more cooperation and exchange of ideas. There are many things that we do in Government which we do not publicise or do not make known to the professionals in the private sector. For some time now, I have made it a practice to tell the Public Works Department that every time they do something new, they should bring around private architects and private engineers to show them what has been done so that they can in turn learn and apply it in the private sector. When HDB introduced a system of quality checking of buildings and how to rate the quality of a building which finally resulted in the "CONQUAS" system, architects were brought to HDB projects and they were given a briefing during the visit on how this is done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, one of the new growth fields in Singapore is retrofitting. My Ministry's building has just gone through a major retrofitting exercise and it will be holding a seminar to explain to the private sector architects and engineers the problems involved in retrofitting and so on. So there is this kind of cooperation. There is an on-going process and programme to disseminate the experience in the public sector to the private sector. But if Mr Leong Chee Whye wants to pursue this matter further, he can always make a submission to the Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

   <b>PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substance of the Bill and the arguments for the Bill are exactly the same as those that I have mentioned for the Architects Bill. The Professional Engineers Bill will repeal and re-enact with changes the existing Professional Engineers Act (Cap. 253). The Bill's main objective, as I mentioned, is similar to that of the Architects Bill, that is, to allow professional engineers to team up with allied professionals to form multi-discipline partnerships and limited liability companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the rationale for moving this Bill is to make our engineers more competitive - the same reason as I have mentioned for the Architects Bill. The same safeguards are provided in this Bill as in the Architects Bill. The Bill also introduces the same concept of practising certificates for professional engineers. And similar to the Board of Architects, the Professional Engineers Board will have greater disciplinary powers to deal with misconduct, if any, by multi-discipline consultancy firms. The Board's functions are also expanded and the Board can also establish trust funds, either alone or jointly with other professional bodies, for the promotion of learning and education in connection with engineering.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the provisions in the Architects Bill, the Professional Engineers Bill has the provision in clause 11(3)(b) under which it seeks to permit only a professional engineer to use as a title before his or her name, the word "Engineer" or its abbreviation "Er." or "Engr." This is to enhance the status of the engineering profession and to prevent the loose usage of the title "Engineer" by non-approved members of the profession. In fact, we hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, that after this Bill is passed, and over time engineers would put before their names "Er." just like doctors put "Dr" before their names, and a Mr Tan, B.Sc (Engineering) would
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> become known as Engineer Tan. This is the practice in other countries, especially in Europe, in Germany, in Holland, where engineers have this prefix before their names indicating that they are engineers. This is to ensure that only professionally qualified engineers use this title. At present, there are many people who go around handing out cards calling themselves engineers. They may be polytechnic graduates, VITB graduates, or just people who have tinkered around with machines for a long time and they call themselves engineers. This provision in the Bill will make sure that only professionals and qualified persons can call themselves engineers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has also been drafted by the Attorney-General in consultation with the Professional Engineers Board and officers from my Ministry, and it has taken into consideration the views of the Institution of Engineers, Singapore. Together with the Architects Bill, it marks an important milestone for the course of professional practice in the construction industry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to enable individual professionals as well as other professional bodies in the construction industry to present their views on the new provisions which affect them. I therefore propose to refer the Bill to a Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill and I would just like to ask the Minister two questions. The first question is: what are the reasons for introducing the use of practising certificates for the registered architects and professional engineers?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: what are the reasons for including clause 11(3)(b) of the Professional Engineers Bill to permit only a professional engineer to use as a title before his or her name the word "Engineer" or its abbreviation "Er." or "Engr."?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have touched on the reasons. In the case of the practising certificate, as I mentioned
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in my Second Reading speech on the Architects Bill, under the present system a person can just de-register himself by not paying the fees. So there have been cases where architects or engineers who are under investigation for disciplinary action just did not pay their fees and did not renew their membership and therefore they were deregistered, and that was the end of the matter. Nothing could be done to deal with them. Under this new provision, once an engineer is registered, he remains an engineer. He cannot de-register himself just by not paying his fees. But in order to practise his particular profession, he has to get a practising certificate which he renews every year. So, even if he does not pay his fees, he will continue to be registered as an engineer and any disciplinary action, which is outstanding, can still be proceeded with. The same with the architects and the other professions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the use of "Er." and "Engr.", I have touched on that. As I have said, this is not a new thing. It is the practice in other countries with a much longer history of employing engineers or a much longer history of educating engineers. In Germany, for example, the title "Diploma Engineer" DIPL-ING is conferred on engineering graduates from the technical universities and they use it as a prefix to their name. In the Netherlands, they also have a similar word - I do not know how to pronounce the Dutch word - but it is "Ir." instead of "Er". We discussed the abbreviations with the engineers and they decided that they would prefer either "Engr." or "Er." As I have mentioned, just as the dentists and the Veterinarians have, over the last few years, begun to use the word "Dr" which was never the case previously, I hope the engineers would also begin to use "Er." before their names. And only engineers and not others masquerading as engineers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

   <b>BUILDING CONTROL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the Building Control (Amendment) Bill is to enable the Building Authority to clear more effectively unauthorised buildings and structures, especially those erected by squatters on private lands.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1980, my Ministry embarked on a programme to clear squatter colonies. HDB, JTC and URA removed squatter structures on State land. Private landowners were asked to do the same for their lands. We gave ourselves ten years to make Singapore squatter-free.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the ten years are up, and we are not quite squatter-free, we have gone a long way. In the ten years, between 1980 and October this year, the Government cleared more than 150,000 squatter cases on State land. There are, however, still 4,700 squatters on State land. These will be cleared by 1992. So all Government or State lands will be free of squatters by 1992. Private land owners have also been given notice to clear the squatters by the end of this year, failing which we said that we would acquire the land. Most, if not all, have taken actions. Some have not been able to complete. We will have to look at each individual case before we decide what to do. But in another two or three years, we should have cleared all squatters. But we still do have, apart from squatters on State land, about 350 lots of private land which are squattered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heaviest concentration of squatters on these private lands or non-state lands (more than 1,500 cases) is found on land managed by the Malayan Railway Administration (MRA). Many of the structures on MRA land are makeshift huts, sited on both sides of the railway track. They were erected without permission. They are safety hazards, potential fire risks and blights on our environment. My Ministry put in some effort to screen off the unsightly structures by thick planting.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> But this is really not a solution because it is just sweeping the carpet but there is dirt under the carpet. The long term solution is to remove them. In fact, many Singaporeans wonder why such blights are still allowed in modern Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we intend to amend the Building Control Act to give the Building Control Division clear powers to act against such unauthorised structures. The Bill also sets out new procedures for enforcement actions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, when the Building Authority detects an unauthorised building, it serves a demolition order on the owner of the building asking him to demolish or remove the unauthorised structure within a specified period of time. If such a person does not comply with the order, he is guilty of an offence. The Building Authority may then take the necessary steps to demolish the unauthorised building.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill now enables the Building Authority to serve the demolition order on either the owner or the occupier of the building. The Building Authority can also close a building and ask the occupier to vacate an unauthorised building. This is to enable demolition to proceed. A new subsection 13(6) is added to make it clear that the Building Authority has the power to demolish temporary structures. Clause 2 of the Bill, in fact, is a consequence of this clause 3. As for the unauthorised structures which are more permanent in nature, action will be taken to clear them under the present Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 25 of the Act to make it clear that the Building Authority can take action itself or ask for the removal of goods, furniture, etc, from a building on which a closure order has been served. The Building Authority can, therefore, clear the unauthorised structure before demolition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 42 of the present Act to provide that where any such goods, or furniture, or other effects are removed, they can be sold at the end of two weeks of their removal and the proceeds can be put into an account and if it is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> not claimed within two years of the sale, the proceeds will be paid into the Consolidated Fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill makes it clear that any notice served shall be deemed to be sufficiently served if the notice is affixed on a conspicuous part of the premises to which it relates. This will help the Building Authority in cases where the owner or occupier of the premises cannot be contacted or traced. There have been instances where everybody disclaims responsibility as either owner or occupier of the building. In such cases, all that the Building Authority has to do is to put the notice on a conspicuous part of the building.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some of the unauthorised buildings are temporary structures which may have had permits issued to them long ago, in one form or other, when they were first constructed. They were meant to meet an immediate temporary need and were, in fact, constructed of shortlived materials. But over the years, they have been repaired, extended and have become a part of the squatter colonies. Clause 7 of the Bill provides that any such temporary permit or permission issued for any temporary building under any law before 5th February 1960 shall be presumed to have lapsed. The Building Authority is empowered to take enforcement action on any temporary building in respect of which no temporary permit is in force. This will make it absolutely clear that the Building Authority has jurisdiction over such temporary buildings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amended Act, the Building Control Division will have clear powers to require the demolition of unauthorised structures and temporary buildings; and to demolish them in the event that the owners or occupiers fail to comply with the demolition orders. If the owners or occupiers fail to demolish as ordered they will be guilty of an offence. They can be taken to court for the offence. They can be made to pay the full cost incurred by the Building Authority to remove such unauthorised structures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly pleased to hear that this amendment Bill will give the Minister the power to clear up squatters located along the Malayan Railway. The squatters in this area are not only an eyesore but I think they also pose a health risk and occasional inconvenience to those who are living in the nearby Housing and Development Board estates. Whilst advocating the clearance of these squatters, I am also apprehensive about the welfare of these squatters. Since the land in question is not State land, will the Minister explain if these squatters, especially Singapore citizens, will be entitled to some form of resettlement compensation or be provided with alternative housing? Will the present resettlement policy apply to these squatters?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to let us know what sort of compensation he has in mind for those buildings which he has said will be removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Ibrahim Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Ibrahim Othman:</b> Sir, I have one question for the Minister. Under clause 7, will this affect the houses, especially the plank and zinc houses on private land, that were built long ago in areas which used to be old kampongs?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chng has raised the question of the MRA squatters and whether any compensation will be offered to those who are eligible. I want to take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, Sir, to expand a little bit on the squatters on MRA land. As I mentioned, the heaviest concentration of squatters in private land is at present found in those lands managed by the Malayan Railway Administration. We, in fact, asked the MRA to clear these squatters and they tried to clear them in 1986, but with limited success. The MRA lands are meant for use for railway purposes only. These lands will revert to Singapore when they cease to be used for railway purposes. So it is a very special type of land.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have agreed with the Malaysian Government that the Singapore Building Authority should move in and take direct
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> action on the unauthorised structures on MRA land. The question may be raised: why do we not do this with other private lands? Why do we not help private landowners to clear the squatters on their behalf? The answer is very simple. Private lands can be used for commercial, residential and other types of developments. MRA lands were alienated for a specific purpose, ie, railway only. All these other buildings that have been put on MRA lands, squatter huts, temples, and so on, are unauthorised, both under the Building Control Act as well as under the Planning Act. The Planning Act requires that the use on that land be according to the use allowed under the Planning Act. The use allowed under the Planning Act for the MRA lands is railway. So all the other uses are unauthorised uses. And even if the owners of such structures apply for permission to regularise their buildings, such permission will not be given because the use will not be permitted. Once railway use ceases, the land reverts to Singapore. So it is a very special type of land. For this reason, we have discussed with the Malaysian Government and have agreed to move in and clear these squatters. That situation, of course, does not apply to other private lands in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building Authority will take immediate action on the unauthorised structures, whether they are temporary or permanent in nature, after this Bill is passed. The clearance exercise will be divided into two phases. Phase 1 will cover the land between Silat Road and Upper Bukit Timah/Chia Eng Say Road. Phase 2 will cover the remaining MRA lands.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our programme is to clear the squatters on MRA lands in three years' time. Although the amended Building Control Act enables the Building Authority to take similar actions on other private lands, I have explained why we will not in fact do it. In order to expedite the process of clearance on MRA land, we will in fact be offering the squatters certain resettlement compensation. And these resettlement benefits will be equivalent to those paid out to squatters on State land, and only squatters occupying the MRA land as of today - today is the cut-off date because I am making this speech and the law will be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> passed today - will be entitled to the resettlement benefits. But of course each case will have to be processed and there is an eligibility requirement and the eligibility criteria applied to those squatters on MRA land will be the same as those which are applied to squatters on State land. All eligible persons and families will be given alternative accommodation. The HDB will make available rental flats as an interim arrangement and then they will be asked to buy flats under the booking system. But our preliminary survey shows that probably about 60% of those who are now living in these squatter colonies will not be eligible for any resettlement benefits, because they are non-citizen single persons. If they are citizen single persons, of course, they will get benefits. They are mainly work permit holders who are using the place to sleep at night and paying very cheap rentals. These people will be given a disturbance allowance and they will have to look for alternative accommodation themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the clearance costs, the resettlement costs, will be paid by the Singapore Government in the first instance and we will offset these against compensation for MRA lands as and when we have to take over these lands for public infrastructure purposes or as and when they are returned to the Singapore Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as private lands are concerned, as I said, we have already asked the private landowners to clear the squatters and it is up to the private landowners to settle with the squatters whatever compensation they want. The Government will not be involved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

   <b>CURRENCY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments are proposed to the Currency Act to allow for the establishment of a Currency Reserve Fund. This Reserve Fund will act as a buffer against fluctuations in the external backing of the Singapore Dollar arising from volatility in exchange rate movements. Amendments to the Act are also proposed to improve the practices and procedures of the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Board maintains two accounts. The first account, the Currency Fund, holds the external assets backing the local currency. By law, the Singapore Dollar is required to be backed at least 100% by external assets at all times. Income from these assets, together with the other operating income of the Board, is credited to another account called the Currency Fund Income Account.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will affect the Singapore Dollar denominated value of the external assets backing the local currency. Should the face value of the currency-in-circulation exceed the value of the Currency Fund, the difference must be met from the Income Account. If the Income Account is insufficient for the purpose, the shortfall will be met from the Consolidated Fund. In the reverse situation where the value of the Currency Fund exceeds that of the currency-in-circulation, the Board may transfer the excess to the Income Account.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Board has to transfer all surpluses in the Income Account to the Consolidated Fund on an annual basis. It is proposed that the transfer no longer be made mandatory. The Board can then set aside a portion of its surpluses every year in a Currency Reserve Fund, and use these to maintain the Currency Fund at a stable
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> level. The Reserve Fund will enable this to be done without the administrative inconvenience of having to make transfers to and from the Consolidated Fund. To ensure that the Reserve Fund will not accumulate surpluses in excess of what is needed to maintain a stable currency backing, the Minister for Finance will monitor the size of the Reserve Fund. Amounts not required for the Reserve Fund will continue to be transferred to the Consolidated Fund annually. Clauses 12 and 13 of the Bill will legislate these changes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposed amendments to the Currency Act are to improve the procedures and practices of the Board. These revised changes would include:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) allowing the Board to provide such other services as it considers necessary besides the issuing of currencies. Clause 2 of the Bill will enable the Board to do this;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) allowing the Board to appoint consultants and agents through clause 4 of the Bill;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) clarifying that banknotes that are illegally dealt with shall not be legal tender, and providing a better definition of the phrase "illegally dealt with" in relation to notes and coins. These will be given effect by clause 6 of the Bill;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) enabling the Board to repossess currency notes and coins that have been illegally dealt with. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for this; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) allowing the Board to seize counterfeit notes and coins. Clause 14 of the Bill is for this purpose.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of the Singapore Totalisator Board Act, the surplus funds of the Board can be invested only in trustee instruments. This stipulation is unduly restrictive, considering the substantial size of the surplus funds held by the Board. As at 31st March 1990, the total liquid assets of the Board stood at $311 million. For the efficient management of funds of this size, it is necessary that the Board be given greater flexibility. Clause 2 of the Bill will allow the Board to invest in such stocks, funds, securities or investments as may be authorised by the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act is also amended to require the Board to submit its annual reports to Parliament. Clause 3 will provide for the presentation of such reports to Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 will also allow the auditor to submit directly to the Minister and the Board reports on any matter arising out of the performance of his audit. The existing provision requires the auditor to submit such reports to the Minister through the Board.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment, read a Third time and passed.
