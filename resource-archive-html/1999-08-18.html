<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Prime Minister whether the

Government will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>



consider  sending  its scholars to leading corporations  in  the

West for training and exposure and subsequently placing them  in

Government-linked companies as part of their career development.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, PSC scholarships are for the purpose of  bringing

talent  into the public service. Nevertheless, the Civil Service

has been seconding to leading private sector companies, officers

who  are able to contribute effectively to the companies as well

as  benefit  from the exposure obtained.  The list of  companies

that   the  Government  has  sent  scholars  to  include   Shell

International  in  London, Singapore Airlines, Singapore  Power,

Straits  Steamship  Land,  Temasek Holdings,  Media  Corporation

(formerly SIM) and DBS Bank.  The Civil Service will continue to

provide  such training and development opportunities,  including

postings  and attachments, for civil servants to learn from  and

be  in  touch  with the private sector, as well  as  the  people

sector.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, would the Government

consider creating a separate career path for these scholars  who

have  signed  up  with  the  Civil Service  as  part  of  career

development  rather than to spend part of their service  in  the

public   service  and  then  move  on  to  the  private   sector

subsequently?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I think this may be difficult because

when  somebody joins the public service, the expectation is that

he  will spend most of his career in the public sector.  He does

not  have  to  be  in the same department, but can  be  in  many

Ministries,  even in statutory boards.  And if we  interpret  it

broadly, he can even be in some GLCs.  But if a person wants  to

spend most of his career in the private sector, then he joins  a

bank, a multinational corporation, or a law firm.  I think it is

very  hard to have an arrangement where you are half in and half

out.   You will have to have a home where you are based and,  in

the case of scholars, the home is the public sector.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> I would like to ask the

Deputy Prime Minister that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>

when  the  scholars are being exposed to the private sector,  is

there  a concern that they might be attracted to private  sector

and  never  come  back to the Civil Service,  and  what  is  the

experience of the Government so far with this attachment.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is a concern. There had been

previous occasions where we had seconded people and, at the  end

of  the  secondment, they said, "I am not coming back." And  the

person to whom he was seconded said, "I am not letting him  go."

This   had  happened  in  the  past.   Normally,  there  is   an

understanding  that when we second somebody out or  somebody  is

seconded to us there is a "no poaching" rule.  You cannot at the

end  of the period say, "I am keeping this person."  So I do not

think  we have any recent problems.  But we have to continue  to

monitor  this.  Basically, we have to make sure that the  public

sector  is  competitive, the terms are good, the  prospects  and

challenges are there and the people are willing to stay and come

back  to  you.  Otherwise, even if you do not second them,  they

will resign and be off.

<div align="center"><b>(Number of students who did not attend kindergarten classes)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following question stood in the name of Mr Shriniwas

Rai -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To ask the Minister for Education how many students in

primary  1  cohorts for the year 1996, 1997  and  1998  did  not

attend kindergarten classes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Question No. 2, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K.</b>

<b>Wong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of Primary 1 students who

did not attend kindergarten classes in 1997 was 397, or 0.8%  of

all  Primary  1 students registered in mainstream schools.   The

corresponding figure for 1998 is 319, or 0.6%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 499 (1.0%) for 1997 and 329 (0.7%) for 1998 did not

provide information on their kindergarten status, even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>

after  repeated  reminders.  Even if we include  this  group  of

children  as  not  having  attended  kindergarten  classes,  the

percentage  of  Primary 1 students registered in our  mainstream

schools,  who did not attend kindergarten classes, is altogether

less than 2%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1997, information on kindergartens attended was

not  captured  for Primary 1 students registered  in  mainstream

schools.

<div align="center"><b>INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION CONVENTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ON EQUAL REMUNERATION AND MINIMUM AGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Ratification)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Manpower whether

his  Ministry  will consider ratifying the International  Labour

Organisation   Convention   (ILOC)   Number   100   on    "Equal

Remuneration",  which deals with non-discriminatory  payment  of

women and men's salary for work of equal value, and ILOC No. 138

on  "Minimum  Age",  which protects children by  establishing  a

minimum age for certain types of work.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  Singapore  has  been a member of the International  Labour

Organisation  (ILO) since 1965, when we became  independent.  We

have ratified a total of 20 ILO Conventions including two of the

seven  core  conventions, namely Convention 98 on the  Right  to

Organise and Collective Bargaining, and Convention 29 on  Forced

Labour. As a member state of the ILO, Singapore participates  in

relevant   ILO   activities.  We  monitor  the  development   of

international   labour  issues  closely   and   assess   whether

additional ILO conventions could be ratified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convention 100 on "Equal Remuneration" aims to ensure a non-discriminatory payment of salary for men and women for work of

equal  value.  In  Singapore, working women  enjoy  good  social

status   and   income  that  are  comparable   to   their   male

counterparts. Our employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>

practices  emphasize payment of salary based on performance  and

meritocracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convention 138 on "Minimum Age" aims at protecting children

by establishing a minimum age for certain types of work. We have

no child labour in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it would appear that we may be in a position to

ratify  these  two  Conventions. However,  ratification  of  ILO

Conventions entails obligations to fully comply with  all  their

provisions.  My Ministry will carry out a thorough study on  the

requirements  and  our  follow-up  actions  under  each  of  the

conventions,  in  consultation  with  NTUC,  Singapore  National

Employers' Federation (SNEF) and other relevant agencies, before

we can consider ratifying Conventions 100 and 138.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, can the Minister

inform  the  House  about  the number  of  complaints  that  his

Ministry  received on gender based discrimination over the  past

few  years?  Second, in future, does he foresee that more  women

will  work  part-time and flexi-time?  How  would  the  Ministry

ensure that such workers are protected from discrimination based

on  gender?   And  the third question is on the  prohibition  of

child  labour.  While it is not a problem in Singapore, can  the

Minister  tell us the number of companies which has  been  found

employing underaged youths in the past few years?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member has raised

three  supplementary  questions.   One  is  on  the  number   of

complaints received on gender based discrimination.  Apart  from

a   small  number  of  complaints  about  gender  discriminatory

recruitment advertisements, my Ministry has so far not  received

any   complaints  concerning  gender  discriminatory  employment

practices adopted by any company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in March this year, my Ministry,

together   with  the  NTUC  and  Singapore  National  Employers'

Federation,   had  jointly  issued  tripartite   guidelines   on

recruitment  advertisements.  I am pleased to inform  the  House

that since the release of these guidelines,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>

recruitment  advertisements which specify gender, age,  race  or

religion  had dropped from about 30% to less than 1%.   We  will

continue  to  persuade  the last few  employers  to  adopt  non-discriminatory practices when they advertise for new employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second supplementary question is on women doing part-time work and also flexi-time arrangements with their employers

and  how  we  will  protect  them from discrimination  based  on

gender.  Sir, currently, employees taking up part-time or flexi-work  are  covered  by the Employment Act and  its  regulations.

Their  terms  and conditions, in respect of statutory  benefits,

are pro-rated based on the number of hours that they work vis-a-vis  the  regular working hours of their full-time  counterparts

within  the company.  Our employment laws and practices  are  of

course  gender neutral.  Sir, my Ministry is also  looking  into

how  our  employment  laws  could  be  made  more  flexible   to

facilitate the employment of women in such work arrangements  so

that they can better balance work and family responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he asked the number of employers who have been

found  employing underaged youths in the past few  years.   Sir,

under  the  Employment Act, a child below the age  of  12  years

shall not be employed in any occupation at all.  My Ministry has

not   received  any  complaint  of  such  underaged   employment

practices for more than 10 years.  Under the Act, young  persons

below  the  age  of  14 years are also not allowed  to  work  in

industrial  undertakings.  They can only be  employed  in  light

work suited to their capability and capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For young persons between the ages of 14 and 16 years, a

small number are employed in industrial undertakings.  Employers

must  notify  the Commissioner for Labour with  details  of  the

young  person and medical report to certify his fitness for  the

job.   Last  year, the Commissioner received notifications  from

1,200  young  persons  to  work in industrial  undertakings.   I

should  hasten to point out that almost all of them are  working

part-time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>

in  fast food restaurants and such kind of establishments.  Fast

food restaurants are classified as industrial undertakings under

the  Factories Act because cutting machines and other  apparatus

for food preparation are used in the premises.  So employers  of

young  persons between the ages of 14 and 16 years in fast  food

restaurants have to notify the Commissioner for Labour  on  this

basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask

the  Minister, when he says that our women in Singapore are paid

comparable  wages,  is  he able to assure  the  House  that  all

employers  in Singapore, whether they are in the private  sector

or  public  sector, pay equal wages to men and women  doing  the

work  of  same value or the same work?  Is that the fact?   And,

secondly,  he says the Ministry, in conjunction with  the  NTUC,

will make a study of the provisions in these two conventions.  I

do  not know how long ago the conventions were promulgated.  Why

has  it taken the Ministry all this while and has it started  in

its study of the provisions?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to equal

wages  for  men  and  women, my Ministry has  not  received  any

complaint that companies adopt discriminatory practices.  If the

hon.  Member  is  aware of such discriminatory  practices  being

adopted by any employer, please bring it to our attention and we

will look into the matter.  As far as we are aware, employers in

Singapore adopt the practice of paying their employees the  same

wages  for  the same kind of work being done.  If the Member  is

alluding  to  the  fact  that  when  you  look  at  the  overall

statistics, there is some wage disparity between male and female

employees,  let  me clarify that wage disparity in  the  overall

statistics   of   our  labour  force  is  not  the   result   of

discriminatory practices.  It is due to the differences  in  the

profile  of  male and female workers in Singapore.  Many  female

workers  drop out of the labour force when they get married  and

start  a  family.   As  a result, the current  stock  of  female

employees is generally younger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>

compared  to the male employees who are older because they  stay

in  the  labour force longer.  So when we average out, the  wage

would indicate that the males tend to get a higher pay than  the

female.   But that is because of this pattern of female  workers

dropping  out of the labour force earlier than the male workers,

and not because the employers deliberately pay them less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a lot of our female workers are also employed

in  the production and related-type of work and as a result, you

will  find  that the overall earnings of female workers  may  be

depressed.   There  again,  it is not  because  they  have  been

discriminated  against but because of the nature  of  work  that

they  do.   If you go to an electronics factory, you  will  find

that  the  vast  majority of the assembly workers or  production

workers  are females.  So, they are paid according to  the  work

they are doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the study to look into whether we can accede to

ratify Convention Nos. 100 and 138, let me point out to the hon.

Member  that there are many countries or nations who are members

of the International Labour Organisation. They do not ratify all

the  conventions.   Even the United States of America  does  not

ratify all the conventions of ILO. In fact, the United States is

one  of  the  countries that has ratified the fewest  number  of

conventions  compared  to  many  other  countries.   It  is  not

surprising that we have not ratified all the conventions because

each  country's laws are crafted based on the special  needs  of

the country.  ILO provides a supranational legal framework.   It

is  only  when we feel fully comfortable and confident that  our

legal  framework  will  not  in any way  clash  with  the  legal

framework  imposed  by  ILO that we then  proceed  to  ratify  a

convention.  That is why I am saying that since we have  reached

this  stage, there is no discrimination on the basis of  gender,

in  terms of wages and also our minimum age laws will not  clash

with  what  ILO is espousing, that we can now look further  into

this  matter to see whether in fact we should proceed to  ratify

these two conventions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister

another supplementary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>

question?   Does  he accept that unless there  is  a  law  which

requires equal pay for men and women, there is very little point

in  women complaining to his Ministry? He says that his Ministry

has never had any complaints so far.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me explain again

to  the hon. Member that even ILO does not require countries  to

enact a legislation on equal remuneration if they want to ratify

the  convention.   In some instances, ILO will  only  require  a

tripartite  declaration to the effect that  the  wages  will  be

based  on  the work performed rather than on the gender  of  the

workers.   There is no reason for us to adopt his approach  that

for  every  issue, we must create or establish a law  to  ensure

that  the matter is dealt with.  We have, over all these  years,

made  progress  and  demonstrated that the  meritocratic  system

works and employees will be paid according to the value of their

contribution  to  the  company  and  no  employer  is  going  to

deliberately  circumvent  this  by  paying  his  female  workers

significantly  less than what he pays to his male  employees  if

they are doing the same job.

<div align="center"><b>RESTORATION OF WORKERS' RIGHTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether  the Government has any intention to restore to  workers

the rights which were taken from them in 1968.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> The Industrial Relations Act was amended

in  1968  to  provide  a  sound basis for  enhancing  industrial

relations.   The  amendments  drew  a  distinction  between  the

functions  of  management and trade unions while  balancing  the

interest  of  both  parties.  Thus,  under  the  new  provision,

matters   like   promotion,  transfer,   hiring,   retrenchment,

dismissal  and assignment of duties were classified  as  matters

not   for   collective  bargaining  between  trade  unions   and

employers.   To  prevent  abuses  by  employers,  the  amendment

provided  for  workers and trade unions to seek redress  through

conciliation and adjudication, including appeals against  unfair

dismissal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative amendments in 1968 also involved the

rationalisation of the basic terms and conditions of  employment

and the rights and obligations of employees under the Employment

Act.   For  example, an employee would be entitled to two  days'

pay  for  work on a holiday instead of three days' pay  provided

the  employee  does  not  absent himself without  valid  grounds

immediately before and after the holiday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While employers were given the discretion to carry out

their managerial functions without being subjected to collective

bargaining, the right of trade unions to take industrial  action

was  not removed.  Such rights continue to be enshrined  in  the

law.  The main difference is that a union, which intends to take

strike action, must first obtain the consent and mandate of  its

members  through a secret ballot.  This requirement of a  secret

ballot  is  in line with the democratic principle that  such  an

extreme  action  should  reflect the collective  wishes  of  the

members.  The need to seek the mandate of members through secret

ballot  before an industrial action has also been introduced  in

other  countries  such  as Malaysia, Australia  and  the  United

Kingdom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to executives joining the rank-and-file unions,

Members  will recall that I had already, in reply  to  the  hon.

Member, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang on 3rd August, informed the House that

my  Ministry  is  studying  the  issue.   We  have  convened   a

Tripartite Committee to consider how to bring our laws on  union

membership  up  to  date especially with  regard  to  executives

joining  unions  and  the areas for which  union  representation

should be allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1968 amendments of the Employment Act and Industrial

Relations  Act succeeded to strike a fair and equitable  balance

between the interest of workers and employers.  As a result,  we

have  enjoyed  more  than  30  years  of  harmonious  industrial

relations,  steady  economic  growth  and  higher  incomes   for

workers.  Our legal framework has been a key factor for BERI  to

rank the Singapore workforce as No. 1 in the world for almost 20

years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>

Hence, we should only make changes which will better equip us to

deal with the evolving workforce and business environment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister: did the trade

unions  not  have all these rights before 1968:   the  right  to

negotiate  for  better  wages, the  right  to  be  consulted  on

dismissals  and transfers, before the law was amended  in  1968?

Did  they  not have these rights?  And were they not taken  away

from them?  Is the Minister aware that the Senior Minister, some

years  ago,  said  in a BBC interview that he had  to  tell  the

workers  then that they should give up these rights because  the

British  were  withdrawing their bases and it was necessary  for

Singapore  to  do  something about its economic programme  which

would   be  affected  as  a  result  of  the  withdrawal?    The

implication, he said, was that they would be restored  once  the

economy  improved  and the situation made it  possible  for  the

rights to be restored.  How long have the workers got to wait?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the right of workers to

negotiate for better wages is enshrined in the law.  That is our

system  of  collective  bargaining and  it  is  being  exercised

regularly  by workers as represented by their unions  when  they

negotiate  for their collective agreement.  None of  that  right

has  been  taken away or eroded.  With regard to  dismissal  and

transfer, I have already said in my main reply that this was  in

fact  removed  for good reason because it was considered  to  be

rightfully  the functions of management.  The way they  promote,

transfer,  hire,  retrench  or dismiss  employees  should  be  a

managerial  decision or management function.  But  at  the  same

time,  we have provided a mechanism for employees who feel  that

they   are  wrongfully  dismissed  or  their  services  unfairly

terminated to make an appeal to the Ministry for their cases  to

be  studied  and investigated and the Ministry would  then  take

action  to ensure that if they were in fact wrongfully dismissed

or their services unfairly terminated, they would be fairly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>

compensated or reinstated as the case warrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point he mentioned about what the Senior Minister

stated,  I  did not have the exact context of what was  said  on

that  particular occasion.  But what I want to say here is  that

whatever changes that we make to our labour law must be  changes

that can help us to better compete in a globalising environment.

You  know that the world is undergoing rapid changes. There  are

no longer barriers to movement of capital and technology.  If we

were  to  change our labour laws and as a result of the  change,

introduce   a  lot  more  confrontation,  adversarial  relations

between  the unions representing the workers and the  employers,

we may, in effect, be putting ourselves at a disadvantage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1968, our labour law had severe inherent

weaknesses.   These weaknesses resulted in constant  bickerings,

confrontations  and disputes between the unions  and  employers.

Unions were exploiting loopholes in the law.  Workers themselves

were also exploiting loopholes in the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the Member an example. Prior to 1968, workers

could claim triple pay for working on a holiday.  The outcome of

it  was  that  there  were many reported  instances  of  workers

absenting  themselves on the day before and the  day  after  the

holiday, but turning up to work on the holiday itself to collect

triple pay.  So, in effect, he got two off-days for working  one

day.   I do not think this kind of practice should be encouraged

and  we proceeded to amend our law to plug such loopholes in the

law.   I  think  what  we have today is a better  framework  for

managing our industrial relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, before 1968, the trade unions were not

required  to  have  a  secret ballot before  they  took  extreme

industrial  action in launching a strike.  In fact,  many  trade

unions  took action without securing a mandate first from  their

members.  They called their union members out on strike  without

any  due regard to the interest and welfare of the workers,  and

the consequences to the company. Trade unions in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>

those  days,  before  the 1968 amendments,  also  intervened  on

issues  which,  as  I have said earlier on,  should  rightly  be

within  management domain, such as hiring, promotion,  transfer,

dismissal  and  even the assignment of duties.  Those  were  the

days  where trade unions would confront and challenge  employers

over  issues, such as redeployment of their members  within  the

company.   I  do  not  think we should  try  to  reinstate  such

provisions  in  the  law because that would result  in  unending

disputes  between workers and the employers.  And this was  what

happened  in  the  60s. The legal framework  in  existence  then

resulted  in  endless  disputes  leading  to  confrontation  and

strikes at the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the Member an example. In 1955 alone, there

were 275 strikes, resulting in a loss of almost one million man-days.   In one year alone, there was a loss of one million  man-days.   In  1961, the industrial disputes also resulted  in  116

strikes,  and the loss of more than 400,000 man-days.  So,  that

kind   of  legal  framework  resulted  in  an  adversarial   and

confrontational industrial relations climate.  I  do  not  think

that  will  equip  Singapore to deal  with  today's  competitive

economic  conditions.  If anything, perhaps the hon. Member  may

be  trying  to  hamper our economic prospects  by  advocating  a

return  to  the  bad old days of industrial relations.   We  can

surmise what would be his reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is quite clear, obviously, is that in an adversarial

and  confrontational  industrial relations climate,  very  often

political  parties  are  able  to exploit  unhappy  trade  union

members  and  even  the leadership, and this is  precisely  what

happened  in  the  60s  where political  parties  were  able  to

influence  various trade unions and to use them  for  their  own

political objective.  I am not saying that the hon. Member is in

fact having such a strategy in mind.  But I am saying that if we

take  his advice and proceed to do what he is urging us  to  do,

then  we  are  likely to end up in a situation where  the  trade

union  movement, instead of serving the welfare of the  workers,

could  well  end  up being an instrument to be used  to  advance

other people's interest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>

and agenda, and not necessarily that of the workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, before I ask the Hon. Minister

supplementary  questions,  may  I  thank  him  for  not  casting

aspersions on my sincerity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentions 1955. Does he realise that in 1955,

I  was around in those days, the present Senior Minister was the

legal  advisor to a great many trade unions.  The PAP  then  was

championing  the rights of workers, wanting greater  rights  for

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is this. The Minister says anyone

unfairly  dismissed can appeal to his Ministry.  I  have  asked,

time  and  time again, why can we not have an  Unfair  Dismissal

Act.   Why is it that our workers cannot be given their  rights,

but  be  allowed  to depend upon the patronage of  the  Ministry

concerned?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was also around in

1955.  Certainly, I was much younger than the hon. Member.   The

point  that  the first generation leaders of the PAP,  including

the   then  Secretary-General  and  Prime  Minister,  were  very

involved  in  the  trade union movement does not  invalidate  my

point.  They were there to serve the interests and the rights of

the  workers  who had engaged their service, unlike  others  who

were  there  to use the trade unions and their organisations  to

advance  their  own  political agenda  at  the  expense  of  the

interests  and  the  rights  of the  workers.   So  there  is  a

difference.  And if the hon. Member is not aware of it, I  would

urge  him to read Senior Minister's memoirs, because it  is  set

out  quite clearly what the Senior Minister tried to do  in  his

younger days in championing the rights of the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on unfair dismissal, this has been a question that he

has  trotted out at every opportunity, and since it is the  same

question,  I  am bound to give him the same answer, because  the

answer  cannot vary just because he trots out the same  question

on  a  different occasion.  The answer is that workers who  feel

that they have been unfairly dismissed have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>

very  efficient and low cost mechanism to which they can  appeal

to  seek  redress.  Our experience at the Ministry is  that  the

mechanism has worked very well, in fact, over the last 30 years.

We  deal with thousands of cases a year, and our decisions  have

always  worked in the interest of both parties.   We  have  been

able to secure a mutually satisfying resolution to many of these

disputes.   Whether it is unfair termination  or  dismissal,  we

have always been able, after conciliation, to reach an agreement

between  the  employer and the employee in the vast majority  of

cases.  So we see no reason now to proceed on a different  tack,

the one that is advocated by the hon. Member, to enact a new law

for  dealing with such cases.  We already have a mechanism  that

works,  a mechanism that is efficient, low-cost and expeditious.

So, why do we need to create a new framework?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   geriatric  services  have  been  developed  at  Alexandra

Hospital.   The  Department  of  Geriatrics,  set  up  in  1994,

provides  comprehensive  specialised  outpatient  and  inpatient

medical  care  to the elderly.  The Geriatric Day Hospital  also

provides outpatient geriatric assessment and rehabilitation  for

those  who need not be hospitalised.  Special focus is given  to

the  more  common disabling medical conditions in  the  elderly,

such as stroke management, bone and joint problems, dementia and

other   mental   problems,  and  continence  management.     The

Department  in  Alexandra Hospital is also the focal  point  for

various  community  support services  for  the  elderly  in  the

western sector.

<br><br><!-- Dr S Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister, in

the light of the

further plans to develop such a service?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We have three regional hospitals - Alexandra Hospital for the western area, Tan Tock Seng Hospital

for the central area and Changi General Hospital for the eastern

area   -   to serve the geriatric needs of the people living  in

these  areas.  So far, the level and the extent of the  services

seem  to  meet the needs of the community, including the various

community outreach programmes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta-Ayer Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister whether there are enough geriatric departments  in  our

should  we not increase and prioritise this area of health  care

in  view  of  the  fast increasing numbers  of  the  elderly  in

Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, we recognise that Singapore's

population  is  aging.  That is why we have  set  up  the  three

geriatric  departments at the three regional hospitals,  and  we

are  building  up the geriatricians as well as geriatric-trained

nurses  to  meet the needs of the community.  We  are  confident

that  we  can  provide  the necessary support  to  the  aged  in

out  from  annuities  bought with the CPF Minimum  Sum  are  tax

exempt.

studying the adequacy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>

of  retirement  provisions for Singaporeans in the  light  of  a

greying  population.   If tax benefits are useful  to  encourage

people  to  build  up  their retirement  savings  and  use  them

prudently when they retire, the Government would consider  them.

In  particular, we will study whether to extend the current  tax

exemption for annuities bought with the Minimum Sum to annuities

bought with CPF savings beyond the Minimum Sum.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN DOCTORS PRACTISING IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health (a) whether

foreign doctors practising in Singapore are subject to the  same

regulations  and medical ethics as local doctors, and  (b)  what

machinery  his  Ministry  has  to regulate  these  standards  on

practising doctors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all doctors, whether

Singaporeans or foreigners, are subject to the same  regulations

and medical ethics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Medical Council (SMC) will only register

doctors who have met the required standards before they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>

allowed  to  practise  in  Singapore.  Medical  registration  is

granted to overseas trained doctors, Singaporeans or foreigners,

if the applicant  -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) holds a basic medical degree awarded by one of the medical

schools listed in the Schedule of the Medical Registration  Act;

or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) holds a recognised specialist qualification, and possesses

special  knowledge  and skills in a field of medicine  that  are

needed by Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMC has drawn up an "Ethical Code" to be observed by

all   doctors.   Since  1995,  all  newly  registered   doctors,

Singaporeans   and  foreigners,  are  required   to   take   the

Physician's  Pledge  of  the  SMC,  which  serves  as  a  formal

affirmation   of  their  commitment  to  follow  the   code   of

professional  conduct and ethics. Disciplinary  action  will  be

taken against doctors who breach the Code.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMC will act on all complaints received concerning

doctors'  professional  conduct and  fitness  to  practise.  The

penalties that can be imposed on doctors include censure,  fine,

suspension or even removal from the register.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints are usually received from members of the public.

My  Ministry's  Medical Audit and Accreditation  Unit  regularly

inspect health care establishments and will report any lapses in

professional  practice  by doctors to  the  SMC  for  follow  up

action.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether the Johns

Hopkins  Hospital is under the jurisdiction of the  Ministry  of

Health,  as it may have come under the Foreign Direct Investment

same  laws  and  practice guidelines as for local hospitals  and

local medical personnel?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes. The

registered by the SMC, just like any other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>

medical   professional  who  wants  to  practise  in  Singapore.

Similarly, the Johns Hopkins clinic itself will have to  undergo

registration by the Medical Audit and Accreditation Unit  of  my

Ministry.  So Johns Hopkins will have to follow the same  rules,

as any other practitioner and any other clinic in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the  Minister  if  he  is aware of  any  practices  by  the

practitioners in Johns Hopkins Clinic to solicit business  in  a

way that other doctors in Singapore are not allowed to?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I guess the Member is

referring  to  the recent press report about a  petition  by  50

medical  practitioners  regarding the advertisement  put  up  by

Johns  Hopkins.  Let me say that there are two elements in  that

complaint.  One is whether we use the same rules for the  people

practising  in Johns Hopkins Hospital.  There is this allegation

that  it  is  an uneven playing field.  SMC has replied  to  the

complainants on 3rd August 1999 to say that the same rules  were

applied  to the registration of doctors.  To-date, SMC has  only

registered two John Hopkins specialists.  Both of them have  the

American  Board certification in internal medicine  and  medical

oncology,  which  are recognised specialist qualifications.   So

the  two  specialists in Johns Hopkins Hospital have  been  duly

registered based on the same rules that we apply for Singaporean

specialists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the allegation about the advertisement, this matter

is still under

<div align="center"><b>STAMP DUTIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.17 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Stamp Duties Act to give

legislative effect to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>

the  introduction  of  Electronic-Stamping (E-Stamping)  and  to

allow  the  Commissioner  of  Stamp  Duties  (the  Commissioner)

additional  powers in administering the Stamp  Duties  Act  (the

Act).   The  Act  is also amended to introduce a  general  anti-avoidance provision (similar to that in the Income Tax  Act)  to

minimise instances whereby parties scheme to reduce or avoid the

payment of stamp duty on any dutiable instrument.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of electronic stamping, or E-Stamping, is

another initiative to boost the use of information technology in

the   public  service.   E-Stamping  will  replace  the  current

physical stamping of documents with franking machines or revenue

stamps.   A stamp certificate will be issued on-line to  certify

that a dutiable instrument has  been duly stamped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fully implemented, E-stamping allows users, mainly

lawyers and other tax agents, to e-stamp dutiable instruments in

the convenience of their own offices. E-Stamping also goes hand-in-hand  with electronic payment of stamp duty. This  would  not

only  minimize the exposure to risk related to manual processing

of  dutiable  documents  and  payments,  but  also  enhance  the

efficiency of collection of stamp duty.  Amendments to  the  Act

are necessary to give legislative effect to E-Stamping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamp duty is an important source of Government revenue.

Sufficient  safeguards must be put in place to  prevent  revenue

leakage.   To  facilitate the administration  of  the  Act,  the

Commissioner   of   Stamp  Duties  would  be  given   additional

administrative powers to conduct investigations and  to  prevent

evasion  of  stamp duties.  Amendments are made to  the  Act  to

provide  for duty payable by a deceased person to be recoverable

from  his estate so long as the assessment is made within  three

years  after the death.  It also requires a company's liquidator

to   make  full  provisions  for  the  payment  of  duty  before

distributing the company's assets to shareholders.  In addition,

the  Act is amended to confer on the Commissioner powers similar

to the Comptroller of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>

Income  Tax to enable him to call for and have access to  books,

accounts and records.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been instances where parties scheme to reduce or

avoid  the payment of stamp duty on dutiable instruments. Clause

15  of  the  Bill  enacts  a  general anti-avoidance  provision,

similar to that in the Income Tax Act, to allow the Commissioner

to  disregard  any  arrangement that is directly  or  indirectly

structured to avoid, evade or reduce the liability in stamp duty

and to make appropriate adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several penalties for offences have not been revised for

many  years.   These penalties would lose their deterrent effect

if  they  do  not increase in tandem with increases  in  general

income level.  Some new penalties are introduced in relation  to

the  improper use and counterfeiting of E-Stamping certificates.

The  Act  is  thus  amended  to revise  existing  penalties  and

introduce new ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes the following amendments to the Stamp Duties

Act:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Introduction of new sections 6A - 6D to give

legislative effect to the new E-Stamping System.  Other  general

amendments to sections 2, 7, 11, 12, 38, 46, 48 and 57 are  also

made in connection with the introduction of E-Stamping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Introduction of new sections 70A, 70B and 70C to

confer  on  the  Commissioner powers similar  to  those  of  the

Comptroller  of  Income Tax to call for,  and  have  access  to,

books, accounts and records.  Provisions are also introduced  to

allow duty payable by a deceased person to be recovered from his

estate  so  long  as the assessment is made within  three  years

after  his death, and to require a company's liquidator to  make

full provisions for the payment of duty before distributing  the

company's assets to shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Introduction of a new section 33A, similar to section

33  of  the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134), to allow the Commissioner

to disregard any arrangement that is directly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>

or indirectly structured to avoid, evade or reduce the liability

in stamp duty and to make appropriate adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Amendments to sections 62, 63, 66 and 77 to revise

existing penalties upwards to commensurate with the severity  of

various  offences.   New  sections  64,  65  and  65A  are  also

introduced  for  offences  arising from  the  improper  use  and

counterfeiting  of  E-Stamp certificates,  furnishing  of  false

information and obstruction to the Commissioner and his officers

in performing their duties under the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the Bill.  Before commenting on the provisions of the

Bill, I would like to declare my interest as a lawyer in private

practice  where I advise clients on commercial transactions  and

corporate restructuring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my comments relate to clause 15 of the Bill which

proposes  to  insert a new section 33A.  The  first  thing  that

struck  me  about the proposed new section is its similarity  to

the  anti-avoidance provisions contained in section  33  of  the

Income  Tax  Act.  Section 33A purports to give the Commissioner

of  Stamp Duties the same wide discretionary powers given to the

Comptroller  of Income Tax to disregard and/or vary transactions

entered into by the taxpayer and to make such adjustments and to

impose additional tax, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raises a number of concerns with members of the

business community, and I would like to raise these concerns  in

this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as income tax and stamp duties affect the financial

position of the taxpayer, tax and stamp duty planning has become

an  integral  part  of modern day commerce  and  finance,  where

products  and  transactions are becoming ever more  complex  and

sophisticated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that the oft-cited dictum of Lord Tomlin in

the  English  House of Lords case of IRC vs. Duke of Westminster

(1936) has even greater resonance when applied in the context of

anti-avoidance  rules in stamp duty.  In that  case,  the  judge

said  that "Every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs

so  that  the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts  is  less

than it otherwise would be.  If he succeeds in ordering them  so

as  to  secure  that  result, then, however  unappreciative  the

Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his fellow taxpayers may be of

his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased tax".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over again, the courts have said there is nothing

sinister  in so arranging one's affairs so as to keep  taxes  as

low as possible, because nobody owes any public duty to pay more

than  the law demands.  These principles apply even more  so  to

stamp  duties  as  they  are  a tax on  documents  and  not  the

underlying transactions per se.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides encroaching on the above established principles,

the new provision also seems to me to be particularly antecedent

to  the spirit of encouraging greater freedom and creativity  in

the  financial  sector  in Singapore.   Recently,  it  has  been

recognised  that there needs to be a radical change  in  mindset

towards  financial regulation in Singapore.   The  new  approach

will be central to the long term development of Singapore into a

world-class  financial hub.  It is hoped that the  change  would

remove  the  self-imposed shackles on the financial institutions

here  and  lead to more new and creatively structured  financial

products.  In view of this change in approach, it seems to me to

be  taking  a step backwards to give the Commissioner such  wide

powers  in  an  area  that impacts on so  much  of  commerce  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the short and medium terms also, we must not forget

that  we  are still in a critical period of recovering from  the

economic  crisis  of  the  last two years.   Already  there  are

observations that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>

momentum of corporate restructuring has slowed and companies are

becoming  less  committed to reform as the  short  term  outlook

becomes   better.   By  itself,  restructuring   involves   many

difficult  decisions, and companies should not be burdened  with

the additional uncertainty in this area of stamp duty planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in achieving a particular commercial result, there may

be  many  different ways of structuring the transactions leading

to  it.   Tax mitigation is admittedly one of the more important

factors  in  deciding which way to carry out  the  transactions.

The   proposed  section  33A  raises  concerns  as  to  how  the

Comptroller  or  the  Commissioner  will  view  such  commercial

structures,  some  of  which  have become  a  matter  of  common

practice today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, an outright sale of a property by way of

conveyance  will attract stamp duty ad valorem at  the  rate  of

approximately  3%  of the consideration.   So  if  the  purchase

consideration is $1 million, the stamp duty chargeable is  about

$30,000.  However, if the property is owned by a special purpose

investment  holding company, the shareholders can sell  all  the

shares  of  the company to the purchaser instead who  will  then

obtain  effective  ownership and control of the  property.   The

sale  of  the  shares will attract stamp duty at a substantially

lower  rate  of  0.2% of the value of the  shares.   So  if  the

property asset is valued at $1 million, but the company has bank

borrowings  and  other liabilities of $500,000,  the  total  net

value  of  the  shares  will be $500,000,  and  the  stamp  duty

chargeable on the transfer of all the shares is only $1,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using this example, could the Minister clarify whether the

exception  in  the  new  section  33A(3)(b)  might  help?   This

subsection  states that section 33A  "shall  not  apply  to  any

arrangement carried out for bona fide commercial reasons and had

not  as  one  of its main purpose the avoidance or reduction  of

duty".   But in subsection (2), "arrangement" means "any scheme,

trust, grant, covenant, agreement, disposition, transaction  and

includes  all  steps by which it is carried into effect."   Does

this mean that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>

Commissioner  of  Stamp  Duties will scrutinise  any  particular

intermediate  step and rule that that particular step  has  been

put  in  place for the purpose of reducing stamp duty?   In  the

sale   of  property  example  above,  although  the  bona   fide

commercial  reason for the whole arrangement is the transfer  of

the  property, the main purpose of choosing a sale of the shares

of the property-owning company, and not the property itself, may

very well be to reduce the amount of stamp duty payable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another example, for financing of a project development,

the  bank will usually take as security, among other things,  an

assignment of the building contract, an assignment of  the  sale

proceeds,  as  well as a mortgage over the land.  If  the  legal

assignment were stamped as a primary security, it would  attract

ad  valorem duty at the rate of 3% of the contract value.  It is

thus  common  for  banks to take the mortgage as  the  principal

security  and nominate the others as secondary security.   Stamp

duty  on  mortgages is capped at $500, and the  other  documents

will attract nominal stamp duty of $10 each.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many more examples of stamp duty planning schemes

which are widely used in commerce and by individuals to minimise

the  amount  of  stamp  duty payable, as allowed  by  law.   The

business  community is rightly anxious about the  new  provision

because  it  is  vague and silent about these tried  and  tested

schemes.   Could  the  Minister clarify the  scope  of  the  new

section  33A and also place on record what would not  be  within

its ambit?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like income tax, stamp duty is wholly a creature of

statute   and  it  is  an  established  principle  of  statutory

interpretation  that  clear  words  are  needed  to  impose  tax

liability on a person, and that any ambiguity should be resolved

in favour of the taxpayer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, I would have liked this Amendment Bill to

address  the  perennial  uncertainty in relation  to  the  share

reconstruction exemptions under the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>

section  15 of the principal Stamp Duties Act.  Because  of  the

uncertainty  in  the  definition of "scheme of  reconstruction",

many  companies and practitioners have had to write  in  to  the

Stamp  Duty  Office  to  seek  confirmation  as  to  whether   a

particular  restructuring exercise falls  within  the  exemption

afforded by section 15.  Unfortunately, the criteria adopted  by

the  Stamp  Duty  Office appear to have shifted internally  over

time  and  now  include a condition that the restructured  group

should  not be publicly listed within two years after completion

of  the  restructuring.  This is surely an  area  in  which  our

existing legislation is due for clarification.  In this  regard,

we  might look to the Hong Kong example, where under their Stamp

Duties  Ordinance, there is much clearer and more  certain  "90%

shareholding" rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial transactions are of course extremely varied. I

understand  it is not possible for the Minister to clarify  each

and  every transaction in this House.  The Commissioner of Stamp

Duties should therefore issue clear guidelines from time to time

on  the  provisions of the Act.  These measures are  crucial  in

ensuring  that  our  tax  laws  are  transparent  and  could  be

interpreted with a sufficient degree of certainty by  foreigners

and  locals  alike.   I  believe a predictable  and  stable  tax

environment is fundamental to the continued development  of  the

financial and other business sectors in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not a tax

expert  like  the hon. Member Mr Ong Kian Min.  So  I  will  not

touch on the taxing aspects of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this Bill however as an opportunity to reform and

streamline  our  laws for the world of Internet trading  and  to

prepare  our  country and our business and  public  sectors  for

electronic document and information management systems.  So even

though  this  Bill, as it stands before the House, is  primarily

one to deal with the physical attachment of E-stamps to physical

documents through electronic processes, I would like to urge the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>

Minister to perhaps look wider and further especially in  future

exercises  to amend the Stamp Duties Act and the different  Acts

dealing with taxes, duties and Government charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, for example, deals with the stamping of

documents.  And in the First Schedule of the main Act, there  is

mention of the stamping of contract notes.  I would just like to

ask  the  Minister if he would clarify if these  contract  notes

were  to  be  electronic, whether these would also  need  to  be

stamped, or whether the duty would be waived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a new section 6B proposed in clause 5 of the Bill,

and this also deals primarily with the electronic procedures for

the  E-stamp  certificates  where  the  electronic  stamping  of

documents  will  one  day  be possible for  documents  that  are

created  online.  So if future developments lead  that  way,  as

they would especially when we have Internet stock trading and so

on,   then  there  would  be  a  need  to  perhaps  clarify  the

terminology  of  this  provision when it  deals  with  the  word

"certificate", for example, whether such certificates  could  be

extended to electronic equivalents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently our Electronic Transactions Act does not permit

most  of the documents in the First Schedule of the Stamp Duties

Act  to  be electronic.  But there could come a day when perhaps

even  the  Ministry  of  Finance  finds  it  comfortable  to  do

something like this in a paperless fashion.  Perhaps even  there

might  come  a  day  when the Government needs  to  include  new

instruments to be stamped, so I think there is a need to clarify

if these certificates would one day be completely electronic and

online.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 30 of the Bill deals with certain powers for the

Commissioner to exercise.  As the Minister has said, it is based

on  the  Income  Tax  Act and the powers of the  Comptroller  of

Income  Tax.   I think section 70C that is proposed,  especially

subsection (2), is a good provision to have in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>

this Bill and in the Income Tax Act and in any of the other  tax

Acts  that we have, in addition to any other Acts that deal with

customs duties, excises, Government charges and fees, and so on.

The  reason I say this is that it makes it very clear  that  the

Comptroller or the Commissioner of each of these respective Acts

has  got the power to look at computer records.  By implication,

therefore,  computer records for tax purposes or  tax  documents

are  permitted and legal in the law.  And I have to say this  in

this  House  because  there  is  a very  strong  misapprehension

amongst  many lawyers, auditors and businessmen that it is  fine

to  have  an information technology-based information system  or

document management system, but these systems are good only  for

in-house  records.  But the moment you need  to  deal  with  the

Inland   Revenue   Authority  of  Singapore  and   the   Customs

Department, you must produce paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, despite the provisions that we already have introduced

in  the Electronic Transactions Act and Companies Act permitting

electronic   record  keeping,  such  people   still   have   the

misapprehension that they cannot do so and therefore it would be

good if the Minister could clarify at this opportunity presented

before the House to clarify these points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the

Member  for Pasir Ris GRC that the public should only pay  taxes

in accordance with what the law requires, and no more.  However,

I  would  point  out that stamp duty is an important  source  of

Government  revenue.  In fiscal year 1998,  stamp  duties  worth

$950  million  were  collected.  And in  fiscal  year  1997,  it

amounted to $1.7 billion.  The general anti-avoidance provision,

which is similar to that of the Income Tax Act, is introduced to

ensure  that there are sufficient measures to safeguard  revenue

and  to  deter parties from scheming to reduce or systematically

avoid  payment  of  stamp  duty on  dutiable  instruments.   The

introduction of new section 33A is neither to stifle  bona  fide

commercial transactions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>

nor  to hamper corporate restructuring.  It simply empowers  the

Commissioner  to  disregard  and  make  adjustments  to  certain

arrangements which are clearly carried out solely or principally

to evade tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax avoidance schemes are purely tax-driven with little or

no  commercial value or rationale.  This is unlike tax  planning

where  the  transactions or schemes have some commercial  basis,

and  where  the  issue  is  structuring the  most  tax-efficient

arrangement   in   accordance  with  the  relevant   tax   laws.

Generally,  tax planning, if carried out within the confines  of

existing  laws,  would  not be caught  under  section  33A.   In

assessing whether a particular scheme or arrangement would  fall

under  the  ambit of section 33A of the Act, the Inland  Revenue

Authority  would  amongst other things look at the  presence  of

artificiality or contrived transactions to reduce or  avoid  tax

liabilities but which have little or no commercial basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress that the aim of the new section is

to  reduce blatant or contrived tax avoidance arrangements which

can  lead  to  systematic or significant revenue losses  to  the

Government.   It  is not intended to affect genuine  and  normal

commercial   transactions,   but  because   anti-tax   avoidance

transactions  are  getting more complex  that  the  Commissioner

needs  a  general  anti-avoidance provision  to  enable  him  to

effectively  counter  tax avoidance, and  also  to  serve  as  a

deterrent  in  order to safeguard revenue.  Members  may  recall

that  this same issue was debated in the House in 1988 when  the

current anti-avoidance provision was put in place in the  Income

Tax  Act.   The concerns then were that this would  be  a  major

impediment  to  the  development of our commercial  enterprises.

But  the  concerns have proved unfounded.  Since 1988, IRAS  has

not   seen   the  need  to  invoke  the  general  anti-avoidance

provision.   Thus,  it  has  been very  effective  simply  as  a

deterrent.  Likewise, section 33A in the Stamp Duties  Act  will

not be invoked unless it is absolutely necessary.  To reduce any

uncertainty,  IRAS  would  also  be  prepared  to   assist   any

individual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>

or  company wishing to consult them on specific transactions  as

to  whether their transactions would fall under the ambit of the

new  section  33A,  provided details  of  the  transactions  are

clearly presented to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has given two scenarios to illustrate his

points.  In a property sale example, the purchaser may choose to

acquire  all shares of the company owning the property  and  pay

the  lower  stamp duty of 0.2%.  However, if it is  subsequently

proven  that  the purchaser has schemed with the seller  to  pay

stamp  duties at a lower rate, such a scheme would  fall  within

section  33A.   This could arise, for instance, when  many  such

special  purpose  property  holding companies  are  set  up  and

frequently traded, amongst other factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's other example on the financing

scheme  for  project  development,  the  borrower  is  assigning

certain  assets  to the bank as a security.  If the  assets  are

reconveyed  back  to the borrower upon full  settlement  of  the

loan, such an assignment by way of security is stamped with  the

mortgage  duty  and capped at $500, and not the  3%  ad  valorem

stamp  duty.   The 3% conveyance duty is applied only  when  the

assignment is effectively a sale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15 of the Stamp Duties Act provides relief from

payment  of  ad  valorem duty on transfers made  pursuant  to  a

scheme  of  reconstruction or amalgamation.  The  concession  is

granted on the principle that there is no substantial change  in

ownership  after the reconstruction.  Hence a key criterion  for

remission is that at least 90% of a company must be involved  in

one  single  reorganisation exercise.  To prevent abuse  of  the

stamp duty remission, a two-year freeze on the ownership is also

imposed  on  the restructured companies and to ensure  that  the

beneficial  interest  in  the  shares  or  undertaking  acquired

remains substantially with the same people.  Hence the condition

that the restructured group should not be publicly listed within

two years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria in section 15 are constantly reviewed and

revised,  if  necessary, to meet the changing circumstances  and

needs  of  the business community.  Successful applicants  under

section  15  only  pay  a fixed duty of $10  on  each  transfer.

Whereas  a  transfer of an undertaking consisting  of  immovable

properties  and shares will attract stamp duty at  3%  and  0.2%

respectively  on  the  value  of  the  undertaking  sold.   This

represents substantial savings.  In order that the concession is

not  open to abuse, it is essential that the applicants  make  a

formal  application  setting out the scheme  together  with  all

relevant  documents to justify that the restructuring  qualifies

under  the relevant sections.  Hence, the need to make a  formal

application in writing.  There have been cases where claims  for

section  15 were made despite that the conditions spelt out  for

remission were not met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Hong Kong, the relief is confined to

conveyance  between  associated bodies,  and  does  not  include

amalgamation  between  unassociated parties.   To  qualify,  one

corporate  must  own at least 90% of the issued capital  of  the

other.   To our knowledge, adjudication is also required in  the

Hong Kong legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members can be assured that IRAS will assist and advise

companies seeking their assistance on specific transactions.  In

fact,  IRAS  regularly liaises with lawyers and  tax  agents  of

companies on matters relating to corporate restructuring.   Many

of them are well aware of the conditions governing exemptions or

remissions  of stamp duties.  They are made transparent  to  all

applicants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now refer to the questions raised by the Member for

Aljunied  GRC.   Presently,  stamp  duty  is  payable  only   on

instruments  effecting transfers, sales,  leases,  mortgages  of

immovable properties as well as stocks and shares.  I assume the

hon.  Member is therefore making reference to contract notes  on

stocks and shares.  If an electronic contract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>

note  or  any  other electronic instrument is an instrument  for

stamp   duty  purposes,  it  will  accordingly  attract  duties.

However,  for the Member's information, stamp duty for  contract

notes  for  stocks and shares is currently suspended until  30th

June 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to whether the definition of "stamp

certificate"  is  too  restrictive, let me  briefly  explain  to

Members  how  the  E-Stamping system works.   E-Stamping  is  an

integrated electronic system on the Internet.  The whole process

is  performed  electronically, starting with the  submission  of

document details, computation of duty and late penalty, followed

by  electronic payment and ending with the issuing of the  stamp

certificate electronically.  The stamp certificate is issued on-line and users can choose to store the records electronically or

in printed format at their premises.  Thus the E-Stamping system

can be easily extended to all on-line instruments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank the Member for his suggestion to

include a provision similar to section 70C(2) in the other Acts,

such as the Income Tax Act, the GST Act and the Customs Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Members that there are currently

provisions  under the Income Tax Act and the GST  Act  to  allow

taxpayers  to keep their records electronically.  IRAS  has,  in

fact,  in  consultation with the Institute of  Certified  Public

Accountants in Singapore, issued two sets of guidelines in  July

1999.  As long as these criteria are met, taxpayers can apply to

the Income Tax authority to keep their records electronically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Customs Act provides for the Director-General of Customs to permit records to be kept electronically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon

Yeo):   Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Act empowers the Public Utilities

Board (PUB) to discharge its roles as the Water Authority and as

the  Regulatory  Authority  of the  electricity  and  piped  gas

industries in Singapore.  This Act was last amended in 1995 when

the electricity and gas operations of PUB were corporatised.  In

the last four years, we have gained experience in the regulation

of   the  electricity  industry  and  some  amendments  to   the

legislation are needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed are mainly to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) put in place further regulatory measures in the

evolving electricity industry and to address the industry's need

for high quality electricity supply;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) increase the penalty for the offence of damaging a

high-voltage electricity cable;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) protect the property rights of the Board and

facilitate the maintenance of water mains; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) protect the interest of consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first go through the amendments that are required in

the  Board's  function  as  the  Regulatory  Authority  for  the

electricity and gas industries.

<br><br><i>Regulation of Supply</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is no provision in the Act to regulate

the  supply  of electricity generated outside Singapore  to  any

person  or  premises in Singapore, or the supply of  electricity

generated  in  Singapore  to  any  person  or  premises  outside

Singapore.   It  is  proposed  that the  present  definition  of

"supply"  in section 2 of the existing Act be amended to  enable

the PUB to regulate such supply of electricity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>

With this amendment, without being licensed by the PUB to do so,

no  person may supply electricity generated outside Singapore to

any  person  or premises in Singapore, and no person may  supply

electricity  generated in Singapore to any  person  or  premises

outside Singapore.

<br><br><i>Power Dips & Cable Damage</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from industry indicates that companies,

particularly those in high-tech industries which rely heavily on

sensitive  computerised  control systems,  have  been  adversely

affected  by voltage dips in their power supply.  Voltage  dips,

unlike  power outages or blackouts, are momentary reductions  of

the voltage levels in the power supply system, which can disrupt

the functions of sensitive computerised control systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voltage dips occur some 25-30 times a year. They have a

severe   impact  on  some  industries,  particularly  high-tech,

process   industries   like  the  wafer  fabrication   industry.

According to the Economic Development Board (EDB), voltage  dip-related  losses  suffered  by five high-tech  companies  between

August 1997 and November 1998 amounted to some $3 million.  This

figure  does not include the cost of production downtime, labour

and  delayed  product deliveries.  The production  downtime  can

amount  to  as  much  as 10% of the monthly output  of  a  wafer

fabrication company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, 57% of voltage dip complaints arose because of

cable  damage.   Although the number of voltage dips  caused  by

cable damage is relatively small (5 out of 36 in 1996, 2 out  of

21  in  1997 and 4 out of 30 in 1998), the effect of such damage

to  high-voltage cables can be major.  For Singapore to continue

to  attract  high-tech,  knowledge-based activities  like  wafer

fabrication, we must ensure the high quality and reliability  of

our power supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise damage to high-voltage cables in the course of

construction  work,  section 95 of the Act will  be  amended  to

differentiate the requirements for earthworks in the vicinity of

low-voltage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>

electricity  cables from those in the vicinity  of  high-voltage

electricity cables.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 95(A) is proposed to require PowerGrid Ltd,

which  is  the  owner  of high-voltage electricity  cables,  and

contractors to work together to prevent damage to cables.   This

new  section  will regulate earthworks and cable detection  work

within the vicinity of any high-voltage electricity cable  which

belongs  to  or which is under the management or  control  of  a

public   electricity  licensee.   Offenders  face  a  fine   not

exceeding  $100,000, or imprisonment for a  term  not  exceeding

five years, or both fine and imprisonment, if they do not follow

the legislated procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious consequence to the economy as a result of

damage  to high-voltage cables makes a severe penalty necessary.

A  deterrent  penalty  of $1 million is therefore  proposed  for

damage  to a high-voltage cable.  Section 107(3) will be amended

to  enhance  the  current fine of $200,000 to $1  million.   The

enhanced   fine  is  the  same  as  that  provided   under   the

Telecommunication  Authority  of  Singapore  Act  for   damaging

telephone  cables.   At  the  present  level  of  penalty,  some

contractors  are  tempted to risk hitting a  cable  rather  than

suffer project delay and payment of liquidated damages.  A  fine

of $1 million will deter such irresponsible behaviour.  With the

amendments,  offenders will face a maximum fine of  $1  million,

imprisonment  for  five years, or both.  The  maximum  five-year

term  of  imprisonment for high-voltage cable damage remains  as

before.  At the same time, section 95 as amended will reduce the

maximum  term  of imprisonment for damaging a low voltage  cable

from three years to 12 months, as this is less serious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from a deterrent penalty, we will require reasonable

precautions  to be taken against damage to high-voltage  cables.

These  are covered in the amendments to section 69.  Firstly,  a

public   electricity  licensee  which  lays   any   high-voltage

electricity  cable on any private land or premises will  have  a

duty to:-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2162</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) insulate and encase the electricity cable in such a

manner  as  to  effectively  protect  it  and  prevent  it  from

constituting a source of danger;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) mark the location of the electricity cable in the

prescribed manner; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) notify the owner or occupier of such private land or

premises  of  the  location  of the electricity  cable  and  the

precautions to be taken if any earthworks are to be carried  out

on such land or premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it will be an offence for any person to

obliterate, remove, damage, alter or tamper with any mark placed

by a public electricity licensee wilfully and without reasonable

excuse.

<br><br><i>Administrative Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other amendments of an administrative nature

pertaining  to the electricity industry.  A new subsection  (3A)

is  added  to  section  47 to ensure that a  public  electricity

licensee authorised to generate, transmit or supply electricity,

does not or omits to do any act, whether directly or indirectly,

to  jeopardise the security and stability of electricity supply.

A  new subsection (4A) is added to section 50 making it the duty

of  a  public electricity licensee to comply with any  direction

that the PUB may give to it from time to time for the purpose of

regulating  the  prices to be charged by  the  licensee  to  any

person.

<br><br><i>Access to Water Mains</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more effective management of Singapore's water supply

system,  a  new section 32A will facilitate the speedy  repair

and  maintenance  of water mains.  This new section  32A  will

empower  the  PUB to require the removal of any  structure  or

substance that is likely to hinder or obstruct access  to  any

water  main  or  connecting pipe belonging to  the  PUB.   The

proposed amendments to the Public Utilities Act will give  the

PUB  the  scope to perform better its functions as Singapore's

Water  Authority  and  as  the  Regulatory  Authority  of  the

electricity and gas industries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  express  my  support for the Public Utilities  (Amendment)

Bill presented by the Minister for Trade and Industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me first to declare my interest that I am a board

member  of  the  Public  Utilities Board.   One  of  the  main

objectives  of  the  proposed amendments is  to  minimise  the

number  of  incidents  of damage to underground  high  voltage

electricity  cables.  It is my understanding that the  damages

to  the  cables  in  the  past have  been  largely  caused  by

earthwork contractors in the course of construction work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage to these cables would cause voltage dips to be

felt  over large areas and the effect is felt island-wide when

the  damage is to 230 kv cables.  The extent of the impact  is

evidenced  by the disproportionately large number  of  voltage

dip  complaints received relative to the incidents which  give

rise to the voltage dips.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has explained at length, the impact on

high-tech  industries  due  to such  voltage  fluctuations  is

particularly  severe.  Feedback from industry  indicates  that

the production facilities of high-tech companies such as wafer

fab    companies,   sensitive   micro-electronics    component

manufacturers  and  others are highly susceptible  to  voltage

dips   caused   by   damage   to  underground   cables.    The

interruptions  of  electricity supply upset  these  companies'

production  schedules and delivery commitments and  result  in

costly  losses  in production time and work in progress  items

which often have to be discarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for us to be able to continue to attract high

technology and high value-added investments into Singapore, we

have  to  ensure  that the quality of our  electricity  supply

remains  consistently  high.   The  proposed  legislation   as

presented  by the Minister is therefore necessary and  timely.

It would require the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>

earthwork  contractors and PowerGrid Limited  which  owns  the

electricity  cable  network to work  together  to  proactively

prevent damage to the electricity cables.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support this Amendment Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  the  light  of deregulation of electricity supply  in  our

nation, it is inevitable that the regulations are changing  to

suit the new operating environment.  Hence, I can see this new

Public  Utilities (Amendment) Bill will serve to provide  more

precise   definition   and   to   place   more   duties    and

responsibilities on the public electricity licensees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3A in particular requires the licensees to ensure

that  they  would not do any act that would adversely  affect,

directly   or  indirectly,  the  security  and  stability   of

electricity  supply.  As the Minister presented earlier,  this

is  an  important point because Singapore is a  modern  nation

which cannot afford to have major voltage dips or blackouts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill goes further in section 69 to ensure that the

public electricity licensee maintain the cables with due  care

and  protection  and to mark out the location  of  electricity

cables  in some prescribed form.  And this is a very  positive

step   forward   towards  more  manageable   and   predictable

underground  excavation and earthwork as  broadly  defined  in

this  Bill.   Until now, there have been grievances  that  the

location maps of the underground cables, especially those laid

a  long  time ago, during the British days, are very  big  and

inaccurate.  Mishaps often occur when excavations  took  place

at   locations  not  suspected  of  underground  cables.   The

prescribed  manner stated in section 2B(b), I hope,  would  be

akin  to something like a chartered survey map, and not  those

that would make reference to, for example, the nearest tree or

fire hydrant.  This latter method suffers from the shortcoming

of  losing  the  location  of the cables  when  the  so-called

reference tree or fire hydrant is removed.  Hence, it  follows

naturally that in new section 95, it is a requirement to  have

cable detection works carried out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>

prior  to  any  earthwork at the low and  high  voltage  cable

areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill particularly spells out a new procedure for

excavation  near  high voltage cables.  It requires  a  proper

notice   to  be  served  on  the  licensee  before  commencing

excavation  and  to get information from the licensee  on  the

locations  of  the high voltage cables.  Of course,  it  is  a

requirement  to  engage licensed cable  detection  workers  to

perform detection work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 95A(5) further requires a licensee to

promptly give the location of the high voltage cables  to  the

person  who  serves the notice and to advise on the precaution

to  be  taken  to  avoid  damage  to  the  cables.  With  this

provision, it now becomes reasonable for the person performing

the excavation to follow the procedures set out in section 95A

and he now has a defence in court when charged for damaging  a

cable.  This is well and good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have four queries. The Bill requires one to

serve  notice on the licensee if he is to carry out excavation

near high voltage cables.  But how would he know that it is  a

high  voltage  cable area?  Secondly, which licensee  does  it

belong  to?  And thirdly, what if the licensee  disclaims  the

accuracy of the information he gives to the person who carries

out  the  excavation, and this is often done?   Fourthly,  how

capable  are  the  cable detection workers and  what  kind  of

liabilities do they have?  What would be considered reasonable

performance of a cable detection worker?  This amendment would

be  more  complete if it can answer the above four  questions,

especially  the  last  one  whereby a  person  performing  the

earthwork   may  be  deemed  not  to  have  taken   reasonable

precaution  and exercised due diligence to avoid the  offence,

should a cable detection worker be found negligent in carrying

out his work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deterrent penalty for damaging a high voltage cable

is raised to $1 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>

The  jail  sentence remains the same at five years.  It  would

only  be reasonable if the Bill would further define this area

to avoid any doubt or any presumption of guilt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, please let me now switch from speaking

on  electricity cable to water mains.  This new Amendment Bill

introduces a new section 32A which basically requires  one  to

remove  any structure, object or accumulation that  exists  in

the  vicinity of a water main or connecting pipe if the  Board

deems  that  it  hinders or obstructs access.   I  think  this

clause  is  far  too  broad.   It does  not  define  the  word

"vicinity"  nor the words "hinder access".  If an  underground

pipe  is to burst near an existing home and the easiest access

can  be  obtained by demolishing part of the  house,  then  it

appears  that  this amendment would apply and the  poor  house

owner will, at his own cost, move out of the house or hold  on

to  the house to facilitate access.  Another possible scenario

here  is  this. When a house owner engages an architect  whose

design  happens  to infringe this condition,  because  of  the

weakness  of  this  clause, then who is  responsible  for  the

removal  of the structure?  Is it the architect or  the  house

owner?   Would  this  clause be precise enough  for  insurance

purposes if the architect is to carry a professional liability

insurance policy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made the above comments, I wish that the Minister

would consider them before legislating the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just

want to make a short clarification. I understand the Amendment

Bill is to severely punish contractors who damage high voltage

cables.   How  about  a  power supply company  that  causes  a

voltage  dip which is equally damaging to the economy and  the

company  concerned as well? I would like to know what  is  the

penalty.   I  believe that it is in the Bill.  How  about  for

those voltage dip cases which the Minister cited just now that

were  not  caused  by  damaged cable?  For  those  cases,  was

penalty  imposed on PowerGrid and, if so, what was the penalty

imposed?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank the Members for their support of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang Shaw Peng asked how would an earthwork

contractor  know  that he is in the vicinity of  high  voltage

cables.   He  has to find out from the licensee, which  means,

PowerGrid Private Limited and PowerGrid is under an obligation

to   speedily  provide  the  detailed  information   and   the

information must be detailed to enable the cables which are in

the vicinity to be accurately marked out by licensed detection

workers.   Which licensee?  There is only one right now  which

is  PowerGrid.   They  own  all the  high  voltage  cables  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang asked what happens if the licensee disclaims

the accuracy of the information he provides to the contractor.

He  cannot.  Under the law, he is required to provide accurate

information.  As for the training of cable detection  workers,

this  is  done  by  PowerGrid.  In fact, under  its  licensing

conditions,  it  is responsible to provide training  on  cable

detection and the person would only be granted a licence as  a

cable  detection worker if he has successfully  completed  the

prescribed  course  conducted  by  PowerGrid  and  holds   the

required  qualifications and relevant experience.   Mr  Chuang

then  asked  what if the licensed cable detection  worker  was

negligent.  I think, if this can be established legally,  that

should be a defence for the contractor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the amendment to the section on water mains, to

begin  with,  structures or objects should not  in  the  first

place  be  built or positioned in such a way that water  mains

cannot be maintained or repaired.  When we talk about "in  the

vicinity  of  water mains", it is with respect to  whether  it

affects the ability of PUB to maintain or repair these  mains.

Mr Chuang also asked in the event that the architect designs a

structure  which  causes an obstruction, then  who  should  be

liable?   That  really  is a private  matter  to  be  resolved

between   the  owner  and  his  architect.  Equally,   whether

insurance  should  cover such liabilities is  also  a  private

matter, defined in contract.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked whether the power supply company

is under an obligation to provide reliable power.  Yes,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>

they are.  As to what the penalty involves, I do not have them

with me here now.  And as to the past incidents, and follow-up

action  PUB has taken with respect to voltage dips not  caused

by  cable damage in the past, I do not have the details  here.

But if he submits a question on this, I would be very happy to

answer him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

<div align="center"><b>BUILDING CONTROL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.16 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

National  Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br><i>Objective</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Building Control Act to put in

place measures to minimise incidents of falling air-conditioning

units from certain premises or buildings.

<br><br><i>Rationale</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, 8 cases of fallen air-conditioning units have

been  reported.   Out  of the 8 cases, 7  occurred  because  the

wooden frames these units were mounted on have decayed over  the

years.  These 7 cases occurred in populated HDB estates.  It was

fortunate that no one was injured or killed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have introduced several measures since 1990 to

forestall  the  problem of falling air-conditioning  units.   We

required  all  new air-conditioning units in  HDB  flats  to  be

mounted  properly  on stainless steel brackets.   An  additional

measure  was  introduced in 1997 to ensure that trained  workers

were engaged to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>

install new air-conditioning units.  This is to ensure that  the

units  were  properly installed so as to minimise  the  risk  of

falling  air-conditioning  units  due  to  poor  workmanship  in

installation.   However,  the stock of wooden  frames  installed

before  these  measures were introduced will remain  substantial

for  some  time to come.  These air-conditioning units therefore

represent a growing risk to the public as the condition  of  the

frames  deteriorates with time.  To minimise the possibility  of

further  accidents  from  happening,  wooden  frames  should  be

replaced  with  properly-installed brackets  made  of  stainless

steel.

<br><br><i>Main Features of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now elaborate on the main features of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 names the Bill as the Building Control (Amendment)

Act 1999.  The clause also allows the Minister to bring the Bill

into operation by notification in the Gazette.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 addresses the meaning of "air-conditioning unit"

for  the purpose of the Building Control Act.  In addition,  the

clause  also  transfers  the definition  of  the  "Building  and

Control  Authority" and "trained workers" from the  Schedule  to

the  main  Act for the purpose of the new provisions  regulating

air-conditioning works which I shall elaborate on later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As air-conditioning units do not affect the structural

integrity  of a building and their installations are  considered

really  to  be  minor works, clause 3 continues to  exempt  air-conditioning  works  from Part II of the Building  Control  Act.

That  is,  there  is  no  need  to  submit  building  plans  for

installing air-conditioning units to the BCA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now elaborate on the main provisions

regulating  the  installation  of air-conditioning  units  under

clause 4 of the Bill.  Clause 4 introduces a new Part IIA to  be

inserted into the Building Control Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>New Part IIA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Part IIA contains six sections. New section 21A limits

the application of the Part to air-conditioning units that would

pose   a  danger  to  the  public.   As  air-conditioning  units

installed  in landed properties would not pose a danger  to  the

safety  of  the  general  public, these are  exempted  from  the

provisions  of this Part.  The same goes for units that  do  not

protrude outwards from buildings or premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 21B makes it mandatory for any person who

desires  to install air-conditioning units to engage a  "trained

worker"  to  properly  install  the  air-conditioning  unit.   A

trained  worker  holds  a  certificate  from  the  Building  and

Construction  Authority for the installation of air-conditioning

units.    This   section  consolidates  what  we  have   already

introduced  in  1997,  to  prevent  accidents  of  falling  air-conditioning units due to poor workmanship in installation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions I have elaborated so far cover air-conditioning units that are to be installed. I will now move on

to section 21C which deals with existing air-conditioning units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have previously issued advices to many flat

owners to retrofit existing wooden air-conditioning frames  with

properly-installed brackets made of approved  material,  namely,

stainless steel, many air-conditioning unit owners have not been

forthcoming  in taking up the advice.  Currently,  about  45,000

air-conditioning  units in HDB estates  and  under  20,000  air-conditioning  units  in private estates are  mounted  on  wooden

frames.  These would pose a danger to the general public as  the

wooden  frames  deteriorate over time.   As  such,  section  21C

requires  the  owner  of  the building or  premises  where  air-conditioning units are mounted on wooden frames to replace these

frames  with  properly-installed stainless  steel  brackets.   A

grace  period of one year from the date of commencement of  this

Act  will  be given to the owner of the building or premises  to

carry out the retrofitting works.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 21D allows the Commissioner of Building Control

to  require  retrofitting  works for any  other  dangerous  air-conditioning units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 21E provides in the main body of the Act an

existing  requirement  that  the  trained  worker  shall,   upon

completion of the installation or retrofitting works,  submit  a

properly  completed installation report to the  Commissioner  of

Building Control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for any person who contravenes section

21B(1), 21C, 21D or 21E(1) are prescribed in new section 21F  of

the  Building Control Act.  Under this section, any  person  who

contravenes or fails to comply with the said provisions shall be

guilty  of an offence and shall be liable upon conviction  to  a

fine  not  exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for  a  term  not

exceeding six months or to both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 allows the Minister to make regulations in

relation  to  the installation and retrofitting works  for  air-conditioning  units.   The Minister can  also  make  regulations

stipulating  the  duties  and responsibilities  of  the  trained

workers in carrying out their works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequential amendments are made under clause 6 of the

Bill,  which tidies up the references to air-conditioning  units

made under the existing Schedule to the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Bill is necessary to protect the general

public from the potential injury that could be caused by falling

air-conditioning units.  Although we could also let the  problem

resolve  itself as the older air-conditioning units  mounted  on

wooden  frames  break down and are replaced by  new  and  better

supporting  structures, we are concerned that further  accidents

might  occur.   The  Bill is thus introduced to  accelerate  the

replacement  process and ensure a safer environment,  especially

in  the HDB estates where many air-conditioning units mounted on

wooden frames still exist today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the Building Control (Amendment) Bill 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I commend the Government for taking proactive

action  on the subject of falling air-conditioning units in  HDB

estates  before  anybody is injured.  We  are  told  that  these

incidents have occurred because the wooden frames that the  air-conditioning units were mounted on have decayed over the  years.

Such decay of wooden frames is not surprising, given the kind of

hot and wet weather we have in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few queries and clarifications to make regarding

the  main  features of the Bill.  In new section 21B,  the  Bill

requires  such  air-conditioning units  to  be  installed  by  a

trained  worker.  The Bill does not give details about the  pre-requisites  or qualifications for such a trained worker,  except

that  he is a person who holds a certificate issued by the  BCA.

Would this be linked to any NTC qualification later to make  the

requirement more clear and transparent?  What is the  number  of

trained  workers that we have in the industry right now?   Would

there  be enough trained workers so as to keep such installation

works at reasonable price levels?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21C also says that the installation will use "such

material as may be prescribed."  Given that wood is not suitable

in  such  a  climate, what will be the new acceptable  materials

that can be used in its place?  I believe that this is not given

in  the  Bill.   Can  the Bill be a bit more  specific  on  this

matter?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the deterioration of timber frames, I understand

that the brackets can also corrode and give way, posing the same

danger  to  residents.  Will the Building Commissioner  consider

requiring   building  owners  to  inspect  and   maintain   air-conditioners and their mountings on a regular basis?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does not seem to address the issue of service or

maintenance   of  air-conditioning  units  after   installation.

Obviously, apart from having the units installed securely,  they

should also be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>

installed  in  a manner that allows them to be serviced  safely.

There  should be adequate provision for working space to prevent

incidents  of falling tools and components as well as to  ensure

that  the worker can attend to the unit without exposing himself

to  undue  danger.   The  design of such air-conditioning  units

should   also   incorporate  devices  that  allow   for   proper

installation.  The Building Control Authority may want  to  seek

the  assistance of the PSB and the product design of  such  air-conditioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am given to understand that apart from incidents of

falling  air-conditioning units, there have also been  instances

of  falling casement windows in HDB flats.  They pose an equally

severe   threat   to  the  safety  of  residents.    Would   the

Commissioner of Buildings consider imposing similar  legislative

control  regarding  the proper installation and  maintenance  of

such windows?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments and queries, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is timely to introduce some control on the

fixing  of  air-conditioners in HDB estates.   It  is  indeed  a

frightening  thought of an air-conditioning  unit  falling  down

from  a  10-storey flat and hitting someone below.  The accident

is  bound to be fatal.  The requirement for the installation  of

an  air-conditioning unit by trained workers is a  move  in  the

right direction.  However, that alone will not be able to ensure

that   the   unit  is  installed  according  to   the   required

specifications,  notwithstanding that a report has  to  be  made

after the installation.  Some form of inspection has to be  made

in order that the installation requirement be followed.  I think

the  HDB  and town councils are in the best position to  provide

this safeguard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to request the

Senior Parliamentary Secretary to consider looking into two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>

other  aspects, apart from ensuring the structural soundness  of

the  installation of air-conditioners.  First, noise  pollution.

Very  often, air-conditioners, if not properly fixed or  due  to

its  age and lack of maintenance, will generate tremendous noise

and  vibration.   This  will invariably be  a  nuisance  to  the

adjoining  flats,  especially to those without  air-conditioners

and have to sleep with their windows open.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, drainage problem. A lot of air-conditioning

units are not provided with proper drainage, ie, provision of  a

tray  to drain off water, resulting in water splashing onto  the

flat  below  them,  especially  units  which  are  not  properly

maintained.   I  hope that some form of control  and  regulatory

measures  are  introduced to address these two  very  widespread

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

highlighted this issue during the Budget debate last  year,  and

asked  the  Ministry  to  do  something  about  it.   The   then

Parliamentary Secretary, in his response, had indicated that the

Building  Control Authority would look into the  possibility  of

legislating  the requirements for window air-conditioning  units

installed  in high-rise buildings.  Sir, it was sheer luck  that

in all the eight cases of falling air-conditioning units, no one

was injured or killed.  I therefore welcome this Bill as it will

help  to enhance the safety of living in a highrise environment.

However,  I  have  some clarifications to seek from  the  Senior

Parliamentary Secretary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21B requires a trained worker to fix the work. A

"trained  worker" means a person who holds a certificate  issued

by  BCA.  My question is: will experienced service providers who

are  without formal education or training be also considered for

the certificate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill also requires that only approved

materials  can be used.  Are there any other approved materials,

apart   from   stainless   steel,  mentioned   by   the   Senior

Parliamentary Secretary just now?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there are about 60,000 such units with wooden

frames.  If we spread over a period of 12 months, each month  an

average  of about 5,000 units need to be retrofitted.   Can  the

Ministry  assure  that owners would not have difficulty  meeting

the deadline?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

support   this  Amendment  Bill  to  ensure  safe   and   proper

installation  of  air-conditioners in HDB estates.   However,  I

have  a  few  suggestions for the consideration  of  the  Senior

Parliamentary Secretary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Amendment Bill provides that air-conditioners be

installed only by trained workers.  I feel that we should go one

step  further  to stipulate that  installation  work  should  be

carried  out only by registered companies, for better protection

to  the  flat-owners.  The HDB should also carry  out  a  proper

inspection after the air-conditioners are installed.  A  sticker

can  then be affixed to the air-conditioner to certify  that  it

has been properly installed according to the specifications laid

down  by  the HDB. This may help to solve the problems of  noise

pollution and water drainage due to improper installation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must ensure that the installations are not

carried out without prior approval from the authority.   I  have

received  complaints  during  my meet-the-people  sessions  that

contractors  employed by the flat-owners  to  install  the  air-conditioners  did  not  make  a formal  application  to  HDB  as

required,  before  they commenced work. Some even  proceeded  to

install  the  air-conditioners without obtaining  the  necessary

approval.   Later on, when the flat owners were to resell  their

flats,  they  will encounter problems, as their air-conditioners

would be deemed to be unauthorized installation.   If there  are

stickers affixed  on the air-conditioners, these problems  would

not arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the rising standard of living in Singapore, more

and  more residents, especially the new flat owners, are  having

air-conditioners installed.  I hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>

that  in designing the new HDB flats, the architects could  make

provision for air-conditioners to be installed in such a way  as

to  give  the  flat owners and technicians access  to  the  air-conditioners   to  facilitate  easy  checking,   servicing   and

maintenance  of  the  said  air-conditioners.   As   most   air-conditioners  are now installed outside the windows  or  on  the

external walls, flat owners find it very difficult for  them  to

inspect  or  service  the  air-conditioners,  and  it  is   very

dangerous too.  They have to bend out of the windows to  do  it.

If  they are not careful, it is not the air-conditioners but the

persons  themselves  will be falling  over.    This  is  a  very

important matter of safety to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, at the

moment some  65,000 units of  air-conditioners are being mounted

on  wooden  frames, and the flat owners are required to  replace

the  wooden frames with stainless steel frames within one  year.

Will  there  be enough contractors to carry out the retrofitting

work of all these 65,000 air-conditioners within one year?  Will

this result in a steep rise in the cost?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of housing estates which have been selected for

the  SERS scheme, the residents will have to move out soon.  Can

the  Ministry  exercise some flexibility in dealing  with  these

cases?   Since they are moving out very soon, there is  no  need

for  them  to spend extra money to retrofit the installation  of

air-conditioners.   But  we  must  of  course  ensure  that  the

existing wooden frames are still in good condition.  I hope  the

Senior Parliamentary Secretary will consider my suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, one of the major causes of air-conditioning units falling off is the deterioration of the air-

conditioning unit over time.  But we must not forget that  these

wooden  frames  were installed by HDB.  They were  provided  for

when  the  owners moved in.  HDB, as a developer, provides  such

wooden  frames.  I wonder whether the Bill should  also  require

developers  (both HDB and private developers)  to  provide  air-conditioning  frames from materials which would not  deteriorate

over time, and thus cause a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>

potential  danger  in the future.  I wonder whether  HDB  has  a

moral  responsibility to replace the existing wooden  frames  in

HDB  estates.   Do  not forget, Sir, it is not  only  those  who

install  air-conditioning units on wooden frames that cause  the

problem,  but the frames themselves cause a problem as well  for

those who do not have an air-conditioning unit.  This is because

as  the wooden frame deteriorates, there is the problem of water

leakage  which  they  have to solve.  I would  urge  the  Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary to consider whether HDB  would  replace

the wooden frames as a matter of goodwill, as a one-time basis.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, may I take the last

question first in answer to Mr Low Thia Khiang.  HDB did provide

some  HDB  flats with wooden frames to facilitate the owners  to

put in their window air-conditioning units.  These wooden frames

were  placed  on  a goodwill basis because there  were  requests

prior  to HDB's guesture.  In the past when HDB did not  provide

the  frames,  owners had to hack a big hole to insert  the  air-conditioning unit into the hole.  Then they have to fix the air-conditioning  unit into the hole by inserting wooden  frames  on

the four sides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB is unable and will not replace the wooden frames for

the  flat owners because this was done on a goodwill basis.  Any

wooden  frame that has deteriorated over time should be replaced

by  the owner.  Once the owner takes over the apartment,  it  is

the  owner's  responsibility for maintaining  all  the  internal

fixtures within the flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having learnt the lesson, what is HDB doing now? For the

new  generation  flats,  HDB  is putting  them  in  the  service

balconies.   If you look at the new generation flats,  you  will

find  that  there is a service balcony where owners can  put  in

their split condensers.  At the same time, HDB has also explored

areas  within  the wash areas.  We have put in the ledgers  with

railings  to mount the air-conditioners.  This is to  facilitate

replacement.  So HDB has progressed ahead and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>

we  are  now tackling a problem that is actually rooted  in  the

past.   We are asking the owners to look at their wooden  frames

and  take  the effort to change these wooden frames  within  one

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is one year sufficient time to change all the 65,000 air-conditioning units, of which 45,000 are in HDB flats and 20,000

in  private  estates?  We have a pool of 4,000  trained  workers

certified  to  install steel brackets on to these existing  air-conditioning units.  We have an existing problem of 65,000  air-conditioning  units.  So there should be enough time.   We  have

4,000 workers and we expect more workers to be trained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the qualification of a worker? It is not very high

because it is a very simple task actually.  We require a  person

to  take a test.  If he says he is qualified, he has the  skills

but  he has no certificate, we will require him to take a  test.

If  he says, "I do not know how to do the installation", then he

undergoes a course.  The course is 17 hours conducted by BCA  at

the  Construction Industry Training Institute at Braddell  Road.

The  course  fee  is  $410 per participant and  we  conduct  the

classes  in Mandarin or English, or if there is enough  critical

mass of about 24 students, it can be conducted in any dialect or

language.  Companies can sponsor their workers for this  course.

They  can  pay a one-time fee of $9,840 for one class  organised

for  a  company.  We have settled the problem whether  there  is

sufficient time.  The answer is yes.  Are there enough  workers?

The answer is also yes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the best approved material? At this point in time,

we  think stainless steel is the best material.  That will be in

the  subsidiary  legislation.   Stainless  steel  is  relatively

cheap, readily available and easily installable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen talked about noise pollution problem. Yes,

it  is indeed a problem.  As the air-conditioning unit ages, the

noise  level  does  go  up.  I will refer  the  problem  to  the

Ministry  of the Environment.  They have a Noise Pollution  Unit

which monitors the noise level of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>

air-conditioning units and other industrial machineries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards drainage problem, before HDB allows an air-conditioning unit to be installed, the person who installs the

air-conditioning unit must satisfy HDB that the drainage problem

is solved before we issue a permit for the air-conditioning unit

to be installed.  I do not think this is a serious problem.  But

at the MUP stage where old flats are undergoing MUP, various MUP

committees have tackled this problem systematically and some  of

them actually put a pipe all the way down from the top floor  to

the  bottom floor so that the window air-conditioning units  can

be  connected to such an improvised down pipe.  But  this  is  a

system  solution which can only come about when there is a  MUP.

But for individual cases, they have to solve it within the unit.

Usually, what they do is that they bring the pipe back into  the

bathroom or into the toilet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Ang Mong Seng's question, he suggested that we should

not license the workers but we should license the companies.  It

is difficult to license the companies.  In any case, it is not a

very  difficult  job to install steel brackets  to  window  air-conditioners. If we license companies alone, I think it will  be

making  a  big deal out of a small problem.  In any case,  there

will not be enough companies.  We have 4,000 workers.  We do not

have  4,000 companies.  And we have set a time limit of one year

because  we  think that while the problem is not severe  enough,

there  is  a possibility that one or two air-conditioners  might

fall off in the one-year period.  So we want to be very safe, we

want  to  make sure the problem is solved in as short a time  as

possible,  and we want to allow a qualified competent person  to

do  the  job.  I think a trained worker with a certificate  from

BCA  can  do the job.  In any case, companies come and  go,  and

there is no assurance either.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested that after the completion of the

job,  the  trained worker or the company should  stick  a  label

there  to certify that the job has been done satisfactorily.   I

will pass this back to the BCA and HDB to ask them to consider.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>

But, off my head, I think that the sticker solution may not be a

fool-proof solution because you can always tear off a sticker or

you can stick on a fixed sticker.  But anyway it is one area  we

can look at and I will ask the authority to look at it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemption for flats undergoing MUP and IUP is something

that  I  will talk to HDB and we will see what we can  do.   The

Member  was  suggesting that flats which have been targeted  for

SERS should be exempted.  A SERS programme takes five years from

announcement to completion.  So five years is a very long  time.

If  it  is  for SERS, I would be very reluctant to  exempt  them

because  it  is  a  long time.  Because when we  announced,  for

example,  the  en-bloc redevelopment at Hillview this  year,  it

will take some time for the residents to be physically relocated

to  the  new  location.   So in five years'  time  anything  can

happen.  But the Member's area is a new area, so probably  steel

brackets  are already in place.  But anyway I will  ask  HDB  to

look  at  it.   But off my head I think we should think  through

this  again.  For MUP, maybe we can look at it.  MUP could  take

two to three years.  The time-frame is much shorter.  But in any

case,  if  the wooden frame needs to be changed, it  has  to  be

changed, and I think we should not compromise on safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions. If I have not,

please remind me.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, may I clarify with the

Senior Parliamentary Secretary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary in his answer says that

the  wooden air-conditioning panel and the opening were provided

by  HDB  on  a goodwill basis.  But I wonder whether all  owners

would  want this goodwill in the first place because I notice  a

lot  of  them  do not use the air-conditioner opening  provided.

Either  the  position is not correct or it  is  going  to  cause

problems  to them because of noise nuisance.  But bear  in  mind

that this is initially a goodwill.  When the Bill is passed,  it

becomes  a "bad will", because if you do not do anything  to  it

and it drops off, it is your responsibility,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>

and  you  are going to be punished under the Act.  So  when  the

goodwill becomes a problem, would the HDB not be responsible  to

at  least  help  to  facilitate the owners  with  this  goodwill

provided by helping them to solve the problem?  So can  we  have

another  goodwill  from  the  HDB to  replace  the  wooden  air-conditioning panel?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, just a point of clarification.

Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary tell us how much does  it

cost to replace a wooden set into a stainless steel set?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The cost to replace the wooden

frame  with stainless steel brackets is very small.  It is about

$200  to  $250.  That includes labour and parts.  It  will  only

take a few hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Mr Low's problem. He said that many flat owners do

not  use the wooden window frame.  If they do not use the wooden

frame,  that means there is no air-conditioning unit  there  and

the  air-conditioner cannot fall off.  So there is  no  problem.

But  if  they do use the window frame to put an air-conditioning

unit  there, then they have used up the goodwill, in which  case

if the wooden frame were to rot, then the owner must replace the

wooden frame with steel brackets.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Leakage.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> As a flat ages, there will be

minor  problems.   Just like when we age,  we  will  have  minor

ailments.   It is not for the Government to treat us.   We  must

treat  ourselves.   Similarly, you live in a  flat,  you  cannot

expect  HDB  to go in and fix every small little problem.   Over

time,  rubber  seals will drop off, doors will  not  hang  well,

things like that.  Deterioration of these things is normal  over

time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> I am not sure whether the amount quoted

by  the  Senior  Parliamentary Secretary  is  a  reasonable  one

because I did check with Prof. Low



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>

Seow Chay just now.  And he told me it costs only about $100.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> Sir, just now I proposed that stickers

be  provided by HDB and not by a trained worker.  Because  after

installation, I think the HDB should send their staff to make an

inspection  to make sure that everything is installed  according

to the standard.  The stickers should be provided by HDB and not

by the trained worker.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> $100 is a good deal. We are

talking about good stainless steel.  Anyway, the figure  I  have

is about $200 to $250, including labour and parts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the installation, Mr Ang suggested that HDB should

inspect the installation and then certify it.  I will ask HDB to

look at it.  But I think it is really unnecessary.  What is  the

purpose  of  certifying the worker?  We have trained the  worker

and  certified him.  It is a relatively simple job, and  to  ask

the  HDB  Branch officer to go and look at it again is providing

200%  redundancy.  No building authority in the world legislates

the installation of air-conditioning units.  So we are almost  a

first  here  but  partly because we have got too many  high-rise

apartments.   But I think it is a very simple problem.   In  any

case,  if an air-conditioner is inserted into a hole, by  itself

it will not drop because there is a fulcrum and friction effect.

In the case where the hole is too big, you put in a wooden frame

to  make the hole smaller, again there is a fulcrum effect,  and

the  window does not fall off.  Now we are saying we  put  steel

brackets  to  reinforce  that installation  and  fix  the  steel

brackets onto the wall, we are providing already 100% redundancy

on  top  of  the wooden frame support.  I think with  the  steel

bracket  installation, the window unit should not  fall  off  at

all.   Anyway, I will take the Member's suggestion.  I will  ask

HDB  to look at whether it is implementable or not.  But I think

it is really unnecessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, how about the casing

of  the  air-conditioner that is corroded?  The owner has failed

to maintain it and the whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>

motor can fall out as well.  Is that covered under the Bill?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, anything the

owner  puts  up,  the  owner  must bring  down  before  it  hits

somebody's head.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

<div align="center"><b>BANKRUPTCY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Bankruptcy Act to put in

place  measures  in  support of the Technopreneurship  21  (T21)

initiative  and  to  make  related amendments  to  the  Business

Registration Act and the Companies Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the Bankruptcy Act had a major and

fundamental    revision   in   1995   aimed    at    encouraging

entrepreneurship.   The  Bill  therefore   does   not   seek   a

fundamental   overhaul  of  the  bankruptcy  regime.    Instead,

amendments   are  proposed  to  fine-tune  our  legislation   to

encourage  technopreneurial activity and to enhance  Singapore's

entrepreneurial climate.

<br><br><i>Voluntary Arrangements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1995, to promote entrepreneurship, a reorganisation

regime  called "Voluntary Arrangement" was introduced to provide

an  avenue  for debt settlement without resorting to bankruptcy.

This  however  has  not been widely used.   As  greater  use  by

debtors  of Voluntary Arrangements will reduce the incidence  of

bankruptcy,  this  process should be encouraged.   The  measures

proposed by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>

the  Bill  to  encourage use of Voluntary  Arrangements  are  as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Firstly, the amendments extend the deadline for a

bankrupt  to make a proposal for voluntary arrangement  from  28

days   to  42  days.   Currently,  after  the  Court  orders   a

moratorium,  the debtor has 28 days to make a proposal  for  the

settlement  of his debts.  The extension of this  period  to  42

days  would allow more time for the debtor to put up a  proposal

and increase the chances of Voluntary Arrangements succeeding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Secondly, the amendments allow the Minister for Law to

make  rules  prescribing the scale of  fees  to  be  charged  by

nominees assisting debtors in respect of Voluntary Arrangements.

The  reason  for  this is that currently, the fees  are  set  by

nominees.   There  is a general perception that  fees  currently

charged  are  too  high.  A fixed scale  of  fees  will  provide

certainty  and  encourage  debtors  to  make  use  of  Voluntary

Arrangements.

<br><br><i>Measures to allow Bankrupts to be economically productive - Amendments  to  the Companies Act and the Business  Registration Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point is that it is important that a bankrupt

remains  economically productive even during  bankruptcy.   This

will allow the bankrupt to settle his debts earlier and get  out

of  bankruptcy more speedily. It will also allow the bankrupt to

continue contributing economically to society during bankruptcy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, a bankrupt cannot act as a company director or

engage  in the management of a company or business, except  with

leave of Court.  However, very few bankrupts apply to court  for

permission to do business, deterred by the costs and trouble  of

having   to   apply  to  Court.   The  Official   Assignee,   as

administrator  of  a  bankruptcy estate, frequently  deals  with

bankrupts and is more knowledgeable of their affairs.   He  will

therefore be able to consider the merits of each case before  he

grants permission.  Allowing the Official Assignee to grant such

permission will also make the process cheaper, simpler and  more

accessible to the bankrupts.  The Official Assignee is also best

placed to assist bankrupts and to ensure that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>

portion  of  profits made from businesses are paid to creditors.

The Bill therefore proposes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to amend the Companies Act to give the Official

Receiver power to allow bankrupts to be company directors and be

involved in the management of companies; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to amend the Business Registration Act to give the

Official Assignee the power to allow bankrupts to be engaged  in

the management of business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, keeping this as a discretionary measure allows persons

who  become  bankrupts through misfortune to  be  differentiated

from  those  who have become so through malpractice.   It  would

also   encourage  bankrupts  to  co-operate  with  the  Official

Assignee  to  expedite their discharge from  bankruptcy.   These

cannot  be  achieved  by total lifting of  restrictions  against

bankrupts doing business.

<br><br><i>Measures  to  speed  up  the  bankruptcy  discharge  process  in deserving cases</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Official Assignee takes into account the cause of

bankruptcy  and the efforts made by the bankrupt  to  repay  his

creditors  when deciding whether to discharge a bankrupt.   This

scheme which was introduced in 1995 with a major revamp has  the

advantage  of being an inexpensive way of discharging  deserving

bankrupts  expeditiously,  whilst  creating  an  incentive   for

bankrupts  to work towards their discharge.  It also  serves  to

promote  entrepreneurship without eroding  financial  discipline

and  commercial  morality.  Indeed, Sir, the scheme  has  worked

well  and  has  been  rated by the Commonwealth  Association  of

Public   Administration  and  Management  in  1998   as   "truly

innovative  and  worthy  of  recognition"  with  the  Insolvency

Service being awarded a Certificate of Achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the scheme's usefulness in rehabilitating

deserving  bankrupts, the Bill proposes that the Bankruptcy  Act

be amended to reduce the period for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>

eligibility  for discharge by certificate from the current  five

years to three years.  This will allow the Official Assignee  to

begin considering a bankrupt for discharge after three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me stress that this is a discretion that the

Official Assignee will exercise only in deserving cases.   There

will  be  no  automatic  discharge.  This amendment  will  allow

deserving  bankrupts  to return to society  more  quickly.   The

three  year  period was chosen to provide greater incentive  for

deserving bankrupts to work towards an early discharge.

<br><br><i>Measures to streamline procedures and reduce the need to  resort to the courts</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two amendments to the Act are proposed to streamline

procedures and reduce the need to resort to the courts:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, currently under the Act, when a bankrupt makes an

offer  of  composition or proposes a scheme  of  arrangement,  a

general  meeting of creditors must be convened to  consider  the

offer  or scheme. The Bill amends the Act to allow for the offer

or  scheme  to  be  accepted by the creditors  by  post  without

convening a general meeting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are currently two situations where a

bankrupt  is  required to apply to court for a discharge.  These

are first when a bankrupt has fully repaid all his debts or when

the creditors have, by special resolution, accepted an offer  of

composition or scheme of arrangement from the debtor.   Sir,  in

these  two situations, the courts will invariably discharge  the

bankrupt.   The Bill amends the Act to provide for the  Official

Assignee to issue a certificate to discharge a bankrupt in these

two situations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two amendments, the last two that I have enumerated,

would  save  time and costs and further expedite the process  of

discharging a bankrupt.

<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the above amendments, the Bill also

amends the Companies Act to increase the debt limit for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>

service  of  a  statutory  demand on a company  from  $2,000  to

$10,000.  This amendment brings the debt limit for companies  in

line  with the bankruptcy debt limit which has been raised  from

$2,000 to $10,000 early last month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in formulating these changes, we have sought to strike

a proper balance between the interests of debtors and creditors.

We  were  mindful  that over-liberalisation  of  the  bankruptcy

regime  may erode creditors' rights and make it more costly  for

businesses to obtain financing. Changes that would work  against

creditors' interests have therefore been avoided.  Instead,  the

proposed amendments focus on, firstly, facilitating bankrupts to

continue   being  economically  active  and  productive   during

bankruptcy;  secondly,  saving costs by streamlining  procedures

and reducing the need to resort to the courts.  These amendments

will help to create a climate more conducive to entrepreneurship

and responsible risk-taking while preserving commercial morality

and  financial discipline.  They will also help to  prepare  our

people   to  take  advantage  of  the  emerging  knowledge-based

economy;   and,   thirdly,  these  amendments  would   encourage

bankrupts to work towards a speedier discharge from bankruptcy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any move we make to aid technopreneurship drive is always

welcomed,  Sir.   Bankruptcy and the  difficulty  of  getting  a

discharge  is  a  major  impediment to entrepreneurship.   I  am

delighted that we have progressively lowered the legal hurdle in

discharging the bankrupts since 1995.  One can only  hope  that,

by  lowering  the legal hurdle, we can lower the  public  stigma

attached to bankruptcy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we lower the legal hurdle, I get the distinct

impression that we may not be discharging bankrupts fast enough.

For example, I am aware of a case in which a bankrupt was in the

process of seeking a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>

discharge under the old guidelines.  But when the new guidelines

were  implemented in which the debt was raised to  $200,000,  he

was  not  given  the  discharge as he  was  still  governed  and

considered  under  the old guidelines.  The distinct  impression

given  is  that  while  we  have the law,  perhaps  we  are  not

implementing  the law sufficiently fast.  Perhaps, the  Minister

of  State  would like to comment on how fast we are  discharging

our  bankrupts and the number of cases of discharge that we  had

done  since  1995.  Will the new guidelines apply to all  cases,

even those who are in the process of being discharged under  the

old policy guidelines?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to improve the rate of discharge, so to speak, I would

like  the Minister of State to also explain to this House if  we

have  sufficient manpower in the office of the Official Assignee

to implement the law.  It is one thing to have the law but we do

not have the manpower to do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I refer to clause 7 in amending section 125(2) of

the  Bankruptcy Act.  Sir, the time bar of five years which  has

now  been lowered to three years to obtain a certificate is most

welcomed.   However, I am of the view that the  three-year  time

bar  is  still an impediment in truly deserving cases since  the

discharge  is  not  automatic.  Perhaps, the Government  or  the

Ministry would like to review a further lowering of this  limit,

especially in cases whereby the person has started an e-commerce

business which is what we are trying to promote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we lower the legal hurdle in discharging

bankrupts  and  helping to lower the social stigma,  I  wish  to

state  that  it  is still necessary to instill or reinforce  the

basic  fundamental  principles that hard work  and  honesty  are

integral qualities in commerce.  No one should take advantage of

the  bankruptcy laws to shy away from this obligation  to  repay

his  debts  and  I  think the law should not help  him  in  this

respect.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish to speak in support of this Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister of State has said earlier, the proposed

amendments  are  in  response to measures to be  implemented  in

support  of  the  Technopreneurship  21  initiative.   The  main

objective  is to make it easier for businessmen who have  failed

and  are declared bankrupt to have a chance to recover and start

afresh   in   the   shortest   reasonable   time.    To   enable

technopreneurship to thrive in Singapore, we need  to  create  a

more  conducive business environment and a climate that is  more

tolerant  to  business failures.  Hence, people who have  failed

should be given second, third or even more chances to try again.

We  know  of many successful entrepreneurs who have gone through

several trials and failures before they finally succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am generally in support of the Bill, I would like

to  ask  the Minister of State for some clarification on  clause

11.  Clause 11 empowers the Official Assignee to give permission

to  an  undischarged  bankrupt  to  act  as  a  director  of   a

corporation  or  to manage a corporation.  My query  is  on  the

effective  implementation of this power given  to  the  Official

Assignee.  While I agree that it will be expedient for the power

to  be  given  to  the Official Assignee to allow  a  person  to

restart a business, or act as a director, though he is still  an

undischarged  bankrupt,  my concern is how  would  the  Official

Assignee  be  able to exercise good judgement on the suitability

of  a  person to continue running a business.  Now, the onus  of

passing  the  judgement  is on the Official  Assignee.   If  the

Official  Assignee is too lenient and makes a wrong  assessment,

he  may be allowing a crook or a cheat to restart a business and

thereafter he can defraud or cheat new and more victims of their

money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the clause is welcomed as it gives the

Official  Assignee  the power to allow genuine  businessmen  who

have  failed to try again.  Perhaps, I would like to suggest  to

the  Minister of State that there should be some means  for  the

Official  Assignee to consult, perhaps, a committee or a  panel.

This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>

panel can comprise experienced businessmen and professionals who

can  give  their independent judgement and views to any bankrupt

who  applies  to  be  allowed to start a business  or  become  a

director.  Therefore, this allows our Official Assignee  to  get

some professional advice on this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to say that I am encouraged that

the Minister of State has taken some bold steps in amending this

Bill  and  I  am  confident that this will be a good  signal  to

Singaporeans and those who plan to become entrepreneurs that  we

are indeed moving towards an environment where we wish to foster

greater  tolerance for failure.  Sir, many start-ups, especially

high-tech ones, are typically risky in nature and not all  ideas

can develop into successful business opportunities.  However, if

some  of these ideas do become good business ventures, the gains

can  be  tremendous, as evidenced by the many Internet start-ups

which have achieved impressive market capitalisation around  the

world.  In cases where a venture fails, the entrepreneur and the

investors  could  suffer  substantial  losses  and  our  current

legislation,  especially  the  bankruptcy  law,  can   be   very

unforgiving and intolerant to those who dared to take  the  step

towards entrepreneurship and technopreneurship.  So I am hopeful

that  the  changes  proposed will encourage greater  risk-taking

among Singaporeans, a trait we lack currently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in today's context, being a bankrupt is a very big

stigma  and leaves a permanent scar in their lives.  Such people

are   treated   badly  by  society  and  not  many,   especially

institutions like banks and Government agencies, will be willing

to give them a second chance to try again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I strongly support the Minister of State's intent to

give  differential treatment for persons who get into  financial

problems due to normal business risks versus those who do so  as

a result of mismanagement and malpractice, the Bill however does

not attempt to clearly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>

differentiate  the two circumstances and it leaves  entirely  to

the judgement of the Official Assignee.  I would like to suggest

that the Minister of State consider stating these clearly in the

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that business failure need not result in

bankruptcy and therefore we should encourage and strengthen  the

use  of informal debt settlement as an alternative and therefore

mediation  should be made a prerequisite before  any  bankruptcy

proceedings  go  to the courts.  I hope that the requirement  of

mediation  before going to the courts can be formalised  in  the

Bill.   This will be a cheaper process and, in my opinion,  will

give  the  creditors a better chance to recover their money.   I

hope  the Minister of State will institutionalise pre-bankruptcy

mediation  in  the Bill.  This will save many  people  from  the

unpleasant experience of becoming bankrupt, a stigma  that  will

last a life time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sections 95 and 95A attempt to streamline the process

of discharge from bankruptcy.  By allowing a bankrupt to make an

offer  of composition or propose a scheme of arrangement without

calling  a  general  meeting of creditors will  make  the  whole

process  less cumbersome.  By allowing the Official Assignee  to

administratively  discharge  a bankrupt  through  a  certificate

after  this arrangement is passed by a special resolution  means

that there is no need to bring the process to the court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the new section 123A does not require a person

to  go back to the courts to be discharged from bankruptcy if he

has  paid  his  debts.  By empowering the Official  Assignee  to

issue  the  Certificate of Annulment, or discharge, the  process

will be much faster, saving both time and cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these changes are big steps that show the Government's

willingness to help those who have failed to get back  to  their

normal mode of living by removing some major obstacles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to ask the Minister of State to

clarify whether the Official Assignee will be able to issue such

Certificate  of  Annulment within the minimum  three  years,  as

stipulated in the Bill, or will the bankrupt still have to wait



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>

for  this  time  period  to  be up  before  being  eligible  for

discharge  by  a Certificate, especially in the case  where  the

bankrupt has already paid up all the debts that he owes  to  the

creditors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the next amendment in section 125. I am

glad  that the minimum period of bankruptcy before a Certificate

of  Discharge can be issued has been reduced from five years  to

three  years.  Can I, however, ask the Minister of State whether

he  will consider reducing this period to less than three years?

At  this  juncture,  in fact, I would like to  suggest  that  we

define in our legislation two categories of bankruptcy. One that

occurs  as  a  result of failure of business venture  especially

those  of  high-tech in nature and, the second, as a  result  of

malpractice and mismanagement.  Our current "one size fits  all"

ruling treats all failures equally and this, in my opinion, will

discourage many technopreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Ministry does have the intent to institute a

differential treatment for the two categories, I would  like  to

suggest    that   the   Ministry   study   the    proposal    of

institutionalising a two-tier bankruptcy ruling where those  who

became bankrupts by virtue of true business failure, without the

intent  of malice or mismanagement, be allowed an easier  option

to  be  discharged.  This  will achieve  two  objectives  in  my

opinion.  First, it will encourage more people to embark on high-risk  technological start-ups and, second, it will allow  people

who  failed to become more productive and to try again at a much

faster pace than the current legislation allows.  As an example,

in the Silicon Valley in the USA, once a person who has become a

bankrupt proves that he has no other assets that can be used  to

distribute  to his creditors, automatic discharge  is  possible.

This  of  course  is an ideal approach.  This has  made  Silicon

Valley in the USA a vibrant place for many new start-ups because

technopreneurs do not have to wait too long before  starting  up

new   ventures  again.   In  my  opinion,  such  a  change  will

definitely shift mindsets among Singaporeans towards being  more

entrepreneurial.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By amending section 148 of the Companies Act, we

effectively allow bankrupts to be economically productive.  This

is  an  excellent  move  because I feel that  this  allows  many

talented people to contribute their knowledge and experience and

perhaps  even establish successful ventures in the process.   It

is  a waste of our valuable resources by not allowing them to do

business  or to act as company directors or to manage companies.

The  new  arrangement of empowering the Official  Assignee  will

definitely make it easier for them to become economically active

faster.   Can  I suggest that we take a bolder step by  amending

this section to read as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bankrupts should be allowed to act as company directors

unless the Official Assignee disagrees."

<br><br>In  this approach, such bankrupts would automatically be allowed

to  do  all  the  things that we have mentioned without  getting

permission,  but if someone wants to object, then  the  Official

Assignee  can  come in and take action based on that  objection.

This would give a more positive outlook to our legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last comment I have is on section 254(2)(a) where the

debt threshold for filing bankruptcy has been raised from $2,000

to  $10,000.   While the increase looks big and is  welcomed,  I

feel  that  many  high-tech start-ups  can  be  very  much  more

expensive  than the $10,000 and this $10,000 limit  may  not  be

helpful  if  such ventures fail.  Here again, having a  two-tier

bankruptcy  rule where perhaps, we set a much higher  limit  for

high-tech  start-ups and for ventures that require  a  lot  more

capital to be accorded a different limit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to add that the changes

proposed  in  this Bill reflect the desire of the Government  to

promote a conducive environment for technopreneurs and will give

a  good signal of the type of changes we need to make for T21 to

be successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this will not be the end of the changes we are

willing to make to this Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>

and I hope that the Minister of State will be willing to be more

aggressive and consider some of the recommendations I have  made

in reviewing the Bill again in the near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before commenting on the

Bill, I would like to declare my interest as a lawyer in private

practice where from time to time, I advise clients on bankruptcy

and insolvency matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, the Companies Act and

the  Business Registration Act proposed under the Bill  seek  to

put   in   place   important  measures   in   support   of   the

Technopreneurship  21  initiative  which  we  are  promoting  in

Singapore.  The proposed amendments are welcomed as concrete and

practical  measures to relax the rules and procedures  affecting

bankrupts  in  Singapore.  It is hoped that these  changes  will

help  encourage  greater risk-taking amongst  entrepreneurs  and

would-be   entrepreneurs   and  will  reduce   the   unnecessary

restrictions  and  burdens  on those  who  may  have  failed  in

previous business ventures but have the resolve to try again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the measures to encourage the bankrupt to work

towards  a  speedier  discharge of his bankruptcy,  perhaps  the

Minister  of  State could also consider relaxing the  conditions

for bankrupts to travel and work outside Singapore.  I have come

across  a  number of cases where the bankrupts  have  failed  in

their  business ventures in Singapore, or had been  structurally

retrenched from their jobs, but who are willing to travel abroad

to  take up employment opportunities in other countries in order

to  earn a living to provide for their families, to repay  their

debts and to secure a discharge of their bankruptcy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have discussed on many occasions in this House the

problems  of  structured  unemployment  .   Where  a  person  is

retrenched  because  of  the particular  industry  he  has  been

engaged  in  is  going  through a period  of  consolidation  and

structural changes, it would not be easy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>

for  him  to find another job in Singapore.  And it would  be  a

double  whammy  for  that person if, because  of  the  financial

difficulties arising from unemployment, he is made a bankrupt as

well.   Under  the existing rules, a bankrupt has  to  seek  the

permission  of  the Official Assignee (OA) to do  so.   However,

such  permission from the OA may be declined or  delayed  for  a

whole  host of reasons.  One of the key concerns is in  ensuring

that  the  bankrupt  would  fulfil his obligations  towards  his

creditors and the OA when he is free to leave the country.  Yet,

the  job abroad may offer just the most crucial opportunity  for

the bankrupt to turn his life around.  Therefore, I believe that

we  should  find ways of fine-tuning the present  conditions  to

allow  the  bankrupt to work overseas while  at  the  same  time

securing his return to repay his debts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although changes to existing legislation are necessary for

the  changing  needs of our society, we must of course  bear  in

mind the need to balance the interest of the individual bankrupt

and  those of his creditors.  It is also important that the  new

rules  are not open to abuse.  In this connection, I would  like

to   make  the  following  comments  on  some  of  the  specific

provisions proposed under the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the proposed amendment to section 95 of the

Bankruptcy  Act is intended to simplify the existing  procedures

for  a  bankrupt  to  propose  the  composition  and  scheme  of

arrangement  of his debts to his creditors and to  obtain  their

approval.   The composition or scheme of arrangement  may  under

the  re-enacted  section 95 be voted on at  a  physical  general

meeting of creditors, or the votes may be put in writing through

the   post   by  the  creditors.   This  makes  it  easier   for

compositions   and  schemes  of  arrangement   to   be   settled

conveniently and with less hassle.  However, the new section  95

provides  that anyone who fails to attend a meeting of creditors

or  who  fails  to signify his assent or dissent in  writing  is

taken  to  have  voted  in favour of the  resolution.   This  is

different  from the present position whereby such  a  creditor's

debt  will  merely be disregarded in calculating the percentages

of rates for or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>

against  the  resolution. The new provision appears  to  detract

from  the  fundamental  principle of law  that  silence  is  not

assent.   The objection to this is not merely academic,  as  the

effect of a successful composition under the new section  95  is

that  the rights of the creditors may be affected, ie, that they

may  have  to accept less than 100% of their debt or  compromise

their  priority status in the ranking of creditors.   While  the

new procedures are in general welcomed, I wonder if it would  be

going  too  far  to put undue pressure on creditors  with  these

technicalities.   A creditor may fail to attend  a  meeting  for

good  reasons, for instance, the notice for the meeting may have

gone astray.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, could the Minister clarify what is the result

where  nobody  attends  the  meeting  or  replies  to  the  OA's

invitation to vote?  As there is no longer a requirement  for  a

quorum,  it appears that composition will go through  with  100%

voting in favour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to clause 8 of the Bill. The

proposed section 157 deals with service of "any summons,  notice

or  document"  and  is  thus wide enough  to  cover  service  of

statutory demands and creditors' petitions.  The old section 157

made  it  clear  that  it did not apply to the  service  of  any

document   for  which  a  special  mode  of  service  had   been

prescribed.    Thus,  the  old  section  157  operated   without

prejudice  to the rule relating to personal service of statutory

demands and the rule relating to personal service of petition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 157 is not restricted in this manner and by

reference  to the rules, it appears to be intended  to  override

the  rules  and  thus will conflict with these  rules.  The  new

section  157  should therefore make it clear whether  it  is  to

operate  without  prejudice to the rules or notwithstanding  the

rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My preference is that it should operate notwithstanding

these  rules, which should then be repealed. This will  make  it

easier  for  creditors to serve such documents  on  debtors  who

frequently evade service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>

However, this may go against the spirit of the amendments  which

is to be more protective of debtors' interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture I would also like to raise an

ancillary  point  on  the  present  section  123(1)(b)  of   the

principal Act where there appears to be a typographical mistake.

The word "paid" in the second line of subsection (b) should read

as  "proved".   This may be a good opportunity to  rectify  this

error.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point relates to the powers of the court. The new

amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, Companies Act and the Business

Registration Act will widen the powers of the Official Assignee.

Some  of these powers were only exercisable by the Court in  the

past, but now they will be exercisable by the Official Assignee.

Indeed, it appears that no procedure has been provided to  allow

the  Court  to  oversee the exercise of the  OA's  discretionary

powers.  There is no objection in principle in giving these wide

powers to the OA.  However, the law should provide some form  of

mechanism for a dissatisfied creditor to apply to the  Court  to

review, and if found fit, to have the exercise of the power  set

aside.  Although it is recognised that the OA's office is  in  a

better  position than the Courts in many cases to deal with  the

particular matters which the new powers relate to, there may  be

special circumstances in which the Courts' intervention  may  be

necessary  to bring about a fairer balance between the  interest

of  the  bankrupt and those of the creditors.  In line with  the

spirit of the new amendments, such a mechanism for review  could

take  the form of a quick and simple application under  the  Act

rather than by cumbersome procedures for judicial review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

thank you for giving me this opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. May I suggest to the Minister to

consider changing the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>

title  of  the  Act  from "Bankruptcy Act" to "Insolvency  Act".

"Bankruptcy"  is  a  much disliked word  these  days.   We  have

transformed our bankruptcy law in the last few years and this is

very  progressive, and I would like to thank  the  Minister  for

taking  the initiative and bringing in the amendments at such  a

short notice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have some suggestions. Could the office of the

Official Assignee and Public Trustee be corporatised to be  more

service-oriented in the long term?  I am not suggesting that  it

should  be done today.  But we should look into this on a  long-term  plan.  I have at the 1998 Budget debate praised  the  good

work  of the Official Assignee and Public Trustee.  In fact,  my

feedback  is  this.  I have had some dealings with the  Official

Assignee  and Public Trustee and the department has improved  by

leaps and bounds.  I have seen how effectively a bankrupt's case

is being managed now and dividends paid at a shorter period than

it was previously. What used to take a few years now takes a few

months.   The backlog has been cleared not only in the  judicial

system but also by the Official Assignee, and I think this House

should be grateful for the work done by this department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that businessmen who have failed

should   be   given  a  second  chance.   This  would  encourage

entrepreneurship.  I am glad that under clause 4, creditors  can

accept  composition of this scheme by special resolution.   This

clause  lays down the procedure for doing it.  I do not have  to

repeat  it.  It is gratifying to note that under section 35A  of

the Act, the Official Assignee has the power of annulment before

going  to  Court.  Previously, applications had to  be  made  to

Court  and it was expensive and time-consuming.  Now, this power

is vested in the OA and it is a very laudable clause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a little concerned about subsection 2 of this section.

It  says  that "notice of annulment shall be advertised  in  the

Government  Gazette  in  any  local  newspaper".   I  think,  in

fairness,  Sir,  the  advertisement should  be  in  one  English

newspaper  and  one  in  a vernacular language  newspaper.   The

decision should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>

be left to the Official Assignee as to which newspaper he wishes

to choose.  But perhaps one consideration should be the debtors.

If  the  debtor  is an Indian, he may want to publish  in  Tamil

Murasu.  Similarly, if he is a Malay, he may want to publish  in

Berita Harian.  I think we should bear this in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion is that the Official Assignee should

farm out some of its work to accountants and lawyers. This would

give  an opportunity for young lawyers and young accountants  to

practise some insolvency laws as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I welcome section 123A. It allows for annulment

of bankruptcy orders for debts that are being fully paid up.   I

am  also  glad  that  section 157 has brought about  fundamental

changes.   Previously, we had what is called "personal service".

New section 157(1) says that service could be effected by:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) delivering it to him;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) by delivering it to any adult person residing at his

usual or last known place of residence .;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) by leaving it at his usual or last known place of

residence or business; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) by forwarding it by registered post in a cover

addressed  to him at his usual or last known place of  residence

or business or at any address furnished by him.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I am glad, Sir, is the composition that the

Minister  has  mentioned earlier.  I am glad that  it  has  been

done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the benefit of going through Mr Inderjit

Singh's  speech earlier, and I support his call for  a  two-tier

category.    I  think  it  is  something  that  is   worthy   of

consideration. Although it may not be practical now, I think  we

should give it serious thought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very judicious Bill. The interests of the

creditors  and  the  debtors have all been taken  into  account.

Finally, I owe it to the Attorney-General's Chambers.  I wish to

congratulate  them  for this Bill which is in  simple  language.

Plain  English is taking place now and I am glad.   Perhaps  the

Minister  could write a note to the Attorney-General's  Chambers

on this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You write.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Jeyaretnam. I will do it.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> First, let me thank all the

speakers  who  have spoken.  Sir, indeed, as the  speeches  have

underscored,  it  is important to keep a proper balance  between

the interests of the creditors and the debtors.  There were some

speeches  in  this House which have reflected some  concerns  of

debtors,  and  other  speeches in this House  asking  for  more,

reflecting  concerns of creditors.  I think  this  is  something

which  we always keep in mind.  I am glad that Members  can  see

that in other exercises concerning bankruptcy laws which we had,

first,  the  revamp in 1995, and then we continued to  fine-tune

the  law  over the last 2-3 years, we have kept this balance  in

place.  Indeed, as one or two Members have asked whether or  not

there  can  be  further refinements, the  answer  will  be  yes,

because  no  laws  are  cast in stone,  particularly  laws  like

bankruptcy  and  as  has been shown from our  track  record.   I

think, where appropriate, to maintain this balance in the  light

of  changing  circumstances, as have happened,  with  the  drive

towards  technopreneurship.  These amendments have  been  partly

driven by this drive towards technopreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the points of Members now. On Mr Chng Hee

Kok's  main point, he says that there are some people who  still

see  bankruptcy discharge proceedings as being rather  slow.   I

think  a  lot must depend on the bankrupt.  Because in terms  of

refinements,  firstly, to the procedures and, secondly,  to  the

insolvency  service of the Insolvency and Public Trustee  Office

(IPTO),  the  Official  Assignee and his staff  have  made  many

improvements to the procedures and process of bankruptcy.   Many

units, for example, have been formed.  One unit, for example, is

the  Bankruptcy  Unit for Discharges, a special unit  formed  to

speedily  process  all  bankruptcy  discharges.   And  it   also

maintains a hot line to inform bankrupts of the status of  their

cases.  Indeed, some of its innovations, like I have said,  have

been recognised by other world-wide agencies.  One



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>

example,  besides  the one I mentioned in my speech,  where  the

Commonwealth Association of Public Administration and Management

recognised  its discharge by certificate process,  is  the  fact

that  the  IPTO last year became the first legal institution  in

Singapore  and the first insolvency service in the world  to  be

awarded  the  ISO  9002.   And I am glad  Mr  Rai,  through  his

practical  experience,  also testifies  to  the  fact  that  the

processes  have  improved.  I think that is the first  thing  to

note.   If there is any delay in the discharge of any particular

bankrupt, it is not because of the processes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OA tells me that he has in fact hired temporary staff

when  the  need arose to cater to the demand.  He also tells  me

that  from his experience, there will always be about 20-25%  of

bankrupts  who do not cooperate with his office.   They  do  not

file statements.  They do not turn up for meetings.  So it is  a

matter of getting people to understand that it is to their  full

benefit to cooperate with the OAPT, particularly in view of  the

discharge by certificate process.  It has worked for many cases,

because this process, in fact, encourages deserving bankrupts to

cooperate.  And if they do and they fit within the requirements,

then the OAPT can consider selecting such deserving bankrupts to

be discharged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of people who may hold up discharges are

the  creditors.   So  besides  the  bankrupts,  there  are  also

creditors  who  hold  up the discharge process,  in  respect  of

offers of composition by bankrupts.  They do not respond to  the

OA's letters, despite many reminders.  This can be quite taxing.

This is in fact one of the problems being addressed by the Bill,

that debtors who come forward, cooperate and who are able to put

together an offer of composition or scheme of arrangement should

not  be  held back by creditors who do not respond to  the  many

letters calling for meetings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok also asked whether the new guidelines will

apply to bankrupts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>

whose  process  of  discharge has begun.   Of  course,  the  new

guidelines  will apply to all outstanding cases.  So  they  will

benefit should they satisfy the requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh is another strong proponent for

creditors.    He  applauds  the  Government  for  making   these

innovations to the Bill and, indeed, I want to thank him because

I  think  he  captures the spirit behind the Bill, which  is  to

encourage  entrepreneurship.  On the other  hand,  like  I  have

said, we have to keep in mind the central point that we want  to

maintain  a  balance  between  the  interest  of  creditors  and

debtors.  So we cannot go overboard.  We must keep this in mind,

because otherwise if bankrupts are able to get out of bankruptcy

too  easily without showing effort on their part, that may  also

increase  business costs.  That may also increase the reluctance

of  bankers  to lend money.  I think that is the central  point.

His points are well made, but, at the same time, we have to keep

this balance in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his suggestion for a faster discharge process for high-tech businesses, as I have said, we have moved it down from five

years  to  three  years.  The three years will enable  the  OAPT

sufficient  time  to study the circumstances of the  bankruptcy,

and  will also give the bankrupt an opportunity to show that  he

is prepared to work with the OAPT.  All these factors are indeed

taken  into consideration.  If he does meet the criterion,  when

three  years  are  up, he will be considered  for  discharge  by

certificate.  I think we should keep it at that, and  not  lower

the 3-year criterion.  Let us see how the process works, and  if

circumstances warrant it, of course, we can consider it down the

road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is not to put this 3-year limit as an absolute

bar.   If  a  bankrupt is able to make an offer of  composition,

which  is accepted by the creditors or indeed has paid up fully,

then  he  will  be  discharged immediately, once  the  creditors

agree.   So  the  3-year  bar  is not  an  impediment  in  those

circumstances.  Indeed, the OAPT tells me that there  have  been

bankrupts who have been able to get out of bankruptcy  within  a

week.  So a lot depends on how quickly they cooperate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His observations on the importance of pre-bankruptcy

mediation are very valid ones.  Indeed, Mr Singh will  be  happy

to  know  that  the  Ministry of Law is  now  working  with  the

Official Assignee and the Singapore Mediation Centre on  a  pre-bankruptcy  mediation programme.  Once the  details  are  ready,

they  will  be announced.  In the meantime, the OAPT is  already

exploiting  mediation, not at the pre-bankruptcy stage,  but  at

the  post-bankruptcy  stage.  A Bankruptcy  Mediation  Unit  was

formed  earlier  this  year  to provide  mediation  services  to

bankrupts  and  creditors to encourage them to  work  towards  a

settlement.  I have been told that to-date, 104 cases have  been

successfully  mediated.  So lessons which are  learned  by  this

Unit  can,  of  course,  be applied to pre-bankruptcy  processes

which  are also important, because then it will keep the  person

away from the bankruptcy regime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh also asked about

the criteria and the process by which the OA will decide whether

or  not  to allow bankrupts to manage businesses or be directors

of  companies.  Both in New Zealand and Malaysia, it is  the  OA

who grants such permission.  The OA is looking into the criteria

that  are used in these countries before finalising the  factors

that he would consider.  What is important is that in processing

such  applications, the OA will consider the  interests  of  the

public,  the  creditors and the bankrupt.   He  will  take  into

account a number of factors which will include, first, the cause

of  bankruptcy;  secondly,  previous  involvement  in  a  failed

business   or  company;  thirdly,  liability  of  the   proposed

business; and, fourthly, whether creditors will benefit from the

proposed  business.  These are the factors which will guide  his

deliberations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said just now that the OA is well placed to make

this  consideration  because he and  his  staff  deal  with  the

bankrupt on a continual basis.  So he will be able to assess not

just their ability to pay but their character and whether or not

they  will fulfil these criteria.  Certainly, when he makes  his

decision,  he  is  not  going to act alone.   There  will  be  a

committee that will assist him in the OA's office.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>

committee will include other professionals like accountants  who

can  also help him make a professional judgment.  Let me  assure

this House that the OA will make his decisions very judiciously,

taking into consideration the factors that I have mentioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min asked about this perennial question of

travelling  for bankrupts, particularly bankrupts  who  want  to

work  overseas.  He says in the past, it was so difficult.   The

bankrupt works overseas to help him pay off his debts,  get  him

off  the  bankruptcy,  helps everybody,  but  the  bankrupt  has

difficulty travelling.  I think he will be very pleased to  know

that  this is a problem of the past, because the OAPT  tells  me

that  in so far as working overseas is concerned, he is now more

relaxed.   This  is  set  out  in  a  brochure,  The  Bankruptcy

Information  Sheet  No. 5.  There are many  such  pamphlets  and

brochures on various matters which have been produced and  which

are  easily available, helping bankrupts along.  This one  deals

with  travelling  overseas, which says that a bankrupt  will  be

allowed  to travel overseas or remain abroad if he is   required

to do so in the course of his employment.  All that the bankrupt

needs  to do is to produce the employer's letter indicating  the

need to travel.  Indeed between August 1998 and July 1999, there

were 1,509 applications for bankrupts to travel for purposes  of

employment.   And  of these, only 6 or 0.4% were  rejected.   So

this will be good news for bankrupts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min makes a few points about the Bill itself.

One concern that he expresses is the amendment to section 95, as

to  the creditors' silence on a composition offer, whether  that

is  unfair  to the creditors.  On the other hand, other  Members

who  have  spoken  appreciate the thrust behind this  amendment.

Because here is a situation where you have creditors who, in the

past,  might have received letters informing them of the meeting

but  they  did not attend.  This holds up the process.   Really,

the  important  point is that the notice of the meeting  or  the

notice  that  they can object in writing must  be  sent  to  the

creditors.  And this will be done because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>

registered  post  will  be used.  Since a  large  percentage  of

creditors are institutions, companies, businesses  -  more  than

80%   -   the  likelihood of wrong address  or  the  letter  not

reaching  the place is very minimum.  Indeed, the OAPT tells  me

that   for   many  of  these  situations,  creditors   who   are

institutions  have  written off these  debts  and  are  not  too

concerned.   In fact, they may agree to the composition  but  in

the  past  they have never replied.  So this new amendment  will

help  expedite the process.  Indeed, this is not a new situation

because  we  have  other  provisions in our  law  where  silence

constitutes  consent.  Those lawyers who do  criminal  law  will

know  that.  An accused person who is served a notice of warning

containing charges made against him, if he keeps silent, adverse

inference  can  be drawn against him.  Even in the  Act  itself,

section  126  provides for a similar provision for discharge  by

certificate of the OA, which says that if the creditor does  not

object  to  a  notice  of  the OA's  intention  to  discharge  a

bankrupt,  he  is deemed to have no objection to the  discharge.

So this, in fact, has already been used in the current discharge

scheme  which has worked very well.  It is really just  applying

it  in other situations where it can be seen that from practical

experience  the OA is very clear that it will help expedite  the

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is section 157. Mr Rai also brings up this

point.   Of  course, the amendment makes it easier  for  various

notices  and summons to be served.  However, in so  far  as  the

document  relates  to  the  creditor's petitions  and  statutory

demands,  the current position of the need for personal  service

still  applies.  It must be so because these amendments  are  to

help  the bankrupt.  It is not to dispense with personal service

where  the creditors want to petition him for bankruptcy.   This

is  done  because there are express provisions in the Bankruptcy

Act  (sections 52 and 62) which specifically mention that  these

documents are to be served in a manner which is prescribed,  and

the  rules  in fact prescribe personal service.  These  sections

clear up this point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that Mr Ong mentioned is recourse to

courts.  I do not know whether he knows that section 30  in  the

Bankruptcy Act states very clearly that the OA is subject to the

control  of the court, and section 31 specifically empowers  the

court  to  review the OA's act on application of a  dissatisfied

bankrupt,  creditor or any other person.  This is a very  simple

process.  All it entails is an application to court which  would

be  heard in chambers, like any other summons.  Even though  the

Act  does give more powers to the OA, firstly, the assurance  to

the  House  is  that the OA, as the record shows, will  exercise

these  powers  judiciously.   Secondly,  these  amendments   are

procedural rather than substantive.  Thirdly, sections 30 and 31

will enable recourse to the courts by any dissatisfied bankrupt,

creditor  or any other person who may want to seek redress  from

an OA's action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai makes two suggestions, one complimenting the

Attorney-General and the other about improving  service  in  the

IPTO.  I think he will know that the IPTO was made an autonomous

agency  some  years ago and that has improved its services.   Of

course,  if the need arises, and if it is useful for  it  to  be

corporatised, that can be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

giving me this opportunity and allowing this motion to stand  on

the Order Paper.  Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House endorses the Principles for Determining and

Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and  the

Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies as  set

out  in  the  White Paper (Paper Cmd. 5 of 1999)  [presented  to

Parliament on 2nd July 1999].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after listening to the Prime Minister, the

Senior Minister and the Minister for Finance yesterday, I was in

two  minds about whether I should proceed with the motion.  Some

Backbenchers felt that I should not proceed.  I have  considered

the position and I am going to proceed with this motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Principles laid down in the White Paper were

arrived  at  after  consultation  with  the  President  and  the

Government.   It is reassuring to note that if any issues  arise

and  are  not  addressed  in the Principles,  the  parties  will

resolve  in  accordance  with  the  spirit  and  intent  of  the

Constitution.   I  repeat the words "spirit and  intent  of  the

Constitution".   This  is  in  keeping  with   the   spirit   of

conciliation and consensus we are trying to build in this  young

republic.  It is a part of our Shared Values as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the importance of the Principles, I can do no better

than  to quote the President's letter.  I quote: "will make  for

greater  certainty and clarity in approaching matters  affecting

the  reserves".   Here  again the key words  are  certainty  and

clarity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper will serve as a public record of the

convention,  and  convention  forms  an  important   branch   of

constitutional law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper will become an important reference

point  in future.  May I have your permission to quote from  the

document itself:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The constitutional practice embodied in these Principles

is  open to future evolution and refinement by future Presidents

and  Governments.  This is necessary as over time the Government

will make new transactions and policies, and the Principles will

need  to  be  extended or adapted to deal with  these  presently

unforeseen situations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By endorsing this motion, we would be giving the Principles

sanctity of a resolution which I think this White Paper  rightly

deserves.  It will gain public confidence and it will  have  the

approval  of  the  highest  forum of the  land,  that  is,  this

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Elected Presidency is a new

institution.  It will take some time to shape.  We must give the

institution  a  chance to develop.  We must  not  get  ourselves

unduly  concerned  if  there are minor  differences  as  to  the

methods  of  achieving the Principles enshrined  in  this  White

Paper as well as in the Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a practising lawyer and a student of constitutional law,

let me share with this House my belief in the Constitution.   In

our  Constitution, the President is still the  titular  head  of

state.   He  is  elected by the people but he has  no  executive

power.   He  acts on the advice of the Cabinet but he  is  given

extra powers to protect the reserves as well as the integrity of

the  civil  service.  He has veto power dealing  with  religious

harmony  and ISA.  If there is a hung parliament, as it  happens

in   India,  he  plays  an  important  constitutional  role   in

appointing the Prime Minister.  Let us pray and hope that we  do

not have a hung parliament in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President does not have the power to initiate policies.

This  still remains in the domain of the government of  the  day

which  derives its legitimacy from the mandate it  obtains  from

the electorate at General Election where political parties offer

their policies to the electorate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President does no such thing. The Presidential

candidate  does  not  go before the country with  any  political

platform.  Mr S. R. Nathan has not gone to the country with  any

political platform.  He asks the country to give him the mandate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>

to  discharge his constitutional responsibilities.  And I repeat

the words "constitutional responsibilities" which I have defined

earlier.   This  distinction  must be  appreciated.   The  Prime

Minister  and  his  Cabinet are accountable to this  Parliament.

The President does not have to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make this clear because some people think that

the  power base has changed.  It has not.  Having said that,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, we cannot run away that the President is the  Head

of  State.  He symbolises our nationhood.  We owe our loyalty to

him.   He bestows honour to our citizens.  He is patron to  many

charities  and art groups.  In short, he is a symbol  of  power.

It is therefore of utmost importance that the powers bestowed on

him should be respected.  His standing must never be undermined.

He   is   not  the  ruling  Party's  President  or  Opposition's

President.  He is our President, the entire country, and we must

bear this in mind at all times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea of Elected Presidency came from the mind of

the  then  Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.  He  has  given  his

thinking  during the Straits Times interview recently.   Members

have  read  it.   I  do  not  have to repeat  it.   His  younger

colleagues  accepted  the principle of  Elected  Presidency  and

worked for it.  It became an electoral issue in 1988 and the PAP

won  the  battle  against the Opposition's call to  curtail  the

power.   We have had a lengthy debate on the Elected Presidency.

Two White Papers were published.  Public hearings took place  in

the  Select Committee where there was an exchange of ideas.  And

I  think  some of the ideas from the representors were  in  fact

incorporated in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the nature of the office, in my submission

before  the  Select Committee, I had pleaded that the Presidency

should  be  above  party politics and I am  glad  all  political

parties  have  done so.   While the Cabinet and  other  MPs  are

entitled  to  support  the  Presidential  candidates,  political

parties  must  never  get  involved  in  the  campaign  for  the

Presidential Election.  Otherwise the President



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>

will  be  beholden.  Sir, I have a terrible dislike of the  word

"beholden".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's address to the press has

given  rise to public concern about the constitutional mechanism

to  safeguard  our reserves.  We must address  and  answer  this

question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution is not a writ in stone. It is a living

document   that  requires  changes,  interpretation   and   even

amendments  from  time to time to meet the requirements  of  the

country.  If the Constitution has to be amended, so be  it.   We

should debate it in public and see if it could be accepted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elected President and the Government have both worked

in a very harmonious manner.  It must be so.  I remember vividly

the  Prime  Minister,  who  was  then  the  First  Deputy  Prime

Minister,  said  that the Government was prepared  to  have  its

wings clipped.  There was no clamour to change the system.   The

Prime  Minister did on his own initiative for the  good  of  the

country.  The Prime Minister said, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bear in mind that in introducing this Bill, the present

Government  is  in  fact  clipping  its  own  wings.   Once  the

Constitutional amendment is effected, this Government will  have

some of its powers checked.  The new Prime Minister will need to

seek  the  concurrence of the President in certain key areas  of

Government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has rightly pointed out his position.

However, the power base did not change, and in fairness  to  the

Prime Minister he did tell the House, and I quote again:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me stress here, however, that the Bill does not

transfer  the power of government to the Elected President,  nor

vest  in  him  absolute veto power.  Firstly,  even  though  the

President  is  elected by the people, he  is  not  the  Head  of

Government.   He  is the Head of State.  He  is  not  the  Chief

Executive  of  the  country.   The  Prime  Minister  is.     The

initiative and responsibility of governing Singapore stays  with

the Prime Minister."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government, Ministers and civil

servants  must at all times try to help the President by  giving

him the necessary information.  If the President and his Council

of  Advisers are not given the necessary information,  then  the

President is hampered from making



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>

his  decision.   This  will  do no good  to  the  country.   The

President  must  have the right to call for  papers  and  summon

officers when the need arises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the President, I am proposing to the Government

that  a  high  ranking officer be appointed by the President  to

assist  him.   This  high ranking officer should  have  his  own

officials  to  assist  him.  We can call him  Secretary  to  the

President.  I leave it to the draftsman to think of a name.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to know that the President

has  no  problem  in  safeguarding the integrity  of  the  civil

service.  This is very comforting.  I take pride in this because

without  an  honest and dedicated civil service  we  will  never

succeed in building a peaceful and prosperous Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another concern in the President's address

was  the  need for a good and honest government.   Many  of  us,

especially  those who are young, take it for granted that  there

will  always  be honest government.  We have maintained  a  high

standard of integrity and honesty.  It is to the credit  of  the

founding fathers who paid a premium on a clean government.  Some

younger Members may not remember the clown and corrupt Ministers

we  used to have in this House.  They do not even know who  Chew

Swee  Kee  is.  It is important that whichever party  forms  the

government, we must maintain this high standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use having the constitutional protection in the

Presidency if we do not have an honest and open government.   It

is  in this spirit that we must institutionalise the process and

I  urge all political parties in Singapore to make it as a  part

of their political platform and culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corruption here is indeed almost non-existent. Whenever

corruption  charges are before the courts,  the  courts  take  a

serious view.  Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members travel from time to

time to other countries.  We can see how the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>

customs  and immigration officials conduct their work.  In  some

countries,  they  ask for baksheesh as if  it  was  their  birth

right.   Corruption is indeed almost non-existent here.   It  is

part of a political culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want hon. Members to consider this aspect rather

than  the earlier aspect more closely.  We are a country without

natural   resources  except  our  people  and  our   system   of

government.   We  must institutionalise this  virtue  of  honest

Government in every sphere of our life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like good health, we take good government for granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I end my speech with this remark. We are a young

nation.   Our institutions are still evolving.  We must  try  to

evolve  a  system of government that suits, and  I  repeat,  our

social,  economic  and political needs.  We cannot  just  borrow

from  other  countries' constitution.  We must  custom-make  our

Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in two weeks' time, the President will leave the

office.   I  want  hon. Members to join me in thanking  him  for

having  discharged his responsibility with dignity  and  honour.

He  has won the hearts of the people.  The House will join me in

wishing  him  the best in the days to come.  Mr  President,  you

have made us proud.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask hon. Members to support the motion which I have moved

and which has the support of my colleague, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have an amendment to the

motion, but before I speak on the amendment, I have a few  words

to say on the motion itself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am objecting to the

amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On what grounds, Mr Rai?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Could I have the floor, Mr Jeyaretnam?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You can object to the amendment later,

unless you are saying it is a question of principle.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Point of order and clarification as

well, Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your objection, Mr Rai?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> May I have the floor, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam has totally taken

away  my motion.  It is not an amendment to the motion.  He  had

been the Registrar of the Supreme Court.  He knows the procedure

very  well.   He must have my amendment in some form  or  other.

What  he has done is that he has completely taken out my  motion

and  put in his amendment, which is wrong.  I want a ruling from

you, Mr Speaker, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam's amendment is before the House.

Under Standing Order No. 35, an amendment may be proposed to the

motion  if it is relevant thereto.  The question now is  whether

the amendment is relevant to your motion or not, Mr Rai.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erskine May is very clear on this matter. It states that

the object of an amendment may be either to modify a question in

such a way as to increase its acceptability or to present to the

House  a different proposition as an alternative to the original

question.  This latter purpose may be effected by moving to omit

all  or  most of the words of the question after the first  word

"That"  and to substitute an alternative proposition which  must

however be relevant to the subject of the question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Mr Jeyaretnam's amendment, I find that the words

in  his  amendment are relevant to the subject under  discussion

and  that, being the case, I rule that Mr Jeyaretnam's amendment

is in order.  You may proceed, Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you for your ruling, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I hope you

will give me another five minutes stolen by Mr Rai.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry. You still have 30 minutes from

the time you started.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> From now?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> From the time you started.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. As I said, I

have a few words to say on the motion and that is, first of all,

I  must  express the amazement I felt when I received the notice

from the Clerk that Mr Shriniwas Rai was moving this motion.  If

any  motion  is to be moved, I would have thought it would  have

come from one of the Ministers of the Government.  They are  the

party  to this agreement, not Mr Shriniwas Rai, and he is not  a

Minister  of the Government, unless he thinks he is a member  of

the Government already.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is a very

uncalled-for remark.  I am not part of the Government and  I  do

not aspire to be part of the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> So I was surprised to see that it comes

from a Nominated Member of Parliament.  Be that as it may, it is

my  proposition  here  that  this agreement  has  lost  all  its

validity now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong assumed the post of President in 1993 and just three

months  before he leaves his office, an agreement is  presented,

setting out what should be the pattern of behaviour between  the

Government  and the President.  One would have thought  that  as

soon as the President has been appointed the first thing to have

done would be to come to an understanding on how the institution

was  going  to  be worked, but, no.  What is more surprising  is

that  it  comes after the Government would appear to  have  made

known  to Mr Ong that it would not support his re-election.   We

were  told  by  the  Prime Minister yesterday  that  it  was  in

February of this year that Mr Ong mentioned to him that he might

seek re-election.  And then, apparently, the Cabinet immediately

got into a huddle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>

about  it, called for the medical reports and then informed  him

that the Cabinet could not support his re-election as President.

What  is  the  purpose of having this agreement when  there  was

going  to  be another new President?  Should you not wait  until

the new President takes office and then have the agreement?   So

I  do  not  see  that  there  is any purpose  in  debating  this

agreement at the moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is the Constitution which sets out clearly,

I  should  have thought, the powers of the President  and  that,

according to the President, was not being strictly observed.  So

what  guarantee  is there that this agreement will  be  strictly

abided by?  I think it is a waste of time at the moment debating

this agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have something more serious. The question that I am

going  to  raise before this House is whether the PAP,  when  it

instituted this office of an Elected President to have executive

powers over the Government, was serious or whether it was all  a

show.   I  am  going  to explain why I ask this  question.   The

question that has to be answered is: was all this just a show, a

pretence, a game of make-believe or did the Government seriously

intend to do what it said it was proposing to do?  What was  the

promise that was made in July 1988 to the people of Singapore in

the  White  Paper?   There  was great  publicity  given  to  it,

although there was not enough public debate, and the analogy  of

the second key was used that the President would have the second

key;  the  Government cannot open the safe unless the  President

himself joins in and opens the safe for them.  It was said  that

if  the  Government wanted to spend any past reserves,  it  must

obtain the concurrence of the Elected President.  This was to be

a precondition, according to the PAP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is more? The White Paper went on to say, in grand

words, "The legitimacy and moral authority of the President  can

only  be derived from the will of the people as expressed in  an

election."   He  must have the moral authority  and  that  moral

authority must come from the will of the people as expressed  in

an election.  And then the White Paper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>

continues,  "The President will have the discretion to  withhold

concurrence  to decisions of the Prime Minister and  Cabinet  on

the spending of reserves and assets.  For a Cabinet decision  to

be  valid,  the second key must be used."  And what is important

is  that  the  White  Paper sets out, "The  President  shall  be

entitled  at his request to any information on matters requiring

his  assent.   All public officers [mark these  words]  will  be

placed  under  a  legal  duty to inform the  President  whenever

assets or reserves are to be used or pledged."  So this is  what

the  PAP  Government was telling the people, "We are an  honest,

good  Government.   We  are  now providing  you  with  a  second

safeguard.  He is going to safeguard your reserves."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bill was presented in Parliament, the mover of the

Bill,  our  present Prime Minister, then the First Deputy  Prime

Minister, said again that "The President will have the right  to

veto  budgets  if they draw down past reserves."  Bear  in  mind

that these words have been quoted by Dr Lee yesterday.  Bear  in

mind  that in introducing this Bill, the present Government  was

saying it was, in fact, "clipping its own wings".  "Clipping its

own  wings" means that it is depriving the Government from doing

something  which  it previously had the power to  do.  There  is

something  else to it where he says, "This Government will  have

some  of its powers checked."  And he says in the Third Reading,

"I  am  putting my money where my mouth is.  I am subjecting  my

Government to these new checks and balances." In other words, he

said  he would accept the authority of the President over  these

matters and he would be subject to his decisions.  That was  the

promise and the people were told "we are honest men, we are  men

of  integrity".  The Government would not wait for any  loss  to

occur   and   was  taking  all  sufficient  safeguards   because

Parliament  was  not  competent at  the  moment.   And  why  was

Parliament not competent?  It was simply because Parliament  was

deprived  of  an  effective opposition.  It is  very  heartening

when, at last, the Senior Minister has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>

come  to  the  realisation about the role of  an  opposition  in

Parliament.   He  has said what we have been saying  all  along,

that  if  you  want  a check on Government,  then  vote  in  the

opposition.   And  we  hope the electorate will  remember  that.

Have the opposition in.  So that was the promise of the PAP when

they introduced the office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the reality? We now hear from the President in

his  press conference that it was not exactly what the  PAP  had

promised.   The  President was, one could see,  very  restrained

when he spoke to the press.  He pulled his punches.  But despite

all that, it was quite clear to anyone reading between the lines

that the President was disillusioned with what was promised  and

the  reality.  He spoke of a long list of problems.   I  am  not

going  to  go  into all what he said because I do not  have  the

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we heard from the Minister, and no less than the

architect of this office, and the Prime Minister replying to the

President.  I am not here to make a judgment on who is right and

who  is  wrong.   The President was accused of not  setting  out

facts accurately. They did not exactly call him a liar but  they

said  he was not setting out the facts accurately.  May  I  tell

the  Government that if you think this matter should be  cleared

once and for all, then it should not just be brought before  the

House in a debate.  You should have a committee to look into  it

and  to  report  on  the  situation  that  existed  between  the

President  and  the  Government.  And I  am  commending  to  the

Government  that  if  they are really serious,  they  appoint  a

Parliamentary  committee consisting of the three opposition  MPs

and  three  backbenchers  from the Government  to  consider  the

difficulties  that the President said that he  had  experienced.

Now that the President is leaving his office, he can be summoned

by that committee to answer questions and to explain everything.

And   so  can  the  Government  Ministers  be  summoned  by  the

committee.   If you are serious, that is the only step  open  to

you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do not have to accept everything that the President

has said.  The Senior



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>

Minister - I am sorry he has left the House as soon as I started

to  speak, I wish he had stayed on - attempts to explain  and  I

see  he  has, in his explanations revealed the intention of  the

PAP,  knowingly or unknowingly.  He has revealed the truth.   He

says,  "There are a lot of misconceptions."  I do not know there

were a lot of misconceptions.  But if there were misconceptions,

who  is  responsible  for  those  misconceptions?   If  you  say

something  and the listener or the reader understands  it  in  a

different  meaning, then it is obvious that you  have  not  made

yourself clear.  But I thought that the Government had  made  it

clear.   But he says, "There are misconceptions."  Then  who  is

responsible, if not the PAP Government?  He says, "No  executive

power was granted to the President."  Are we playing with words,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir?  Here was the Prime Minister saying  in  this

House,  with  this office we are "clipping our wings".   We  are

subjecting  ourselves to the President's powers."  I  asked  the

Senior  Minister  yesterday that when the President  chooses  to

exercise  his  veto, is he not using his executive  power?   The

Senior Minister evaded that question and said, "I am not here to

argue  as to whether it is executive or not."  So are we playing

with words?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, "It was never intended that the President's

office  should  be  an  independent  office  to  check  on   the

Government."   Has he not read or heard what Mr  Goh  Chok  Tong

said when he was moving the Bill?  He said, "We are providing an

independent body to check.  You have this second key held by  an

independent  person."  What was Mr Lee doing when  Mr  Goh  said

these things in Parliament?  Was he not in Parliament then  when

Mr  Goh  said that the Government would be "clipping its wings"?

He  says,  "I  would  never had used those  words.  It  was  not

intended  that the Government's wings should be clipped."   Then

why  did he not correct it then?  He was the architect.   If  he

was  the architect and he sees the workman putting a brick which

should  not be put, he should have said, "No, no, that brick  is

out  of  place.  I did not want that brick there."  But  nothing

was said and the people were allowed to think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>

that  the  Government  was  really  giving  the  President   the

executive power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we do not just have the President's outburst. We

have  Mr Lee revealing what he thought were the powers that were

being  given  to the President which was what the PAP  intended.

But  that  was  not what the PAP said they were  giving  to  the

President.  So, the question is:  was all this a show,   a  show

in  front of the public not meant to be carried out, but just  a

showcase, a pretext?  Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  a  lot  of

pretence.  We pretend that we have a national press when  we  do

not have any national press. We have a PAP press.  I do not want

to go on but there are so many other things which are a pretence

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This episode has attracted attention not only in Singapore

but  outside Singapore.  It has drawn into question the  honesty

and integrity of this Government. What did it mean to do when it

brought this office into being?  Did they intend to carry out or

was  it  simply a wayang and the Government continued as it  had

done  previously?  Was there any directive to the civil  service

after  the  office was instituted that they should  provide  the

President with all information he needed because the White Paper

said  that that would be the duty of the Ministers and the civil

servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have much more time, Mr Speaker, Sir. I am going

to  suggest  to the Government that it can still redeem  itself.

It  can recover some of the credibility that it has lost and  it

can  only  do  that if it now goes before the people  again  and

explain  to  them  why this has arisen.   I  say  that,  in  all

decency,  this Government should resign and I mean it.   It  has

been  shown  up  to have instituted something which  it  had  no

intention  to allow to work.  It is a confidence trick,  nothing

short  of  it.  If the Government feels that it is not necessary

for  the  whole Government to resign, then I am sorry the  Prime

Minister  should resign.  It was he who promised the  people  in

Parliament what the office would be.  He should resign and go to

the people.  Let us not forget, as I keep saying in this House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>

again  and again that it is the people that matter.  So we  have

got  to  satisfy the people.  At the moment, there is a  lot  of

mumbling  going  on outside this House.  There is  a  perception

that the PAP did not want Mr Ong Teng Cheong to continue because

they  found it difficult to get along with him.  So there  is  a

perception which has been lodged with me several times  that  Mr

Nathan  is just the Cabinet's man.  Of course, we know  it.   It

was  revealed to us.  It was the Cabinet who chose him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the words that Mr Goh used when he asked the

House to pass the amendment?  May I repeat again:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The President must have, and be seen to have, the

legitimacy  and  moral authority derived from the  will  of  the

people  [not from the will of the Cabinet, but from the will  of

people]."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Mr Nathan have the will of the people?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> He was elected by the people!

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does Mr Nathan have the will of the people?

We  posed  this question in a press release but, of course,  the

Straits Times, true to its tradition of being a servile follower

of  the  Government, does not publish the press release.   So  I

say,  Mr Speaker, as we said in this press release, let us  stop

all  this  pretence.  Let us be honest.  Let us go back  to  the

people  and  explain  to them why this has  happened.   Let  the

people  make the judgment.  And I say quite seriously  that  the

installation of Mr Nathan should be postponed and that an Acting

President  should  be  appointed  until  the  people  are   told

everything and the matter is resolved to their satisfaction,  so

that  Singaporeans may say honestly and proudly that we  have  a

President  that  we  elected into office, not  that  we  have  a

President who has been foisted on us by the Cabinet.  We have no

choice and yet the PAP said, "(its President) must be elected by

the people."  But after saying it, they went out of their way to

see that people will not vote anyone of their choice.  So let us

stop all this humbug, all this pretence.  Let us, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>

I said, be honest now with ourselves and with the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The couplet in Shakespeare comes to my mind:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To thine ownself be true

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it must follow as day follows night

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou canst not be false to anyone'

<br><br>And  I  tell the PAP Government, be true to yourself.  What  did

you  intend  when  you presented the Bill to  change  the  whole

structure  of  the  Government?  There is a fundamental  change.

We, may I say, Mr President, the Workers' Party oppose  ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, not Mr President!

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, who are you addressing?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Speaker. Mr Speaker, Sir, we opposed

the  Bill.  We said that the President should not have executive

power.    It   should  rest  with  Parliament  to  control   the

Government.   And now, as I said, we seem to have found  support

from  a  quarter which we never expected and that is the  Senior

Minister.  Now he says it is Parliament with an Opposition.  So,

let  us reform ourselves.  Let us scrap this office of executive

President.  Let us take steps to see that there is growth of  an

effective Opposition, so that the Opposition can play its  role.

If  you  are honest with yourselves, and you are honest in  your

determination to do your duty for this country, you will do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move my amendment:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To delete all words following "That this House" and there

to insert  -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"regrets that the Government blocked the President's

efforts  to  exercise  the  powers  granted  to  him  under  the

constitution to safeguard the Accumulated Reserves of the people

and  deplores the conduct of the Ministers of Government and the

civil servants who failed to give the President any co-operation

to enable him to discharge his functions."

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question before this House is the amendment

moved by Mr Jeyaretnam.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left out,

be left out."

I shall now call on Members who wish to speak on the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  speak  against  the amendment  proposed  by  the  Non-Constituency Member, Mr J B Jeyaretnam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many tributes have been paid to President Ong and his

devotion  to duty, especially in the midst of grief.   Many  who

watched  the  National Day Parade have remarked on  the  courage

etched on the face of the President, his serenity  and composure

showing   a   fine  President  and  a  true  Singaporean.    All

Singaporeans   owe  an  enormous  debt  to  our  first   elected

President.  That is why I am particularly dismayed and  saddened

that at the end of his term in office, we in this House have  to

consider an amendment in the name of the Non-Constituency Member

that  seeks  to  bring  out all the disapproving  and  unhelpful

elements in an otherwise impeccable Presidential term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Non-Constituency Member has had many opportunities

yesterday to clarify his doubts, and he took advantage of  them.

He  asked  questions of the Prime Minister and Senior  Minister,

and  they  were answered, though perhaps not in the way  he  had

hoped  or  expected.   Yet,  at this time,  when  we  should  be

considering   the   positive  aspects  of  the   first   elected

Presidency, we are asked to make deprecatory remarks  about  the

relationship between the President and the Government.   Sir,  I

believe  we  should reject this amendment and proceed  with  the

original motion standing in the name of the Nominated Member, Mr

Rai.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Non-Constituency Member repeated matters that were

comprehensively  dealt  with  in  the  Ministerial   Statements.

Whilst  not  wishing to prolong discussion on them, may  I  just

draw  on  the  main  points  of the two  Ministerial  Statements

yesterday  to  rebut the Non-Constituency Member's  observations

that  there needs to be a committee of inquiry.   First of  all,

there was no attempt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>

to  block  the  President's efforts to  exercise  his  custodial

powers.  And that in the one incident referred to regarding  the

CPF  Board,  the  issue was one of accounting standards  and  of

correctly interpreting the Budget figures, and this is also  the

case with the meaning of the net investment income vis-a-vis the

past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and more broadly, both the Prime Minister and

Minister  for  Finance have reiterated that the Government,  ie,

the  Ministers and the civil service, treated the President with

great respect and answered all his queries.  There is no failure

to  give  the President the cooperation to enable him to perform

his  functions.  There is  nothing to regret or deplore  in  the

relationship  between  the  President  and  the  Government.   I

believe  that Members have all heard the accounts given  by  the

Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance yesterday, and  that

we  are satisfied with the explanations given.  There is no need

for  a committee of inquiry.  It is demeaning to the process  of

government.   There  is no case for it.   The  matter  has  been

adequately resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should reject this amendment and

consider  the very positive effects that have emerged  from  the

first  Presidency.  The White Paper that has  the  status  of  a

constitutional convention is a significant document.  It shows a

close  working  relationship  between  the  President  and   the

Government,  for  it  is  a  convention  that  is   reached   by

consultation and consensus.  This does not suggest, as the  Non-Constituency  Member  suggests, a  confrontational  relationship

between the two institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we, in Singapore, have adopted a unique form of

government,  of  two elected institutions  -  the President  and

Parliament.  We have also laid down in our Constitution that the

President  generally shall act in accordance with the advice  of

the  Cabinet.    The executive powers reside with  the  Cabinet,

which  in turn comprises Ministers who  are all Members of  this

House  and  answerable  to it.  The principle  of  parliamentary

government remains paramount.  This is so whether the  President

is elected or not, and we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>

not  playing  with  words.  The President is very  much  like  a

passenger in a car with his hand hovering over the handbrake  in

case the driver does something rash.  When the car is travelling

well,  there  is  no need for the passenger to worry  about  the

driver.   It  is only when the driver becomes rash  or  reckless

that  the  passenger  would  need to  have  his  hand  over  the

handbrake in case there is any unintended danger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, as a custodian, has veto powers on the use

of  past reserves and the appointment of senior public officials

conferred  on  him.  The relationship between the President  and

the Government is regulated both by the written Constitution and

by  constitutional conventions.  That is clearly  correct.   The

use  of constitutional conventions allows the President and  the

Government to evolve and keep in touch with the growth of ideas.

Indeed, it keeps the Constitution up to date.  Such a convention

makes the Constitution a living constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Sir, I ask that the amendment moved by the

Non-Constituency Member be speedily and decisively rejected.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the amended motion moved by the Secretary-General of the

Workers' Party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, the PAP Government amended the Constitution to

institute  the office of Elected President in what was  supposed

to  be  a  move to "clip the wings" of the Government.  Yet,  in

1994,  the  PAP  Government again amended the Constitution,  and

this time, it was to clip the wings of the President.  Under the

amended  Constitution, the President's consent is  not  required

for  defence expenditure.  Even if he knows it, he has no  power

to  veto  it  and to make it public.  The Monetary Authority  of

Singapore  (MAS)  no longer comes under the supervision  of  the

President.  There were also some other amendments.  As a result,

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>

original  intention  of having the President  to  safeguard  the

national  reserves is thus diminished.   Although  it  was  said

that  the Elected President was holding a "second key", the  PAP

Government changed the lock!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has become apparent to us that it is not the President

but  the Council of Presidential Advisers who is having the veto

power.    More  than  half  of the members  of  the  Council  of

Presidential Advisers were appointed by the Government,  and  in

the event of a tie in the votes, the Chairman of the Council has

the  last say.   Even if the President vetoes the advice of  the

Council,  Parliament can also overturn the President's  decision

by a two-thirds majority.  Under the current circumstances of  a

PAP  dominated Parliament, the Elected President is  actually  a

nominal   post.   Can  he  effectively  safeguard  our  national

reserves and our security?  No.  From our experience of the  way

the  first  Elected  President operated, we can  see  that  this

system  is  not  functioning effectively at all.   There  is  no

transparency  in  the workings between the  Government  and  the

President.   It  is  only after the first Elected  President  is

about  to  step  down  that we see problems  exist  between  the

President and the Government.  It has already become a thing  of

the past, and only then do the people know about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Elected President is actually nominated by

the  Government.   The word "elected" is a  misnomer.   Even  if

people  were  to vote,  they  can only vote for those  whom  the

Government   had  certified  to  be  eligible.    The   public's

participation  in  the  whole process is  subject  to  what  the

Government  has  provided  for  them.   This  system   of   pre-qualification is ineffective.  It has resulted in people who are

eligible  refusing  to  offer themselves for  nomination,  while

those  who are willing and ready to stand for election  fail  to

qualify under the rules set by the Government.  As a result, the

candidate endorsed and nominated by the Government just walks in

and   is  returned  unopposed.  The  so-called  "election"   and

"participation  of  the  people" have become  just  a  means  to

legitimatize the institution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Workers' Party feels that if we want to

effectively  safeguard the people's assets and the  security  of

the   country,  we  should  have  more  opposition  Members   in

Parliament so that the Government will be checked when  it  does

anything against the interest of the people, they have  to  face

the   challenge  of  opposition  and  the  prospect  of   losing

parliamentary seats in elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 12th August 1988, when the then First Deputy Prime

Minister was speaking on the amendment, he said, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A weak and/or opportunistic Government together with a

weak  opportunistic President, and both belonging  to  the  same

party.  Under that scenario, I think it is hopeless."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the words of the Prime Minister. In fact, what

the  people have to worry about is not a scenario in which there

is  an  opposition  party taking over the  Government.  What  we

really  need to worry is that you have a dominant PAP Government

and  a  PAP  approved Elected President but  have  no  effective

opposition  having  the  ability to  serve  as  a  mechanism  to

exercise  checks  and  balances on the  Government.   Under  the

circumstances,  there  may come a day when  the  PAP  Government

squanders away all the reserves of the nation and then Singapore

really is "hopeless", as the PM had said.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir, for

allowing  me  to join in the debate.  I think it  is  unfair  of

Prof.  Chin  Tet Yung to say that Mr Jeyaretnam has been  making

deprecatory remarks about the President.  The Opposition has got

nothing against Mr Ong personally.  If you look at the amendment

made by Mr Jeyaretnam, he regrets that the Government blocks the

President's effort to ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On what point are you rising?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> I am objecting to his saying

that  I  have been asking the House to make deprecatory  remarks

about  the President. That is not what I said.  What I said  was

that we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>

asked to make deprecatory remarks about the relationship between

the President and the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What I am going to say is that the

Opposition  has  got nothing against Mr Ong  personally.   Prof.

Chin  tries to draw a scenario where the Opposition is objecting

to Mr Ong personally.  We have got nothing to that effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Prof. Chin wants to make a

clarification.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> There is no such implication

in anything that I have said.  If Mr Chiam had listened clearly,

he  would  have  heard the sentence that we are  asked  to  make

deprecatory remarks about the relationship between the President

and the Government.  I said nothing about the Opposition, if  he

can recall.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think Mr Jeyaretnam in his reply later

on  will surely have something to say about the remarks made  by

Prof. Chin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam has no right of reply. Mr Chiam,

you may continue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Opposition in the 1988 general

election opposed the introduction of the Elected President.   It

had good reasons to do so.  It persisted that the institution of

the  Elected  President was installed so that it could  be  used

against  the  Opposition should the Opposition be  elected  into

power.   I can see that some of the younger Members are  smiling

in  this House.  They think that the Opposition cannot get  into

power,  but the Senior Minister and the older PAP Members  think

otherwise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981, Anson was lost. Then in the 1984 general

elections, not only two seats fell to the Opposition  but,  more

importantly,  there  was  a 12.3% swing  of  the  votes  to  the

Opposition. That massive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>

swing of the pendulum towards the Opposition shocked and angered

the  Senior  Minister, who was then the Prime  Minister.   Those

Members who watched television at 3.00 on the morning after  the

polling  was  over in 1984 would remember the grim face  of  the

Senior Minister. That election result shocked him.  He knew that

if  the pendulum swing continued at that rate, the PAP shall  be

out  of  office  in another two or three general elections.   He

took  the  12.3% swing of the votes to the Opposition seriously.

He knew that if nothing was done, the Opposition shall come into

power  in  10 or 15 years' time.  I believe it was the shock  of

the  big  swing of the votes to the Opposition in 1984 that  got

the Senior Minister to moot the idea of the GRCs and the Elected

President, purportedly to preserve national wealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members know what happened after that. The election laws

were  drastically changed to prevent further  PAP  loss  at  the

polls.  The Constitution was amended to bring in the institution

of  the  Elected President to protect and preserve the  national

wealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the institution of the Elected President is in

place, the Opposition has to make efforts to make sure that  the

Government abides by the Constitution, and not to ride roughshod

over  the Presidency.  This can easily happen since the  Elected

President  is  very much alone.  Whereas on the other  side,  we

have  an  all-powerful, overwhelming Government which  could  be

quite intimidating to the lone elected President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Teng Cheong, the current President, dared to speak

up.   Many  have  asked: how come he dares to do  so?   For  the

answer,  we  must look at the man himself.  He  was  a  die-hard

politician.  He has been toughened at the hustings.  He was also

a trade union man, and not an armchair one at that.  I have read

that  he  had  led  an industrial action once.   So  he  was  no

pushover.  He had guts.  He had courage.  I believe that it  was

this  nature of Mr Ong which compelled him to speak up to  voice

his dissatisfaction of the way the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>

Government treated the office of the Elected President.   We  in

the  Opposition support Mr Ong's press conference of 16th  July.

We  are  happy  that  he  dared  to  speak  out,  criticise  the

Government,  and  voice his dissatisfaction  with  the  way  the

Government treated the office of the Presidency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elected President has two important custodial powers.

One  is to oversee new appointments, and the other is to protect

the reserves that have been accumulated by previous governments.

We in the Opposition shall assist the Elected President to carry

out  his duties. We shall speak up in Parliament if there is any

hint  that  the  Government attempts to  block  the  President's

effort to exercise those powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amended motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, do I have the right to reply

to the Member now or do I wait till I conclude?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have to reply at the end of the motion. Do

you want to speak on the amendment?

Sir, I ask the House to reject the amendment.  Do not laugh,  Mr

Jeyaretnam,  I  am coming to it.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam  forgets

that  any  Member  of Parliament can raise  any  issue  in  this

Parliament. The fact that he has moved an amendment to my motion

signifies that I have the right to speak.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does that mean you do not have the

right?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> It is for the House to decide whether I

have the right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you. Mr Jeyaretnam has cast

aspersion  on  the office of the Presidency.  The President  has

discharged his constitutional responsibility ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. What is your point. Are you seeking a

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, a clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you giving way?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am not giving way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is not giving way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The previous speaker has said that I never

cast  aspersions and now Mr Rai comes on and says  that  I  cast

aspersions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right, you have made your point. You will

continue, Mr Rai.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was at pains

explaining to the House earlier the nature of the office of  the

Presidency.   The  President is never  an  Executive  President.

Leave  the Constitution alone.  Do not go to the Hansard because

the  Hansard  is  not the Constitution.  But I will  go  to  the

Hansard  since Mr Jeyaretnam has quoted from the Hansard  and  I

will give him his piece.  Speaking on the Second Reading of  the

Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Bill

on 4th October 1990, the Prime Minister said, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Objective of the Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for an Elected President to safeguard the

reserve and integrity of the public services.  Specifically, the

President will have:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the right to veto the annual budgets of the

Government,  statutory boards and key Government  companies,  if

they draw down reserves accumulated during the terms of previous

governments;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the right to veto key public service appointments; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) safeguard roles with respect to the Internal Security

Act,  the  proposed Maintenance of Religious Harmony  Bill,  and

CPIB."



<br><br>I  will  go  further.   What the Prime Minister  said  is  worth

listening to.  He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are singularly lucky that able and honest men were in

charge of Singapore for the last 31 years.  They have not abused

their  powers.  They have worked the parliamentary  system  very

well.   And because they have worked the system very well,  this

has  caused some people to conclude that there is nothing  wrong

with  the  present  system and that we  should  therefore  leave

things alone - do not make any modifications to the Constitution

or to the system.  But in my view, the marvellous working of our

parliamentary  system is due less to the merits  of  the  system

than to the integrity and quality of the people working it.  And

while  honest men are still in charge, it is prudent for  us  to

institute  a  system  of checks and balances  in  our  political

system,  instead  of banking on good fortune to  throw  up  good

governments for the next 30 years."



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> There are "checks and balances". That

is what he said.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Yes, the checks and balances are there.

But  he  was saying something more.  Sir, the other thing  I  am

saddened is this:  Mr Jeyaretnam is a lawyer and he knows  that.

Mr S.R. Nathan has been constitutionally elected by the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> By the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Because he has offered himself for

election  and  nobody comes forward to challenge him.   Are  you

saying that he is not elected by the people themselves?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Take a writ in the High Court and I will

argue against it, and I will not charge him any cost, if I  win.

Mr Jeyaretnam, let us be ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I urge the two Members not to

indulge in a personal discussion, and make their remarks to  the

Chair.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am sorry, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> He got carried away.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr S.R. Nathan's choice

is  not just the Cabinet's choice.  He is qualified for the  job

because  he was a former Permanent Secretary.  And may I declare

my  interest, Sir.  Mr S.R. Nathan is a member of SINDA.  I have

worked  with him in SINDA.  I was at the Nomination Centre  this

morning to endorse him.  I spoke about him in May this year when

the   motion on Singapore 21was being debated and I paid tribute

to  the  man  who,  because of his ability, has transformed  one

community  organisation.  And let me quote from Prof. Tommy  Koh

who had issued a statement to the public at large.  He says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ambassador Nathan has the intellectual ability and moral

courage to discharge his constitutional duties as President.  Of

his intellectual powers there can be no doubt."

<br><br>I  was  hoping that Mr Jeyaretnam will never bring up the office

of  the Presidency again, but since he has decided, he wants  us

to   postpone  the  installation.   Let  us  not  shut  out  the

Constitution.   Let us accept this fact.  He has  been  elected,

and  I  use  the word "elected" by the people.  As  I  said,  he

should assume office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with Prof. Chin that the office of

Presidency should go by convention.  And that is why  I  brought

up  this White Paper today to have the approval of this House to

give it the sanctity of a resolution of this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to prolong the agony of this House. Let

us reject this amendment.  It does not deserve the consideration

of  this  House.   Mr Chiam has said some good words  about  the

system, but still I do not agree with him and my good friend, Mr

would  like  to  preface  my speech  by  stating  my  view  that

President  Ong  is a good President.  In spite  of  his  illness

which  he  and his late wife suffered, he discharged his  duties

well.   I  would  also  like to put on  record  my  wholehearted

endorsement  of  Mr S. R. Nathan's candidature for  the  Elected

Presidency.   In  my capacity as Director of  the  Institute  of

Policy Studies, I have come to know and to work closely with  Mr

Nathan  in his capacity as Director of the Institute of  Defence

and  Strategic  Studies.   I have the  highest  regard  for  his

integrity and sound judgement, and have not the slightest  doubt

that,  if  necessary, Mr Nathan as President will  exercise  his

custodial  powers responsibly and will by no means be a  yes-man

of the Government.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.35 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the motion which I fully support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper carefully lays out for the first time the

definition  of  what  constitutes  past  reserves,  how   budget

surpluses are treated, what should be done in a transition  year

and  the  frequency and type of information to be given  to  the

President.   It is a meticulously written document.   I  applaud

the effort that went into producing the paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also fully endorse the objective of the White Paper which

is  to  enable the President and Government to have a harmonious

working relationship.  The clarity and transparency achieved  by

the  White Paper go a long way towards removing some ambiguities

where  reserves are concerned.  My only reservation is that  the

White  Paper should have gone further in its clarification.   It

is  a good first step but it is not enough.  I am rather puzzled

as  to why there is such an easy escape clause.  So long as  the

President  and  the Government agree that the Principles  apply,

they  apply.  But in the event that one party notifies the other

that it does not wish to abide by the Principles, they no longer

apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to give a concrete example as an illustration.

Suppose that in future the government of the day decides to sell

a piece of state land.  The White Paper states that the value of

the  state  land is its fair market value, in other  words,  the

highest acceptable bid by tender, and that all of this amount is

considered  to  be past reserves.  Suppose it is boom  time  and

property prices have doubled.  The fair market value at the time

of  transaction is $20 million but the Government  returns  only

$10  million to past reserves, retaining $10 million as  current

reserves,  giving the reason that the fair market value  is  not

the  value  at  the  time of transaction but at  the  time  they

assumed  office,  which was $10 million.   And  hence  only  $10

million is considered to be past reserves.  In other words,  the

government  of the day decides not to abide by the  White  Paper

and  that it then unilaterally informs the President of the  day

that  this  is the case and proceeds to return only $10  million

and not $20 million to past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What recourse does the President have to prevent the

Government  from  doing so?  Since the Principles  are  only  in

operation when both sides agree, it would appear that apart from

publicising the disagreement and applying public pressure, there

is very little else that the President can do.  After all, it is

not  a  dispute  regarding the use of past reserves.   It  is  a

dispute regarding the definition of past reserves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple example illustrates the point that the

disagreement  over  what  constitutes  past  reserves  can  have

serious consequences for the size of past reserves, particularly

where  the  treatment of state land is concerned.  In  my  view,

therefore,  steps should be taken to prevent the  occurrence  of

such  a  scenario in future where the government of the day  can

merely  by  formally notifying the President not  abide  by  the

Principles in the White Paper.  This is too easy.  It should  be

made  more difficult for either party if they wish to do so.   I

therefore  believe  that these Principles should  eventually  be

part of the Constitution sometime in the future.  It should  not

be  done  so  now,  because  to cast them  in  stone  now  would

introduce too much rigidity, while an element of flexibility  is

needed  at  this  early  stage of  the  office  of  the  Elected

Presidency.   The  Principles should first  be  tested  out  and

refined,  and then at some later stage, be incorporated  in  the

Constitution.  But I do believe that we should not stop  at  the

Constitutional convention that we have now, but, at  some  later

stage that these Principles should be enshrined in law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister and Dr Richard Hu clarified many of the

other  queries which I had.  Dr Hu has stated that by accounting

convention,  net  investment  income  is  regarded  as   current

reserves  and hence it is not described in the White  Paper.   I

was  initially going to argue that the President's staff  should

be  increased.   But the Prime Minister has clarified  yesterday

that  the President's Office should function much like the Prime

Minister's Office, which only has a few staff, and therefore the

President and his staff have the right to query public  servants

in   the   course   of  his  carrying  out  his   constitutional

responsibilities,  regardless  of  whether  it  is  safeguarding

reserves,  safeguarding key public appointments, in  conjunction

with  Internal  Security Act or corruption  investigations.   If

this  is  indeed the case, then I think that it is not necessary

to  increase the President's staff so long as they can  function

much like that of the Prime Minister's Office.  I therefore hope

that  future Presidents and their staff will not experience  any

more unpleasant encounters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I agree that a harmonious working

relationship between the President and the Government is in  the

best  interest  of the country.  It is therefore in  support  of

this  objective that the White Paper was published and  hence  I

believe  that  it  is a commendable move.  I fully  support  the

motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise in support of the motion in the name of Mr Shriniwas

Rai.  Although most of the issues have been clarified yesterday,

I  wish to emphasise a number of points and implications in  the

White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think the clarification yesterday has given a lot

of  Singaporeans a sense of clarity and a sense of comfort  over

some  of the issues that have disturbed some Singaporeans  prior

to  this.   And the other thing that is more important,  despite

the   very   uncomfortable  issues  that   were   presented   to

Singaporeans,  we did handle the issues without  really  hurting

the Presidency, the Government or the personalities involved.  I

think  that is a good thing that has happened out of it. I  wish

to  raise a number of points.  One is that I would like  to  see

the  White Paper as one of the more notable contributions of the

Elected Presidency.  Through his experience and clarifying  some

of  his problems, I think we are now better able to clarify many

of   the   technical  issues  related  to  the  Principles   for

determining  and  safeguarding our  accumulated  reserves.   And

therefore  there  is  a  good outcome out  of  all  these.   The

differences  on  this matter have brought about a  positive  and

concrete  outcome  in terms of the White Paper.   The  provision

therefore provides for a more effective channel of communication

to  deal  with  the  matter.  While the clarification  had  been

necessary, it was no doubt uncomfortable and I think  the  White

Paper  today  can serve as a better platform for future  Elected

Presidents and the Government to deal with many of the  problems

that can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>

be expected to evolve over time as we continue to strengthen the

institution of both the Government and the Presidency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as we now move towards instituting a new President,

the  White  Paper  can  also  serve  to  facilitate  the  smooth

transition  of  office for the next Elected  Presidency.   Every

Elected President by sheer qualification will be a man of strong

character  and can be expected to exercise his own judgement  on

the  power  that is bestowed on him.  However, being an  elected

process,  despite  the  stringent  qualification,  there  is  no

guarantee  that  the new President will abide and  keep  to  the

conventions  agreed  between  the Government  and  the  previous

President.   We have seen how, in my view, completely unsuitable

Singaporeans  made comical attempts to contest for  the  Elected

Presidency.  Perhaps I would like to suggest that we find a  way

to  get the new President to, amongst other things, as his first

duty,  confirm  his  desire  to  abide  by  the  terms  of   the

convention; or perhaps at some future date, consider translating

the White Paper into a stronger legislative process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I think we have had a very good outcome of

all  these discussions.  And I hope one day we can look back and

say  that  one  of  the more solid contributions  of  the  first

Elected  Presidency has been the White Paper which  I  am  quite

sure will in the long run strengthen not only the institution of

Elected Presidency but the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  swearing-in  ceremony  on   1st

September  1993,  President Ong Teng Cheong gave  the  assurance

that  he  would do his best to unite the people of Singapore  to

jointly  build  up  a  prosperous,  gracious  and  compassionate

society to make Singapore a wonderful country. He also vowed  to

carry out his duties fearlessly, selflessly and without bias  or

prejudice,  to protect the interest of the people of  Singapore,

to  reach  out  to fellow citizens from all walks  of  life,  to

understand  their aspirations, and at the same time  maintain  a

good working relationship with the Prime Minister, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>

Government,  so  as to create a rational system  of  checks  and

balances on the political system of Singapore, thereby enhancing

the political stability of Singapore and ensuring that Singapore

has a government of high standing that will continue to work for

the well-being of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past six years, President Ong encountered many

difficulties.  However, he lived up to the  expectation  of  the

people,  and earnestly practised what he advocated to  undertake

the  heavy responsibilities and accomplish the very high  target

that he had set for himself.  This has enabled Singaporeans from

all  stations  of  life to stay united amidst the  recent  Asian

financial  crisis  to  tide  over the  crisis  and  emerge  even

stronger to march into the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the working experience and knowledge accumulated

during his term of office, President Ong also collaborated  with

the  Government in formulating the principles to  safeguard  our

national  reserves  in the form of a White Paper  which  is  the

subject  matter of our debate today.  As the Prime Minister  has

said  yesterday, President Ong has proved that this "second key"

system   of   safeguarding  our  national   reserves   and   key

appointments in the civil service is indeed feasible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is even more commendable that President Ong has

impartially  and  selflessly  revealed  some  of  the   problems

encountered  by him in the execution of his duties, just  before

he steps down, to enable the people to openly discuss the issues

and  have a better understanding of the real object and  working

of  our  Elected President system.  As Senior Minister Lee  said

yesterday,  this debate is useful as part of the  education  for

our  people.  More importantly, this will enable the  Government

to  take stock of the views and reactions of the people on  this

system after it has been in operation for six years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong has announced his decision not to seek re-election. This is indeed a great pity. However, we should

respect his decision.  We must record our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>

affirmation and appreciation for the great contributions he  has

made  to the country and the people.  Therefore, I am very  glad

to  learn that the Government will be giving a farewell party to

President  Ong  on  30th  August to pay  tribute  to  the  great

contributions he has made to the country and the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, President Ong once said, "Having a

good  government is far better than having a good  President  to

check  on the bad government."  These sincere words and  earnest

wishes truly bring out President Ong's love for the country  and

the  people, and his noble sentiments.  As a matter of fact, the

people  of Singapore can be said to be extremely lucky  to  have

not  only  a  good  Government, but also a  good  President.   I

believe  it is the common prayer of all the people of  Singapore

that we continue to have a good Government and a good President.

However, from the long-term point of view, this is not something

to  be  taken  for granted.  Apart from the wise choice  of  the

voters,   we  must  also  endeavour  to  fine-tune  the  Elected

President system through extensive practice and exploration,  so

that  this system will give full play to its fullest effect when

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the business community

in  Singapore,  let  me  take  this  opportunity  to  offer  our

heartfelt congratulations to Mr Nathan who was returned  as  the

second  Elected  President  of the Republic  of  Singapore  this

afternoon.   I  firmly believe that he will be a  well-respected

and popular President, like President Ong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government instituted this office of an Elected

President,  its  intention  must  surely  be  that  the  Elected

President  would no longer be having just a ceremonial function.

The  President   has also the custodial power to  safeguard  our

national  reserves  and  maintain the  integrity  of  our  civil

service.   In  view of this, the responsibility of  the  Elected

President  is  indeed very heavy and important.   Such  a  heavy

responsibility will be put to test only when our nation faces  a

very  serious internal or external crisis, or a severe  economic

crisis which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>

requires  the  Government to draw on the reserves,  or  when  an

important  decision has to be made on some key  appointments  in

the  civil  service.   As such, we have to be prepared  for  the

worse,  and fine-tune our Elected President system based on  the

most  fundamental interest of our country so that  we  would  be

able to deal with any sudden crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the views expressed by the

media  and the public, it is apparent that our people  are  very

concerned  with  our  present Elected  President  system.   Some

people  would  like  to  know  how  the  Government  views   the

difficulties  encountered by President Ong in the  execution  of

his  duties, and whether the Government is determined to seek  a

long-tem solution to the problems, or to give the President more

resources  to  exercise  the  powers  vested  in  him   by   the

Constitution.  Is the Government happy with the way the election

for  the  first and the second Elected Presidents was conducted?

What  is  the people's reaction to the nomination of the  second

Elected   President?   If,  in  future,   candidates   for   the

presidential   elections  have  to  be  proposed  and   endorsed

continuously  by  the Government before they can  be  considered

eligible to stand or worthy of support, then will this  not  run

contrary  to  the  original intention of the  Elected  President

system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, based on the working experience

over  the past six years, President Ong and the Government  have

entered into a convention and formulated a set of principles  to

safeguard  the  national reserves and this is published  in  the

form of a White Paper for the people of Singapore to read.  This

is very encouraging.  However, because the Government originally

had no intention to move a motion in Parliament for the contents

of   the  White  Paper  to  be  debated,  it  has  caused   some

Singaporeans   to   be  skeptical  over  the   feasibility   and

sustainability  of  these principles.  The people  of  Singapore

want to know in the event of an Elected President having to face

a  strong  but  free-spending and persistent government  in  the

future, under the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>

mechanism, can this set of principles be solely relied  upon  to

stop the government from squandering away our reserves?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Prime Minister, the Senior Minister and the

Finance  Minister,  Dr  Richard Hu, had  already  given  a  very

detailed  explanation  on  the  problems  encountered   by   the

Government  and  President  Ong  during  the  past  six   years.

However, from the long-term point of view, it is apparent to  us

that  there are still a lot of  worrying and complicated  issues

which  need  to  be resolved.  In view of this,  I  support  the

motion standing in the name of Nominated MP Mr Rai to give  this

House the opportunity to further discuss the issues, and give  a

clear explanation to the people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I sincerely hope that through this

round  of  frank  and  sincere discussion, and  with  the  joint

efforts   and  mutual  cooperation  between  the  next   Elected

President  and  the  Government, our  unique  Elected  President

system  will make further progress, thereby laying a  solid  and

effective foundation for our political development, and for  the

long-term benefit of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, everything in this world is

continuously  changing  and  developing.   Our  unique   Elected

President system is no exception.  It is, after all, just a  six

year-old  little boy. It needs to be carefully looked after  and

nurtured  by  his  parents.   He  also  needs  regular   medical

examinations, takes the medicine and receives medical  treatment

whenever he is sick.  Only then, can he grow up to be strong and

healthy.  Therefore, I suggest that the Government should  reach

out to the people and collect feedback from the people on how to

perfect  this Elected President system, and make this  a  "World

Class Political Project".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if there is a need to amend the

Constitution again to perfect this system, the Government should

go ahead and do it without any hesitation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

the debate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>

on  this  motion takes place amidst the context of  considerable

controversy  and  the  incoming President.   There  are  factual

differences  between  what  President  Ong  said  in  his  press

conference and the Ministerial Statements given yesterday by the

Finance  Minister, Dr Richard Hu, and the Prime  Minister.   The

Opposition have been quite opportunistic in seizing the comments

by President Ong to their own advantage.  I myself find I cannot

comment  on  these  factual differences.  They  are  not  in  my

knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, in this sense, to avoid the question of

personalities.   At  most,  I think all  of  us  would  join  in

thanking  President  Ong for the service he  has  given  to  the

country  and to welcome the incoming President, Mr S  R  Nathan.

And  I  would like to place my thanks to President Ong alongside

the  thanks  of  many, many Singaporeans and my well  wishes  to

President-designate Mr S R Nathan among the well-wishers of many

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond this, I wish to focus on the Presidency as an

institution because Presidents come and go, but for the  present

and  future,  for our children, the principles set  out  in  the

White  Paper  before us and of the Constitution are  what  would

endure.   There  has  been great debate in various  media  about

whether  this Presidency we now have is executive, or custodial.

And  many other terms have been bandied about by me as  well  as

other  people.   We  know for a fact that the President  is  now

elected.   But  these other terms are not in  the  Constitution.

The  Constitution does not call it "executive", "custodial",  or

"largely   ceremonial".   None  of  these  is   there   in   the

Constitution.  These are words, analogies that different  people

have used differently to try to simplify for the public the very

complex issues and laws in the Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go through some of these quite briefly in this

House.   In classic constitutional theory, there is a separation

between  only  three  arms of the state  -  the  Executive,  the

Legislature  and the Judiciary.  In these three-fold  divisions,

the President is clearly part of the Executive.  He acts in this

classic model.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>

President,  while  being  the Head of  State  and  part  of  the

Executive,  does  not  hold powers or discretionary  initiative.

The  running of the Government is indeed with the Prime Minister

and  his  Cabinet once they have been appointed to  the  office.

The President or the monarch - in the case of England, it is the

Queen  - reigns but does not rule.  It is almost all ceremonial.

This  is what Singapore used to have before the creation of  the

present presidential system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we now have? As I said, in our Constitution, if

you  look  at  it  carefully,  there  is  no  use  of  the  word

"custodial", "ceremonial", or "executive".  On the  other  hand,

there is no term like "executive President".  The definition  of

the  words  "Elected President" is not even there.  It  is  just

simply  the  definition of the word "President",  which  is  the

person  elected  to  that office.  The main  provisions  of  the

President  are found in Part V of the Constitution and  this  is

the  same  Part, under the title of the "Government",  where  we

find the provisions of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.  None

of  these is to say therefore that the President is the Head  of

Government or the CEO.  I tend to agree with the Prime  Minister

in  this sense.  All things done by Government are done  in  the

name  of  the President, eg, in giving the Presidential Address.

But  it is clearly the agenda set by the Prime Minister and  his

Cabinet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Article 21(1) of the Constitution, it is clear that the

President  acts  on the advice of the Cabinet.  But,  here,  the

word  "advice"  is not simply a nice suggestion you  give  to  a

friend.   The  word  "advice" here is a  polite  way  of  saying

"instruction of the Cabinet".  How then is the present system of

the  President different from the old form?  The President today

differs  from  what we had before in that he  can  exercise  his

discretion and make up his own mind on a limited set of matters.

These  matters are set out in Article 21(2).  There are  various

shorthand ways of saying what these powers are.  Some people say

that  this  is the second key, custodial. Generally, people  say

the Elected President acts as a check on the use of reserves and

on key appointments. These short forms are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>

not sufficient to a full understanding of what the President can

or cannot rightfully do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NMP, Mr Shriniwas Rai, earlier mentioned - correct me

if  I  am  wrong - that the President can veto on  the  Internal

Security  Act  or  the Maintenance of Religious Harmony  orders.

Well,  he  has a role in it.  But look carefully,  and  I  quote

Article  22(I)  that the President can only  act  on  orders  on

religious  harmony  if  first,  the  Presidential  Council   for

Religious  Harmony  disagrees  with  the  Government.   If   the

Presidential  Council agrees with the Government, the  President

cannot veto.  This is what I mean that we are dealing with  very

complex  issues which in the end we must try to simplify  to  be

understood  by the people who elect the President.  These  short

forms  are not exact.  They never would be.  But we can, through

various  exercises such as this, try to educate our  people  and

ourselves in trying to understand these concepts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, when we say the President guards the reserves,

it  is  clearly not all the reserves.  Those not accumulated  by

the  present Government are protected. Those accumulated by  the

present  Government can be used at their discretion and are  not

subject  to the Elected President's veto.  More importantly,  it

must  be seen that the President does not exercise this function

absolutely  or  alone.  There is  a  role  for  the  Council  of

Presidential Advisers as well as other balancing institutions or

pillars  such as I have mentioned, the Presidential Council  for

Religious  Harmony.   In  exercising discretionary  powers,  the

President is not an absolute ruler.  He is independent but he is

neither  wilful nor singular.  The President can  disagree  with

the  Prime Minister but there is no guarantee that the President

will always prevail in case of such a disagreement.  The role of

the Council of Presidential Advisers is critical.  It is said so

in  Article  21(3) of the Constitution that the President  shall

consult the Council of Presidential Advisers, and he may  do  so

in other circumstances set out in Article 21(4).  If the Council

of Presidential Advisers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>

agrees  with  him, the President can carry the  issue.   If  the

Council  does  not  agree with the Elected President,  then  the

Prime Minister can override if two-thirds of Parliament supports

the  Prime Minister.  This is clearly seen in Article  22(2)  as

regards certain appointments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's Parliament, I would dare say that if the Prime

Minister  wants the two-thirds majority, he would get it.   That

is  the  standing  of the Prime Minister in today's  Parliament.

But this is not always vouchsafe for the future.  It is possible

that  the future Prime Minister would have a majority but not  a

two-thirds  majority.  And so we must see that  the  President's

powers  in  the Council of Presidential Advisers and  Parliament

sit  in a very intricate balance that may well change over  time

according to certain numbers.  The President, in that sense, can

win  in  some  circumstances but the point  today  is  that  the

President  can act, even without the concurrence of the  Council

of  Presidential  Advisers.   He may  act  but,  ultimately,  be

defeated.   But in acting, he would raise issues, an alarm  bell

would  have been raised and a controversy would have begun.   It

is  therefore a question of judgement and discretion on the part

of the President whether to act alone and risk defeat or whether

to  only  act when the Council of Presidential Advisers is  with

him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new and unique institution. The Prime Minister

and  Elected  President Ong had, in their own ways,  pointed  to

teething problems.  We have to accept this as part of the  price

for embarking on a bold constitutional adventure to create a new

system  of  Government.  The  White  Paper  is  therefore   very

important  in  this  context.  It seeks to  record  the  present

President's  agreement on ways to smooth  over  these  problems.

The  Member of Parliament, Dr Tan Cheng Bock in 1988 in a debate

in  this House on 12th August 1988 [Hansard, Vol. 53, Cols.  578

to  579] put it correctly on the issues that the White Paper now

touches on.  Let me quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I shall now touch on financial assets and reserves. The

definition of "assets" is indeed very wide and may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>

in  practice  mean  every cent and every  square  centimetre  of

Government land in Singapore.  Singaporeans want to know if this

means  that  every parcel of land sale must be approved  by  the

President.   Must  the sale of HDB properties have  his  assent?

Will  the sale of every HDB unit or every block or every defined

estate have his assent?  What about resale?."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore to thank President Ong for trying with

the  Prime  Minister to make some of these matters  clearer.   I

dare  say if we had somehow managed to do the White Paper before

President  Ong  came  to  office, half  the  controversies  that

President  Ong alluded in this press conference would have  been

avoided.   Of course, this could not have been done.   But  now,

having the White Paper, I think it helps the next President.  We

are trying to clarify and we will come to a position of clarity.

I think the White Paper also does a very good service in setting

out   some   ideas  about  the  Net  Investment  Income   (NII).

Commonsense  tells us that capital, the reserves and  return  on

capital are different.  Many businessmen will agree that NII can

be  used  by  the present Government.  The Finance Minister,  Dr

Richard Hu, says that this might be defined to protect some part

of  the  NII  in the next year.  Of course, this  can  be  done,

perhaps  to take care of inflation or rise in replacement  costs

of  certain assets.  But the essential principle is that the NII

is part of income, return on investment and not past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I think that there is a point to say that the

valuation  of  assets should be at the point of  transaction  of

sale  or  alienation rather than to try to sit down at  any  one

point  in time and take stock of everything in Singapore.   This

is  not easy to do and actually it is not much sense in doing it

because  the value of property changes according to use and  the

rules  you allow a property to be used for.  It is sensible  and

workable therefore in what the White Paper recommends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while the White Paper is a step forward, it is not the

only  thing we need to do.  We need to make the system  work  in

practice.  Yesterday in this House, the Prime Minister  told  us

that  there  is  no  need  for  parallel  government  under  the

President's office.  I agree.  People want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>

less  government and less red tape, not more. They do  not  want

another  bureau,  another  bureaucracy.   But  people  do   want

transparency and accountability and they do see the President as

an  important  additional element in ensuring  transparency  and

accountability, in addition to the direct accountability of  the

Prime Minister and his Cabinet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitutional duty of the civil service set out in

Article  22F  is to reply to the request of information  by  the

President.   This  should be reinforced in the  mindset  of  our

civil  servants in case it is ever forgotten.  It is not just  a

nice  thing you should do because the President is a  nice  guy.

It  is part of the burden of their office and the obligation  to

defend  the Constitution. I would venture to say that while  the

civil service must observe their constitutional duties and while

there  is no need for a parallel government, there may  be  some

need   for  additional  staff  and  resources  for  the  Elected

President.   Perhaps, this question should be left to  the  next

President to decide within a reasonable mandate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to the nature of this White Paper. This

White  Paper  is not binding on either this House  or  the  next

President.   This is despite the suggestion in paragraph  10  of

the  White  Paper  itself that it should be so unless  the  next

President  disagrees.  Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's  point  in

Parliament yesterday bears repeating.  What we say in this White

Paper  or in Parliament are not of the same effect as the  words

in  the  actual Constitution. Therefore, the White Paper  is  of

limited  use.   We  must understand this.  It  can  be  open  to

questions  by the next President or indeed it can be subject  to

judicial interpretation under Article 100 of the Constitution if

matters should be brought to the tribunal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the system work, another point must be that the

President  should be entrenched sometime in the next  term.   By

this, I mean that, as it stands presently, this House, under the

leadership of the Prime Minister or another leader, could  amend

the  Constitution and limit the powers of the President  without

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>

President's  approval.   Only  if  it  is  entrenched  can   the

President  be assured that his powers will not be nibbled  away.

I  think this matter is not a light matter because once  we  are

doing that, we are locking ourselves into such a position.   But

I  think it must be seriously looked at and considered over  the

next  term  of  the President and I am glad the  Prime  Minister

indicated  yesterday  that  he  would  look  seriously  at  this

question.  Only then can we have an assurance that the President

is  an institution that is strongly established and accepted  by

all.   This  White Paper and the other measures I have suggested

are  necessary to make it work.  But perhaps they themselves are

not  sufficient.  Institutions are necessary but  never  enough.

We  do  need a President with moral courage.  I can do no better

on this part than to quote from then Deputy Prime Minister's Goh

Chok  Tong's speech in this House on 5th October 1990  [Hansard,

Vol. 53, Col. 560].  He said,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are actually looking for people with competence. They

must  be  competent people before they can stand  for  election.

Secondly,  they  must be trustworthy. Thirdly,  they  must  have

sound judgement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must have the moral courage because the President may

come  from  the  same  party as the Prime Minister.  But  if  he

disagrees  with  the Prime Minister on the use of  reserves  for

wasteful  welfare  programmes, then the Elected  President  must

have the moral courage to tell the Prime Minister that he is not

going to spend the reserves."

<br><br>We  do  need men of such moral courage to fill that office.   We

also  need a Prime Minister who is committed to making this very

new  and unique system work, as Prime Minister Goh has said that

he is committed to doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elected President is supposed to check if we ever had,

God forbid, a so-called bad government or rogue government.   Of

course,  it  need  not  be  a  rogue government.  There  can  be

reasonable disagreements between reasonable people.   But  while

we  are  planning  for  a  scenario of  a  rogue  government  or

disagreement, it is ironic that to make the presidency  work  in

the  first  place,  it  must be put into  operation  by  a  good

government and by a good President. Only when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>

both  these two important officers are concerned with the future

of  Singapore and the future of institutions will this  new  and

unique  system be strongly embedded in the hearts and  minds  of

Singaporeans and the way our system works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I will support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, first let me thank Mr Rai for  moving  the

motion  for  the House to endorse the principles for determining

and  safeguarding the accumulated reserves of the Government and

the Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies  as

set  out  in  the White Paper and also to the other Members  for

speaking in support of the principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this motion has taken the debate in several

directions.  I have no wish to clarify or explain all the issues

that  have  been raised.  Many of the issues have been addressed

yesterday.  I just want to make a few key points after listening

to the debate so far.  First, because of the perceptions and the

confusion   through  the  use  of  the  terms  like   "executive

President", etc, the Government decided to clarify the  role  of

the Elected President and his specific roles in the two areas  - protection  of past reserves and key civil service appointments.

This clarification, in my mind, is not intended to diminish  the

role  of the Elected President.  It is because of this confusion

that we thought it necessary to re-establish or to re-visit  the

objectives in setting up the elected President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Simon Tay has gone through at great length the

role  of  the  President.  So I have  no wish to go through  the

same  ground.   But  just  to  highlight  to  Members  that   by

introducing  the elected President, we have made  a  very  major

change in the way future governments will run Singapore, whether

future governments come from the PAP or come from the Opposition

parties.   And  this change is that all future governments  will

find  that they have to run the government on a balanced budget,

because at every stage of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>

term  of  office,  they can only make use of  current  reserves.

Without  the  elected President mechanism, the government  could

use  past  reserves without it being clearly made known  to  the

public.   But  with  this mechanism now  in  place,  future  PAP

governments or future  Opposition party government, if there  is

one,  will find it incumbent to run the government on a balanced

budget.   Any time any government wants to use the old reserves,

they  have to seek the President's agreement to unlock the  past

reserves.   So this is a fairly significant change  to  the  way

future governments should be run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a lot of talk about the need for good

and  honest  government.  I endorse that entirely.  But  Members

may  not  realise that, in fact, the elected President mechanism

is  also  important even if there is good and honest government.

You  do not need a bad and dishonest government to dig into  old

reserves.   This  elected  President  mechanism  is  not   about

corruption.   It  is about using past reserves.   So  it  is  to

protect  ourselves  against a government  that  is  honest,  not

corrupt at all, but wants to spend old reserves for well-meaning

and  even  well-supported policies.  With the elected  President

mechanism  in  place, if such a government  wants  to  spend  on

programmes,  however well-meaning, honest or  well-supported,  a

red  flag will be flashed.  The President will have to come into

play.   The President has to agree that such a programme  is  in

the  interest  of  Singapore.  And as the  Senior  Minister  has

explained,  this is a hurdle so that Singaporeans  are  alerted.

Because we  are a small country with limited resources, we  have

decided to set aside past reserves.  And if we are now going  to

spend  on  programmes using the past reserves,  let  that  be  a

transparent fact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the elected President is not just to guard

against  dishonest government.  In fact, it is equally effective

against a good, well-meaning but profligate government.   So  we

do  not need to have a rogue or a bad government for the elected

President to be effective.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the main benefit of these two days' discussion is

the  ability for us to clarify the role of the elected President

and to better understand how this new mechanism that we have put

in  place  would change the nature of future Budgets and  future

governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Government put the principles in a White Paper?

As  explained in the White Paper, the objective of  the  elected

President  is  clear.  How to operationalise it is  a  lot  more

complicated, because it is a complex issue.  We have  to  define

many terms.  We need to come to a common understanding, a common

agreement  on  what these terms are and how to  interpret  them.

Therefore,  the  White  Paper  is important  to  set  out  these

definitions  and  to spell out the working arrangements  between

the  President  and  the Government, so that  both  parties  can

fulfil their respective roles effectively and smoothly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J B Jeyaretnam asked why not put out this White Paper at

the  beginning of Mr Ong's term and not at the end of his  term.

As  explained  in  the  White Paper, many  of  these  principles

require  time for them to be operationalised, to be  documented,

formalised and then institutionalised into the White Paper.   We

would  have liked to do it earlier, but it is in the  nature  of

such complex issues that we can only complete it towards the end

of  the  term.  And for this, I think we have to thank President

Ong for setting the pace and wanting to make sure that the White

Paper is completed before the end of his term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper is a statement of how we would proceed with

the  administrative actions to implement the  objective  of  the

elected  President.  So it is not an agreement between President

Ong and the Government, as Mr J B Jeyaretnam tried to argue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members asked about the role of the civil servants.

I  can  only  reiterate what the Prime Minister said  yesterday.

The  civil  servants have a constitutional role to  support  and

advise  the President in his role in the two areas that  we  are

concerned about.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low, Mr Chiam and Mr J B Jeyaretnam talked about

clipping  the wings of the Government.  In the context  which  I

explained  just  now, the institution of the  elected  President

would  mean  that all future governments, whether PAP government

or  an  Opposition  party government, would have  to  operate  a

balanced budget.  If they operate anything other than a balanced

budget,  they  have to go to the President to  unlock  the  past

reserves.  And if that is not clipping the wings, I do not  know

what  is.  It is a very major restraint on the way we run future

Budgets and the way we run future governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members asked about giving the President more

resources.   Again, the Prime Minister has explained,  that  the

President  can  call  upon the entire  resources  of  the  civil

service  in executing and implementing his role.  He is assisted

by  his Principal Private Secretary (PPS) who is a civil servant

in  the Administrative Service of Deputy Secretary Grade.  So he

is  a  very senior Administrative Officer and can call upon  the

entire  resources of the civil service.  It is the same way  the

Prime Minister operates through his PPS, the same way the Senior

Minister  operates through his PPS as well as the  Deputy  Prime

Ministers operate through their PPSs.  So we do not see the need

for  additional staff for the President for him to implement his

role effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to how the White Paper would bind future

Presidents  and future governments.  As indicated in  the  White

Paper, these are principles which both the President, his  staff

and the Government had worked together to establish, and we find

it  effective  and  we  intend to make this  binding  on  future

Presidents  and future Governments.  At the same time,  we  know

that  these  principles cannot be cast in  stone  and  therefore

there  must be a mechanism by which either party can be  allowed

not  to  follow  the  principles if they  think  these  are  not

applicable.   But  there  is tremendous moral  pressure  in  the

example  that  Dr Lee Tsao Yuan raised.  If indeed a  government

does not want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>

return the money from a sale of land, using the argument that it

will  return the money at market value at the start of the  term

and  not  at  the time of the sale, I think that is  clearly  in

violation  of  the preservation of the past reserves.   And  the

President   will  be  well  within  his  power  to   veto   that

transaction,  because  that would  mean  a  draw  down  on  past

reserves.  So I think both the principles as well as the  intent

and spirit of the Constitution are quite clear.   That would  be

deemed as a draw down on past reserves, and the President  would

indeed either veto the transaction or gazette and make it  known

that the Government has  drawn down past reserves, in which case

the  Government would be forced to replenish the  past  reserves

from its current reserves.  So there is no ambiguity in that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just conclude by saying that we have worked hard to

establish the principles between the President's Office and  the

Government.   We  believe  that  the  principles  set  out  very

effectively the common understanding of how we will  proceed  to

implement  the  safeguarding of the  past  reserves.   It  is  a

complex issue and we are glad that we are able to complete  this

White Paper on time.  The White Paper can indeed be said to be a

legacy  of  President Ong and this White Paper will help  future

Presidents in performing their constitutional functions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, can I have a clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> What is your clarification?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> The Minister said that the principles in

the  White Paper are binding and that if a future government  so

decides  to  define fair market value as not  at  the  point  of

transaction  but at the time it took over office, then  that  is

clearly in violation of the definition of past reserves.  But as

far  as  I remember in the White Paper, there is a provision  to

say  that so long as either party does not wish to agree to  the

principles  of the White Paper, they can notify the other  party

in  writing and therefore the principles of the White Paper  are

not binding on that particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>

government.  Could I please ask for clarification of this point?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the principles will be binding for

future Presidents and future governments.  And there is, as  the

Member  has  described it, an escape clause, that if either  the

President  or  future government does not  want  to  follow  the

principles,  they  are  allowed to say  that  it  is  no  longer

binding.   But  that does not deviate from the  requirement  and

the  spirit  of  the  Constitution, which is protection  of  our

financial assets and protection of our land and buildings, which

are  deemed  as  past reserves.  State land is  deemed  as  past

reserves,  and  if  you sell State land at  anything  less  than

market  value,  you are running down on past reserves,  and  the

elected President will veto that transaction.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Another clarification, please. As far

as  I  understand  from the White Paper, and I could be  obtuse,

supposing  you  have  a  future  government  that  informs   the

President  of  the day that it disagrees with the definition  of

the value of State land, in other words, the value of State land

at  fair  market value at the point of transaction,  then  those

principles  no longer apply.  So it is not a question  of  using

past reserves.  Here, it is a question of the definition of  the

value  of State land, which is very clearly stated in the  White

Paper.   Therefore,  unless  those principles  are  indeed  made

binding, then future governments can have the leeway to say that

they  do  not  agree with the valuation of State  land  at  fair

market  value.  This is my understanding of the White Paper.   I

could be wrong.  If I am wrong, please clarify.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the Member's understanding of the

binding  agreement is correct.  But whatever principles you  may

not  agree  with in the White Paper, the fact remains  that  the

Constitution  says  that the President protects  past  reserves.

And  what  constitutes past reserves?  They  are  net  financial

assets  and  State  land and buildings.  And if  the  Government

says, "No, that past reserve is defined as the value at the time

of the change over of government," and the President says,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>

"No,  it  must  be at the point of transaction.", the  President

will  say,  "This  is  my  view  supported  by  the  Council  of

Presidential  Advisers.  I  will veto it."  The Government  will

have  to  either  challenge it, if it can.   It  will  be  under

scrutiny by the public.  In that very simple example, the public

will  quite clearly be on the side of the President to say, "You

sell a piece of state land, it must be at the market value at at

the  point  of sale."  I do not think there is any confusion  to

the public who is right in that scenario that she painted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Rai, can you reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I have got two clarifications for the

Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Why not you put them all in your reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> All right. I know Members are eager to

end  this  debate soon and I will do so.  I would not take  much

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am grateful to the many Members who spoke, ie, those

who  have  supported the motion and even those who have  opposed

the motion, because they have added to this debate.  There is no

doubt, as my good friend, Mr Tay Beng Chuan said, that President

Ong  has  endeared and has done the Constitution and the country

proud  by  the  way he has discharged his duties.   The  Elected

President  is still in its infancy.  It will take some  time  to

shape.  The Minister has been very assuring and I have no  doubt

that the Government intends to abide by the principles laid down

in the Constitution and the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two clarifications for the Minister. (1) Should the

in-coming President ask for a staff, I hope the Government  will

consider  it favourably.  (2) Should there be a dispute  between

the   President  and  the  Government,  would  it  go   to   the

Constitutional Court for a decision?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new President has won the admiration of my

colleagues, Dr Lee, Mr Tay Beng Chuan and others, and I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>

Members  will  join  me in wishing him well.   He  has  a  heavy

responsibility in discharging his duties, but I  have  no  doubt

that  his  vast experience and the mandate he has received  from

the public will enable him to discharge his duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he is an intellectual, he is a man of the ground.

He has friends from all walks of life.  I was surprised when his

fruit seller came to the People's Association this afternoon  to

wish him.  He was delighted and talked to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give another example of the humility of the man.

After  he  was returned unopposed at the Nomination  Centre,  he

went around thanking people.  An NTUC official came and told  me

that  he  has  moved away without meeting one  sector,  ie,  the

Indian  activity  group from the PA.  When I whispered  this  to

him, he said, "Yes, I am sorry, let us go."  That is the quality

of  the  man.  He has finished his tour but he felt that he  has

left out one group and he must meet them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask Members to endorse the motion

wholeheartedly.   I  would also ask the  Opposition  Members  to

endorse the motion, even though they have filed an amendment  to

the  motion and spoke in favour of it.  This is not a  political

issue.  It concerns the future of the country.  It concerns  how

we  are  going  to rule.  The Government has introduced  a  very

unique



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>

constitutional mechanism which has no parallel anywhere  in  the

world.   I think we owe it to ourselves to evolve the system  by

assisting.   When  the  Prime  Minister,  Senior  Minister   and

Minister  for  Finance spoke yesterday, I was  relieved  by  the

picture that they have painted because there were some doubts in

the  minds of some members of the public.  This morning I had  a

chance to speak to some people and they were relieved that  they

have  now been presented with the facts of the issue.   Whenever

there   is  any  difference  between  the  Government  and   the

President, it is only fair that the public should know  it.   In

this way, we can talk and debate on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge Members to vote for the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House endorses the Principles for Determining and

Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and  the

Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies as  set

out in the White Paper (Paper Cmd. 5 of 1999).
