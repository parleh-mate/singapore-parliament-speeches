<div align="center"><b>WATER SUPPLY IN JURONG</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Salt content)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and Communications if he will  ascertain  from

the  Public Utilities Board whether the Board is aware that

the  potable  water  supplied to Jurong  residents  has  an

excessive  salt content and whether the Board will  subject

the   potable  water  to  a  desalination  process   before

supplying it to Jurong residents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Utilities

Board  is  aware that potable water supplied  to  the  non-industrial  area  of Jurong has a higher chloride  or  salt

content  than the Board's other supplies. This water  comes

from  the  Pandan Reservoir which was completed in February

1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water stored in the Pandan Reservoir flows through an

industrialised and populated area and is therefore  subject

to  pollution.  To  make it safe for  human  use,  it  goes

through a more sophisticated and costly process at the  new

water  treatment works at Choa Chu Kang which was completed

in October 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Organisation Drinking Water Standards

allow  for  a  maximum chloride content of  600  parts  per

million and a Total Dissolved Solids content of 1.500 parts

per  million. Our record at the Water Treatment Works shows

that   the  chloride  content  of  water  from  the  Pandan

Reservoir



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



treated  at the Choa Chu Kang Water Treatment Works  has  a

chloride content of not more than 200 parts per million and

a Total Dissolved Solids content of not more than 400 parts

per million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water supplied from the Choa Chu Kang Water Treatment

Works  is well within the WHO Drinking Water Standards  and

is  perfectly  safe for potable use. The  Public  Utilities

Board  therefore  does not envisage the installation  of  a

desalination  plant to further process  this  water  before

supplying it to the residents.

Development  and Communications when work will commence  on

the Sembawang Seaside Park; what will be the total area  of

the Park; and what facilities will be provided in the Park



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the area of the

proposed   Sembawang  Park  will  be  about  16   hectares;

consisting  of 6 hectares of foreshore and 10  hectares  of

mangrove  area  to be reclaimed. The Park  will  contain  a

large  scenic  pond,  shelters, tea  kiosks,  a  children's

playground  and  picnic areas. Plans  for  the  reclamation

Minister of State consider building a running track  around

this Park so that our youths can use it for exercise?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, actually the Hon. Member has made

this   request  to  the  Parks  and  Recreation  Department

previously.  However, it will be considered and,  if  found

appropriate, a track could be incorporated.

<div align="center"><b>(Repairs)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and Communications when the repairs  to  Jalan

Ulu  Sembawang 3 km, and the track off Andrews Avenue  will

start and what is the estimated cost of the works.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

making  up  of Jalan Ulu Sembawang from Hua Mien School  to

the  3rd  km. Jalan Ulu Sembawang community centre will  be

tendered  out  today. 3rd September, 1976, and  work  will

commence in October 1976. The estimated cost of the work is

$29,055.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The track off Andrews Avenue is on private land and it is

necessary to obtain the owner's consent to enter  into  the

land  to  make  the track. As soon as the  owner's  written

consent is obtained, the proposal will be submitted to  the

Urban  and  Rural  Services  Committee  for  approval.  The

estimated cost of the work is about $29,220.

<div align="center"><b>PURCHASE OF HOUSING BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Raising of income ceiling)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and Communications if he will consider  raising

the ceiling of total family income of $1,500 per month,  in

proportion to the four National Wages Council wage increase

recommendations, for applicants who are financially  unable

to purchase Housing and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



Urban  Development Company flats and who wish  to  purchase

Housing and Development Board flats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

records  of  sale,  of  flats  of  the  Housing  and  Urban

Development Company (HUDC) show that:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 329 or 18.76% of the purchasers have a family income

of less than $1,500 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 515 or 29.36% of the purchasers have a family income

of between $1,501 to $2,000 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 910 or 51.88% of the purchasers have a family income

above $2,000 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These records show that it is unnecessary for the Housing

and  Development  Board to raise the  total  family  income

ceiling  of  $1,500 per month, as the higher income  groups

can apply for HUDC flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present position is fair and workable between HDB and

HUDC.  However, the situation will be watched and if  there

are  cases  of  inability to buy HUDC flats,  consideration

will  be  given to changing the total family income ceiling

for the purchase of HDB flats.

<div align="center"><b>(Improvements to roofs)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and Communications if he will  ascertain  from

the  Housing  and Development Board (a) whether  the  Board

proposes  to  carry out Improvements to the  roofs  of  the

former  SIT  flats  in the Tiong Bahru  Pre-War  Estate  to

reduce  excessive heat; or (b) alternatively,  whether  the

Board  will grant permission to those lessees who  wish  to

carry out the improvements themselves.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

former  Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) pre-war flats  in

Tiong Bahru were sold



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



without  restrictions and owners are free to rent  or  sell

their  flats  at  a  profit  to  anyone.  The  Housing  and

Development  Board  is  only acting  as  agent  to  provide

services and conservancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is prepared to install secondary roofs to these

flats  to reduce excessive heat, provided the owners  agree

to  bear  the cost. A survey will be conducted to ascertain

from  the  owners  of the top-most flats whether  they  are

willing to bear the cost in proportion to the size of their

flats.  The  owners  will be allowed to  pay  the  cost  in

instalments  over  a period of, say, three  years.  If  the

majority are not prepared to pay for the improvements,  the

Board  will permit those owners who wish to carry  out  the

improvements  to  do  so individually. However,  they  must

first  submit their plans to the Board for approval  before

carrying Out the work in accordance with the directions  of

the HDB engineers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and Communications if he will  ascertain  from

the  Telecommunication Authority of Singapore what has been

the  expenditure per month for the printing, postage, etc.

of the monthly note-books/diaries sent out by the Authority

and  if the Authority will consider discontinuing the issue

of  such  notebooks/diaries if they do not serve  a  useful

purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Telecoms monthly

calendars  are  sent  to  65.000 of its  250.000  telephone

subscribers, as well as Members of Parliament, members  of

Citizens Consultative Committees, Permanent Secretaries  of

Ministries,  heads of Government departments and  statutory

boards.  The  total  monthly  cost  is  less  than  $14,000

including postage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a large public authority providing an important

service, the TAS considers it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



desirable that the people it serves should be kept informed

of  its varied activities. The Telecoms monthly calendar is

only  one  of  the  ways through which  this  objective  is

carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project was implemented in April 1976 and twelve

issues  of  the calendar will have been sent out  by  March

next  year. Its objective is to communicate information  on

Telecoms to its recipients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, Telecoms has received several letters from

subscribers  complimenting the approach and the  attractive

presentation  of  the  calendars.  There  were  others  who

offered  constructive suggestions on how to  encourage  the

use of these calendars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecoms will continue to monitor the usefulness of such

calendars. It is too early to decide now that they  do  not

serve a useful purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of

State said that it is too early to decide. May I know  when

he can decide?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, as I mentioned earlier, the TAS

is  still  monitoring the usefulness of these calendars.  I

cannot  tell  him  exactly  when.  Of  course,  if  it   is

eventually  decided that these calendars do not  serve  any

useful purpose, they will be discontinued.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for National

airport taxi service is far from adequate and what steps he

proposes to take to improve the service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

Ministry is aware of the inadequacy of the taxi service  at

the  Paya Lebar Airport, especially during the peak period,

between  6.30  pm  and 10.00 pm. As a  first  step  towards

improving the airport taxi service,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



NTUC-Comfort  was  allowed to take over the  management  of

this  service on 1st May, 1976. The availability and quality

of  the  airport taxi service are being constantly reviewed

by  the  Department  of  Civil Aviation, the  Registry  of

Vehicles and NTUC-Comfort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a recruitment exercise was carried out to

increase the number of taxi drivers allowed to ply  at  the

Airport.  As  a result, the number of airport taxi  drivers

has  been  increased  from 507 to  737.  Selection  of  the

airport  taxi  drivers was based on  factors  such  as  the

applicant's record as a taxi driver and his proficiency  in

spoken  English and local dialects in order to ensure  that

the  grade  of the airport taxi service is of an acceptable

level, and to minimise the possibility of malpractice among

taxi drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveillance on the adequacy of the airport taxi service

will  continue and measures to upgrade the level of service

will be taken as and when necessary. If the recent increase

in  the  number of taxi drivers is found to be insufficient

to  meet  the  demand, then a further recruitment  exercise

will be held. In addition to increasing the number of taxis

allowed  to  ply  at the Airport, the Department  of  Civil

Aviation,  together  with  the Registry  of  Vehicles,  are

looking  into  the  expansion of the existing  shuttle  bus

service  between the Airport and hotels to  supplement  the

taxi service.

the  pro-communist activities of Hussein Jahidin and of the

probable  involvement  of Samad Ismail.  In  June  1976  we

informed the Malaysians of the results of the interrogation

of  Hussein  Jahidin and Azmi Mahmud. I cannot say  whether

the  Malaysian action was brought forward by the admissions

of  Hussein  Jahidin and Azmi Mahmud during  interrogation.

What  I can say is that, on common security problems, there

is   close   cooperation  between  the  Singapore  Internal

Security Department and the Malaysian Special Branch.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs and Education (a) whether it is proposed to acquire

new  and  modern scientific equipment to better  equip  the

Police  to  combat  criminals who use  new  techniques  and

equipment;  and (bi what new equipment are being  purchased

during the current financial year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Hon. Member for Anson had

asked  similar questions during the Budget Debate in  March

this  year. I had then informed the House that there was  a

Committee  comprising senior officers to constantly  review

police equipment and keep them updated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee has recently completed a review and has

recommended the purchase of a range of police equipment  at

a  cost  of  $770,000 to enhance the effectiveness  of  the

Police Force in combating crime for the present as well  as

for the future. The proposal is now under consideration  in

the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the equipment proposed to be purchased are

communication  equipment for the Marine Police  and  Police

Reserve  Units, improved-quality gas masks and  head-gear,

walkie-talkies  for  the commanders of the  Police  Reserve

Unit  troops and new anti-riot gas equipment. Every regular

police officer is also being equipped with better and  more

effective  handguns, after having  undergone  training  in

"combat style" shooting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had also earlier reported that a Scene of Crime Unit

was   established   in   1975  to   undertake   specialised

investigation  at the scenes of serious crimes.  This  Unit

will    apply   forensic   science   for   more   effective

investigation  and detection of criminals.  A  proposal  to

purchase scientific equipment, including a van equipped for

collection and analysis of evidence at the scene of  crime,

is  now under consideration in the Ministry of Finance. The

estimated cost of the equipment and the van is $70,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Force is also looking into the feasibility of

using  computers  at  the Computer Service  Department  for

police  work to detect and combat crime on a 24-hour basis.

The new computer recently installed at the Computer Service

Department  is  capable of providing on-line retrieval  and

real-time processing. Initially, the Police Emergency (999)

calls,  criminal  records  and  crime  statistics  will  be

computerised  on  real-time basis if the feasibility  study

undertaken  jointly by the Police and the Computer  Service

Department finds the cost justifies it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, when will the new

equipment be ready?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> As I have stated, the proposals are

now under consideration by the Ministry of Finance, and  as

soon as approval is given they will be purchased.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, when will the new equipment be

ready for use? I want to know the date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It involves two Ministries, and

therefore I am not in a position at the moment to give  him

a  date. But I can say this: as soon as the proposals  have

been agreed upon.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  and  Education (a) how many Government  and  Aided

English  schools offer Tamil as a second language; (b)  how

many  children have registered to take Tamil  as  a  second

language  in  the  recent registration for  admission  into

Primary One classes; and (c) whether some schools, in which

Tamil  was  supposed  to be taught as  a  second  language,

rejected  or  discouraged parents  from  registering  their

children  in  those schools if they opted for  Tamil  as  a

second language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Education):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the number of Government and Government Aided

English  Schools which offer Tamil as a second language  is

69  (53  in Primary and 16 in Secondary). During the recent

Primary  I  Registration  Exercise, however,  another   33

schools  were asked to register children who wish to  offer

Tamil as their second language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Primary I Registration Exercise ended on 28th

August  1976, and  relevant  statistics  are  still  being

processed.  I  shall keep you informed when the  figure  is

available. For your information, figures for 1974 and  1975

registrations were 1.542 and 1,563 respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of the second language for their children

rests  entirely with the parents concerned.  No  designated

school for the teaching of Tamil language has ever rejected

or  discouraged parents from registering their children  on

the  grounds that they would like their children  to  offer

Tamil as a second language.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of State for

Education mentioned that another 33 schools had been  asked

to  register  children  who wish to offer  Tamil  as  their

second language. But recently in New Town School when  some

parents  wanted  to register their children, who  wish  to

offer  Tamil as a second language, there were no vacancies.

They  live near that school but they cannot get a  seat  in

that  school. So they went to other schools but there  were

also no vacancies. Which school can they go to?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of these schools which the parents went to, they

were  told,  "If  you are willing to offer  another  second

language,  then  we  can  accept your  children  here."  My

grandchild  went to Anglo-Chinese School and offered  Tamil

as  a  second language, but the school said no. They  said.

"If you want to offer Chinese as a second language, then we

will  accept."  Where is the encouragement of  Tamil  as  a

second  language?  Many children look forward  to  studying

Tamil  as  a second language but there are no vacancies  in

such schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the Ministry of Education appoints a

Commission of Inquiry into this matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, what is your supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I propose that the Ministry

appoints a Commission of Inquiry, and then everything  will

be  put  right.  I want every Government and aided  English

school  to  offer Tamil as a second language.  That  is  my

proposal to the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, obviously it is not possible for

every school to offer Tamil as a second language. From  the

figures  I  gave,  in 1974 there were only  1.542  students

registered for Tamil as a second language and in 1975 there

were only 1.563.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have more than 350 primary schools and we cannot run a

class  for  two  or  three  students.  This  year  we  have

announced in the newspapers the designated schools. Here is

a  question of money. If we have the money, then perhaps we

can  fulfil  the  wish of the Member for Anson,  but  I  am

afraid I have to disappoint him. It is not possible  to  do

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, will the Senior Minister of

State  for Education agree to encourage the study of  Tamil

as  a  second language or not? I want to know that.  If  he

agrees,  he must try to find ways and means of implementing

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, the study of a second language is

encouraged,  irrespective of whether it  is  Tamil  or  any

other  language. But we have to look into the rationale  of

its  cost and practicability. If we can do it, then we will

do  it  in  designated schools. For example, if we  have  a

sufficient number of students in a particular school  -  by

sufficient,  I do not expect the number to be  40, but  it

must be reasonable enough to form a small class - then  the

particular language can be taught.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I agree with the Senior Minister of

State.  However, if the school does not want  to  register

Tamil  as  a second language, how can you get the  required

number?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, I will appreciate it if the

Member  for  Anson  can let me know the  particular  school

where this is going on, so that I can look into it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I have already mentioned it. My

grandchild  went  to the Anglo-Chinese School  and  offered

Tamil as a second language. But there was no vacancy and he

had to take Chinese as a second language.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, is the Senior

Minister  of State aware that even designated schools  have

refused  to  register  or  have  discouraged  parents  from

registering  their children who wish to offer  Tamil  as  a

second language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> If the Member can give me the name of

the school, then I will look into that.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Can the Senior Minister of State

assure  the  House that if names are given,  proper  action

will  be  taken  to discipline those found responsible  for

discouraging  the  parents to register their  children  who

wish to offer Tamil as a second language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, if the allegations can be

substantiated, I can assure the Member that action will  be

taken.

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he

will  ascertain  from the Jurong Town Corporation  (i)  the

breakdown  cost;  (ii) the selling price; (iii)  the  floor

area;  and  (iv) the total number of flats  built  and  the

occupancy  rate,  in  respect  of  (a)  an  executive  flat

(luxurious type); and (b) a low-cost 5-room flat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Sir, I

understand  from  the  Jurong  Town  Corporation  that  the

selling  price for the JTC executive flat (luxurious  type)

is  set to cover all costs, whether for construction,  land

and  financing,  architectural  and  engineering  fees   or

administration. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



think  it appropriate that for a luxury type flat where  no

subsidy  from public funds is involved, the JTC  should  be

required to reveal what private sector developers  are  not

expected to do, namely, how the selling price can be broken

down  into  its respective costs. The selling price  ranges

from $77,000 to $82,800 per flat depending on the floor and

orientation. Each flat has a total area of 178.4 sq metres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two blocks comprising a total of 1 36 flats have been

completed, of which 97 flats have already been sold and  10

rented  out  mainly  to industrialists in  Jurong  Town.  A

further  eight  units  are awaiting  acceptance  by  recent

applicants,  leaving  a  balance of  22  flats  yet  to  be

allocated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of the Member's question,

I  understand that the total cost of a low-cost 5-room flat

at  Boon  Lay Garden is $35,100 of which construction  cost

accounts  for $29,900, land and financing costs $3,400  and

architectural  and  engineering  fees.  $1,800   and   some

contribution to administrative costs. The flats  are  being

sold at $35,000 each. Each flat has a floor area of 11  8.7

sq metres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six blocks of 360 units were balloted in February this

year. Because of a number of rejections, 25 units are still

to  be allocated. Another three blocks consisting of  1  80

units  will  be balloted this month, amongst 128 applicants

now on the waiting list.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would like to ask the Minister whether Jurong Town should

be  called a new town or semi-urban? If it is classified as

semi-urban or new town, should not the selling price of the

5-room flats be lower?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, as far as Jurong Town is concerned,

the  classification that may be applied to  low-cost  flats

elsewhere is not relevant. It is not a new town, nor is  it

suburban  or  semi-urban. It is an industrial new  town.  I

think  the  policies  of the Jurong  Town  Corporation  are

entirely   a  matter  for  the  Corporation  and   do   not

necessarily relate to other flats elsewhere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in its other low-cost

housing  schemes, the Jurong Town Corporation  follows  the

construction adopted by the Housing and Development  Board.

I have the HDB's Annual Report with me here. An HDB flat in

a new town costs $30,000. The Minister has pointed out that

Jurong Town is an industrial new town. So the selling price

of the JTC low-cost 5-room flat should not be that high.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I have tried to explain that the

Jurong Town Corporation is organised on different lines and

that  the  flats are also allocated in a different  manner.

There  is no queueing up as there is in the Housing  Board.

If   there  is  any  adoption  of  HDB  practices  or   its

architectural  designs  or any other  matters  relating  to

housing  it is a matter for the Jurong Town Corporation  to

decide  whether they want to adopt these. But they are  not

required  to  do  so nor are they required  to  follow  the

prices  which the Housing Board has fixed for their  flats.

In  this  particular case I have already given the cost  of

the  5-room  low-cost flats as being slightly over  $35,000

and  there  is  no  question - in  fact,  as  Minister  for

Finance.  I would be strongly against it - of their  trying

to sell a $35,000 house for $30,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, according to the

Annual Report of the Housing Board for 1975/76, the selling

price  of a low-cost 5-room flat does not include the  cost

of land and architectural and engineering fees. The cost of

each unit is $21,149 and it is sold for $30,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the cost of the JTC flats

includes the costs of land, construction, and architectural

and  engineering fees, and that is why the price is higher.

Would the Minister then consider removing the cost of land,

construction and architectural and engineering fees, so  as

to bring the selling price down?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the answer is no. I have mentioned

that  the  Jurong Town Corporation is organised on strictly

different lines. It is not a housing corporation.  It  does

not  have a waiting list of people who are prepared to wait

two years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is true that the Housing Board does not

recover,  on  the whole, its land and other costs.  In  the

end,  apart  from  the subsidies which the  Government  has

given,  they  are  supposed to recover  all  the  land  and

financing costs as well as the administrative costs.

<div align="center"><b>CULTURAL SHOWS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Criteria for tax exemption)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Finance

what are the criteria for tax exemption for cultural shows;

arid  what  yardstick is applied to distinguish  charitable

shows from private shows.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, where cultural shows are organised

by  a charity or an "institution of a public character"  or

any  other  non-profit making organisation  and  where  the

proceeds    are   used   for   charitable, philanthropic,

educational  or sporting purposes, entertainments  duty  is

not  charged. An essential condition is that performers  do

not  receive payment for their services. Details are  given

in  section  12 of the Entertainments Duty Act  (Chapter  1

36).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural shows organised by other establishments may also

qualify for entertainments duty exemption provided that the

funds are used for the same purposes and an endorsement  is

received from the benefiting organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By private shows, I assume the Member is referring to

performances  by  profit  making  organisations  where  the

proceeds   are  not  used  for  charitable, philanthropic,

educational  or  sporting  purposes.  Entertainments   duty

exemption  is discretionary but will generally  be  granted

where  the performance has intrinsic cultural value. It  is

difficult to spell out precisely what shows are of cultural

value,  but  generally  symphonic concerts,  chamber  music

ensembles,  operas,  ballets, plays and  national  cultural

shows  are  given  exemption. The unduly  esoteric  or  the

mundane  will  not  normally qualify for  exemption.  Other

aspects  that are taken into consideration are whether  the

performers are of international status and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



whether  the performance would appeal to a reasonably  wide

cross section of Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister to

clarify this point. What is the difference between  a  show

organised  by a private individual and that of a charitable

organisation?   Recently, there  have  been   many   shows

organised by private individuals for their own benefit, and

they  were given tax exemption. Why is there discrimination

between   the   cinemas  and  the  National   Theatre?   If

entertainment duty is paid by the cinemas, why is duty  not

charged for shows organised ,by private individuals at  the

National  Theatre?  If  a  show  is  organised  not  for  a

charitable cause, then entertainment duty should be levied.

If  the  private organisations want to organise  shows  for

their  own  benefit, entertainment duty must be imposed  as

for the cinemas. If it is a charitable show, then it should

be exempted from tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a loophole in the law and I hope the Minister

will look into this. The Minister should also look into the

wording  of  the  relevant law. I  have  received  so  many

complaints  on  this  that  I  have  to  put  forward  this

question. The Minister must stop this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am most disappointed

at  the  Member  for his non-support of shows  of  cultural

value.  I  thought that his question tended the other  way.

i.e, he  wanted  to  try and press  me  into  giving  more

exemption  for shows of cultural value. If he  thinks  that

the  private shows are making too much money.  I  am  quite

happy to extend the same exemption to him if he could bring

in symphonic concerts, ballets, cultural ensembles, chamber

music  and  so  on, which  are what  we  at  present  give

exemption  to.  I  do not think I want to  depart  from  my

present  practice  which  is to give  exemption  for  these

cultural shows. Of course, if he brings in pop music and so

on, I will not exempt them from entertainment duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister has not heard me

correctly.  He  does  not  want to  change  his  policy  or

practice. I accept that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



But  I do not want to see the proceeds of these shows going

into  the  pockets  of individuals. If they  are  used  for

charitable purposes, tax exemption should be given.  If  it

is not for a charitable cause, entertainment duty should be

charged,  as  for  the cinemas. Otherwise the  people  will

complain. We must try to make this clear and spell  it  out

in  the  law  that  if  a show is organised  by  a  private

individual  entertainment duty will be levied.  Then  there

will be no trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the time I organised a charitable show there were

so  many  individual organisations. My organisation  is  a

charitable  one  but  these individual organisations  have

all mixed together -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Govindaswamy, could you please put

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no response -

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member of Parliament

for  Sepoy Lines, Mr Wee Toon Boon, faced a total  of  five

different charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act in

the  Court  of first instance. The District Judge convicted

him  on each and every one of these charges, and imposed  a

sentence of three years' imprisonment on the fourth charge,

and  sentences  of six months' imprisonment in  respect  of

each of the other charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the conviction and sentence of three

years'  imprisonment imposed on the fourth charge,  Mr  Wee

would have been, by virtue of the provisions of Article  29

of    the    Constitution   of   Singapore, automatically

disqualified  from  remaining as a Member  of  this  House.

However, on appeal, the conviction on the fourth charge was

quashed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



and  the  sentence of three years' imprisonment set  aside.

The  appeal  in  respect  of the  other  four  charges  was

dismissed  and the sentence of six months' imprisonment  on

each charge was affirmed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An application made on Mr Wee's behalf to take the appeal

further  to  the  Court of Criminal Appeal  was  heard  and

dismissed  on  10th  August this year. Thus,  all  possible

appeals  have  been exhausted and the criminal  proceedings

against Mr Wee have been brought to a close.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney-General has advised that as the provisions

of   Article   29   of  the  Constitution   provide   quite

specifically that, in order to be disqualified from being a

Member  of  Parliament,  a  Member  so  convicted  must  be

sentenced in respect of an offence for a term of  not  less

than  12 months' imprisonment or to a fine of not less than

$2,000. Mr Wee would not, by virtue of his convictions  and

sentences,  be disqualified from remaining as a  Member  of

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee accordingly remains a Member of this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will recall that at the last sitting

of this House on 23rd July, 1976 a White Paper on the Report

of  the  Electoral  Boundaries  Delineation  Committee  was

presented to Parliament as Command 10 of 1976, and  that  I

made  a  statement in this House on the acceptance  by  the

Government of the Committee's recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recommended the creation of ten new

constituencies  and  the abolition of  six  existing  ones,

resulting in a net increase of four and bringing the  total

number of constituencies to 69.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 22 of the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap.

50)  provides  that  each constituency  should  return  one

Member  to  serve  in  Parliament.  Article  23(1)  of  the

Constitution enables the Legislature to provide by law  for

the  number of Members to be elected to serve in Parliament

in lieu of the number of 51 prescribed in that Article. The

Legislature  increased the number of Members of  Parliament

to  58  in  1  967 and to 65 in 1971. This  Bill  seeks  to

increase the number of Members of Parliament to be  elected

at the next general elections to 69.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this Bill has the assent of the President, we will

be ready for the next general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill-[Mr E. W. Barker]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to replace the Architects Act of 1941

which  has been outmoded by the establishment of the School

of Architecture in the University of Singapore and by other

developments affecting the architectural profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for a Board of Architects consisting of

a  President  to  be  appointed by the Minister  and  eight

members  from  the University, the private sector  and  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Board include the maintenance of a

register  of architects, the regulation of the conduct  and

ethics of the architectural profession and other associated

functions.  The  Board  is  also empowered  to  cancel  the

registration  or  suspend  a  registered  architect   under

certain circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important change is that under this Bill members of

the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) will cease

to  enjoy the privilege of automatic recognition which will

instead   be   accorded  to  graduates  of  the   Singapore

University  School of Architecture and to  holders  of  the

Diploma  in  Architecture from the  Singapore  Polytechnic.

Other persons holding approved qualifications will also  be

entitled to register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons who are registered under the present Architects

Act shall be deemed to be registered under the new Act. But

a  professional engineer who is registered as an  architect

will  after  three  years cease to be  entitled  to  be  so

registered  if  he continues to practise  as  an  engineer,

unless otherwise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



approved  by the Minister. This is because the registration

of  engineers  has  been  provided under  the  Professional

Engineers Act enacted in 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a

piece   of  legislation  to  safeguard  the  interests   of

architects, the profession ought to be happy with the  Bill

before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, looking at it as a member of the public, I must

express my disappointment that insufficient attention would

appear to have been paid to safeguard the interests of  the

public. In saying so. Sir, I have in mind particularly  the

need  for  Government to at least have some say in  how  an

architect's fee should be calculated. At present, I believe

architects  in the Republic follow an agreed scale  of  fee

fixed  by  the Singapore Institute of Architects  (SIA  for

short).  This  scale,  if  I am  not  mistaken,  was  taken

wholesale  from the RIBA, the British counterpart  of  SIA.

With the memory of the fierce rate of inflation in the cost

of  construction over the last couple of years still  fresh

in  my  mind,  I  do  like to question the  equity  of  the

customary  practice  of  the  architectural  profession  in

calculating  fees by applying a uniform percentage  on  the

contract sum of any one particular job irrespective  as  to

the  time spent. This would appear to me also to be totally

unrelated to the quantity of work involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give an illustration, if today the contract value

of   a  particular  job  is  $10,000  the  architect's  fee

applicable  calculated at 7½% would be $750. But  tomorrow,

if  for  any reason either on account of escalation in  the

costs  of building materials or labour, the same job should

be  valued at $20,000 the architect would still be entitled

to  7½%  but  on  the enhanced value, or  $1,500,  i.e, an

increase   of   100%  in  fees:  although  it   is   highly

questionable  whether the quantity of work  involved  under

such circumstances has proportionately increased.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sort of internally-generated inflation which

is  well within our control, and something ought to be done

about  it, perhaps by suitable provision in the law  giving

the regulating authorities the right to step in as and when

the   occasion  so  demands.  At  a  time   when   we   are

energetically  pursuing the renewal of our City  state,  we

should  wherever and whenever possible endeavour  to  bring

down the cost of construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17, sub-clause (1)(c) imposes certain penalties

upon unauthorised persons undertaking "architectural work".

However, there appears to be no attempt under the  Bill  to

define  what  is  "architectural work". This  leads  me  to

wonder  whether in the actual implementation of the  law  a

situation  might not arise whereby owing to ambiguities  of

the law, offences could be committed unwittingly by certain

members  of the public under the relevant section. What  is

architectural work? Is interior decoration involving  minor

structural  alteration  to be considered  as  architectural

work?   There  are  at  present  a  number  of   small-time

contractors involved in such type of work at HDB flats  and

other private residential estates. Would they be considered

as  undertaking  architectural work? Presumably  the  legal

definition  is  to  be found in our Building  bye-laws  and

regulations.  Perhaps  the  Hon.  Minister  would  care  to

clarify for the benefit of the general public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also take the opportunity of urging the Minister

to review our existing bye-laws and regulations at an early

date;  first, to ensure whether they are still  in  keeping

with  and  relevant  to  our  present  circumstances,   and

secondly, to consider excluding therefrom certain types  of

work   which   may   not  strictly  require   architectural

expertise. In making the second suggestion I have  in  mind

the   construction  and  alteration  of  wooden  structures

commonly  seen in our rural areas. At present, the services

of  architects  are required in conjunction with  all  such

structures  except. I believe, where the built-up  area  is

less  than  200 sq, ft. In practice considerable  confusion

has been caused by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



the regulating authorities in this particular area of work.

For  instance,  I  have come across cases where  occupants,

applying  for a change of roofing from attap to  corrugated

iron sheets, have been asked to submit architectural plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of development that has prompted me to

suggest  a  review  is  the  increasing  tendency  to   use

prefabricated   steel   structures   for   industrial   and

warehousing  purposes. Looking at such type of  structures,

as  a  layman  it  would appear to me to be  sufficient  to

require  only  the services of engineers without  involving

architects.  In this way we could help to keep construction

costs  down,  as  we all know that the architect's  fee  is

normally calculated at 7½%, whereas the engineer's  fee  is

only  2½%. It is pertinent for me to make clear that I have

not   been  lobbied  by  the  engineering  profession   and

therefore  hold no briefs on their behalf. My concern  here

is  simply the saving of construction costs for our general

public.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill which seeks

to  amend the Architects Act of 1941 is commendable, as  it

replaces  the  old  Act and updates the provisions  dealing

with the registration of architects, the qualifications and

practice of architects, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My worry is this. I am wondering whether the Ministry has

given  sufficient  thought to this Bill before  introducing

it.  As  my  Friend, the Hon. Member for  Jalan  Kayu,  has

pointed out, some further amendments could be introduced to

improve  it.  I  also notice that many amendments  will  be

moved  at  the Committee stage. This is a Bill to amend  an

old  Act and I am sure the Ministry must have been thinking

of amending this Act for quite some time. The Bill contains

only  26  clauses, of which eight are to  be  amended.  The

total number of amendments that will be moved is 15.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is becoming a habit of the Government to amend

Bills  at  Committee stage, not in the case  of  this  Bill

alone but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



even  in  other Bills previously. I can understand  if  the

amendments come from this side of the House or if a Bill is

sent   to   a  Select  Committee  when,  as  a  result   of

representations received, amendments are introduced. But in

this  particular case, as in many other previous instances,

the  Bill  has been introduced by the Government  and  soon

after  its Second Reading, many, many amendments are to  be

moved by the Government in Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just wondering. Sir, whether this is the result of

carelessness or insufficient thought given on the  part  of

the  Ministry  that  introduces the Bill, or  whether  the

problem  lies with the people who drafted the Bill. Perhaps

the  Minister  would care to explain. I am sure  he  has  a

legitimate  reason for these amendments. If  so,  why  were

they  not  given  sufficient thought before  the  Bill  was

introduced?



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share

some of the sentiments of the Member for Jalan Kayu. Here I

would  like  to state that while the architects'  interests

are  being  sufficiently provided for  in  this  Bill, the

consumer is still not adequately protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must hasten to add that there is some protection now

afforded  to consumers, but very little indeed. There  must

be a move by Government to ensure that in the services area

there  is consumer protection. The Government had  seen  it

fit  to  introduce  in  the products  area  protection  for

consumers in the form of the Consumers Protection  Act.  It

is  my hope that the Government looks more closely into the

services area to ensure adequate protection for consumers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, by "consumer

protection"  I  presume the Hon. Member  for  Potong  Pasir

implies architect's fees and those matters relating to work

done.  I shall take my reply together with the Hon.  Member

for Jalan Kayu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of architect's fees raised by the Hon.

Member for Jalan Kayu, the fee for new works done is  7½%

of the cost of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



executed   works  as  currently  shown  in  the   Singapore

Institute   of  Architects  (SIA)  "Scale  of  Professional

Charges".  For repetitive work, the fee is on  a  declining

scale  from  6%  down to 4%. I understand and  it  is  also

understood  that these rates are non-mandatory  guides  for

SIA  members  and  that in actual practice,  the  fees  are

negotiable between the client and the architect. It is also

my  understanding that the total cost of works may be based

on  the tender price or on a fixed lump sum, in which  case

the  question of inflation affecting architect's fees  does

not  arise. However, should the total cost of work be based

on  the final settlement of the accounts, then the basis of

arriving  at the final cost of works is negotiable  between

the  architect and the client. Any increase in fees due  to

inflationary   elements  is  again  a  matter   of   mutual

settlement. Since architects' fees are negotiable, there is

no  necessity to make provisions in this Bill to  stipulate

the scale of fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it may be pertinent to point out that clause 5

of  this  Bill  provides that one of the functions  of  the

Board  of  Architects  is  to determine  and  regulate  the

professional   conduct  and  ethics  of  the  architectural

profession,  as  well  as  to hear and  determine  disputes

relating   to  the  professional  conduct  or   ethics   of

registered  architects.  Within  this  context, therefore.

cases  of malpractice or conduct which is infamous  in  the

professional aspect can be brought to the attention of  the

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  of  Parliament  may  wish  to  know   that

previously,  under the Architects Ordinance  of  1941,  the

Board  of Architects was empowered to fix a scale  of  fees

charged. However, this was removed by an amendment  in  the

Ordinance in 1957 as it was felt that the Government should

not interfere in the fees charged, which should be left  to

market  forces.  However, I would like to assure  the  Hon.

Member  that  should a situation at any  time  warrant  the

architect's  fees to be fixed, amendments could accordingly

be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu made a correct observation in

that  the term "architectural work" is not defined  in  the

Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



The Ministry is aware of this and to avoid ambiguity in the

interpretation (and this is one of the reasons in answer to

the  Hon.  Member for Telok Blangah) an amendment  will  be

introduced  at  the  Committee stage to  delete  clause  17

(1)(c).  Certain other minor amendments to  the  Bill  will

also be moved at the Committee stage and the reasons are to

make  the  Bill more explicit. Perhaps I can say  that  the

reasons for the amendments are both of a drafting nature as

well as the result of representations and observations made

by  some  MPs  and the Singapore Institute  of  Architects.

Generally, architects do not build houses without amendment

to the plans. So at the last moment the Singapore Institute

of Architects made further representations to the Ministry,

and  to  show  that  we  are open to  suggestions  we  have

therefore incorporated a few of the suggestions or recommen

dations made by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed also seek to strengthen the

authority  of the Minister vis-avis the Board of Architects

and  also  to give the Board of Architects more flexibility

in  meting out punishment for lesser offences which do  not

warrant suspension or deregistration as required under  the

existing unamended Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point raised by the Hon. Member for Jalan

Kayu  on  minor works, let me say that for alterations  and

additions  to  HDB  flats and other  private  residences  a

submission of building plans by architects is not required.

However, where there are major additions and alterations or

where  additions  and alterations entail  structural  works

involving safety standards, architect's plans are required.

Recently,  the Building Control Division issued  guidelines

as  to  the  type  of building works which do  not  require

submission  of  building  plans  by  architects,  and  this

information is available at the Building Control  Division,

if required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's comment on the erection of temporary

dwellings  in the rural areas, the BCD makes available  six

standard-type plans so that applicants need not engage  the

services of an architect. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



services  of an architect are only required where erections

do not conform to any of these six standard-type plans, and

this is obviously to ensure that the plans comply with  all

the necessary building requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also suggested looking into and updating the

existing  regulations under the Local Government (Building)

Regulations. We are looking into this at this juncture, and

appropriate amendments will be made when we are  ready  for

it.  I would also like to inform the Member that the change

of  roofing from attap to corrugated iron sheets  or  other

light-weight  materials such as asbestos does  not  require

architect's plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also made a valid point on the use of

services  of engineers as against architects in engineering

type of works. As things stand, building plans can only  be

submitted  by persons registered under the Architects  Act.

Consequently, in  the present context an  engineer  cannot

submit  building  plans unless he is registered  under  the

Architects Act. The Institution of Engineers Singapore, and

the Association of Consulting Engineers Singapore, together

with  the  Singapore  Institute of  Architects,  have  made

representations to the Ministry. The question of permitting

engineers  to  submit building plans for certain  types  of

projects,  for example, prefabricated works, as brought  up

by  the Member, is being discussed between these interested

parties.  We will incorporate the necessary recommendations

in  the  Schedule  to the Building Regulations  when  these

issues are mutually settled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to assure Members of this House

that  both  the Singapore Institute of Architects  and  the

present  Board of Architects have been consulted throughout

the  whole period of the drafting of this Bill. I have also

indicated   earlier   that  even   at   the   last   moment

representations made by these organisations  were  accepted

and incorporated in amendments which will be introduced  at

the  Committee  stage, and they have fully  supported  this

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of sea pollution, especially by oil, has been

a subject of international concern. Over the last few years

more  and more efforts have been taken by ports and various

authorities  in different parts of the world  to  keep  the

seas and oceans around them clean and free of pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Singapore is no exception. Situated at a

focal   point  of  international  shipping, the  Port   of

Singapore  last  year recorded some 40,426 vessel  arrivals

and   departures  giving  a  total  of  205.2  million  net

registered tons of shipping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is also a major oil refining centre, a large

number  of  oil  tankers, some of  them  Very  Large  Crude

Carriers,  discharge crude oil and load  refined  petroleum

products  at  the  various  oil  terminals  in  our   port.

Therefore, the threat of oil pollution in Singapore  waters

is a constant one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority is charged with the

responsibility  of  keeping our waters clean.  Legislations

such  as  the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act,  1971

and  the  Civil Liability (Oil Pollution) Act, 1  973  have

been  drawn  up  to  prevent vessels from  indiscriminately

polluting our waters with oil and rubbish.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, legislation in itself does not help the Port of

Singapore  Authority  in a real situation  arising  out  of

accident   in  our  port  waters.  Besides  improving   the

navigability  of  the  sea  lanes  and  the   addition   of

navigational aids, the Port of Singapore Authority  has  to

have  available sufficient equipment to combat  oil  spills

and  to  prevent the oil from polluting our beaches in  the

event  of  an accident. To this end, the Port of  Singapore

Authority  has  worked tirelessly to acquire anti-pollution

equipment and to build anti-oil pollution capabilities into

its tugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment on such specialised equipment is high. It is

therefore necessary that organisations actively involved in

the  refining of petroleum or transport of petroleum should

also  play an active role by building up their own anti-oil

pollution  capabilities in Singapore so that  they  can  be

called upon at short notice to assist the Port of Singapore

Authority in fighting major oil spills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore proposed to amend paragraph (b) of

section  27(2) of the Prevention of Pollution  of  the  Sea

Act,  1971  to  require  the owners  or  operators  of  oil

terminals   in   Singapore   to  store   such   detergents,

dispersants   and   equipment,   as   are   prescribed   by

regulations, to  deal  with  any  pollution  of  Singapore

waters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the existing provision of section 36 of the

Legal Profession Act (Chapter 217), any full-time member of

the  academic staff of the Faculty of Law of the University

of  Singapore  is  only permitted to  act  in  an  advisory

capacity when he is instructed by a practising advocate and

solicitor.  This  has resulted in narrowing  the  scope  of

advisory  work  of University law teachers.  The  Bill  now

before this House seeks to remove this limitation, so  that

persons  wishing to seek legal opinions or advice from  our

University  law  teachers may do so without  going  through

practising  advocates  and  solicitors, and  thus   enable

greater  use to be made of the advisory services which  our

University law teachers can offer, especially in the fields

of law in which they have specialised knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The removal of the limitation made under the Bill cannot,

however, apply to all University law teachers but  only  to

those who are "qualified persons" within the meaning of the

Legal  Profession Act. A "qualified person" as  defined  in

section 2 of the Act briefly means an LLB graduate  of  our

University or a person who is professionally qualified as a

barrister  or  solicitor  in  the  United  Kingdom.  It  is

necessary  to  impose this requirement since there  may  be

University  law  teachers  who are  not  qualified  persons

within  the meaning of the Act, and it is not the intention

to  accord  such  persons, whether within  or  outside  the

University, this special right to render legal opinions  or

act in an advisory capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970, the British Government announced that it would

assume  responsibility  for  the  cost  of  preindependence

expatriate  pensions  paid to retired expatriates  who  had

served  the  governments  of its  various  territories.  To

implement  this  decision,  the British  Government  passed

legislation which enabled the British Government to  assume

full  responsibility for the administration and payment  of

pensions to expatriate officers who had served in the civil

service of its former colonies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussions held between officials of the Singapore

Government  and  the  British  Government,  agreement   was

reached  for  the latter to assume full responsibility  for

the following payments:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the cost of expatriate pensions payable to retired

officers   covered  by  the  Public  Officers'   Agreement,

Singapore, 1 964, in respect of their service prior to 29th

January, 1957, the date on which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



Singapore Public Service Commission was established;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the cost of expatriate pensions for service after

29th January, 1957 on the Singapore Government paying  the

British  Government a capital sum in full  settlement, the

amount  of  which  is  to  be  actuarially  determined  and

mutually agreed upon by the two Governments;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the whole cost of pension payments under the Widows'

and Orphans' Pensions Scheme for the widows and orphans  of

deceased  expatriate officers and assisting  the  surviving

expatriates who are still under the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 1 .380 pensioners are involved and the estimated

gross  saving to Singapore on expatriate pensions would  be

in  the region of £860,000. This amount would be reduced by

about £260,000 representing Singapore's cost of liquidating

the pension liability for pensions of officers with service

after  29th January, 1957. There will  also  be  a  small

abatement  on  account of income tax  deductible  from  the

pensions by Singapore. In respect of the expatriate widows'

and  orphans' pensions, the Singapore Government would save

about £66,000 annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Officers' Pension (Singapore) Agreement 1976

has been signed between the Government of Singapore and the

Government  of  the  United Kingdom of  Great  Britain  and

Northern  Ireland  detailing  the  arrangements   for   the

takeover  of  expatriate pensions liability by  the  latter

from   1st April, 1973.  The  passing  of  the  Pensions

(Expatriate Officers) Bill will give effect to  the  Public

Officers'  Pension (Singapore) Agreement 1976  under  which

responsibility  for  the  payment  of  pensions, including

widows'   and  orphans'  pensions, to  certain  expatriate

officers and their dependants will be relinquished  by  the

Singapore  Government and taken over by the  Government  of

the United Kingdom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this clause, the requirement is that in every

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 35, to leave Out lines 10 to 15 inclusive, and

insert a new sub-clause (2)* as set Out in the Notice of amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (2) of this clause introduced by the Select

Committee  has been amplified to the advantage  of  foreign

companies.  A  special  power to exempt  is  given  to  the

Minister  (subject to such conditions as  he  may  consider

necessary)  where a foreign company is able to satisfy  him

that more than



<hr size="2" noshade>

<pre>

               *New sub-clause (2) reads as follows:



               "(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, where a foreign company is able to satisfy

               the Minister that more than fifty per cent of the total voting rights attributable to the share capital

               of such foreign company is held by -



                 (a) members who are citizens; or

Cap. 141.        (b) members who are "resident in Singapore" within the meaning of the Income Tax Act and

                     who pay the tax imposed under that Act; or

                 (c) members mentioned in both paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection.



               the Minister may. by notification in the Gazette and subject to such conditions as he, may consider

               necessary, exempt such foreign company from all or any of the provisions of this Act".

</pre>

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>





50%  of its share capital is held either by members who are

citizens  or  by  members resident  in  Singapore  who  pay

Singapore  income  tax,  or  by  both  such  categories  of

persons, that is, citizens and tax-paying residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended sub-clause represents a more liberal approach

to  the  exemption of foreign companies than at present  in

the Bill. Thus -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the percentage shareholding held by citizens (and

taxpaying residents) in foreign companies to qualify for an

exemption  is reduced from 80% to 50% in the amendment  now

proposed; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the required percentage need not be held exclusively

by  citizens,  but  may  be held by citizens  or  taxpaying

residents  or  by both citizens and taxpaying residents  in

order  to arrive at the "more than 50 per cent" or majority

criterion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a purely phraseological amendment which is being

made for the purpose of added clarity.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Third Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Now. Sir, I beg to move. "That the Bill be now

read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee on this Bill received 1 5

written representations and heard 13 representors. Some  of

the contributions were valuable and a number of suggestions

have been accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Select Committee was presented to this

House on 5th May, 1976, as Paper ParI. 2 of 1976. The Bill,

as  set  out at Appendix I of the Report, incorporates  the

amendments made by the Select Committee. I shall not burden

the   House  with  explanations  in  respect  of  all   the

amendments  so made, as these are contained at Appendix  V.

Explanations have also been given in the Committee of  this

House for the necessity to amend further certain provisions

of the Bill as submitted by the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, however, to emphasise the fact that this

legislation is concerned only with residential property and

that  industrial  and commercial real  estate  as  well  as

residential flats in buildings of six or more storeys,  and

units in approved condominiums which are not subject to any

restriction, may be freely purchased and sold  by  citizens

and non-citizens alike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign companies are now to be given 10 years from 11th

September  1973 to dispose of their residential  properties

except  in  cases where specific approval  to  retain  such

properties  has  been  granted by  the  Minister.  However.

foreign  natural  persons or societies  owning  residential

properties  as at 11th September, 1973 will not be  required

to   dispose  of  such  properties;  this  is  specifically

provided for in clause 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of sale by legal personal representatives of

residential  properties belonging to deceased  persons  who

died   on   or  after  11th September, 1973, where   the

beneficiaries are foreign persons, has been extended to ten

years, instead of five years,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



from the date of the death of the deceased persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The established procedure to facilitate foreigners

in  seeking approvals for the purchase of residential

properties  will  continue  to  apply  to   permanent

residents  as  well as other foreigners. Applications

from   those  making  an  economic  contribution   to

Singapore  or  those  with  special  merit  will   be

favourably  considered  by  the  Minister.   However,

approvals  granted will be subject to the  limitation

of  one residential unit of land not exceeding 15.000

sq, ft, to be used only for the occupation  of  the

applicant and his family. Foreign companies which are

of  economic benefit to Singapore will be allowed  to

purchase or acquire and retain residential properties

for  the  occupation of their chief executives.  Such

approvals,  however,  will be subject  to  reasonable

limits on the number of such executives and the  area

of land for each residence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this Bill will take effect retrospectively

from the 11th day of September 1973, the penalties by

way  of  a  fine or imprisonment imposed for offences

under  the  Bill  are  not to be  made  retrospective

before the appointed day. This is as it should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing  in my name as it

appears on the Order Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Jurong Town Corporation proposes to

develop about 327 hectares (809 acres) of the land at

Sembawang as shown edged purple on the plan marked as "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 3/76", a copy of which is displayed in the Library of

this   House, for  industrial  use.  The   proposed

development necessitates the reclamation of about  70

hectares  of the foreshores and seabed and  parts  of

Singes  Simpang,  Sungei  Khatib  Bongsu  and  Sungei

Seletar as shown coloured yellow on the plan, and the

creation of two artificial channels at the mouths  of

Sungei   Simpang  and  Sungei  Seletar   to   provide

additional  sea-frontage land for marine and  marine-orientated   industries,  by  excavating   about   48

hectares of dry land shown coloured blue on the plan.

and  dredging  about 1 27 hectares of the  foreshores

and seabed shown hatched blue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will cost about $60 million (including

reclamation and dredging works) and will  take  about

four  years to complete. The necessary fill  will  be

obtained by excavating the dry land and dredging  the

foreshores and seabed mentioned earlier, as  well  as

by  levelling  hills in the Sungei  Kadut  Industrial

Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation, the reclaimed

land  will  be proclaimed as State land and  will  be

alienated to the Jurong Town Corporation on terms and

conditions  to  be  agreed with the  Commissioner  of

Lands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the

Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by

Government of approximately 70.28 hectares of foreshores

and seabed coloured yellow and the dredging of

approximately 48.19 hectares of land shown coloured blue

and dredging of approximately 126.59 hectares of the

foreshores and seabed shown hatched blue on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 3/76", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.
