<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, yesterday, Dr Chong Weng Chiew spoke about the

impact of the move of HDB's headquarters from Jalan Bukit

Merah  to  Toa Payoh Central.   Allow me to spend  a  few

minutes to explain why HDB made this move.  At that time,

the  previous HDB office, which was at Jalan Bukit Merah,

was  facing a severe space shortage, which was  affecting

the  level  of service as well as the working environment

of  its  staff.  After considering several  options,  HDB

decided  in 1995, at a time when the Singapore's  economy

was growing robustly, to move to this new location in Toa

Payoh.  Moving the office to a suburban location that was

served  by  an  MRT station would, obviously,  help  ease

congestion in the urban areas but, more importantly, also

provide greater convenience for HDB lessees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB hub in Toa Payoh was also a very integral

part  of  the estate renewal strategy for Toa Payoh  Town

Centre.   When  the move was made in 1995, HDB  did  take

into  account  the  impact on residents and  shopkeepers.

But  as  the  economy was doing well at  that  time,  HDB

anticipated that it would be able to sell the HDB  Centre

and  ensure  that there would continue to be activity  in

that   area.   But,  unfortunately,  the  market   turned

dramatically.   And  as I informed the  House  yesterday,

there  has been a drop in demand for office space  island

wide,  and this has resulted in over supply of  space  in

the  market.  Nevertheless, I recognise that this  is  no

comfort  to  the shopkeepers in Bukit Merah, and  I  will

urge  HDB to redouble its efforts to bring in new tenants

to the HDB Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mdm Cynthia Phua's question which

is on a related topic, this time on the relocation of one

of   the  neighbourhood  centres  in  Hougang.   This  is

Neighbourhood South II.  I must, first of all,  emphasise

that when HDB plans new towns, it does so with many other

agencies  - LTA, MOH, MOE, Library Board, PA and so on  - to   provide  a  wide  range  of  facilities   like   bus

interchange,  recreational facilities,  shopping  centres

and so on.  But over time, as the town

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>

expands, it is sometimes necessary to relocate that  town

centre to better serve residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Hougang South Neighbourhood II, or

Kovan  City  as  it came to be called,  as  Hougang  town

expanded northwards, an MRT station and a new town centre

were  planned  at  Hougang Central,  Neighbourhood  VIII,

because  this  is  more  centrally  located  within   the

expanded  town.  To better serve the residents,  all  the

bus  services that were originally in Hougang South  were

to be moved and centralised in the bus interchange at the

town   centre  or  Hougang  Central.   The  vacated   bus

interchange  site and the vacated Hougang  Branch  Office

would   be   designated   for  residential   development.

Obviously,  because  there is no  need  to  provide  more

residential  development  at this point in time,  nothing

has been done so far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members of this House that decisions

like  this  to relocate town centres and therefore  cause

disruption to shopkeepers and even to residents, are  not

taken lightly, but sometimes they have to be taken.   And

when  they  are taken, certain measures are also  put  in

place   to   mitigate  the  impact.   For  example,   the

downgrading  is implemented gradually over several  years

to  ensure that both residents and shopkeepers have  time

to  adapt  to  the change.  Notice is given as  early  as

possible.   In  the case of Kovan City, for example,  the

shopkeepers were informed as early as 1986.  The  planned

closure of Hougang South bus interchange was conveyed  to

the  shopkeepers as early as 1992.  When the  shops  were

sold  to  them  in 1993 under the Sale of Tenanted  Shops

Scheme,  HDB  took  this into account that  it  would  be

downgraded   from  a  town  centre  and  that   the   bus

interchange  will be closed.  So, HDB valued these  shops

not  as  town  centre  shops but as neighbourhood  centre

shops, and re-priced them accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, HDB works closely with other agencies to

schedule the relocation of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>

facilities  such  as bus interchange from  the  old  town

centre.   In  this  case  of Hougang,  for  example,  the

relocation  of  the  bus interchange coincided  with  the

opening  of  the  new Kovan MRT Station,  which  is  just

across  the road.  And, hopefully, when Kovan MRT Station

is opened, this will help to balance part of the loss due

to the relocation of the bus interchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where HDB can do so, it will assist the shopkeepers

affected   by  relocation,  eg,  by  exercising   greater

flexibility  in  change  of use  approvals,  by  allowing

shopowners  to convert to shorter leases, by  sub-letting

the shops and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua also asked whether there is any

agency that is overall in charge of land use in HDB  town

centres.   I will ask HDB to work with relevant  agencies

to  take  the  necessary measures needed to minimise  the

impact  of such plans in future.  But I cannot  give  any

undertaking that such relocations will never  take  place

or that such relocations will only take place if there is

no adverse impact on the shopkeepers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to respond to Mr Wee Siew Kim on wet

markets,  as  Members would know, HDB used to  build  wet

markets  in  its housing estates.  But for public  health

reasons,  after 1982, HDB replaced the wet  markets  with

dry markets, and these dry markets comprise a cluster  of

shops as well as a supermarket.  Unfortunately, these dry

markets soon became wet again, and public health concerns

resurfaced.   So,  in 1982, based on the  review  of  the

situation  and feedback from advisers and residents,  HDB

started to build new markets  -  not wet, not dry  -  but

new.    These  are similar to wet markets  but  they  are

designed with improved features, much cleaner, much  more

hygienic,  larger market stalls and wider aisles  and  so

on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new markets are usually co-located with other

retail  and  eating facilities in stand-alone  commercial

complexes  at  neighbourhood centres.   These  integrated

facilities  have helped to provide a good  marketing  and

shopping environment for the residents.  Some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>

Members  may  be  aware  of such new  developments.   For

example, in Sengkang, we have Rivervale Plaza;  in   Chua

Chu Kang, we have the Yew Tee Shopping Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Mr Wee that HDB has also

started  to tender out designated sites for the provision

of  retail  marketing  and eating  facilities.   And  the

successful tenderer has the flexibility to build whatever

type  of  market facilities that he thinks the  residents

need  and want, whether it is a new market or whether  it

is a supermarket.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, the

Master  Plan  provides short to medium term  planning  of

land  use  and the intensity of individual land  parcels.

The  Master Plan 2003 aims to make Singapore a great city

to  live,  work  and play.  But, how do  we  measure  the

achievement  of our Master Plan?  We need to  define  key

performance  indicators to monitor the  progress  of  our

Master Plan.  To date, we have not defined any quality of

life  indicators  for  Singaporeans.   Sir,  we  need  to

determine quantifiable indicators which Singaporeans  can

understand.   In  this way, we will all know  whether  we

have  planned successfully to maximise our  land  use  to

provide a quality living environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must commend the URA for adopting an open and

consultative approach to solicit public feedback for  the

Master Plans of different regions.  In order to develop a

better  sense of belonging among Singaporeans, we  should

reach  out  to  more  Singaporeans,  especially  the  HDB

heartlanders  to  participate in  land  use  planning  of

Singapore.    More  outreach  efforts  are  required   to

encourage  active citizen participation in our  land  use

planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) How much has been achieved in the Master Plan 1998?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What percentage of State land has its plot ratio

increased as compared to private land?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What measures have been taken to improve the

jobs and home accessibility for Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) What are the key performance targets of Master

Plan 2003?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I support the

URA's  move  to  give  developers  and  businesses   more

flexibility  in their land use by having sites  with  new

expanded  white zoning under which a wider  mix  of  uses

will  be allowed, ranging from residential and commercial

to  sports  and R&D facilities.  This also  implies  that

landowners have greater flexibility to change  a  portion

of  the  uses  of their building in future  according  to

market demands without attracting development charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I would like to suggest that when

tenders  are invited for such plots, unless the intention

is  merely  to  allow  greater flexibility,  some  weight

should  be  given to the proposed uses of the land  which

may  add  more  vibrancy to the area and thus  indirectly

bring in more and wider economic benefits, than just  the

bid  prices for the land.  Otherwise, for sites  such  as

those  next  to  the  Jurong East  MRT  Station  recently

unveiled in the draft Master Plan 2003, the wider mix and

combination of uses allowed may be purely academic, since

commercial and residential uses would generally yield the

highest  residual land values.  Previous whites sites  in

the  Central  Area,  for instance,  have  been  developed

largely for commercial uses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to propose that for white sites,

the Ministry could, in future, instead of prescribing the

permissible  uses of the land, provide an exclusion  list

of  uses  that  are  disallowed,  because  they  will  be

incompatible with the surrounding land use.   This  could

allow for even more creative and flexible use of land and

enable  land  owners  to adapt more quickly  to  changing

market conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to land use, I would also like to ask

what  the Ministry's thinking is with regard to land  for

retirement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>

housing.   I understand that feedback has been  given  to

the Ministry regarding the need to look into provision of

retirement  housing  in  view of  an  ageing  population.

There  are  already  lands designated for  nursing  homes

which have been sold by the Government on 30-year leases.

I  would  like  to  ask whether the Government  can  also

consider  designating  land for  retirement  housing  and

selling them on, say, 30-year leases.  HDB already builds

granny  flats  and perhaps the private  sector  and  NTUC

affiliated  organisations could be given the  opportunity

to participate in this area of social provision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as one of the MPs in the west region, I am also

very  happy  to note that there are plans to improve  the

accessibility within the Jurong area with  a  light  rail

system for the future Jurong Regional Line.  I would urge

the  plans  to improve accessibility of the  area  to  be

implemented as soon as possible, as this is  one  of  the

main  reasons which makes the Jurong area less attractive

to  live  in  than  the  East.  Tuas,  for  instance,  is

infamous as a place that employees try to avoid as  their

place of work.  Indeed, the ERC Report accepted as one of

the   recommendations  of the Land  Work  Group  for  the

Government  to  invest  in transportation  infrastructure

ahead  of  demand if there are sound reasons  to  do  so.

Hence, I would like to ask the Minister how the proposals

in  the  Master  Plan 2003 for this area  would  help  to

enhance  the attractiveness of Tuas as a place for  work,

if not, live and play.

<br>11.15 am

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong):</b> Sir, the setting up

of  the 3-in-1 service centre in Jurong East took only 11

months from approval to operation.  I would like to thank

MND  for  this.   So,  instead of cutting  $100  off  the

budget, I believe maybe we should add $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of "a first world oasis in a third world

region"  gave Singapore a competitive advantage for  over

30 years.  We clearly did well.  But the world has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>

changed.   Not only do we have to compete for investments

among  cities,  we also have to compete to  be  the  best

place to live in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Esplanade is our latest pride. But when

you  travel along Sheares Bridge at night, it  is  hardly

seen,  unlike  the  Fullerton  Hotel  which  is  brightly

lighted  up.  Bright lights and big cities are a  natural

combination.   Think  of the theatre district  of  London

where  the  flashing lights create a vibrant and  buzzing

atmosphere,  or  the  chaotic  and  colourful  shops   of

Shanghai,  and  Harajuku in Tokyo.  I am  glad  that  the

Ministry  has allowed some neon lights to add colour  and

life  to our night skies.  We have to make it well  known

to  the  people and identify more areas for such  lights.

Some  of  the countries came and learn from  us.   So  we

should  put  in  more effort in our much praised  "Garden

City",  if  not, it will be slowly losing its shine  when

compared with some other cities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our population too has changed. With economic

wealth  and rising standard of living, their expectations

have  risen.   They  travel all  over  the  world.   They

compare  our  city  state  with  other  countries.    Our

students  study  overseas and expect  to  have  the  same

quality  living  conditions as the  best  cities  in  the

world.    The   competition  for  talent,  tourists   and

investments has now become global.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should use this economic downturn period to

sharpen  our competitive edge.  I would like to urge  the

Government  to  increase  MND's  budget  further  to  re-energise   and  consolidate  our  development,   position

ourselves strategically for the next wave.  MND must  aim

high  to make Singapore truly a city of excellence.   Our

buildings  should reflect our multi-cultural  and  multi-racial  background.  If we keep building boring and  "so-so"  looking buildings, Singapore will soon become a "so-so"  city.  We should start building buildings that  will

stand  up to the best designed buildings in other cities.

Better still, we should encourage buildings designed  for

our  humid and hot weather.  We would save money  through

energy  conservation  and we could even  become  a  world

leader in design for the tropics.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>

Good-looking  buildings  need  not  necessarily  be  more

expensive and less practical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should benchmark against the best cities in

the world.  When we built Changi Airport, we learned very

aggressively  from the best.  We should do the  same  for

everything  that we do.  To promote a healthy  lifestyle,

it  is  a  good  idea  to connect  the  parks,  and  park

connectors are very well used.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Yu-Foo, your speech is becoming

so-so long!

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> All right, Sir, I will try to

sum  up.  So we should speed up.  Another area is,  as  a

city  state,  we  need to accelerate the building  of  an

island-wide MRT network.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end, I would like to say that MND must

aim to make Singapore a "WOW" city.

these.   In  view  of the advancement in technology,  the

different  business  uses are now more  integrated.   MOS

Vivian Balakrishnan has just announced the integration of

the  various  types  of uses within an  industrial  land.

What  about the integration of the industrial, commercial

and  residential uses within a parcel of land, so  as  to

have  a  better  home-office connectivity  and  a  better

provision  of  commercial amenities to support  the  work

environment?  Can the Ministry allow the existing  vacant

industrial  land to have this flexibility of  integration

to allow vibrancy and increase economic value?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For residential property, the trend is towards high-density residential development. What are the planning

considerations  taken  to ensure that  the  intensity  of

living  does  not cause social and communal  dislocation?

This   is   especially  important  where   good   private

residential   estates   are  now  faced   with   5-storey

apartments overlooking into their houses,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>

in  view  of the plot ratio of 1.4 for landed residential

estates.   The  mobility  of  residents  for  social  and

communal  interactions,  as well as  personal  well-being

with regard to a 4-storey high public housing, has to  be

studied carefully before duplicating in other estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the planning considerations of the places

of  worship,  especially in private residential  estates?

And  what  are the planning considerations of columbarium

within  these  places  of  worship?   This  is  extremely

sensitive  in  private landed housing  estates.   In  HDB

estates,  these places of worship are usually  designated

and pre-planned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Master Plan 2003, land use plans were

prepared  for  five  large  areas.   Would  URA  consider

detailed planning at areas where it is a necessity?   For

example, Toa Payoh is such a vibrant town now because  of

the detailed development guide plan that was drawn up  in

1996.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Michael Lim is not present. Dr

Wang Kai Yuen.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, in land-scarce

Singapore, everyone has the impression that in Singapore,

there  is  always  going to be short of land,  Government

landfills notwithstanding.  Therefore, investing in  land

cannot  be  that  wrong.  Government has also  reinforced

this  concept through very careful and controlled release

of land through its tendering system.  As a result, often

times,  property investment yields fantastic  result  not

because   of   its   intrinsic  value  but   because   of

Government's  land  policies.   This  has  led  to  over-investment   in  land  by  businesses  and   individuals.

Regardless  of  whether it is residential, commercial  or

industrial  land,  their  value has  escalated  over  the

years, leading to the current high land cost in Singapore

and contributing much to our current difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was a surprise to learn from the

Minister for Finance in his recent Budget Statement  that

there  is  no shortage of industrial land in Singapore  - not  now,  not ever.  So, in a way, one wonders what  has

JTC been doing over the years,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>

allocating industrial land at ever increasing land price,

until recently.  Sir, unwinding the current situation  is

extremely  difficult.  As the Minister  for  Finance  has

indicated,  we  would all be very worried  if  Government

causes  a  collapse  in land price, leading  to  negative

equity suffered by all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if we were to leave the current

situation  to slowly digest the inflated land  price,  it

would  also  delay  our economic recovery.   In  the  ERC

Report,  the  concept of competitive factor  pricing  for

land  use has been introduced.  I would like to find  out

from  the  Minister  how he proposes  to  implement  this

concept.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min is not present. Dr

Amy Khor.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, being the largest

landlord in Singapore owning some 90% of the land in this

country,  the Government has repeatedly assured  that  it

will  ensure  an  adequate supply of land  to  achieve  a

stable property market and rein in price increases.   Its

vast  land holdings give it leverage to steer the  market

in its long-term strategic direction.  Most recently, DPM

Lee  has  assured  this House that  the  Government  will

ensure  an adequate supply of industrial land to  achieve

stable and internationally competitive prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few days, and just a few minutes ago,

it seems to me that many in this House have tried to make

land  cost  the chief villian for our business woes,  the

destroyer  of  entrepreneurial drive  and  the  cause  of

national  embarrassment (as in the case of  the  loss  of

Maersk and Evergreen to Tanjong Pelapas).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is that our present business

woes  are  due to a combination of factors which  include

land,  but  also  labour costs, other than  the  cost  of

materials.  In fact, for most large companies, land costs

make  up  only  a  small fraction of  their  entire  cost

structure,  the  bulk  being  labour  costs  other   than

material costs.  In reality, to remain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>

competitive, all costs must be reined in.  The danger, of

course, is when land costs rise out of sync with the rest

of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a property consultant, I would also like to note

that  since  1996, land prices for almost all sectors  of

the  property market, including industrial and commercial

land,  have fallen by about half or more.  So, too,  have

rentals, and our office space occupancy cost is now lower

than  even  those of Mumbai and Beijing.  The  locational

preferences of multinationals and blue chip names reflect

multi-dimensional  decision processes, including  quality

of life and quality of infrastructure.  Land cost is only

one   of  these  factors.   For  this  reason,  while   I

appreciate the difficulty of obtaining data, every effort

should  be  made  to  derive, as the  ERC  Workgroup  has

proposed,  authenticated value added  per  land  area  by

sector,  taking  into  account  the  entire  package   of

interests and liabilities that go with the land for  more

accurate cost comparisons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While high land costs will make us uncompetitive,

there  is  also an opposite danger that an oversupply  of

land,  and  thus built-up space, is a waste  of  valuable

economic resources.  For instance, island-wide, there are

currently  more  than 43 million square  feet  of  vacant

industrial  space  and about 11 million  square  feet  of

vacant  office space. This amount of vacant office  space

is  nearly  three times the amount of space proposed  for

the  Business  Financial Centre and  enough  to  fill  12

Republic Plazas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a knowledge-based economy and with recent changes

to  the  land  use groups in the Master  Plan  2003,  the

distinction between office and industrial space and  even

residential  space will become increasingly blurred  with

the  proliferation of business parks, home offices, live-work,  high-tech  industrial space, etc,  including  One-North.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is how would his

Ministry  track  the  supply and demand  for  office  and

industrial space which impinges on the Government's  land

sales programme, so as to avoid large

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>

volatilities in the market as the traditional definitions

of  such  spaces have become increasingly  obsolete,  and

there is considerable overlap between the two.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, first of all, let me respond

to Dr Teo Ho Pin's questions on the Master Plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, the Master Plan is reviewed every

five years.  The last review was done in 1998.  What  the

Master  Plan does is to translate the Concept  Plan  2001

into  more  specific land use plans for the medium  term,

and  the Concept Plan 2001, in turn, ensures that we have

enough  land to meet our development needs in the  longer

term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked what has been achieved since the last

Master Plan review in 1998.  Let me just go through  some

of the developments since then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, new towns such as Sengkang and Punggol

were  developed  after the Master Plan  1998.   New  rail

networks such as the North East MRT Line and LRT  systems

in  Bukit Panjang and Sengkang were also established.  As

far  as parks were concerned, there were new parks -  the

Hindhede  Nature  Park  for  one.   Existing  parks  were

redeveloped,   for  example,  West   Coast   Park.    New

commercial  space  at  Novena Square,  Far  East  Square,

Compass  Point  in  Sengkang  and  other  HDB  town   and

neighbourhood centres were built.  New industrial estates

and  business parks such as Woodlands Spectrum and Changi

Business  Park were developed to provide jobs  closer  to

home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about Master Plan 2003? The new Master Plan

will  focus  on two things: (1) enhancing the quality  of

our  living  environment through green  spaces;  and  (2)

reinforcing the identity of familiar places in Singapore.

As for the business community, we will be looking at ways

to  provide  greater flexibility for businesses.   Please

allow me to elaborate.

The  public has given great support for the proposals  in

URA's Parks and Waterbodies Plan - a key part of our plan

to realise our vision of Singapore as a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>

"tropical  city in a garden".  So, Master Plan 2003  will

provide  for  an additional 1,200 hectares of  parks  and

park  connectors.  To give you an idea of what this means

-  1,200  hectares  is equivalent to  something  like  20

Bishan  Parks, or if you consider the existing amount  of

land that we set aside for parkland, it is another 45% of

parkland  for the enjoyment of Singaporeans.    Residents

in  several of our newer towns - Sengkang, Jurong West  - as well as in Woodlands, can look forward to new parks in

their  neighbourhood.   And  for  existing  parks,   like

Labrador and Pasir Ris, we will be extending them.

<br>11.30 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, unexplored areas, like the central

catchment, will be opened up for recreational activities.

There will be plans for canopy walk, an observation tower

and  more  hiking  trails and boardingwalks.   All  these

plans  will be obviously implemented in conjunction  with

the PUB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recognise and to safeguard our natural heritage,

nature reserves and nature areas will be reflected in the

draft  Master  Plan 2003 for the first  time.   With  all

these  initiatives and programmes in place, there  should

be  no reason for Singaporeans to complain that there  is

nothing to do in Singapore.  Indeed, even now, there  are

some  quite  breathtaking and very  beautiful  places  in

Singapore,  places like Sungei Buloh,  Chek  Java,  Bukit

Timah  Nature  Reserve, Labrador  Park,  and  many  other

places,  which I hope more Singaporeans will  take  their

time to visit and to appreciate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect of this draft Master Plan

2003  is the identity plan.  What the identity plan seeks

to  do is to retain the unique identity of some parts  of

Singapore.   Again, I am pleased to note that  this  plan

has  received  very strong support from  members  of  the

public.   Everyone of us has a favourite building,  park,

or  place  in Singapore where we have enjoyed good  times

with  family and friends.  These physical markers in  our

lives serve to root us in time and space.  We should  not

underestimate their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>

importance  in our ongoing efforts to forge a Singaporean

identity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Master Plan 2003, we intend to preserve both

such   places.   The  identity  plan  goes  beyond   just

retaining  old  buildings.  It also recognises  that  the

existing  community life, the streetscape, the activities

-  all  these  contribute to the identity, character  and

colour   of  the  place.   MND  is  supportive   of   the

recommendations   to  conserve   about   600   additional

buildings,  or  about  10%,  of  the  existing  stock  of

conservation buildings.  There are four key nodes of  the

identity  plan,  namely, Balestier, Jalan Besar,  Tanjong

Katong and Joo Chiat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to bear in mind that there is a limit

to  conservation.   Much  as we  want  to  conserve  many

buildings and areas, this cannot, and should not, be  the

overriding consideration when we plan for Singapore.   We

live  on  a small island with many competing land  needs.

So  land use planning is always a fine balancing act with

many  trade-offs  to be made.  Do we conserve  or  do  we

sacrifice  some  infrastructure  that  is  important  for

economic  growth?   Do  we  conserve  and  diminish   the

economic value of some pieces of property?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Library, for instance, many

Singaporeans  have  asked  for  its  conservation.   But,

unfortunately, it has to be relocated because of the need

for  a new road and tunnel system in the area which  will

allow  our city to grow.  More recently, there were calls

for  the Portsdown Road area to be kept as it is.  Again,

it  has  to  be  disturbed because there  is  a  need  to

construct a vital road link through the area.  We can  of

course try to mitigate the effects of these developments,

and we will.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMU and the National Library Board are exploring

ways  to  capture  the  memory of the  existing  National

Library.  JTC is trying to relocate the popular cold  bar

restaurant  to somewhere nearby.  But while  we  seek  to

preserve memories

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>

and  identity, it is not possible to conserve  everything

and freeze our growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members, like Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mdm Yu-Foo, Mdm

Cynthia Phua, have commented that we need to improve  the

accessibility   of  jobs  to  homes.   Mdm   Yu-Foo,   in

particular, asked whether we can find ways and  means  to

increase  the  vibrancy of our city, to turn  it  from  a

boring and so-so city into a wild city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> WOW City!

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sorry. I heard it wrongly. While

I  am  afraid that turning Singapore into a WOW city must

be the responsibility of other agencies as well, not only

MND, we will contribute our part to that effort.  I would

also  like to thank Mdm Yu-Foo for the $100 ang pow which

she  has  contributed to the Ministry and  I  hope  that,

after she hears my reply, she will not withdraw it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, HDB does offer a wide range of facilities

for  accessibility.   Facilities,  like  schools,  parks,

polyclinics,  community  centres  and  so  on,  are  well

located  within  our new towns and they are  within  easy

reach  of  residents.   That we  can  do,  and  we  will.

Regional  centres, such as Tampines and Jurong,  will  be

developed  into  an  integrated  live,  work   and   play

environment.     Housing,   shops,   entertainment    and

institutional  developments will be introduced  into  the

Jurong  Regional Centre.  And URA, HDB and SLA will  work

closely  with  grassroots organisations to  allow  vacant

state land that is not needed in the short term to be put

to interim community and recreational use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring jobs closer to homes, the Master Plan 2003

will  safeguard  more  industrial  lands  in  residential

areas,  such as Sengkang, Sembawang, Hougang and Punggol.

New  housing  units will also be introduced in  the  west

region,  as  Dr Amy Khor pointed out.  This  will  be  in

mature  estates,  such as Clementi as well  as  in  newer

ones, such as Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the central area is a major employment centre, we

will also increase

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>

the  number of homes in the central area.  One area where

we  will  do this is in Outram.  URA will be proposing  a

new  high  density residential precinct at Outram.   This

will  capitalise on two very positive attributes of  this

area,  one, the hilly terrain in the area; and, two,  its

internal city location.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support Mrs Yu-Foo's call for us to build a

city  of  excellence.  It is indeed  our  intention.   In

fact,  if  Members  will recall, the URA  some  time  ago

revealed the landmark and gateways plan.  What this  plan

does  is  to earmark certain strategic sites for landmark

developments,  landmark buildings.  We  have  started  to

hold  design  competitions as  a  way  to  draw  new  and

creative  ideas.  For example, for the Duxton Plain  high

density  public housing project, we held an international

design competition in which many international architects

participated in this competition.  I am pleased  to  note

that  the  competition was won by a  local  architectural

firm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add even more buzz to the city, URA plans to

establish a cultural and activity loop around the  Marina

Bay  area.  So if you look at the Marina Bay area  today,

you  will  see the Esplanade, you will see the Fullerton,

the developments along One Fullerton, etc.  We would like

to  develop  that even further around the Marina  Bay  so

that  Singaporeans can look forward to even  more  world-class  attractions to arts and cultural activities  along

the  waterfront and, hopefully, this will  contribute  to

Singapore becoming a WOW city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will selectively increase density of residential

land  around  MRT stations so that more people  can  live

within easy reach of public transport.  This is a concern

of  some  Members  that  we do not  have  a  sufficiently

extensive rail network for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about increase of plot ratio on

public and private lands.  Let me explain, first of  all,

that  when we assign plot ratio to land in Singapore,  we

do  so on the basis of planning objective, and not on who

owns the land, in other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>

words,  not whether it is public or private.   While  the

planners will seek to intensify land use, they also  have

to  be  guided by many other considerations, for example,

technical  considerations.   There  are  tight   controls

imposed  by,  say, flight paths, which need to  be  taken

into  consideration.   And we  also  need  to  take  into

account  the need to maintain the ambience and  character

of certain areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Master Plan Review 1998, there was

already  a  major  review  of land  use  and  development

intensity  and many parcels of land had their plot  ratio

increased.   For  the  Master Plan 2003,  we  will  focus

intensification on undeveloped lands, or  what  we  call,

soft lands, especially those near MRT stations.  This  is

done  with  the  knowledge that it will be sufficient  to

meet our medium term needs for housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on how we can allow greater

flexibility  in land use for businesses.   We  are  in  a

rapidly evolving business environment.  So the ability to

adjust quickly to changing business needs is important to

our  competitiveness.  In this regard,  the  Master  Plan

2003  has incorporated several features that will provide

this greater flexibility for businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on white sites, we propose to allow more uses

within the so-called white sites.  As Members will  know,

the  white site concept was introduced to give developers

greater  flexibility to allow a mix of uses - commercial,

residential, hotel - on such sites.  We will expand  this

new white site zone to allow for other uses as well, such

as  sports and recreation, clean industrial uses and  R&D

facilities.  Secondly, we will introduce new Business One

and Business Two zones (B1, B2 zoning).  Basically, these

new  zonings will also allow industrialists to change the

uses  according  to changing business conditions  without

the need to apply for rezoning of industrial land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether we can allow more

types  of  businesses  to  be  conducted  in  residential

premises.  I remember this was a matter which was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>

also  raised  last  year by several Members.   We  did  a

review  and I am pleased to inform Members of this House,

yes,  we  will allow more uses in residential areas.   My

Ministry  will  be introducing a Home Office  Scheme  for

both HDB and private developments that allows home owners

to  conduct  certain  small scale businesses  from  their

homes within zones that allow for mixed uses.  Under this

scheme  entrepreneurs can operate small scale  businesses

from  their  own  homes without incurring  high  start-up

cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will adopt a negative list approach to kick off

this   scheme.   Uses  that  could  potentially  generate

disturbances, such as noise, pollution and traffic,  will

be excluded.  Examples include retail, maid agencies, car

trading  office,  commercial schools and  food  catering.

Uses  specified in the negative list will not be allowed.

Everything  will be allowed, provided they  satisfy  some

guidelines.     The  negative  list  will  be   regularly

reviewed based on public feedback and I expect that  many

small   businesses,  such  as  professional   consultancy

services,  design  offices, financial  planning  offices,

etc, will benefit from such a scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the premises do not become full-fledged offices and to protect the amenity of the

residential environment, some guidelines will be  put  in

place,  for  example,  the business  activities  must  be

confined  within the premises and the number of employees

will  be  limited.   I hope Members will  understand  why

there  is  a  need  for such rules to be  put  in  place.

Otherwise, those who have bought into these developments,

with the hope of enjoying some peace and quiet, will feel

aggrieved, and rightly so.  My Ministry is now finalising

the  details  of  the  Home Office  Scheme  and  we  will

announce the guidelines to them in the next few months.

<br>11.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take up some Members' comments that

flexibility in some cases can result in undesirable  side

effects, like

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>

increase  in value of land.  Yes, today we do allow  some

ancillary  uses, eg commercial and supporting uses,  such

as  childcare centres, canteens, showrooms,  etc,  within

business zones.  Mdm Cynthia Phua, in fact, asked why  do

we   not   extend   the  allowable  uses  in   industrial

developments  to  other complementary uses,  particularly

today   when  many  industrial  developments  are  under-utilised  or  not  utilised.  Industrial land  developers

have asked that pure office or retail users be allowed to

fill  up  vacant industrial space.  There are  many  such

requests that my Ministry receives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, they appear quite reasonable. Why

do  we  zone land?  Why do we specify that this land  can

only  be  used for this purpose?  If land that was  zoned

industrial  were used for higher value uses, eg,  offices

or  shopping centres, we would soon use up our  stock  of

industrial  land.   The price of industrial  space  would

start  to  escalate,  and  our competitiveness  would  be

affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to zone land specifically to safeguard

sufficient  land  for housing, parks  and  for  community

uses, such as schools and hospitals.  Furthermore, zoning

ensures that uses are compatibly located.  For example, I

am  sure we do not want our residents to live next  to  a

chemical  factory or, suddenly, to find, after they  have

moved into a neighbourhood that, overnight, they have got

a repair workshop next door to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoning is also essential to ensure that the

transport  facilities  can  be  planned  to  match   such

activities.  For example, if we have a factory or part of

a  housing estate suddenly to be converted to a  shopping

centre,  we  can  expect a lot of traffic  congestion  in

these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for all these reasons, I hope Members will

appreciate why URA needs to enforce zoning controls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the draft Master Plan 2003 for the west region

has  been  launched.  This is the first in the series  of

five  regional plans that would be launched over the next

few months for the north, north-east,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>

east  and the central regions.  All these plans  will  be

exhibited.   Before firming up these  plans,  I  hope  to

receive views and suggestions from Members to help us  to

improve our plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the property market. Many

Members  of this House have asked what the Government  is

doing  to  ensure that our land prices do not hinder  our

competitiveness,   particularly   for   commercial    and

industrial land.  Other Members have highlighted that  in

ensuring that Singapore remains cost-competitive,  we  do

not  inadvertently  destabilise the property  market  and

erode  the  asset  values of existing land  and  property

owners.  This House has already discussed industrial land

pricing in detail.  Deputy Prime Minister Lee has already

explained  that  we cannot match the lowest  land  prices

offered  by  our competitors, nor do we need  to  do  so.

But,  the Government will safeguard and ensure that there

is  an  adequate  supply of industrial land  released  to

achieve competitive and stable prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the Government's land release

policy, in particular, for the commercial and residential

sectors.  The Government's objective behind the supply of

land  is  to sustain economic growth.  We will  safeguard

sufficient land over the long term, and we will phase the

release  of  this supply to generate growth.   Prices  of

land  and  properties  will rise and  fall  according  to

economic  conditions.  Our aim is not to control property

prices  in  the  short  term, eg, by  subsidising  it  to

maintain competitiveness when it is high, or boosting  it

when  the  market  is  down  during  economic  downturns.

Rather, it is to ensure a stable property market over the

medium  term.  To achieve this, the Government's strategy

is  to  ensure that there is a sufficient supply of  land

released  to meet the end-users' medium-term  demand  for

space.   With sufficient supply, prices will not escalate

sharply,  and  the market will be more stable.   One  way

that   the  Government  releases  land  is  through   the

Government Land Sales (GLS) programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor commented on the importance of taking

into account all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>

available supply when determining the GLS programme.  Let

me  assure  her  that  MND and URA will  take  this  into

account.   We  do account for all sources of supply  when

planning  for the GLS programme, ie, existing supply  and

supply  in  the pipeline, and those released  by  private

developers as well as Government agencies.  MND and  URA,

together with MOF, MTI and MinLaw, are now studying  ways

to see how we can improve this operating framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise, however, that it is difficult to

determine  demand accurately, as the market  is  dynamic,

and  this  is  the reason why in 2001 we  introduced  the

reserve  list programme.  The reserve list system enables

the GLS programme to be more responsive to market demand.

Sites  will  only  be released for sale  when  developers

apply   for   them.   With  this  approach,   Singapore's

commercial space has remained, by and large, competitive.

As  Dr Amy Khor has pointed out, Singapore is competitive

by  international standards, whether we are talking about

office  or retail space.  Property consultants do regular

surveys  and,  for  office space, we are  ranked  in  the

latest  survey, 35th in the list of global cities in  the

world.  Our office rents, in fact, are cheaper than those

in  Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing and Sydney, even Mumbai,  I  am

told.   As  for retail space, again, property consultants

have  ranked  Singapore 12th in the world.  We  are  more

competitive than cities like Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul and

Tokyo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The office market is, however, currently in a state

of  over-supply mainly because of shrinkage in demand due

to the economic slowdown.  The private residential market

is  more  stable.  Prices fell marginally  last  year  by

1.8%.   But  sentiments in the property market are  still

uncertain.  The Government has, therefore, taken  a  more

cautious  approach towards the commercial and residential

markets,  and  has  not released any  sites  through  the

confirmed  list of the GLS for residential or  commercial

developments  since the end of 2001.   We  also  deferred

plans  to  release a site for the business and  financial

centre  in  the  first half of 2003,  and  tightened  the

controls to ensure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>

that Government agencies build office buildings only when

there  are  no suitable alternatives.  However,  we  have

still  made  sites  available through the  reserve  list.

Despite  the  Government's suspension  of  the  confirmed

list,  interested  parties  have,  to-date,  successfully

applied  to release nine land sale sites.  Eight of  them

have  been  sold, and the tender for the last  site  will

close in the next few days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by restating that Singapore

will  never  be as cheap as some other countries  with  a

large  land  mass.  We cannot compete on property  prices

and rentals alone.  There are serious implications to the

rest  of our economy, if we deliberately depress the true

market value of land.  It is far better to ensure that an

adequate   supply   of  land  is  released   to   achieve

competitive and stable prices.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, as a multi-religious society,

we  must  provide necessary places of worship to  fulfill

the  spiritual needs of Singaporeans.  The  present  open

tendering  system  of allocating land for  our  religious

activities  does  not  provide a  satisfactory  means  to

ensure that places of worship are conveniently located to

serve the needs of Singaporeans.  In fact, some places of

worship  are  located  on remote industrial  sites  where

public access is difficult.  Others are located in  areas

where there is no carpark available, resulting in serious

traffic congestion during religious occasions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to develop a master plan for places of

worship  in  Singapore.   Based  on  the  proportion   of

different  religious groups, we should adopt  a  religion

quota system to allocate land to the respective religious

organisations.  At the same time, efforts must be made to

encourage religious harmony through land use allocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What is the basis of allocating for places of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worship?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What are the measures adopted by URA to promote

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;religious harmony in Singapore through land use

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning? and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) How can URA ensure that places of worship are

easily  accessible to worshippers by public  and  private

transport?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, we have a

fast-aging  population.  Indeed, many Members have raised

issues  relating to the elderly and, to be fair, many  in

the Ministry have paid attention to these areas.  I would

like to add another to the list, and this is to resurface

the  issue  of retirement villages which was  brought  up

before but has not quite taken off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole idea is to allow the elderly to live

together and, from the logistics point of view, this  has

merit because it will allow for care-giving activities to

be  better  organised,  and it will  also  be  easier  to

conceive recreational and safety facilities as well.  But

it  has not quite taken off, because what we have at  the

moment  are some HDB blocks across Singapore and, as  one

of  the social workers said to me, it is a colony of  the

old,  the  frail and the sickly.  We will get  a  funeral

every  other week.  So, it is quite depressing.  We  have

organised the hardware, but not really the software side.

Admittedly,  this is a new concept, and it requires  some

change in mindset.  It also requires time for the idea to

gain acceptance.  That is why people say it is far easier

to  integrate  the  old  with the young,  so  that  their

spirits can be uplifted as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this idea of retirement villages has, in fact,

worked well in other countries, and perhaps we can  learn

some best practices and ideas from them as well.  In some

countries like Thailand, retirement villages are in  fact

set up even through the lure of foreigners.  But I am not

advocating that this should be done for non-Singaporeans.

It is just an idea for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we should move from the concept with just a

cluster of houses, and we should add software to it,  eg,

get it well

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>

managed, get the facilities in.  But, as with all  things

in Singapore, it would need to be spearheaded, championed

and  sponsored.   Perhaps,  to  incentivise  the  private

sector  or, in fact, the VWOs, we need to put  some  real

incentives in it.  One of the main prohibitive  areas  is

land  cost again.  That is why I have directed the  issue

to  MND.   Perhaps  it  could  consider  making  it  more

affordable, so that the whole idea can then take off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what I am saying here is that it remains a good

idea  and we should not allow the lack of success in  the

past to deter it.

12.00 noon

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, three

Budget  debates  ago, I asked the Minister  if  he  would

consider  granting gross floor area (GFA)  exemption  for

space   to  be  set  aside  in  business  and  industrial

complexes for childcare or multi-service centres  as  one

component  of  a  total approach to  creating  a  family-friendly  environment in Singapore. The Minister  thought

that   developers  should  be  willing  to  provide  such

facilities on their own volition, as it would surely  add

to the attractiveness of their developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the ERC report which was released just last

month,   one  of  the  recommendations,  in  the  segment

addressing  land issues, was to grant more GFA exemptions

to   encourage  the  provision  of  communal  areas   for

residential developments and common areas for  commercial

developments, so as to improve the quality of the  living

and  working  environment.  I am therefore encouraged  to

try  my luck at persuading the Minister yet again to make

similar GFA concessions for space set aside, specifically

for   childcare   centres  in  business  and   industrial

complexes,  as  I  cannot think  of  any  better  way  of

improving  the  living and working environment,  than  by

providing   more  on-site  or  near-workplace   childcare

centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childcare arrangement is one of the two most

important factors cited by women

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>

in  enabling  them  to  balance  their  work  and  family

responsibilities.   Apart  from  the  quality   of   care

provided, convenience of location is an important factor.

Best  for  the parents are childcare centres conveniently

sited at a location near to home or a workplace centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, only big companies with large

establishments  would  even consider  having  an  on-site

childcare  centre, as it makes little sense for  a  small

company with a small staff to set up one of its own.  The

economies  of  scale to run such a centre  are  just  not

there  to  make  the  enterprise viable  without  a  huge

subsidy,  something small companies are not in a position

to  undertake, and the number of staff benefit is  small.

In a big industrial or business development, however, the

employees  of many companies sited within such a  complex

would  find  a  childcare  centre,  conveniently  located

somewhere within the complex, most useful and, with their

combined   numbers,   make  the  running   of   such   an

establishment a viable proposition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our on-going efforts to create a family-friendly environment - an important consideration, both

from  the  perspective of our on-going attempts to  boost

our  fertility rate as well as being an integral part  of

the  enhanced working environment that the ERC  seeks  to

make  a reality - I hope that the Minister will give this

proposal consideration this time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the topic of

heavy vehicle parking must have been discussed many times

in  this House.  Nonetheless, in new towns, I would  like

to  see  some flexibility in the policy of heavy  vehicle

parking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In new towns, residents do not have much of an

option  if  he drives a van with a high roof or  a  heavy

prime-mover.  This is because multi-storey  carparks  are

the   norm.   Their  vehicles  just  would  not  get  in.

Moreover,  the new towns are generally further away  from

the  centres of employment.  So, one would empathise with

the frustration felt by many residents who are unable  to

find parking, especially for those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>

who  have  to hit the road early and wind up the  workday

late.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that there are rationally correct

arguments  that such vehicles are meant for business  and

should  not  be used as a mode of transport to  and  from

work or the employers must provide transportation for the

employees.   However, there is a human face  behind  each

problem and, if a solution also lessens business cost  as

well,  so  much  the better.  I hope  we  can  find  some

accommodation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise and safety considerations also merit the

position  that  heavy  vehicles should  be  kept  out  of

residential areas.  Noise and safety considerations  must

be  respected.   However, I hope that the Minister  would

consider allowing the public and private sectors to build

and operate heavy vehicle parks, say, 2-3 kilometres away

from  the  dense  population  centres.  This  way,  heavy

vehicle  drivers can either walk or cycle back and  forth

between their home and the parking space.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our much respected long-term town planning,

land   earmarked  for  facilities  like  light-industrial

estates - and possibly would not be built for some  years

-  could  be temporarily released for such purposes.  The

need  is  more urgent, now that the recent amendments  to

the  Road  Traffic  Act  allow  for  the  possibility  of

enforcement  action on vehicles which are not  parked  in

their statutorily declared sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, island-wide, there are many and adequate

parking lots, but there is a wide disparity between where

the  lots are located and where people live and where the

demand  is.   I hope that in the new towns, the  Minister

would  consider flexibility in the implementation of  the

policy on heavy vehicle parking, and that the plight, and

the  alleviation of the pains and frustrations, of  these

key   players  in  our  logistics  chain  be  taken  into

consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

the Istana, located along

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>

Orchard  Road, is the official residence of the President

of  Singapore  where  he receives  and  entertains  State

guests.   The  office of the President  is  also  at  the

Istana.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire domain of the Istana occupies over 100

acres.    The  Istana  Building,  which  was   known   as

Government House, was completed in 1869. The Building  is

dominated  by  a three-storey 28 metre high tower  block,

and there are two-storey side wings.  There are extensive

grounds  and a nine-hole golf course.  Sri Temasek  is  a

19th  century bungalow which was built in 1869.   It  was

the  Colonial Secretary's residence.  The Villa was built

in  1908,  and is the official residence of the  Aide-de-Camp.   It  later became the Private Secretary's bungalow

in  1916.  Thereafter, in 1958, it became  the  Attorney-General's  house.  It is now used mainly  for  functions.

In  the  past,  the Villa was used to house many  foreign

dignitaries  while they were guests of  the  State  which

included Dr Mahathir, Mr Deng Xiaoping, President Suharto

and Ex-President George Bush.  The Military Guardroom was

built in the early 1900s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a great deal of dignity and pride in

the  office  of  the President.  And we,  citizens,  have

great respect for our President.  I wish only to raise an

important issue about the maximisation of the use of  the

physical  land  space in the Istana.  I do recognise  the

tranquility and the lovely ambience of the Istana.  I  do

hope,  if changes do take place, it would not affect  the

overall ambience of the Istana.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission Statement of National Development is,

and  I  quote,  "To create the best physical  and  living

environment for building a robust economy, a vibrant city

and   cohesive  communities."   The  Ministry's   desired

outcomes  include,  inter alia, a vibrant,  central  area

contributing to a world-class city, sufficient  land  for

development and provision of optimal greenery, parks  and

recreational space for quality living.  In line with  the

desired  outcomes  of the Ministry, my query  is  whether

there  is currently a maximum utilisation of the  grounds

of the Istana.  Would it be better if part of the Istana

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>

were  to be transformed into a public park for the better

utilisation  of the same by the people of Singapore  and,

for visitors to Singapore, as a tourist attraction?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Istana is not open to the public,

except  during the occasions of Istana Open  Houses,  for

instance,  on  New Year's Day, Labour Day, National  Day,

Deepavali,  Chinese  New Year and Hari  Raya  Puasa.  One

would  put  up  a  case  for and recommend  that  such  a

beautiful and tranquil place, which could give  peace  of

mind  and  happiness  to  many in  Singapore,  should  be

enjoyed by more people frequently.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please start wrapping up your speech,

Mr Mohan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> I understand our President

does  not stay at the Istana.  I take it that no  one  in

high  office  stays at night.  If so,  could  we  have  a

portion of Istana converted and used as a beautifully-lit

park  for  Singaporeans to enjoy?  Security measures,  if

any, could always be taken.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Mr Mohan. Mr Mah.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, first of all, in response to

Dr  Teo  Ho  Pin  on  the planning norms  for  places  of

worship.  URA and HDB work together to ensure that  there

is  adequate  land  for places of  worship  to  meet  the

different religious needs of our residents. He asked what

is  the  basis for allocating land.  The number  and  the

distribution of sites for the different places of worship

are  based on planning norms and standards, which are set

not  just  by URA alone but in consultation with  various

authorities,  like the Ministry of Community  Development

and Sports.  The key factors in determining the number of

sites  include the size of the residential population  in

the area, as well as the needs of the different religious

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Places of worship are one of the many community

facilities  that are provided for residents  in  HDB  new

towns.  When HDB plans these new towns, various types  of

religious institutions are catered

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>

for,  and they are distributed throughout the new  towns.

As a result, residents can pursue their own religion in a

place  of worship near their homes, well-served by public

transport  and  a good road network system.   But,  in  a

few  instances,  where land is not so readily  available,

sites are also provided in industrial estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are sites allocated? They are allocated by open

tender.   We  specify the type of religious  institution,

whether  it is church, Chinese or Hindu temple. I believe

that  this is a fair and transparent system.  Apart  from

tender,  we also use the auction system.  As for mosques,

the   sites   for  mosques  are  traditionally  allocated

directly to MUIS, and MUIS will do the development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Dr Teo that my Ministry is

very  mindful of the need to provide adequate  sites  for

places  of worship for the different religious groups  in

Singapore.  For  his information, we are  also  exploring

this  concept  of  community clusters,  where  civic  and

community facilities, such as community clubs and nursing

homes   are   allocated  together  with   one   religious

institution  per cluster. We are trying out this  concept

in  Punggol  21.  Apart from optimising land  use,  these

community  clusters will also serve as a focal  point,  a

gathering point, for residents to interact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fang Ai Lian raised the issue of retirement

villages.   I believe Dr Amy Khor also raised this  issue

earlier  in her cut.  Let me, first of all, say that  the

issue  of retirement villages was deliberated extensively

when  the IMC for the Aging Population met and discussed.

First  of  all, we agreed that our priority was to  allow

for  "aging  in-situ". As I have explained,  we  try  and

provide good facilities so that the elderly can live with

their  families  in places that they are  familiar  with.

Having  said that, of course, yes, there are  also  times

when the elderly may want to live on their own.  For this

reason,  the  HDB  has also provided the  housing  option

known  as  the  studio apartment. Studio apartments  were

originally built as stand-alone blocks. There  were  some

valid concerns

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>

about  having  all  the elderly together  and,  for  this

reason,  we  have  reviewed the situation.   We  will  be

integrating studio apartments in blocks with other 4- and

5-room  residents,  so  that the young  as  well  as  the

elderly  can live together.  This scheme has  been  well-received  and  we will be doing more, as I  explained  to

this House yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there may be demands for other housing options

for  the elderly, such as retirement villages.  If  there

is  such  a  demand  for  a retirement  village,  private

property developers will cater to this demand.  I do  not

think it is the business of Government to step in to meet

this  demand  for  private retirement villages.  We  have

already done so in the case of HDB residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we incentivise it? What we can do is to

make  sure  that the norms, the building guidelines,  the

planning  guidelines  do  not  unnecessarily  impede  the

development  of such retirement villages.  Just  to  give

Members a small example.  A feedback was that some of the

current  planning guidelines for developments in  general

specify  certain  minimum car parking  requirements.   We

have looked at it and we have decided that for retirement

villages, we can relax these guidelines because they  are

not relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I have said, I do not believe that Government

should directly incentivise the development of retirement

villages.   It is best left to the private  sector  as  a

business decision.  One feedback that we have received is

to  provide  land on a shorter tenure.  In  other  words,

instead  of providing land for 99 years, why not  provide

land  for  60 years or even 30 years?  This is  something

that we can consider, and if it is helpful for developers

in  encouraging them to provide retirement villages, then

we  will certainly look into it favourably.  But, as  for

land specifically zoned for retirement villages alone,  I

do  not believe there is any need for such specific  land

use zoning at this point in time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>

<br>12.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee asked whether we will provide bonus

GFA  for space used for childcare centres.  First of all,

may  I  spend  some time to explain why  we  provide  GFA

exemptions  in certain situations.  GFA, or  gross  floor

area,  is something that developers pay for.  They tender

for  it  and they bid on the basis of the specified  GFA.

Having  done  so,  they are allowed  certain  exemptions.

Exemptions  are  selectively granted to  satisfy  certain

planning objectives.  What are these?  For example, there

may  be a need to provide for greater design flexibility,

for  more pedestrian linkage, so there are GFA exemptions

for   covered  public  walkways.   Or  there  may  be   a

requirement to achieve more greenery within developments,

and  so things like planter boxes, sky terraces, etc, are

granted GFA exemption.  But, GFA exemption should not  be

freely used as a tool to achieve every and any objective.

So,  for  example, if there is a need to  provide  social

facilities  like childcare centres, we should be  looking

at  other ways of facilitating such developments,  rather

than look to GFA exemptions as the only way of doing  so.

Because  the moment you start to expand the GFA exemption

list you are, in effect, compromising the planning norms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these other incentives? Perhaps we can

look  at  tax incentives as one possibility.  But,  as  I

said in my reply three years ago, I still believe that it

is  important for the market to be allowed to operate  in

this  case.   If  really there is  a  need  for,  say,  a

commercial development to have a childcare centre, or any

other family-friendly facility, I believe that developers

should  seriously consider providing for such facilities,

in the same way that it provides other facilities to make

its development more attractive.  I believe that this  is

an  attractive facility and that if there is a  childcare

facility, this would be a plus for that development.  But

this is a decision not for the Government to make, but  a

decision properly left to the developers to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the issue of heavy vehicle parking by

Mr Wee Siew Kim.  This is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>

perennial  problem with developments in HDB estates,  and

many  MPs have approached my Ministry on this.   What  is

the  issue?   The issue really is whether  to  take  into

account  the disamenities - the disturbances,  noise  and

smoke caused to residents - or whether we put more weight

on  the  convenience of the heavy vehicle owners.   There

are heavy vehicle parks located in HDB estates, but where

they are located directly inside HDB estates, we can  get

a  lot of complaints from the residents.  Five o'clock in

the  morning  the vehicles start up and they disturb  the

residents.   In  fact, recently, I have received  several

requests  from  MPs to actually re-locate  heavy  vehicle

parks  outside HDB estates, and we have done so.  So,  we

will  provide  heavy vehicle parks close to HDB  estates,

where  there  is  space available, but we  have  to  also

recognise that heavy vehicles are not meant to be used as

a  personal transport.  They are, in fact, to be used for

businesses.   We will try to accommodate the  demand  for

such  parks on an interim basis, as Mr Wee suggested,  in

certain areas where land is available, where vacant  land

is not required for development in the near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have to recognise that in the longer term,

all  the  heavy vehicle parks, once land is progressively

used up, will have to start to move.  For this reason, we

have  provided  permanent heavy  vehicle  parks  in  many

purpose  built heavy vehicle parks near workplaces,  like

industrial estates in Jurong, Kranji, Senoko, and so  on.

And  when  we do so, the intention is to have  the  heavy

vehicle  owners make their own transport arrangements  to

travel  between  their  home and the  designated  parking

places of their heavy vehicle.  This is, I recognise, not

the  ideal situation.  Ideally, they would prefer to park

their  vehicles  just  next  to  their  flat  but,  as  I

explained,  this  is  not feasible and  it  is  also  not

conducive  to the living environment of the estate.   Let

me just add that there are sufficient parking lots island-wide  for heavy vehicles, and owners and drivers of heavy

vehicles  should  not have problems  securing  a  parking

space for the vehicles in these areas.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me address Mr Chandra Mohan's cut

about  the site of the Istana and his proposals.   As  Mr

Chandra Mohan pointed out, the history of the Istana is a

very  colourful and important one.  It was built in 1869.

It  has  housed many, many dignitaries, ranging from  the

British  Colonial Governors, and all our Heads  of  State

since  self-government  and independence.   It  has  also

played host to many important people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Istana site is zoned "Civic and

Community Institution" (CNCI) in the Master Plan.  Should

the Istana grounds be better used, considering that it is

sitting on prime land in the city area?  The Istana is  a

very  important part of our history.  During the Japanese

occupation,  General Yamashita, who was the Commander  of

the  Imperial  Japanese Forces, resided in  it.   So  did

General  Tojo, who was then the Prime Minister of  Japan,

when  he visited Singapore.  Lord Louis Mountbatten,  the

British   Commander-in-Chief,  when  the  Allied   Forces

returned in 1945, lived in it and so did many others,  as

Mr  Mohan  pointed out.  If walls could speak,  it  would

tell  fabulous  tales of Singapore's  past.   Within  the

Istana  grounds  there  are  also  several  buildings  of

significant  architectural and historical interests,  and

two  of  these buildings have been gazetted  as  national

monuments in 1992.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Istana is the official residence of the

President.   This  is  where he receives  and  entertains

State guests.  It is, therefore, a symbol of authority as

the  abode  of  the Head of State.  Due to  its  national

significance, we should consider very seriously before we

shift  it  around  or relook at its  use.   There  was  a

suggestion, in fact, made in the early 60s by Mr Ong  Eng

Guan, who was then the Minister for National Development.

He  suggested that we should free up the land for  public

housing  because,  at  that time, housing  was  in  short

supply and in great demand.  The Government rejected  the

idea  because of the significance of the Istana.  Had  it

done  so,  instead  of  the Istana today,  with  all  the

grounds and all the buildings available, we would have  a

public housing estate, something like

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>

Bukit  Ho Swee, because at that time we were thinking  of

whether  we  should be building flats in  Bukit  Ho  Swee

after the Bukit Ho Swee fire, if Members recall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Istana should not be moved from its present

location,  and there is no pressing need to free  up  the

Istana  land, whether it is for use as a public  park  or

otherwise, because there is sufficient State land in  the

central  area to meet our future development  needs.   As

far  as  park land is concerned, as I have just explained

in  a previous response, we are providing more park land,

more  green  spaces for our residents to enjoy.   Indeed,

currently,  the public can visit the Istana  grounds  and

even  the  buildings  themselves.  There  are  plenty  of

opportunities.   It is open five times a  year,  all  the

festivals  - Chinese New Year, Labour Day, National  Day,

Deepavali, Hari Raya Puasa.  In addition, the  Istana  is

used  for many important State and other large Government

functions,  eg,  the Armed Forces, the Police,  teachers,

nurses, VWOs, community leaders and workers.  So,  it  is

open  for use by members of the public and I am sure that

members  of  the  public have enjoyed the Istana  grounds

during  these  times.  The Istana is a  crucial  national

symbol  for Singapore, and we would preserve and maintain

it for posterity.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, AVA aims to provide a resilient

supply  of  safe  food to Singaporeans.  With  an  ageing

population and the vulnerability of food-borne  diseases,

we  need  to develop a more water-tight system to control

the  hygiene of food in Singapore.  Today there are  many

reports  on  certain food compounds, such as  Thalidomide

claiming to cause cancer.  Many consumers are confused by

such  reports  and  may  not  know  how  to  take  safety

precautions  to protect their health.  Sir, I  hope  that

AVA can work closely with various Government agencies  to

keep Singaporeans more informed on food safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore imports 90% of our food supply. As such,

we  are heavily dependent on overseas food supply.   This

food

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>

may  sometimes  come  from farms  which  use  pesticides,

growth  hormones or antibiotics harmful to human  beings.

Besides the control of food safety, we must also  have  a

sufficient  supply of food to overcome any food  shortage

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:   What are the key policies in  ensuring  that

Singapore has a resilient supply of food to cope with any

food  shortage situations?  What are the anti-bio threats

to  our  food  supply?  What are the  measures  taken  to

safeguard  our food supply? And, how can we  reduce  food

prices in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I

would  like to add to what Dr Teo Ho Pin has  raised.   I

just  want to be sure that the AVA has adequate resources

to  achieve  the desired outcome of "safe  and  resilient

supply  of  food",  and whether AVA will  look  for  more

diversified food sources which are competitive so that we

can have stable food prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another question is the import of genetically

modified food.  I believe we import them and so I want to

make sure that they are safe for consumption and that AVA

will check them.

<br>12.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the meat that we consume in Singapore

can   be   classified   into  four  categories:   freshly

slaughtered; chilled; frozen; and frozen for many  years.

They differ in price and, of course, in taste too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do people want to pay a high price for the

freshly  slaughtered? Simple!  Because it  is  fresh  and

hence tastes delicious. The moment you taste it, you will

know.  It has a natural taste.  Eating this type of fresh

meat is plain  enjoyment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we eat? There are people who eat in order to

survive.  They  are also people who  eat  as  a  form  of

enjoyment. To the former, it does not matter to them what

they  eat. So long as it is edible and can sustain  life,

it is good enough. But, to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>

the latter, they want to eat the best, the most delicious

and  appealing food, never mind the price!  To them,  the

greatest  enjoyment in life is to have a deliciously  and

well-cooked meal at home or in a restaurant after a  hard

day's  work.  For this purpose, they make sure  that  the

meat served to them is fresh and succulent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people who go to Hong Kong enjoy the food

there.  This is because the Hong Kongers also  insist  on

fresh  meat and vegetables. If the fish is not alive  and

swimming, it will not make it to the table. Meat must  be

fresh, even the chilled one may not qualify. Frozen  meat

is  definitely  out. That is why the food  in  Hong  Kong

always tastes better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the supply of meat in

Singapore.   After the spread of Nipah virus in  Malaysia

some  years ago, one of the two abattoirs  was shut down,

and  the supply of fresh meat was reduced by half.  Ducks

and chickens are no longer permitted to be slaughtered in

the  wet  market. They are now being slaughtered  in  the

authorised  poultry slaughter-houses  the  night  before,

and  supplied to the markets the following  morning.   We

are  not as fortunate as the Hong Kongers, as far as  the

supply  of fresh meat is concerned.   There is a  Teochew

saying, "If you do not have fish, shrimps will do."   So,

with no agricultural resources, we should count ourselves

lucky that we have meat to eat at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that even the only abattoir in Singapore

will  be closed down. If that is the case, then the  best

we  can  get  will be the "Air Pork" which is  Australian

pork  air  flown from Australia to Singapore.  The  price

will certainly be higher, and it will taste as good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is also a rumour that

poultry slaughter-houses will also be closed, because the

import of live chickens and ducks will soon be banned. If

that is the case, then we will not have any more good and

delicious  meat to eat in Singapore.  This  may  well  be

another  reason  for some people to want  to  migrate  to

other countries.  Can the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>

Minister  tell  us whether there is any  truth  in  these

rumours?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, we always

enjoy  a good joke from Prof. Low.  I wish he could  keep

his jokes halal!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I visited an egg farm in Lim Chu Kang and

also  the  AVA  HQ  in  Jurong.   There,  I  learnt  that

Singaporeans consume one million eggs a day, most  of  it

imported  though.  In these days of very health conscious

Singaporeans,   I   wonder   whether   that   is    good.

Nevertheless, I am glad to learn that many of the sources

of  egg  supply  are now run by companies with  Singapore

investments,  although they are overseas.  Food,  we  all

know,  is  of  strategic value,  and  in  these  days  of

terrorism,  including bio-terrorism, one  cannot  be  too

careful about our food supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also learnt that the egg farm I visited is the

only  one in Singapore.  I realise we are short of  land,

but  is one egg farm all that we can afford in Singapore?

I would like the Minister to answer that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a wider issue, Sir, what is the progress of

Singapore's efforts to be less dependent on food imports,

and our move to be more self-sufficient in food supply?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was also very impressed by the work done by

AVA,  specifically on food testing and food  control.   I

saw the growing use of technology at the AVA but also how

crammed the office space was.  Thus, I was glad to  learn

that  the  AVA  will  be moving to  its  new  and  better

premises somewhere in Jurong too.  May I ask the Minister

what  provisions  have  been made  to  meet  the  growing

challenge  of technology in meeting AVA's role, including

coping with genetically modified (GM) food?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, AVA

is  responsible for the inspection of all imported  meat,

seafood,  etc,  to ensure our food hygiene.   Last  year,

there  were  less than 1,000 cases of food  poisoning  in

Singapore.   In  comparison, there were 10,000  cases  of

food poisoning

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>

in  New Zealand, and the number in Europe and the USA was

even  higher.   This  shows that  our  food  hygiene  has

surpassed international standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we visited the AVA office, and we were

very impressed with its  technology and the work attitude

of   the  workers.   They  are  very  impressive  indeed.

However,  I found that their office is too crowded.   Can

the  Minister  provide them with a bigger office, so that

they  have  a better working environment?  Now  that  the

former  HDB  Centre in Bukit Merah is  vacant,  can  some

arrangement be made to move the AVA office there?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the AVA possesses the professional skills and

technologies  which are of  international  standards,  we

should  encourage them to make use of their expertise  to

establish a regional testing centre so as to go  regional

and  even global.  At the moment,  AVA has a staff of 800

and  their annual expenditure is $70 million.  Apart from

the  $20-odd  million  revenue  collected  from  services

provided,  they   still need about $40 million  to  cover

their  activities and operational costs.  If we can allow

AVA  to provide their professional services on a regional

or  international basis, it would have derived revenue on

its  own,  and  we  can  cut down on  dependency  on  the

Government.  With a steady source of income coming in, we

can avoid  retrenchment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more and more of our food imports are coming

from  China,  like  vegetables,  meat  and  canned  food.

Recently,  some of our enterprises like the  pig  farmers

have gone to Qingdao, China,  to set up pig farms. At the

moment, they are having some 50,000 pigs there.  Once the

pigs  are slaughtered, they can be exported to Singapore.

But  the businessmen do not have  confidence in the  food

testing  facilities over there, and whether  or  not  the

import  will  be  approved  by the  health  authority  in

Singapore.  If AVA can join up with the ICQ of  China  to

set  up a testing centre in China, it will clear all  the

doubts  of our pig farmers there. Our entrepreneurs  will

then have more confidence to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>

go  overseas to invest in pig farming, and the food price

here  can  then be lowered.  This will certainly  benefit

our  consumers  here.  I  hope  that  the  Minister  will

consider this.  I have sounded out this idea to  the  CEO

and  senior  officials of AVA, and they are  enthusiastic

towards it.  They have the entrepreneurial spirit but the

Ministry of Finance does not support this idea.  Can  the

Minister for National Development take up the matter with

the Minister for Finance?

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I would like to ask three

questions  about  farming.   First,  what  are  the   key

policies  supporting the farming industry  in  Singapore?

Second,  what are the key incentives available to attract

investors in the farming industry?  Third, can URA  allow

more flexibility to allow integrated uses of agricultural

land?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second cut is on the Building and Construction

Authority  (BCA).   The BCA was formed to  spearhead  the

construction  industry in Singapore.  Its mission  is  to

develop   an   advanced   and  competitive   construction

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, the construction industry still faces

many  problems and suffers from an image problem.  It  is

flooded  with  problems  of  poor  quality  work,  unfair

business  practices, unprofessional conduct and  lack  of

innovation.  Despite all the quality schemes and  awards,

we  have  failed  to  develop  a  quality  culture  among

building  practitioners.  We need to restructure  BCA  to

focus  its  efforts to upgrade the construction industry.

Self-regulation  will  never  work  in  the  construction

industry.   We  need rules and regulations to  provide  a

total approach to improve business practices and increase

the  quality  of  our  buildings.  We  need  a  top  down

approach   where  authorities  would  guide   developers,

consultants and contractors to work jointly as a team  to

produce  quality  buildings for  users.   Without  strong

commitment from the Government, the construction industry

will  remain a dirty and dangerous industry.  In the last

Committee of Supply, the Minister mentioned about forming

an international advisory

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>

committee  for  the construction industry.   I  hope  the

Minister  can  update the House on the progress  of  this

committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask three questions on this cut. What

are the key achievements of BCA in upgrading our building

industry?  What is the output of the R&D efforts of  BCA?

Are  there plans to corporatise BCA, and what are the key

performance indicators of BCA?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on CoreNet. I have three

questions   to  ask.   First,  what  is  the  status   of

development of the CoreNet system and how much  has  been

spent   on   CoreNet?    Second,   what   percentage   of

construction   related   firms,  architects,   engineers,

quantity  surveyors and contractors have adopted CoreNet?

Third, has CoreNet increased the cost of business?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It will be good if Members can follow

Dr Teo's example.  Dr Amy Khor.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I have one question, but

it has got a preamble

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I acknowledge that bringing up the plight of

our  local  contractors may sound like a  broken  record.

Nonetheless, however low the productivity of this sector,

it  is  still a contributor to our GDP, with  probably  a

large number of SMEs struggling to cope with the shrunken

demand for construction services.  On the positive  side,

the   value   of  construction  exports  by   our   local

contractors has also shown some increase in the last  two

years,  contributing to our efforts to expand our  second

wing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many contractors have gone bankrupt due to the

economic  slowdown.  Feedback from these  contractors  is

that  whilst many of the policies implemented by the  BCA

and other relevant authorities are well intentioned, some

can be more flexible to alleviate the problems they face.

For  instance,  whilst the BCA Contractors'  Registration

System is to ensure minimum standards, there needs to  be

some  leeway given to contractors, most of whom have  had

to downsize in such difficult times.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These contractors find that it is not practical to

keep a large pool of professional staff resulting in high

overheads  when jobs are scarce.  But their grading  will

be  jeopardised if they were to reduce their professional

staff  strength.  Moreover, due to the scarcity  of  jobs

and  the  desire by some to maintain their grading,  they

engage  in  price wars with bids often below cost.   This

had  led  to the failure of many firms.  Those  who  have

been  inactive  in the last few years have  likewise  had

their registration downgraded, with the result that  they

will  then be barred from tendering for the larger public

sector  projects.  Getting downgraded also does not  help

them in their attempts to venture overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent introduction of e-bidding which allows

the  number  of  lowest bidders to bid again  every  five

minutes  until  all  except one are  eliminated  is  also

squeezing their already low margins.  Undoubtedly, it  is

a very efficient system but brutal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new multi-skilling requirement of foreign

workers  would  also, in the short term, further  squeeze

their   already   razor-thin  margins  to   begin   with.

Furthermore,  contractors note that it  is  difficult  to

improve productivity in the sector as they face an uphill

task  trying  to  attract local workers to  work  in  the

industry,  whilst  foreign  workers  can  only  work   in

Singapore  for  a fixed number of years.  To  corroborate

what   the  Minister  for  Manpower  said  yesterday,   a

contractor told me that, recently, he advertised for  two

lorry drivers.  There were many applicants but no takers,

because all the applicants were Singaporeans and did  not

want  to  work 28 days a month.  Moreover, he added  that

margins are so thin, and he would not be able to continue

business without hiring some foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further noted that conditions are so tough, many

contractors  now  feel  that with all  these  regulations

imposed by the Government,  well-intentioned no doubt, it

is  as if they are being pushed to what they say pai  tui

tiou  lou, ie, queue up to commit suicide.  In fact, most

recently, the contractor for our own CC also went bust,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>

and we had to get another contractor to finish the work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully understand the undesirable consequences of

over reliance on foreign workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Khor, your one question is pretty

long!

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sorry. I am coming to the

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Singaporeans gripe that

foreign   talents  are  taking  their  jobs   away,   but

Singaporean  businesses are actually griping  that  there

are  no  Singaporeans to work for them.  In sum, I  would

therefore  like to urge the relevant authorities  to  re-evaluate  the various policies that have been imposed  on

local   contractors  to  see  if  their  plight  can   be

alleviated.  Otherwise, our local contractors will become

extinct.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a pretty long sum! Mr Yeo Guat

Kwang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, one of the top five

complaints the Consumers Association of Singapore  (CASE)

receives  is against renovation contractors.  The  claims

relate  to  defective works, unscrupulous  sales  tactics

like  not  giving a breakdown of the work to  be  carried

out,  over-charging and unsatisfactory service  resulting

in bad workmanship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that HDB has an approved list of

contractors.  But the list in itself does not guarantee a

high  standard  of  service  of  HDB-approved  renovation

contractors.   I  would  like to  ask  the  Minister  for

National Development the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the basis for approving the list of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contractors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How does HDB monitor the contractors on the list

after they have been approved?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will the HDB consider doing more to ensure the

improvement  in  service standards of all the  renovation

contractors and enhance transparency in renovation deals,

so as to protect the consumers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Does the BCA play a role in this area?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the Land Titles (Strata) Act

governs  the  management of strata title developments  in

Singapore.   However,  many purchasers  of  strata  title

developments  do  not understand the  Act  and  also  the

concept  of communal living.  As a result, many  disputes

have  arisen  over the years among subsidiary proprietors

concerning  the management of strata title  developments.

This  problem is further compounded when there is a mixed

development   comprising   commercial   and   residential

developments.  The limitations of the Act have  also  led

to  a  lack  of  transparency and poor  management,  thus

causing many subsidiary proprietors to be unhappy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Will the Act be amended to cater to the needs

of  different  subsidiary  proprietors  in  strata  title

developments?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How can we ensure good corporate governance of

management corporations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Are there plans to improve the professional

management of strata title developments?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I have three questions

to ask the Minister to consider when reviewing the Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As long as they are short.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Firstly, share value. The

existing COB's guidelines for share values have  been  in

use  for  more  than  20 years.  To overcome  the  common

complaint of home owners that they have to bear the  same

amount of maintenance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>

charge, even though their unit is much smaller, it  would

be   better  to  refine  the  floor  area  groupings   by

incorporating  more bands than to leave the  share  value

allotment  entirely to the developer.  Having  a  set  of

guidelines  would  provide some level  of  certainty  and

transparency to both buyers and sellers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the role of managing agents. Unlike the

more  popular and perceived "sexy" professions,  say,  in

the  financial  or legal sector, there is no  legislation

governing the minimum standards of professional  property

managers.  While SPRING Singapore has published a set  of

guidelines  on  the appointment of managing  agents,  the

performance  standards  required  of  them   still   need

articulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to ensure that management personnel

employed by the managing agents possess the proper  skill

sets  and  qualifications, I would like the  Minister  to

consider  a system of accreditation for managing  agents.

This is to be developed with inputs from the professional

organisations and practising property managers.  I do not

think  that  accreditation, in this  instance,  could  be

viewed  as interventionist, because it is in the interest

of the home owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the role of the Strata Titles Board. Sir, I

would like to ask the Minister to consider enlarging  the

role  of the Strata Titles Board.  Presently, the  Strata

Titles  Board  is empowered to consider only  14  matters

under  its  jurisdiction.   It  is  suggested  that   the

jurisdiction of the Strata Titles Board could be  widened

to   deal  with  conflicts  relating  to  management  and

operation, so that the parties need not resort  to  court

proceedings.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, my concerns are as follows.

I  would  like to strongly call for a separate management

corporation for the different and diverse unit owners  in

a  mixed development.  Presently, all the different types

of  unit  owners  in a mixed development  belong  to  one

management    corporation.    For    complex    mixed-use

development,   it   is  difficult  for   one   management

corporation  to accommodate the different and conflicting

needs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>

of  the different user groups.  For example, the high car

park  charges  would be welcomed by the residents  as  it

would  mean more income for the maintenace of the  common

property.   However, for the commercial units,  high  car

park charges mean less customers coming in to the shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we seek to review the Land Titles (Strata) Act

(LTSA), some of the issues are more fundamental, ie, they

arise at the time the strata is subdivided and not at the

time  of management, for example, the sharing of the  car

park  between  the residential users and  the  commercial

users.   If  the  car  parks  for  the  residential   and

commercial users are clearly and physically separated  at

strata  subdivision level, ie, clearly defined,  the  car

park  can  then  be  separately  managed  once  the  LTSA

considers  multi-management corporations  for  the  mixed

developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am requesting the relevant authorities, while

reviewing the LTSA, to take the opportunity to review the

strata  subdivision guidelines under the URA  too.   This

will  ensure that the review of the LTSA is thorough  and

resolve some management issues of the strata property  at

source.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the National

Parks  Board  manages some 287 parks and a million  trees

all  over  Singapore.  The public parks  in  HDB  estates

particularly have provided the residents with a sense  of

serenity and a place to relax in.  However, the Authority

can  further  improve the facilities of  these  parks  by

providing more car parks, food kiosks, public toilets and

exercise corners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Adopt-a-Park" scheme has been well supported by

many  schools in the neighbourhood.  This is a very  good

concept.  More schools and civil organisations should  be

encouraged to adopt the parks near their vicinity  so  as

to  promote  a sense of identity with these  parks.   One

other  thing that warrants our attention is the  security

measures.  The Bukit Gombak GROs had formed a Park  Watch

Group  to further enhance the security at the Bukit Batok

Nature Park.  But we need money.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>

Perhaps,  the Ministry should initiate a "Park Activities

Endowment Fund" for this purpose. The private sector  can

donate  towards  this fund so that we can provide  better

facilities for the residents.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Sir, it is difficult to talk about

food at lunch time.  That is our task, I guess.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, given its limited land resources, has to

import  most  of its food requirements.  It is  therefore

imperative  that we ensure that our external  sources  of

food  supply  are stable and resilient.  In a  time  like

this,  I  think it is equally important that our  imports

meet  Singapore's stringent food safety  standards.   The

AVA adopts a strategy of diversifying our food sources so

that  our  food  traders can quickly turn to  alternative

sources  to  meet any disruption, due to  either  disease

outbreak or even a terrorist act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore imports vegetables from 33

countries, meat from 25 countries, fish from 91 countries

and  fruits from 40 countries.  The AVA will continue  to

seek out new sources of food and by maintaining free  and

open  market  competition among these sources  will  also

help to keep the food prices in check.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AVA organises trade missions and provides

technical  assistance to facilitate overseas ventures  by

Singapore  companies in agriculture and food  production.

Singapore investors have gone into pig farming in  China,

poultry  farming  in  Malaysia, and  fish  processing  in

Vietnam,  Myanmar, Malaysia and Indonesia.  Mr  Ang  Mong

Seng  had  asked if AVA could form a private  company  to

assist  local SMEs who have to set up farms overseas.   I

am  glad  to inform him that the AVA actually established

the  company  in  October  2000  to  provide  consultancy

services  to companies investing overseas on measures  to

assure  food  safety as well as on the use of appropriate

technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to ensure that the food we consume

meets international safety

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>

standards,  the AVA has an integrated food safety  system

which   includes   accreditation   at   source,   product

inspections   and  laboratory  tests.   To  enhance   its

capabilities,  a  new  veterinary public  health  centre,

located at the Agri-Bio Park at Lim Chu Kang, will  start

operations by the middle of this year.  The AVA's testing

capabilities  will be expanded and it  will  include  the

capability to test genetically modified food.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the AVA adheres to the guidelines set up by

the National Genetic Modifications Advisory Committee for

the  safe  import,  release and use of such  products  in

Singapore.  The new centre would also have a level  three

biological safety laboratory to handle the more hazardous

organisms and toxins.  The new centre would also  address

the  concerns  of  both Mr Ang and Mr Zainul  Abidin  for

better working conditions for the staff of AVA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is impossible to predict when and how an act

of  terrorism  involving the deliberate contamination  of

food  may occur.  In the event of such an act, an  Inter-Ministry Committee, coordinated by the Ministry  of  Home

Affairs,   will  be  activated  to  handle  the  threats,

including those involving chemical and biological agents.

If  necessary,  the AVA will play a part in  coordinating

food  recalls  to  prevent the  spread  of  such  agents.

Meanwhile,   the  AVA  has  enhanced  its  vigilance   in

inspection and testing, to look out for tampering of food

products.   In  addition, our food industries  have  also

been made aware of their vulnerabilities and also to take

appropriate   measures   to   prevent   the    deliberate

contamination of their food products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible for Singapore to be self-sufficient in food production. But having said that, we

produce  5%  of  our vegetable needs,  10%  of  our  fish

requirements  and  30%  of  our  egg  requirements.   The

Government's  policy on farming is to  allow  farming  in

Singapore as long as land is available and as long as the

investors  find  it  commercially viable.   The  AVA  has

issued  273  licences for activities such as  vegetables,

fish,  egg  layers  and  cattle farming.   The  AVA  will

continue to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>

provide  assistance to farmers in the form  of  technical

assistance and training in the areas of animal and  plant

disease  control  and prevention.   The  AVA  also  works

closely  with  farmers to develop and  adopt  appropriate

farming technology in order to optimise production.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land zoned as agricultural land is intended for

agricultural  and  agricultural-related  uses   such   as

farming,  processing and the packing  of  farm  products.

The  current guidelines already allow for some  ancillary

uses  to support the main agricultural activities in  the

farms.  For example, small visitor centres, display areas

and  snack bars that are related to the main agricultural

activities   are  allowed.   We  can  consider   allowing

integrated agricultural activities provided the  intended

activity   is   compatible  with  the   farm's   existing

activities  and  will  not impact the  surrounding  farms

adversely.    For   example,  orchid  cultivation   which

requires  the  use  of pesticides would  not  be  allowed

within or near egg layers, as the poor chickens would  be

affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has sought clarifications on the

rumours  about abattoirs being asked to cease operations.

Let me reassure him that there are no plans to close down

the pig abattoirs and the poultry slaughterhouses as they

can  cater  to  consumers like him and  many  others  who

prefer  freshly  slaughtered meat.  These slaughterhouses

will continue to operate as long as they are economically

viable.   It is also not true to say that there  is  only

one  licensed  egg layer farm in Singapore.   While  some

farms  have stopped operations recently, there are  still

five of these egg farms which today meet 30% of our local

demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the cut from Mr Ang Mong Seng

relating to National Parks Board (NParks).  NParks  takes

into account the requirements of all park users.  In this

respect,  it is not just the question of maintaining  the

parks  but also ensuring that other facilities,  such  as

car  parks,  toilets and security measures  that  Mr  Ang

mentioned,  are provided for.  In addition, we  are  also

catering  to an expanding group of park users,  including

the elderly,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>

by   providing  things  like  hand  rails   for   sloping

footpaths, building ramps instead of steps, and providing

coverings over drains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from just physical facilities, we also have to

cater  for  programmes  and activities  within  the  park

itself.   NParks'  role has therefore evolved  from  just

physically  developing  and  maintaining  parks  to  also

meeting   the   social  and  lifestyle   needs   of   all

Singaporeans.   While  the Government  will  continue  to

provide  for the basic maintenance and infrastructure  in

our  parks,  efforts are also being made to increase  the

involvement of the wider community.  An example  of  that

is  the  Adopt-a-Park scheme that Mr Ang  mentioned.   We

believe  that such activities and recreational programmes

will  help  to  encourage bonding and rootedness  amongst

Singaporeans.   Mr  Ang  would be pleased  to  know  that

NParks is in the process of setting up a fund called  the

"Garden   City  Fund"  which  will  support   more   such

activities  in  the  parks.   Specific  details  will  be

announced later this year.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Sir, on behalf of the Minister for National Development,

I  would like to thank the MPs - Dr Teo, Dr Amy Khor,  Mr

Yeo Guat Kwang and Mdm Cynthia Phua - for their questions

and their useful suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo asked about the key achievements of BCA.

Before  I answer this question, I think we need  to  know

the  core  missions of BCA.  There are  two:  first,  BCA

ensures the safety of all buildings in Singapore,  public

as  well  as  private; second, BCA is a promoter  of  the

construction   industry.   Therefore,  Sir,   the   first

achievement  is  that  BCA has  made  buildings  safe  in

Singapore,  like Parliament House is safe,  certified  by

BCA.   And  BCA  has achieved this star with distinction.

Sir,  the second achievement of BCA is that it has worked

with  various  agencies, including MOM and the  Singapore

Contractors'   Association   (SCAL),   to   improve   the

productivity of the industry which, admittedly,  is  low,

but  we are trying to raise the productivity level.   And

these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>

efforts are documented in the Construction 21 Report.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third achievement of BCA has many limbs.

There  are at least three.  I will talk about them.   BCA

has facilitated companies to expand overseas by, firstly,

actively  leading  missions overseas  and  marketing  the

Singapore Inc. brand name.  I am not sure whether Dr  Teo

read  yesterday's Straits Times' business page, page A19.

It  reads, "NeoCorp breaks new ground in Fiji and India."

And  according  to the Managing Director of  NeoCorp,  he

said  he  is  able  to penetrate the  Fijian  and  Indian

markets  against the Australian, New Zealander and  other

MNCs  because,  if  I  may quote  him,  "because  of  the

Singapore brand name."  The Singapore brand name has been

nurtured by all contractors, together with BCA.  So  this

is a significant achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other limb of the achievement is that BCA has

encouraged  and  facilitated  consultants  and  different

companies to form consortiums on overseas projects using,

as  I  just  mentioned, the Singapore Inc. approach.   An

example  is  the very successful housing project  in  the

State  of  Andra  Pradesh in India, and the  Minister  of

State himself led a mission some time, I think, last year

to  seal  the deal.   And BCA brought together a team  of

town    planners,   engineers,   architects,   surveyors,

landscape  architects,  contractors  and  developers  and

together they went as one team and they shared the spoils

among  themselves.   So this is the second  limb  of  the

achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third limb of the achievement is that BCA is a

collecting  agency of all information and it disseminates

the  information to all contractors.  In fact, BCA has  a

resource  centre in Chongqing, China.  In  addition,  the

Minister  himself,  for  example,  actively  sources  for

projects  overseas for the construction  industry.   Last

year, he mounted a mission to different parts of China to

promote the Singapore brand name.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about the progress of the international

advisory board for BCA.  We have not formed it  yet.   We

are  still in the process of looking for a suitable name.

If  he  knows  of  any  suitable  name,  we  welcome  his

suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the R&D efforts of BCA? Sir, there are

many.   A  few  key  ones  are BCA has  promoted  quality

construction.  Admittedly, the quality can  be  improved,

but  BCA  has  made some headway.  BCA has developed  the

CONQUAS  score.   Today, the CONQUAS score  is  a  highly

sought-after score by developers.  Because  with  a  high

CONQUAS  score,  developers can sell their  flats  for  a

higher price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other achievement of R&D is that BCA has

developed   and  facilitated  the  use  of  IT   in   the

construction  industry.   It has developed  the  CoreNet.

The  CoreNet has different layers.  It has an  electronic

plan  submission  layer.   It has  information  retrieval

layer and it has got a plan checking layer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about the progress of CoreNet. I am

pleased to report that, today, 33% of all submissions are

through  CoreNet.  A plan checking system would be  ready

by  2005.   The  first  two layers  are  completed  -  e-submission and e-information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about the start-up cost to the system.

It  is  low  because  it uses existing office  automation

system   -   PCs,  printers,  telephone  lines,  Internet

services.   For those who do not even want to  invest  in

this  small start-up cost, they can go to any of the  six

agencies  -  BCA is one, FFSB, URA - to use  the  e-kiosk

free  of  charge.  There will be a staff stationed  there

who  has been trained by BCA to guide the user to  submit

the  plans  through the e-kiosk free  of  charge.   Total

committed  cost on CoreNet so far is $13  million.   Over

1,500  users  have  registered for e-submission,  another

6,000 for e-information, and the usage of CoreNet is free

of charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other achievement in R&D is that BCA has

developed a system of pre-cast and pre-fab components  in

construction.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>

With  the  assistance  of  a  few  developers,  BCA   has

demonstrated  that pre-cast and pre-fab  construction  is

possible  on  site.   It  is not overly  expensive.   The

initial investments will pay off through long-term  gains

and  you  need  not  have a big project  to  harvest  the

economies  of  scale.   But of  course,  the  bigger  the

project,  the  lower the unit cost.  But even  for  small

developments, like landed terrace houses, pre-casting  is

possible.  I brought the GPC to see a project and I think

they are quite impressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BCA has also facilitated research in environmental

recycling to ensure that waste materials can be  used  on

construction   site.    BCA   has   also    raised    the

professionalism  of  the industry by providing  a  medium

between   the  professionals,  the  academics   and   the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo has suggested a top-down approach - Government leading, sending instructions, guiding. They

(the  industry) prefer a consultation approach.  In fact,

we  are moving away from a prescriptive approach where we

think  we  know everything, or know best, to a system  of

performance-based,  where  we  will  specify  the  design

outcomes  and  the  industry  decides  how  to  go  about

achieving  the outcomes.  Of course, where red  tape  and

bureaucracy exist, we will bulldoze them away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other R&D achievement is the development of the

energy  efficiency  index to promote energy  conservation

within  buildings.  It has also piloted R&D with  NUS  to

eliminate the heat island effect that is building  up  in

some parts of Singapore because of the concentration of a

large number of concrete buildings over a small area.  To

achieve  all  these, there are tax incentives.   Some  of

them   are  the  Local  Enterprise  Technical  Assistance

Scheme,    Innovation   Development   Scheme,    Industry

Productivity  Fund,  etc.  These are  all  available  for

contractors to apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked if there are plans to corporatise BCA.

The  answer  is  a  categorical  no.   BCA  will  not  be

corporatised.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked what are the performance indicators of

BCA.   First, coming back to the core mission,  buildings

continue   to   be  safe.   That  is  a  very   important

performance indicator, and there is no compromise on this

indicator.  Second, MND has set BCA a productivity target

of 1% to 2% over the next few years when all the policies

come  into play.  These are buildable design legislation,

the  multi-skilled workers policy comes into  play  after

2005 and the man-year entitlements.  When all these three

are  fully harvested in the next three years, we will ask

BCA to raise the productivity to between 1% and 2%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo, Dr Amy Khor and Mdm Cynthia Phua have also

raised some suggestions on the proposed amendments to the

LTSA,  in  particular, their views on  how  to  encourage

mixed  use development are very useful.  Because this  is

an  area  where  the practitioner on the ground  and  the

subsidiary  proprietors (SPs) are very concerned.   There

are  many views on how LTSA should be amended.  Different

stakeholders have different perspectives, as Dr Amy  Khor

alluded  to.   Even  the  same  stakeholder  may  hold  a

different perspective at different times.  For example, a

subsidiary  proprietor may not want a  high  share  value

when  it comes to paying maintenance.  But he may want  a

higher  share  value  to  ensure his  voting  rights  for

decisions like collective sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For share allotment, how to allot the share, who to

allot  the  share, is one area we should discuss  at  the

coming forum.  BCA has had a public consultation session.

Not  long ago, we have collated the views and we will put

these  views  for a focused discussion with  experts  and

stakeholders  in April.  The key issues  that  are  under

consideration so far are allotment of share values -  how

to  allot share values, who to allot share values, how to

facilitate mixed use developments in a single development

where  you  have residential, commercial and,  sometimes,

office space.  Then the issue of representation of multi-unit  owners - one or two owners hold majority shares  in

the  condominium.   Also  council  members  who  are   in

arrears, should they be allowed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>

to stand for election in a management corporation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An issue we also want to take is how to

decriminalise some of the offences in the LTSA.  Some  of

the so-called offences are not very serious.  I think  we

want to decriminalise them.  How to ensure good corporate

governance?   Hopefully, the new LTSA,  after  amendment,

will promote good governance.  At the end of the day, the

subsidiary  proprietors  must  take  ownership   of   the

problem.   They must know who to bring into  the  office,

who  to  vote out, what questions to ask and how to  read

the reports, basically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the three MPs are practitioners of LTSA, I would

ask  BCA  to  invite the three MPs to this public  forum.

All  views will be fully ventilated and I expect lots  of

views  from  these three MPs on that day.  The discussion

of  this forum will form the basis for BCA's proposal for

the  LTSA  amendment.   MND has  asked  BCD  to  put  the

amendments  on  the fast track.  MND will move  the  LTSA

amendment in this House some time in the second  half  of

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, BCA is working with SPRING to

review  the  technical reference on  the  performance  of

managing  agents with a view to upgrading it to Singapore

standard.  I am not sure if Dr Amy Khor has gone  through

the  technical  manual in her capacity  as  President  of

SISV.  She has participated in it, I am sure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accreditation of managing agents, I think I would

like  to  leave that at least for now, to the  subsidiary

proprietors and the management corporation who they  want

to  appoint.  There are enough qualified managing  agents

in town for them to select.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Khor asked for a review of the Strata Titles

Board.   I am afraid that comes under the purview of  the

Ministry  of  Law  and I would pass  her  request  to  my

colleague there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked about the need to revise certain

policies in the construction

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>

industry  at  a  time when the industry  is  quite  down.

While  the  industry is down, not because  of  all  these

policies  -  all  these policies are meant  to  help  the

industry sail through this difficult period - the problem

lies  with the low volume of construction because of  the

underlying  economic conditions.   At  the  peak  of  the

construction  industry  boom  in  1997,  the  market  was

dishing out something like S$24.4 billion.  Last year, it

was   something  like  $14  billion.   It  will  probably

stabilise to between $12 billion and $15 billion  in  the

next few years, probably outside $15 billion.  So because

of  a shrunken market, there are just not enough jobs for

the  thousands  of  contractors around.   Therefore,  2-3

years  ago,  BCA decided, together with MOM,  on  how  to

reorganise  the  industry so that  they  will  be  better

prepared to meet this downturn in the first instance  and

better capture a bigger market share in the region in the

near  term because the market here is very limited.   So,

companies   like   Neo   Corporation   has   successfully

penetrated Fiji and India.  Some companies have  gone  to

China and many of them are in Southeast Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new CRS system, the registry system, actually

helps  to  pool the resources of many smaller contractors

together  to become a big contractor.  As experience  has

shown, it is companies like Neo Corporation, a fairly big

contractor,  that are able to leap beyond  the  Singapore

shores  to  the region.  Small contractors are  just  not

possible.  I think it is better that they have  jobs  and

they  work  as  subcontractors to good main  contractors.

Because even if you were to put a small contractor  in  a

big league, when it comes to tender, the small contractor

will  be outbidded by the main contractor anyway.  So  we

actually want to nurture a few good contractors  so  that

they  will be able to stay in Singapore, nurture  in  the

homeland  and  also  move overseas.  We  share  the  main

concern  with Dr Amy Khor and, that is, we want  to  keep

the  industry  and  keep it alive,  and  not  to  see  it

disappear.   We also help the contractors to lower  cost,

for example.  In the past, the levy was quite high.  Some

years ago, we decided to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>

differentiate   skilled  and  unskilled   workers.    For

unskilled  workers,  the levy was $470;  skilled  workers

went  all  the  way  down to a mere $30.   And  this  has

achieved  one  desired outcome, ie, many of  the  workers

have become skilled to capture the low levy.  So, we have

decided  to  go  one step further by making  the  skilled

workers  even more skilled.  We say that if  he  has  one

skill,  maybe he should try for another skill and  become

two-skilled, and we call him a multi-skilled worker.   If

he  is  unskilled, maybe he can learn something to become

skilled.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage companies to do that, we will lower the

levy  for a one-skilled worker to $320.  In other  words,

from  next  year  onwards, all  new  foreign  workers  in

Singapore  will be on two levies.  Existing workers  will

not  be affected.  So, from next year, there will be  two

categories  of new workers - either he is one-skilled  or

two-skilled.   If  he is two-skilled, we  will  call  him

multi-skilled,  the levy is $320.  If he is  one-skilled,

the  levy is $30.  So, these are ways to lower costs  for

the contractors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked if BCA and HDB

regulate  renovation contractors.  BCA does not  regulate

renovators.   HDB  has  a  list  of  approved  renovation

contractors.  The purpose of this list is to ensure  that

renovators do not create any nuisance or do damage to HDB

property  while working in the flats.  This is  necessary

because unauthorised renovation can do structural  damage

to  the entire block of flats, and lives and limbs are at

risk.   HDB  does not control the pricing, work  schedule

and  quality of these renovators.  Such arrangements  are

strictly  private  deals  between  the  lessees  and  the

renovators, because HDB is not privy to the price nor the

scope of work between the lessee and the contractor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Potong Pasir Town Council had written to

HDB in January last year to request that the 29 lifts  in

course, that request was refused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MND has announced that it has selected 62 blocks

for its LUP.  Yet, I notice that all the blocks at Lorong

8,  Toa  Payoh,  on  average, are  older  than  the  ones

selected  for  LUP by at least 10 years.   The  lifts  at

Lorong  8,  Toa Payoh, are about 28 years  old,  and  are

definitely  due for replacement.  The lifts there  should

have  early  priority for the LUP,  but  they  have  been

neglected  by  the MND.  According to HDB  guidelines,  a

lift  is  due for replacement when it is about  25  years

old.  By these guidelines, all the lifts at Lorong 8, Toa

Payoh, should be upgraded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB itself has admitted in a letter to the Town

Council that all the lifts at Lorong 8, Toa Payoh, should

be  upgraded  soon.  Many blocks in the nearby  Kim  Keat

neighbourhood and 10 blocks of flats, ie, Blocks  225  to

234  further up the road at Lorong 8, Toa Payoh, have all

been given their LUP, and yet the lifts at Lorong 8,  Toa

Payoh, in my constituency have been glaringly left out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many residents in Potong Pasir are asking whether

the  LUP at Lorong 8, Toa Payoh shall be made an election

issue  at  the next election.  Many people are  wondering

why  Singaporeans  residing in Opposition  constituencies

should be discriminated against.  Why must they vote  for

the  PAP  candidates at the election before they  can  be

entitled to the benefits

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>

of   the  national  policies?   Do  the  voters  in   the

opposition  wards also not pay taxes?  Do they  also  not

fulfill their National Service liabilities?  Are they not

allowed a free choice to choose the one they want  to  be

in Parliament as their representative?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has written to say that the queue for LUP is

about 4,000, although yesterday the Minister said that it

was  3,500.   At 4,000, if the Potong Pasir Town  Council

were  to  be  last in the queue, it would take  something

like  333 years before it can get upgrading of the lifts,

assuming that it takes one year to complete 12 blocks!

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you wrap up your speech, Mr

Chiam?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, I will be finishing. Sir,

it  would  be a waste of money if the Potong  Pasir  Town

Council were to carry out its LUP and then, suddenly, the

MND  changes its mind and wants to carry out the  LUP  at

Potong  Pasir.  For this reason, I would like to ask  the

Minister to confirm whether the blocks in Lorong  8,  Toa

Payoh,  in the Potong Pasir constituency shall  be  given

the Lift Upgrading Programme within the next two or three

years.  Logically, it is long overdue.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, I want to distinguish

two  issues: the cyclical replacement of lifts on the one

hand, and the Lift Upgrading Programme on the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12 blocks and 29 lifts that Mr Chiam brought up

are   old,   and  some  of  them  are  due  for  cyclical

replacement.   As  far  as  the  Ministry   of   National

Development is concerned, the Town Council should proceed

to  replace  those  lifts  according  to  schedule.   The

question of lift upgrading, whilst it may be related,  is

a separate issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first address Mr Chiam's question about

whether  there will be any wastage of resources,  if  the

lifts  are replaced first, and subsequently undergo  lift

upgrading.   I  have checked with the HDB and  they  have

assured me that all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>

work  done by the Town Council to replace the lifts  will

not  be  wasted, because that same lift cabin  and  shaft

will be used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Lift Upgrading Programme goes far beyond

simply  replacing the lifts.  It will involve,  depending

on  the  configuration of the blocks, either the creation

of  new lift shafts, lift landings, mechanisms, etc.   In

fact,  the  additional cost incurred to do lift upgrading

is  significantly higher than that incurred just for  the

provision of a lift replacement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, we have decided to keep these two

programmes separate.  Lift replacement will be done on  a

cyclical  basis  by  the Town Council using  its  Sinking

Fund,  as  that is the correct position as it should  be.

The  Lift  Upgrading  Programme is a  national  programme

which  will  be  funded by the Government, together  with

contributions  from  the Town Councils  as  well  as  the

residents.   This is a national programme in which  there

are  3,500 blocks in the queue.  At the current rate that

we  are doing lift upgrading, it will not take 300 years.

It  will take something like 15 years before we work  our

way through the queue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be in a position to give Mr Chiam, or any

other  Member for that matter, an exact position  in  the

queue  today.   We  have  announced  the  Lift  Upgrading

Programme  recently,  and those  blocks  that  have  been

announced  will  proceed.  Every year, depending  on  the

budgetary  position of this Government, and on the  needs

and  requirements of the population, we will work through

those 3,500 blocks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say categorically that, as a Government,

we  have  said  that we will look after all Singaporeans,

and  we  will  continue to look after  all  Singaporeans.

However,  it is not possible for Mr Chiam, or  any  other

Member for that matter, to insist that simply because the

lift  is old, his residents must have eligibility or,  in

fact,   must   receive   the  Lift  Upgrading   Programme

immediately.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, are you withdrawing your

amendment?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code TJ 2100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, HDB has liberalised its change of use policy

for its shops.  Shopowners and operators appreciate this.

It shows that the HDB understands the needs of the market

and  is  prepared to let market forces  work.   But  this

understanding is not all encompassing.  The HDB is  still

hesitant  in liberalising the change of use of  shops  to

family  restaurants and eating houses,  and  the  use  of

common spaces for open recreation areas (ORAs).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the concerns of the HDB. But it should

trust  the  market to do its work, even with restaurants,

eating  houses  and ORAs.  With a good transport  system,

the  concern for a good mix of shops is no longer a must.

Consider  Holland Village.  It has become a food  centre,

with  no  loss of functionality to nearby residents.   In

fact, they enjoy the good food.  They hop onto buses  and

trains to buy whatever else they want from other shopping

centres.  They have the best of many worlds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a shop wants to become a food establishment, they

can be made to pay an equalisation fee, as owners of food

shops  have paid more for their shops.  This equalisation

fee  should  not  be  refundable,  if  the  eating  house

business fails and the owner or operator requests  for  a

change  of use to other businesses.  The rental can  also

be  adjusted.  Owners and operators must decide  if  they

are   prepared  to  pay  this  hefty  equalisation   fee,

increased rentals and the renovation cost to change it to

a  food  business.  If they are prepared to do so because

they  really believe that the business is there, then  so

be it.  Thereafter, let competition win, and let the best

man or woman win.  Customers will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>

benefit  from better food, more variety, better  services

and prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with ORAs. ORAs, in fact,

bring life to the place.  ORAs along Orchard Road and  in

the  town  areas  are welcoming sights.  Can  we  imagine

Orchard  Road without the ORAs?  We should  do  the  same

with  ORAs  in  the HDB neighbourhood centres.   What  is

important  is that they are properly managed.  Rules  can

be established and rent can be charged for the use of the

common  areas.   We  should  apply  these  rules  to  all

shophouses  which  want to use the common  areas  outside

their  shops.  They must manage these areas.  These rules

should  be rigorously enforced to ensure that the use  of

the common areas does not turn them into eyesores and  an

obstruction  to  pedestrians.  If they flout  the  rules,

then penalties can be imposed to bring them in line.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, can you start asking your

questions, please?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, we are trying to build a

creative   entrepreneurial  society,   one   that   makes

decisions  for  itself and takes responsibility  for  the

outcome.   In  this spirit, I suggest  that  we  let  our

entrepreneurs and business people decide what  they  want

to  do.  The community and the market shall pass judgment

on their decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as what the business people do is not

dysfunctional  to  the community and market,  the  latter

will  support  them.  Let our business  people  take  the

risks.   They can enjoy the fruits of the right decision.

They  will  pay  for  the mistakes  they  make.   Let  us

regulate the requests of our business people with a light

touch.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, your time is up. Please take

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Although this issue has been

highlighted in this House, our flat owners still  do  not

understand how this problem can happen with our Singapore

brand name.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions are: when we see spalling concrete

after  three  or  five years of owning a  flat,  is  this

natural  deterioration of the concrete slabs?   What  are

the  preventive measures that can be taken by  the  house

owner  to prevent this natural deterioration or to  delay

the  occurrence of this problem?  If there are,  can  HDB

inform  and  educate the existing owners  to  prevent  or

delay  the  occurrence, than simply  ask  the  owners  to

repair  it?  If there are no measures that can be  taken,

would  HDB, being the biggest landowner, carry  out  some

intensive research into this problem?

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, in 1997, the

Hougang  Town Council wrote to the HDB, alerting them  to

the  condition  of  a lamp-post which we  discovered  was

corroded  and  could  pose a danger  to  the  public  and

recommending  to  the HDB to carry out major  replacement

works.  HDB refused to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, we wrote again to the HDB, making the same

recommendation, and HDB again turned it down.   It  asked

the   Town  Council  to  continue  carrying  out  routine

maintenance  works  to  replace lamp-posts  whenever  the

condition warrants it.  HDB also informed us that it  has

no  cyclical maintenance programme for the replacement of

car park lamp-posts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these lamp-posts have been installed more than

15  years ago.  Their condition has deteriorated and  the

HDB  has no plans to replace the lamp-posts.  Is  it  the

intention of the HDB to push the responsibility  to  Town

Councils  to  replace all the lamp-posts eventually  when

they  are all corroded?  Is this fair?  First of all,  it

will  place a heavy burden on the financial resources  of

Hougang  Town  Council.   I  do  not  know  of  PAP  Town

Councils, maybe they are richer and can afford to do  so.

Secondly, is it fair to ask the Town Council to do so  by

using  money  contributed  by the  residents  by  way  of

conservancy charges?  Do not forget, the HDB owns the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>

car  park,  collects  the parking fees  and  pockets  the

money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past years, in the interest of the residents,

Hougang Town Council had no choice but to replace quite a

number  of lamp-posts with corroded base to ensure public

safety  was  not compromised. However, Sir, the  question

really  is:   to  what  extent would  routine  inspection

ensure  100% safety without cyclical replacement  of  the

existing lamp-posts?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hougang Town Council recently conducted a

sampling size of 10 lamp-posts to ascertain their general

condition by digging out the lamp-posts and exposing  the

lamp-posts'  bases buried underground. The result  showed

that all the 10 dug-out lamp-posts have different degrees

of  corrosion around their bases. Although the structural

integrity  of all the 10 dug-out lamp-posts has  not  yet

been  compromised,  the  question  is:  when  would   the

corrosion  set in to the extent that it would  compromise

public safety without cyclical replacement? Does the  HDB

expect  Town  Councils to dig out all the  lamp-posts  to

expose their bases for inspection and then cover them  up

again  every week or every month to ensure that there  is

no  falling lamp-post that will cause a tragedy?  I would

like to know what is the HDB's response to the above.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it is said that the PAP

Government  does not treat all Singaporeans alike.  Those

Singaporeans who reside in Opposition wards  do  not  get

the benefits of the national policies as of right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, residents in Potong Pasir Constituency

could get upgrading of their flats only if they voted for

the  PAP candidate, although some of the flats at  Potong

Pasir  were  definitely due for upgrading.   These  flats

were  about  23 years old at the time of the election  in

1997.   However, the flats of many PAP wards  which  were

much younger than that benefited from upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the election of 2001, the same tactics were used

by the ruling Party.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>

residents at Potong Pasir were told that if they did  not

support the PAP candidate, the North East MRT line  might

not  run  through the Potong Pasir Constituency. When  it

became  clear  that  the North-east MRT  line  would  run

through  Potong Pasir, it was made known by the PAP  that

if   residents  in  Potong  Pasir  did  not  support  its

candidate at the General Election of 2001, the station at

Potong Pasir would not be opened.  It shall only remain a

"box" and trains shall not stop at that station but  only

run  through it. The name of that station would  also  be

called  Sennett  MRT  station and not  Potong  Pasir  MRT

station as many have expected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on, during the heat of the election, the Prime

Minister  himself came to visit Potong Pasir and  made  a

promise  that  the  majority of the residents  at  Potong

Pasir  need not vote for the PAP candidate in  order  for

them to get upgrading.  Any one of the five precincts  in

Potong  Pasir  need only to give the PAP  candidate  more

than   50%  and  that  precinct  would  be  entitled   to

upgrading.  The  private estate, ie, the Sennett  Estate,

would   not   normally  be  entitled  to  the  Government

upgrading.  But if they voted for the PAP candidate, they

would  have  got the upgrading.   As it turned  out,  the

residents there gave the PAP candidate about 51%  of  the

votes.  Thus,  the  Sennett Estate  was  entitled  to  be

upgraded by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that one precinct at Potong Pasir has given its

majority  votes to the PAP candidate, it is  left  to  be

seen  whether  the  Government shall  keep  its  promise.

Initially,    the   Minister   tried   to    shirk    his

responsibility, but now the Prime Minister confirmed that

Sennett  Estate is one of the private estates that  shall

be  included in the upgrading.  I would like to know from

the  Minister when would the upgrading at Sennett  Estate

begin.   And  I  would  ask that the upgrading  programme

includes the alleviation of floods there, the enlargement

of  the roads and repairs of the drains to make sure that

water  do  not stagnate in them but can flow freely,  and

also  the erection of railings to make the monsoon drains

safer.   I  hope that the Government would do  all  these

things, including erecting the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>

signages of the estate and also other works requested  by

the residents there.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, the first question was

from  Dr  Tan Boon Wan.  I share his support for  maximum

flexibility to be exercised wherever possible.  As far as

shopkeepers are concerned, the HDB does allow shopkeepers

to  change the use of their shops, except in cases  where

the  conversion is likely to cause disamenity   to  their

neighbours and to other HDB residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has allowed shops to be converted into

family  restaurants.  I  want to  emphasise  that  family

restaurants are different from eating houses. In the case

of a restaurant, it is managed by a single operator, with

a  single  kitchen.  However, the HDB does not allow  the

change  of use of shophouses into eating houses.   It  is

not a price issue. Eating houses are large, purpose-built

premises  where  the  operators will usually  sublet  the

internal  spaces  to individual stallholders,  and  where

transit  bins  and  high  electrical  loads  have  to  be

provided,  in  order  to ensure the smooth  operation  of

these  premises.   As  the retail  shops  are  very  much

smaller in size, the conversion of such shops into eating

houses  is  very  likely  to cause  disamenity  to  their

neighbours because of heat, noise and smell nuisance  and

because  the premises were not designed for such uses  in

the first place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB does allow Outdoor Refreshment Areas (ORAs) for

eating  houses. The size of an ORA would  depend  on  the

location  of  the  premises and whether  it  would  cause

obstruction  along the walkways, and, in  particular,  on

the  volume of human traffic along those walkways. As far

as  family  restaurants are concerned, HDB will  have  to

evaluate  such  requests on a case-by-case  basis.   But,

obviously,   because  of  the  smaller  scale   of   such

businesses, it would be inappropriate for a large outdoor

refreshment area to be provided for such premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the next question by Mdm Cynthia

Phua  on spalling concrete.  I think Members would recall

that there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>

was a long debate on this issue last year.  She has asked

whether  this is a natural deterioration process after  a

period  of 3-5 years and what are the measures which  can

be  taken to prevent this from happening.  Let me  handle

the latter question first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spalling concrete is a natural process which could

potentially occur in all concrete buildings.  It  is  due

to deterioration, due to a process called carbonation, in

which  corrosion  of steel bars within the  slab  occurs,

followed  by expansion and then cracking and falling  off

of  concrete.   To reduce or minimise the  occurrence  of

spalling  concrete, flat lessees are advised to seal  any

cracks or holes in their flats immediately, as well as to

have  their  flats painted regularly.   A  few  coats  of

quality  paint  will also help slow down the  carbonation

process by minimising the ingress of oxygen, moisture and

carbon   dioxide  into  the  concrete.  Without   oxygen,

moisture  and  carbon  dioxide, the  steel  bars  in  the

concrete will not corrode.  In addition, flat lessees are

also  advised to keep the level of humidity  low  in  wet

areas  such as kitchens, toilets and bathrooms by keeping

the doors, windows and vents open wherever possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the lease, HDB flat owners are responsible for

the  repair  of spalling concrete within the flats.   HDB

flat owners who encounter spalling concrete problems  can

report  to  the HDB branch offices which can  assist  the

flat  owners to investigate the cause of the problem  and

recommend  appropriate remedial action.  For flat  owners

who  have  difficulties  in  finding  a  suitable  repair

contractor on their own, HDB will also assist to  provide

them with a list of repair contractors with whom they can

negotiate the price on a private basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I turn to the first question, which is, what is

the cause.  I think the real question there really is who

is  responsible.  I suspect that is what  she  is  really

after.  I will not do anything here except to quote  what

my  Minister  said previously on spalling  concrete.   He

mentioned two

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>

issues.  The first issue is on the cause of the  spalling

concrete. If the cause of the spalling concrete is due to

the design, as some Members suspected, or alleged, and if

that  can be proven to be so, then obviously it is  HDB's

responsibility  to fix it, either in  the  flat  that  is

currently affected or in future designs.  But if it is  a

matter   of   natural  wear  and  tear  and   a   natural

deterioration process which occur to all buildings,  then

obviously  the  responsibility must  lie  with  the  flat

owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I move on to car parks and, in particular,

corroded lamp-posts.  I listened with great anxiety  when

I  heard Mr Low say that he had noted corroded lamp-posts

as  far back as 1997, and subsequently in the year  2000,

in car parks maintained by Hougang Town Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure if Mr Low is aware, but his Town

Council  has signed a maintenance agreement with the  HDB

to  maintain the car parks, and HDB pays his Town Council

a  monthly  amount,  I think, in excess  of  $22,000,  to

perform  the maintenance of car parks.  In this contract,

an  agreement, which I have a copy of, Schedule  A  lists

the  things  which are supposed to be done  by  the  Town

Council.   It is stated very clearly, around  here,  "the

repair   and   replacement  and  painting  of  lamp-post,

including faded lamp-post numbers and luminaries."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if any corroded lamp-post in a car park

maintained  by  the  Hougang Town Council  leads  to  any

problems  or  loss  of lives and limbs or  property,  the

responsibility and liability will be entirely that of the

Town  Council.  I would strongly suggest that Mr  Low  go

immediately  to rectify all those faults.   If  his  Town

Council feels that it is not able to maintain car  parks,

then,  please  do not enter into an agreement  with  HDB.

The  contract  will  expire at  the  end  of  this  year.

Consider, perhaps, excusing himself and handing over  the

job  to someone else who can do the job more properly and

competently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if his question was who is responsible, my

answer  to  him, unequivocally, is that it  is  his  Town

Council  which is responsible.  And I think in the  light

of recent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>

events,  his Town Council, and indeed all Town  Councils,

better  make sure that they address this problem speedily

and comprehensively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to Mr Chiam's point. I was not sure, at

the  end of his speech, what the real question was.   The

estate upgrading programme in Sennett Estate was approved

by the Ministry of National Development in response to  a

request put up by the Citizens' Consultative Committee of

Potong   Pasir  and,  in  particular,  the  neighbourhood

community  in  Sennett  Estate  itself.    This  is  also

entirely  consistent with the promise made by  the  Prime

Minister before the election. The working committee right

now is working on the details of the upgrading programme.

As  far  as  the  Ministry  of  National  Development  is

concerned, the faster they complete the planning and  the

execution of this upgrading, the better.  We have already

set  aside  funds.   With  the  cooperation  of  all  the

relevant Government agencies to embark on this upgrading,

the  residents of Sennett Estate can look forward  to  an

enhanced   living  environment.   The  key  thing   here,

however,  is  to  make sure that as many people  who  are

living in Sennett Estate as possible get involved in this

process   of   deciding   what   necessary   or   desired

improvements should be made, and then get it executed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Low.

the way the lamp-posts are constructed and installed,  is

there  not a potential problem or a likelihood of falling

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the demand in our hospital services can be over-prescribed by the suppliers themselves. By setting our

public  hospitals into two clusters, it  has  been  noted

that each cluster has taken more efforts to publicise and

woo  as  many referrals and patients to their  respective

clusters.  In other words, they are trying to outdo  each

other.   Is  this not creating unhealthy demands  on  our

healthcare  system?   Sir, as consumers  cannot  exercise

their  sovereignty  in purchasing the appropriate  amount

and  level  of  medical  care in  most  cases,  they  are

invariably dependent on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>

the expert judgement of the providers.  Are our hospitals

and doctors incentivised to effect higher demands for our

healthcare services?  Should our healthcare providers not

be  subjected to the ethical codes of conduct and to  the

audit  of  an  effective watchdog body with a  system  of

checks and balances?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, due to the economic downturn, C class hospital

wards  are  in  great  demand as  patients  opt  for  the

cheapest  beds  to  save  medical  cost.   Of  late,  our

hospitals  have  frequently  run  out  of  these   highly

subsidised   beds  and  have  been  temporarily   putting

patients  up in a higher class ward while waiting  for  C

class  beds  to become available.  Thus, may  I  ask  the

Minister  for  Health whether there should be  a  further

revision  upwards on the availability of  C  class  beds,

which  should form 18% of all hospital beds provided,  by

the year 2010, according to the White Paper on Affordable

Healthcare?   Have we achieved the 18%  target  yet?   In

view  of  the  higher  demand  for  C  class  wards,  are

hospitals deploying more personnel, nurses and doctors to

cope  with  this  increased demand?   Are  doctors  under

pressure  to  discharge patients earlier to make  more  C

class   beds  available?   Are  patients  sent  home   or

transferred  to the community hospitals prematurely?   Is

there  a  system in place to monitor and  check  on  this

possible  unfavourable outcome, because C class wards  in

hospitals are bursting at the seams?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Ministry of Health on another

issue, and that is, what are the extra cautions that have

been  taken  by our hospitals with regard to  the  latest

highly  contagious  atypical pneumonia,  which  had  been

given  a  new  name of Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome

(SARS)?   It has been reported that some of our  hospital

providers  who  looked after the patients with  SARS  had

been  infected.   May I ask how many  of  our  healthcare

providers were affected?  Is there special care given  to

those  hospital  providers exposed to the infection,  but

have not shown any symptoms?  Is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>

Ministry  of  Health  taking  extra  emergency  steps  to

control  the spread of SARS, especially in our hospitals,

and  safeguard  our doctors, nurses and  other  patients?

What has the Ministry done to better inform the public of

SARS?   Is  there any collaboration with other Ministries

to  better  contain the spread of the  disease?   Is  the

Ministry  of  Health taking extra effort to identify  the

causative agent of SARS?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the Minister

has   informed   this   House   that   the   Government's

restructured  hospitals would be run on a  not-for-profit

basis.   This has indeed provided assurance to the public

at  large  that  there  will  not  be  the  typical  pre-occupation with making profits that a commercial  concern

would   have,   which   can   otherwise   undermine   the

Government's   intent   to   make   healthcare   services

affordable  to  all.  Sir, some lingering concerns  still

exist,  for which I seek the Minister's response.   These

revolve  around, firstly, the motivation for cost control

in  order  to ensure overall affordability; and secondly,

the  alignment of interests of medical practitioners with

the hospitals and, ultimately, with the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within the not-for-profit framework, how do

hospitals  control costs, both recurrent in the provision

of  healthcare and in the maintenance of facilities which

are,  to  a  large extent, overheads?  I  realise  it  is

difficult  to  predict patient demands.  But  how  do  we

guard  against  the over-supply of beds  in  restructured

hospitals?  Over-capacity attracts some maintenance cost,

even  if  sections  are  closed.   If  nothing  else,  it

reflects an opportunity cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to echo Dr Lily Neo's sentiments

on the state of the healthcare delivery system today.  We

now  have  two clusters, SingHealth and National  Health,

with  the  respective  complements  of  specialities  and

facilities.   How  much  oversight  is  there,   at   the

strategic planning level, to ensure that there  will  not

be  unnecessary  duplication of capabilities,  or,  worse

still, no spiralling up of manpower cost from the limited

talent pool?  Furthermore, how do hospitals within

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>

each   cluster   operate   within   this   not-for-profit

framework?   How  much  latitude do  they  have  in  cost

control measures?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as restructured hospitals attend to both

subsidised  and  private  patients,  there  is  always  a

nagging  suspicion  that it is run  on  a  not-for-profit

basis  for  the  subsidised patients, but  on  a  totally

commercial one for private patients.  Some even  conclude

that  medical practitioners are remunerated according  to

how  much revenue they can bring in;  in other words, how

many  private patients they see.  In short, many wondered

if  there  is a disincentive to treat subsidised patients

properly.  I am not advocating that the same basis should

be  applied  to  both, but it would  be  useful  for  the

Minister  to explain how doctors are remunerated  at  the

restructured hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, one can argue that the best test of what is

the   right   level  of  subsidy  and  what   constitutes

affordable  healthcare might be to extend the  subvention

to  the  private hospitals.  Generally, private hospitals

contemplate capital expenditure carefully.  They  do  not

have  the luxury of building ahead of demand and can thus

provide   a   useful   benchmark  for  the   restructured

hospitals.   I  would  be interested  in  the  Minister's

response.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Arthur Fong is not present. Dr

Chong Weng Chiew.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, let me

first  declare  my  interest as the CEO  of  Ang  Mo  Kio

Community Hospital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the Minister consider allowing

Medisave  to  be used to pay for domiciliary medical  and

nursing  services, otherwise known as home care services.

Sir,  I  had raised this issue earlier in Parliament  too

and  the  Minister had turned down the request.  I  would

like  to  appeal to MOH to relook into this matter  again

based on the following reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singapore is becoming an ageing

population  and  rising healthcare cost  is  one  of  the

concerns of an ageing population.  Home care is known  to

be one of the ways of curbing rising

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>

healthcare  cost as it would be the alternate  route  for

quite  a  number of patients to hospitalisation, provided

that the illness is one that could be treated at home  by

a  visiting  doctor  and  not requiring  hospitalisation.

Also,  home  care is one that could allow the doctors  in

acute hospitals to send certain patients home earlier  as

the doctors and nurses of the home care team could attend

and  monitor these patients at their homes.  Thus, as you

can  see it, the home care element not only enhances  the

convenience  and  comfort  of  the  patients  and   their

families, it also helps cut down the number and length of

hospitalisations of many patients - all these  equate  to

bringing down healthcare cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, the Minister has cited that Medisave is

one  that prepares us when we get old, to be used  during

in-patient hospitalisation.  I agree with him.   However,

with the changing trend in medical treatment, should  MOH

not be moving along with time too to allow Medisave to be

used in home care?  As pointed out by myself earlier  on,

home  care  would  cut down on health  expenditure,  with

fewer  numbers of hospitalisation and also the length  of

hospitalisation.   Thus,  if  a  patient  could  not  use

Medisave  for home care, what is the point  of  having  a

large  amount in his Medisave and he could not use it  on

what  is  useful to him?  I was previously  a  practicing

medical doctor in a VWO providing home care services.   I

can  tell  the  House that one of the main problems  that

acute   hospitals  and  home  care  providers   face   in

encouraging  patients  to  take  up  home  care  is   the

inability of the patients to fork out cash for  the  home

care services, despite the fact that they have sufficient

Medisave.  If MOH thinks that home care is the way to  go

for an ageing population, which I believe so, and MOH has

funded operators of home care services, then it must also

pave  the  way  by  allowing Medisave to  be  used.   For

otherwise,  those patients who could actually be  treated

at  home would still opt for the more expensive treatment

in  hospital, just simply because they could use Medisave

in  hospitals  and  not  home care.   Thus,  I  urge  the

Ministry to review my suggestion; otherwise we would end

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>

up  with a service that we know is good, but could not be

used.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Today, 90% of the working

population  is  covered under MediShield or  one  of  the

Medisave-approved  insurance schemes.   The  majority  is

covered  under MediShield.  Over the last few years,  MOH

has improved the benefits and features of MediShield.  It

is  important  that the Government continues  to  enhance

MediShield  to  make it relevant and  responsive.   In  a

limited  way,  Sir, MediShield provides portable  medical

coverage  for Singaporeans as long as premiums are  paid,

regardless of employment status.  However, the system  is

not  without  weaknesses.  First, it  principally  covers

only catastrophic illnesses and does not cover general in-patient,    day   surgery   and   specialist   outpatient

treatments.   Now that the ERC has formally endorsed  the

portable  medical  benefit scheme, I wonder  whether  the

Government  will  review  or revamp  MediShield  in  that

direction.  This can be done by widening the coverage and

claim  limit.   If  need be, the premium  for  MediShield

should also be reviewed to facilitate such a move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I am also concerned that more than a quarter

million  of  Singaporeans have opted out  of  MediShield.

What  is  the Government doing to encourage them  to  opt

back  to  the  MediShield scheme?   Will  the  Government

consider making MediShield a compulsory national  medical

insurance scheme so that no Singaporean is left out?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, on the issue of premiums. We know that the

older  we  get, the MediShield premiums we  pay  will  be

higher.  This is not just for MediShield but also for all

kinds  of medical insurances.  In fact, the premiums  are

higher  when  a worker retires than when  he  is  in  the

workforce.   But the older he gets, it is  most  unlikely

that  he  will  be  able to pay for  the  high  expensive

premiums.   I suggest the Government consider introducing

the  "pre-funding"  element to  MediShield   -   let  the

worker pay higher

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>

premium  when  he  is working, so that  by  the  time  he

retires,  he would already have "pre-funded"  his  future

premiums and to continue receiving insurance coverage.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeo, since Dr Warren Lee is not

here, you can go on to your next cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, my next cut is on

healthcare  insurance scheme.  Why is the Government  not

considering  expanding  the scope  of  Medisave  approved

medical insurance schemes?  Medisave should be allowed to

be  used  to  pay  for the premiums of all  portable  and

transferable medical insurance schemes.  In fact, I would

take  the  argument  a step further.  Since  Medisave  is

already  compulsory,  then it should  be  compulsory  for

MediShield  to  be  a  national basic  medical  insurance

scheme  for  all.  It will also be universal and  no  one

would  be  left out, as I have mentioned just now.   More

so, there will be a great pooling of risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I understand that there are weaknesses in an

insurance-based medical coverage system.  It may lead  to

the  buffet syndrome, as we all worry about.   But  since

they  have  already paid for the premium, they  would  do

whatever they like, and get as much as they could.   This

is   why  I  will  prescribe  two  key  features  in  the

compulsory national Medisave insurance scheme, and we can

be sure that it would not be made a buffet for all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it must only cover the basic medical needs.

For those who prefer to have wider coverage, they can use

cash  or other options. Medisave should be used only  for

the basic tier of the coverage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there should be an appropriate level of co-payment to encourage personal responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, if the system is properly constructed and

applied,  it  can lead to universal coverage and  greater

personal   responsibility.   Introducing   a   compulsory

national  Medisave-approved  insurance  scheme  providing

basic medical coverage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>

will be a significant step to greater portability in  our

healthcare  system.  This will significantly enhance  the

well-being  and  provide for the  medical  needs  of  all

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on Medisave, even as the Government considers

the  Medisave-approved insurance schemes, it should  also

constantly  review the criteria for the use of  Medisave.

The  criteria  should be responsive  and  appropriate  to

today's   needs.    Currently,  the  use   of   Medisave,

particularly  for  inpatients, is largely  based  on  the

number  of  hospital days.  However, with the  increasing

popularity  of  day  surgery,  this  criterion  will   be

outdated and irrelevant.  The bottom line is that the use

of  Medisave should be based on medical condition  rather

than  hospital  stay.   I  hope  that  the  Ministry  can

consider all my suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, over the past week,

MOH  has been rather busy with its media blitz to  inform

Singaporeans  about  affordable  healthcare.    We   have

Medisave, MediShield and Medifund to provide that  cover.

The radio advertisement spoke about the importance of the

above  three schemes to make healthcare affordable.    It

said  that  99%  of appeals for Medifund  were  approved.

That  is reassuring indeed.  May I ask the Minister  what

is  the  experience with Medisave and MediShield, whether

they  both  are meeting the needs of average Singaporeans

when  it  comes  to  meeting hospital  bills?   How  have

Singaporeans  coped  with the total  hospital  bill  when

Medisave  and MediShield can only cover partial  cost  of

the   hospital   bill  and  also  for   selected   health

situations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about outpatient charges? From feedback, it is

not cheap.  My own personal experience is that when I got

my finger caught in the door, it cost more than $100 just

for treatment and to visit the specialist.  What more can

MOH  do  to  moderate charges at outpatient clinics,  and

thus make healthcare more affordable?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, very

often, during the meet-the-people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>

sessions,  senior citizens come forward complaining  that

medical  costs  are  too  much for  them  to  bear,  even

choosing to die earlier  if the choice were theirs.  Such

is  the  state  of  affairs on the ground.   It  is  thus

heartening  to know that the Ministry of Health  will  be

revising   Medisave  withdrawal  limits  based   on   the

resources needed, and not hospitalisation days to treat a

medical  condition.   However,  I  am  not  referring  to

surgeries  or hospital days, but outpatient treatment  or

long-term  prescribed medication that can  be  expensive.

Does  a person need to be hospitalised to be able to draw

from his Medisave and MediShield?  The question here  is:

are we too restrictive?  Can more be done in this area?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to step back for a minute and look at the

macro  picture that I am about to paint.  We worry  about

surging ahead in the age of globalisation with its  rapid

technological  and economic change, and  we  tinker  with

ideas  of  remodelling Singapore.  Indeed, such  concerns

are   pertinent.   We  are  doing  our   job.    However,

simultaneously,  we  need  to  grapple  with  demographic

changes  and implications.  Among other things, a  longer

life  expectancy,  the aged, the non-working  population,

out  of  which 88% have not saved enough for  retirement.

They   spend  too  much  on  housing  perhaps,  but  this

realisation will not solve the problem for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, with increased unemployment, the issue

of  medical coverage arises. Those in between jobs  often

do   not   enjoy   medical  benefits.   The   two-pronged

predicament  is  banging on our door  for  effective  and

immediate attention.  On this subject, the Government has

accepted  the  recommendation of the ERC and  intends  to

encourage  companies to provide portable medical  benefit

scheme or the transferable insurance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can we do more besides encouraging the

companies?   We  are not a welfare state  and  I  am  not

suggesting that we try to be one now, just because we are

in  trouble.  However, we are also here because  we  have

made a commitment to the man-in-the-street.  Where do  we

draw  this  line?   When is it a hand-out  and  is  it  a

response of genuine call for help?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob Jurong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, over the last one

year, I have received a number of requests for help  from

residents  in  my  constituency to settle  their  medical

bills.   Those  who  face  great  difficulties  are   the

elderly,  those with long-term illnesses  and  those  who

have  lost their jobs.  Under our system, those  who  are

really  poor and needy can look towards Medifund to  help

them.   But  there  are a number who  are  sandwiched  in

between.   They  are neither poor enough to  fulfill  the

stringent requirements stipulated under the Medifund but,

on the other hand, they cannot afford the existing rates.

One  approach  would be to provide them  with  short-term

financial   assistance  or  loans  or  longer  instalment

payments.  But these are largely temporary measures.   In

the  long  term,  a  fundamental issue  that  has  to  be

addressed  is  what can we do to ensure  that  healthcare

costs remain affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years now, the CPI for healthcare has been

higher than the overall CPI rate. One explanation on  how

to  contain costs is through the presence of two hospital

clusters.   But  to  Singaporeans,  having  two  hospital

clusters  have not helped to reduce costs, as costs  have

continued  to  go  up.  There seems  to  be  problems  of

coordination and economies of scale as well.  The  recent

example  of  different  prices  being  charged  for  non-standard medicines by the polyclinics and hospitals, even

within the same cluster and across clusters, is a case in

point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also public concerns over means

testing.   Means testing is currently used  in  step-down

care  services, those moving from private to restructured

hospitals, and from upper class to lower class  wards  in

the  restructured hospitals.  Recently, the Ministry  has

said  that  it  may  extend  means  testing  to  patients

referred  from  polyclinics to the specialist  outpatient

clinics  in  the  restructured hospitals  as  well.   The

problem with means testing is that the criteria and basis

for it as well as the administrative cost of doing so are

not very clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the following questions to ask of the

Ministry of Health.  What is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>

being  done  to contain healthcare costs and ensure  that

they  remain affordable to Singaporeans?  Secondly,  what

is  the  Ministry  of Health's policy on  means  testing?

What  are the criteria and basis that it intends to  use?

How  will  the Ministry ensure that really needy patients

are   not  denied  access  to  healthcare?    And  before

introducing  means  testing  in  other  areas,  will  the

Ministry  first inform and educate the public widely,  so

that there is no confusion and anxiety?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong Aljunied -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, our healthcare

system is amongst one of the best in the world.  We  have

a  wider  coverage  for  our  population  vis-a-vis  many

countries  in the world.  We have fine-tuned our  system,

including  tweaking and competition, by  introducing  two

clusters of medical providers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, our healthcare expenditure is close

to  4% of our GDP.  However, if we age adjust it to  that

of,  say, the United Kingdom, it would be about  7.2%  of

our GDP.  Hence, if we want to maintain the same level of

healthcare,  in  a  few years' time when  our  demography

reaches that of the UK, we would expect to spend 7.2%  of

our  GDP.   If  we  continue to  raise  the  standard  of

healthcare, the total expenditure will probably  be  much

higher than the 7.2%.  Sir, I would like to know if  this

level of GDP spending  is sustainable in the long run for

our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our population gets older, less people would be

paying  taxes.  So, would our average Singaporeans  still

be  able to afford to pay for their healthcare?  What  is

the  Ministry's measure to make sure that our  healthcare

providers  do their best to contain the cost and  operate

in a cost efficient manner?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concern of other MPs who spoke earlier

about the two clusters and whether they are operating  in

a very cost efficient and cost effective manner.  I think

one  of the problems is probably the cost recovery model,

which  may  not incentivise the operator to be  efficient

because  he  may  just  pass on  the  cost  back  to  the

consumer, the patient and also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>

the  Government who gives him the subsidies.  So, I would

like to urge the Ministry to review the approach for this

cost  recovery,  maybe a  price minus  model   where  the

price  of a service is being fixed and the operator  will

have  to  work backwards in order to recover and to  make

sure  that he is able to provide the service at  a  price

that is affordable to our patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to talk about ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, you do not have much time to

talk about whatever you want to talk about.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong Aljunied -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> I want to talk about competition

in the healthcare service, a point which I will allude to

in my later cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, our Government has given the promise

that  no  one will be denied basic affordable healthcare.

We  are very proud that we have delivered this promise so

far.  I hope we will continue to deliver our promise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, I share the concerns

expressed  by Mdm Halimah Yacob and Dr Ong Seh Hong,  and

also the other Members of this House on healthcare costs.

What  has  the Ministry done to try and reduce healthcare

costs?  I am confident that the Ministry of Health  would

have  seriously considered various avenues  available  to

try  and  reduce or minimise healthcare costs.   However,

many  lower  income, average Singaporeans  and  Singapore

residents  have shown deep concern about the increase  in

and  escalation of healthcare costs.  As the standard  of

healthcare  rises, healthcare costs would  tend  to  rise

also.   Cost of medical equipment, scientific and medical

examination,  professional  and  staff  costs  and  other

expenses  must  inevitably increase as the years  go  by.

What are the positive steps taken by the Ministry to  try

and  reduce healthcare costs?  Do we need such high class

hospitals  like  Singapore  General  Hospital,   National

University Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  as  they

appear  to  reach  almost five-star hotel  status?   What

patients  and  their  families generally  expect  are  as

follows:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A simple, clean and comfortable hospital bed

and hospital surroundings.  Forget about the luxuries and

frills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Caring and kind nurses and doctors and hospital

staff  ready with a smile and words of comfort, confident

and  professional looking to give patients peace of  mind

and some form of happiness whilst in hospital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Does the Ministry have rules and guidelines to

reduce the possibility of resorting to a hasty need to do

too  many  medical  tests on patients,  using  a  lot  of

complex   medical   equipment?   And  medical   equipment

purchased  by  the Ministry may be expensive.   Does  the

health  authority  have,  as  their  goal,  recouping  of

capital    expenditure   as   soon   as   possible    and

expeditiously?  Does the Ministry of Finance  expect  the

Ministry of Health to recoup all or most of the cost  and

be in the black within a time limit, resulting in medical

cost going up and making the patients pay more?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Does the Ministry try to have rules and

guidelines to ensure that specialist doctors are directed

to assist by not charging too high consultancy fees?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Does the Ministry have rules and regulations on

pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment  companies

to  reduce  the  cost  of supply  of  drugs  and  medical

equipment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong Aljunied -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, last year, I raised the

concern  on  the cut-off of the Ministry's means  testing

that  would  result  in only half of the  patients  being

eligible for subsidised healthcare.  I was relieved  when

the   Ministry  implemented  the  means  testing  at  the

community  hospital last year.  It was done in a  gradual

manner  to  phase in the impact.  I commend the  Ministry

for  listening to the people and thank the  Ministry  for

taking appropriate steps to alleviate the concerns of the

people.

Sir,  while I support the underlying principle  of  means

testing,  I  am  still  concerned  about  the  Ministry's

intention  to  set the cut-off at 50% of the  population,

ie, only roughly half of the patients will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>

receive  subsidised healthcare when the means testing  is

kicked  in fully.  This is far too stringent a  level  to

set.    Sir, every Singaporean should be given access  to

affordable healthcare.  By setting the means test cut-off

at  50%, those in between, the not so poor and yet not so

rich,  will  be  deprived of good medical  services  they

could  afford.   Let me elaborate.  For  example,  it  is

common for a husband and wife, both working and with  two

children,  to  earn about a combined salary  of  slightly

more   than  $5,000.   This  will  be  above  the  median

household income and the family will fail the means test.

When the means test is kicked in fully, say, at the acute

hospitals, and the husband is unfortunate that he needs a

bypass  operation  that would cost  $20,000,  the  family

would  have a problem forking out four months'  worth  of

their  total  income either in cash or it will  wipe  out

their  Medisave savings very fast.  This would be a great

burden on average Singaporeans.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with increasing healthcare cost, most

Singaporeans  look  to  the  Government  for   good   and

affordable  medical service.  The Government should  cast

its  net  wider  when  applying healthcare  subsidies  to

Singaporeans.  Sir, I am speaking for the lot who are out

of  the band to qualify for subsidies and yet poor enough

to  be  stressed  by the rising healthcare  cost.   While

means test has not kicked in at the acute hospitals  yet,

most are already anxious about their ability to meet  the

rising costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Ministry to relook at the details of

means testing for the healthcare services and ensure that

the  healthcare subsidies are given to a wider  group  of

Singaporeans so that they are not deprived of  affordable

healthcare.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, Primary Care Partnership Scheme

(PCPS)  is a scheme set up to provide outpatient  medical

services  at polyclinic rates for those who are 65  years

and above and have a per capita income

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>

of  $700  per  month  or less.  May I  ask  the  Minister

whether it is correct to say that, to-date, only 50%,  or

thereabouts, of those eligible have registered  for  this

scheme and, that being the case, is his Ministry planning

to  better  promote this scheme in order to  benefit  the

rest of those who are eligible?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister why is there restriction on

the  type of medical conditions that can be treated under

the scheme?  I find it odd that chronic diseases, such as

hypertension  and  diabetes, are  not  eligible  for  the

scheme as it is chronic diseases like these that are more

prevalent  in the elderly.  They are the ones  that  most

crucially  call  for  good  treatment  and  follow-up  to

prevent   the   complications   which   usually   require

hospitalisation and incur higher healthcare costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing patients with chronic diseases to be cared

for  under  this  scheme will provide  more  convenience,

better  compliance and the achievement of  secondary  and

tertiary prevention of illnesses and problems.  I believe

that  the resultant cost need not be much higher than  by

limiting  such treatment at polyclinics.   The  price  of

medicines can be pegged to polyclinic rates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, with

the   introduction  of  the  PCPS,  many  residents  have

benefited from the scheme.  I am glad that the scheme was

expanded further last year.  I think it has been  a  very

effective and worthwhile scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme, qualified patients no longer need

to  travel  all  the way to Government  polyclinics,  but

instead  they can be treated at any participating private

clinics  near  them,  while paying subsidised  polyclinic

rates.   The best part is that the scheme does  not  cost

the Government any additional subsidy as the same subsidy

would  have been borne by the Government had the patients

gone to the polyclinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it has the benefit of reducing the

queues at the polyclinics as well

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>

as  give  business  to the private  clinics.   Given  the

success  of the scheme, I would like to urge the Minister

to  consider relaxing some of the qualifying criteria  so

that more patients can benefit from this scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, only senior citizens who pass the means

test  and  those  who  are under  public  assistance  can

qualify for the scheme.  I would like to propose that the

scheme   be  extended  to  three  additional  categories.

Firstly,  the non-senior citizens who may pass the  means

test.  These are those in the lower income group and they

would benefit from some savings in the cost of travelling

to  the  polyclinics.   Secondly, for  patients  who  are

handicapped, travelling is always a major task  for  this

group of people, and it would be good if we can save them

the  inconvenience.  Thirdly, patients  who  suffer  from

chronic  diseases  that  require  long-term  and  regular

medication  or  treatment.  These  patients  are  already

suffering  from  critical  illnesses  and  we  can   help

alleviate  their  sufferings by  including  them  in  the

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe these three groups of people deserve some

help.   I  feel that we can afford to open the scheme  to

them because these groups can be clearly defined and they

are  small  in number after all.  They are, in any  case,

most  likely  to  be  patients of Government  polyclinics

already.   If we open the scheme to them, it is  unlikely

to  result in widespread abuse, or a significant increase

in Government subsidy.  Yet, it would undoubtedly benefit

those who really deserve it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be most delighted if the Minister could

consider my suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, primary

healthcare  is  one of the foundations of our  healthcare

system.   Over  the  years, the Ministry  of  Health  has

intensified  and  strengthened  the  primary   healthcare

delivery network. This is indeed commendable.  I would be

grateful if the Minister could update us on the following

matters:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the night polyclinics. I understand that

seven night polyclinics are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>

now  in  operation. What is the response of the residents

to  these night polyclinics?  Does the Ministry intend to

open more such night polyclinics?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry piloted the Primary Care

Partnership Scheme (PCPS) three years ago and extended it

nationwide last year, making it much more convenient  for

the  residents in various parts of Singapore. In view  of

the successful implementation of PCPS, would the Ministry

review its policy on polyclinic development? How many new

polyclinics  are in the pipeline? What is the  Ministry's

guideline  in opening new polyclinics in the  new  towns?

For  example,  I  understand that  Pasir  Ris  Polyclinic

started  operation only one year ago, whereas  Pasir  Ris

New  Town has been developed for quite some time.  I hope

the   Ministry   can  coordinate  the  opening   of   new

polyclinics with the development of new towns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Interim Disability Assistance Programme

for  the  Elderly  (IDAPE).  The scheme was  launched  to

cover   older  Singaporeans  who  are  unable   to   join

ElderShield  due to age limit or pre-existing disability.

This  is  a  good  scheme.   I  want  to  know  how  many

Singaporeans  have benefited from the programme  and  how

does  the Ministry plan to reach out to those who qualify

for the scheme but may not be aware of it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Michael Lim is not present. Dr

Warren Lee is also not present.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I want to

bring to the attention of the Ministry of Health one area

of  high cost which I think we should look into.  At  the

specialist outpatient clinics, when patients go  and  see

these  specialists,  they know the  cost.   If  it  is  a

consultant,  they  know how much to  pay.   If  it  is  a

Registrar,  they know how much to pay.  But  then,  after

the  consultation, a prescription is usually given.   And

it  is  this  prescription that I want to  bring  to  the

attention of the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the drugs that are given to the patients are

very expensive drugs.  For

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>

those  who  suffer  from  heart illness  and  high  blood

pressure, cholesterol raised, the drugs used to treat all

these  conditions  are really very expensive.   Normally,

they  are given a three-month supply of medication  which

is actually a lot.  The cost can be a lot.  Sometimes, it

is  as  much as $500.  So I am suggesting that we  should

advise  the  specialists to give maybe a two-week  supply

first.   If  it  is agreeable, then you  have  a  further

extension  of  the purchase of whatever drugs.   Because,

many a time, some of the patients do not agree with these

drugs.  And I think it is a lot of wastage here.  I  hope

that the Ministry will look into it.  One way perhaps  is

to  ask  the pharmacists to advise the patients maybe  to

just  take a two-week supply first before they resort  to

taking more.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Warren Lee, since we are on the

same amendment, I remember you want to speak.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, one of the problems

that  we  face in the current downturn is when people  go

and   see   a   private  practitioner  and  the   private

practitioner   tells  the  patient  that  a  specialist's

opinion is needed.  Up to now, the practice has been that

if  the  private  practitioner refers the  patient  to  a

restructured  hospital, it becomes a private consultation

with  high  cost.   Usually, this  is  justified  on  the

grounds that, after all, you are choosing to have a named

specialist.   Although I know this has been  a  perennial

problem,  I  would  still  urge  that,  when  a   private

practitioner  refers  a patient to  a  hospital  to  seek

consultation on a given medical discipline, but not  with

the  named specialist in mind, consideration be given for

these referrals to be done at subsidised rates.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Sir, Singapore probably has

one   of  the  highest  cases  of  specialist  outpatient

referrals in the world.  As the population gets more  and

more  educated, our people invariably get  more  informed

about  their  healthcare  needs.   Likewise,  people  are

getting more demands for specialist referrals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, a minor indigestion that could be

treated  with a simple prescription of antacid could  now

result   in  lengthy  and  numerous  medical  tests   and

investigations at patients' demand.  All this  drives  up

healthcare cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cause of this phenomenon would probably be

how  easy  it  is  for polyclinics to make  referrals  to

specialist  outpatient clinics (SOCs) and  the  low  cost

when referrals are made from these clinics.  It is as low

as $21, equivalent to seeing a private GP.  Also, once  a

referral  is  made  to SOC, it is almost  certain  to  be

caught  in  a loop of subsequent referrals for years  and

months.  For most patients, if they are told to come back

for more referrals, most would obediently follow, despite

the  fact that many of these cases could actually be sent

back to GPs or polyclinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state that, while there is no evidence of

abuse,  such a system that we have currently is  an  open

invitation  for abuse.  I am particularly concerned  with

graduating  patients from this loop  of  endless  further

referrals and appointments with the specialists.  At  the

moment,   our  public  specialist  doctors  have   little

guidance  on taking patients out for more future  visits.

Patients themselves would either adhere to future  visits

obediently,  out of ignorance, or simply because  of  the

subsidies  and are not deterred by the cost of subsequent

referrals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, there is a need to regulate the specialist

outpatient  clinics with either a set of new  guidelines,

or  a department housed in the Ministry, to monitor that.

In   Queensland,  Australia,  for  example,   there   are

guidelines  for  SOCs  where  SOCs  must  follow  certain

guidelines  which spell out periodic audits to  ascertain

if  the individuals still require the appointment.  These

guidelines  spell out, amongst other things, the  waiting

time  before a patient gets to see his or her  doctor  as

well.  To ensure the audits are competently carried  out,

the  Audit  Committee comprises peers  from  the  medical

profession.  Currently, we do not have this audit  system

in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the containment of rising medical cost in

Singapore needs a multi-pronged approach.  We must  spare

no effort, including a need to regulate our SOCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head O (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

affordability for healthcare services has become a  major

concern  of many Singaporeans.  This has been highlighted

by  many  Members who spoke earlier and I, too,  share  a

similar  concern.   With the current  economic  downturn,

many  workers  are  retrenched and  a  vast  majority  of

workers also experience wage cuts or a wage freeze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, medical cost has become a major burden on the

ordinary  workers, especially for those who are  affected

by  the  economic  downturn, and  many  Singaporeans  are

facing reality by seeking medical treatment at subsidised

wards.    I  wish  to  ask  the  Minister  whether   more

subsidised wards in Government or restructured  hospitals

would be provided if the situation warrants.  At the same

time,  many  workers have raised their  concerns  to  me.

Many workers who had sought medical treatment provided by

their  employers at non-subsidised rates before could  no

longer   continue  the  same.   They  could   have   been

retrenched

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>

or   retired,  and  could  not  continue  with  the  same

treatment  at  non-subsidised rates.  Would the  Minister

allow  such Singaporeans, who have earlier sought medical

treatment   at   non-subsidised   rates   at   specialist

outpatient  clinics  or wards, to  switch  to  subsidised

specialist outpatient clinics or wards?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, would he consider freezing all healthcare

cost  increases  for  the next two years  for  subsidised

patients?   Or, at least, if cost increase is  necessary,

can it be kept as low as possible?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need a humane approach in dealing with this

human  problem.   This  will go a  long  way  in  further

strengthening  the  bond  between  the  people  and   the

Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir,

the  Ministry of Health has provided Singaporeans with  a

high standard of healthcare comparable to the best in the

world.   This is possible not only because we have access

to  good doctors but also because we have access  to  the

best  in  medical technology and devices.   The  Ministry

must   be  careful  about  putting  in  place  healthcare

policies which will add to healthcare cost.  Some of  its

policies  may have the unintended effect of raising  cost

of healthcare for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One recent policy, ie, the change in the regulation

for  the  control  of medical devices in Singapore,  will

eventually  translate  into higher  healthcare  cost  for

Singaporeans.   The  policy aims to control  the  use  of

medical devices, and medical devices include all products

used   in   healthcare  for  the  diagnosis,  prevention,

monitoring  or  treatment  of illness  or  handicap,  but

exclude  drugs.  The stated aim of the new regulation  is

to  strike  a  balance between ensuring  product  safety,

quality and effectiveness, and providing the public  with

timely access to medical devices.  It further states that

it  will  expedite availability and access of new medical

device  technologies  to  patients,  consumers  and   the

clinical community in Singapore while preventing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>

the  entrance of unsafe and ineffective devices into  the

Singapore market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On paper, it looks fine. But, in reality, what are

its  implications?   The submission format  is  extremely

tedious and onerous and requires substantial data  to  be

submitted. The requirements are even more stringent  than

that   of  FDA  requirements.   If  we  do  follow  these

regulations,  we  will probably become the  most  tightly

regulated  market  in the world for medical  devices.   I

would  advise that this is not one of the things that  we

should  aim to be number one in the world.  We  must  not

follow blindly and make our system the most stringent  of

all  regulations. We do not have a big market and neither

do  we have the resources.  We cannot, and must not,  act

like  the  FDA.  While the manufacturers are prepared  to

spend  tremendous amounts of money and resources  to  get

their  devices accepted in the US or EU market, they  are

not  likely to want to spend significant resources for  a

small market like Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even FDA-approved products and CE-marked products

from EU will be subject to our stringent regulations  and

are  not exempt as well. Feedback from manufacturers  and

distributors  indicate that the Singapore market  is  too

small  and,  if  they  were to be subject  to  all  these

additional  paperwork  and cost, it  will  not  make  any

economic sense for them to bring in some of their medical

products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Ministry, firstly, why do we need

to  change the system? What are the shortcomings  in  the

current system that have resulted in the desire to change

it  to  a  highly tedious and onerous system?  Are  there

medical device failures in the past that have compromised

healthcare  outcomes in Singapore where the manufacturers

have not taken responsibility?  I hope that this is not a

case  of  finding more work to do, so that more  revenues

can be generated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that the new regulation

states  that it will expedite availability and access  of

new medical device

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>

technology  to  patients,  consumers  and  the   clinical

community in Singapore, while preventing the entrance  of

unsafe and ineffective devices into the Singapore market.

However,   does  the  Ministry  or  the  Health  Sciences

Authority  (HSA)  have  the resources  to  perform  these

duties  diligently, professionally and without  delay  in

its  review  process?  I have serious  doubts.   Clinical

data require special in-depth knowledge and also end user

experience which is not available in HSA.  So  I  do  not

believe that HSA has the resources or the ability to view

these  documents  in  a  timely fashion.   Neither  do  I

believe  that  they have the expertise to understand  all

the  technical  data, the clinical data  that  they  have

requested  the manufacturers to submit.  If that  is  the

case,  why  does the HSA want such voluminous amounts  of

data?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Your time is up, Dr Lim. Dr

Chong  Weng Chiew, you have two cuts.  Please  take  them

together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> The ERC has highlighted that

we   could  develop  our  medical  services  further  and

transform Singapore into a medical hub.  On reading that,

I  was  really  wondering what direction should  our  two

largest  clusters of medical services, namely, SingHealth

and  NHG, be heading to.  Would it be to further  enhance

our  medical services to one that is world-class  and  to

attract  patients  from neighbouring countries,  or  even

countries  far away?  Or should they be concentrating  on

providing   basic   affordable   health   services    for

Singaporeans or maybe both, as what they are doing now?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my humble opinion, achieving both is almost

impossible with the limited talent pool in Singapore  and

also the limited resources that the two groups have.   To

be  able to provide world-class medical services and  yet

be  able  to  meet  the basic needs is  like  asking  our

national body-builder to strive for the Olympics  but  to

keep slim to fit into a small-sized T-shirt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a lot of resources of our two clusters

are  spent on meeting world-class medical demands and  we

have achieved

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>

that  in many of our medical services.  Our Heart  Centre

at SGH is perhaps among one of the best in the region and

it  stands  shoulder-to-shoulder among some of  the  best

heart clinics in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in our bid to top the medical

deliverables, some of the hospitals in the  two  clusters

have to pay high wages for top-notch doctors and to equip

the   hospitals  with  the  most  modern  and  up-to-date

equipment  and facilities.  Given the finite  subventions

that  our hospitals receive, the cost of such talent  and

equipment will naturally have to be borne somehow.  It is

either  passed down to consumers and hence the perception

that  the  healthcare  cost is high,  or  some  areas  of

services will have to suffer a reduction in allocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not helpful or healthy for public

misconceptions  to  persist, while our  medical  services

work  very  hard  to give Singaporeans the  best  medical

services there are.  Perhaps, the Minister could  provide

a  clear  direction for the roles the healthcare clusters

should  play  so that they could meet healthcare  demands

adequately.   I  would also like to ask the  Minister  to

study the feasibility of introducing a third cluster that

will  look  into the ERC's recommendation of spearheading

Singapore into providing excellent medical services. This

third  cluster  could  address  the  demand  for  premier

healthcare services, while NHG and SingHealth could focus

on   providing  adequate  basic  healthcare  upon   which

Government subsidies can be applied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I would like to move on to my second

cut.  Under my second cut, I have two points to make. The

first  was  raised earlier on by Dr Lily  Neo  about  the

surge  in  recent requests for C class beds and the  call

for  more  allocations of C class beds in  hospitals.   I

shall  not dwell on that further.  The second point which

I  would  like  to speak on focuses on those Singaporeans

opting  for  higher class of services only  to  find  out

later on how unaffordable they are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to address the growing concerns about

the level of understand-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>

ing  the  public  has on the ability  to  pay  for  their

healthcare cost.  It has become apparent that  a  growing

number of Singaporeans are not too clear on how they  can

go  about paying for their healthcare cost.  I have  seen

reports that the expenditure for more expensive hospital-based services has increased, primarily because they  are

perceived to be of a higher quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of many cases where the next-of-kin, upon

admitting  their loved ones for surgery, would invariably

opt  for a higher class bed.  Many thought that they  are

just  being  filial by giving their loved ones  a  better

class without realising the level of subsidy, or the lack

of  it.  They would later question why the treatment  for

their father or mother is so expensive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the possible reasons for this? In my

humble opinion, the main reason is that there are serious

misconceptions about the quality of healthcare  available

in  the  different wards and in the different  hospitals.

This  is despite the fact that MOH has re-emphasised time

and   again  that  the  level  of  medical  and   nursing

professionalism is irrespective of the class and ward you

stay in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a considerable ignorance on the part

of  the  public  with  regard to the  limit  of  Medisave

coverage,  creating  an  illusion  that  more  money   is

available than there really is, and what it can  be  used

for.   Many also erroneously perceive Medisave  funds  as

frozen  assets and, if unspent, will be retained  by  the

Government.  All  these  misgivings  have  induced   many

Singaporeans to opt for more luxurious services than they

would have consumed otherwise.  This is a serious problem

and  it  could lead to a situation where no funds  remain

for their old age when they are more likely to need it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would therefore like to ask the

Ministry to make greater efforts in embarking on a public

education  exercise to educate the public about potential

healthcare cost and the means through which this cost can

be managed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong Aljunied -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, the Minister for Finance, in

his Budget Statement,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>

announced the introduction of market-testing for non-core

Government  services  this  year,  beginning   with   new

services.   Public sector agencies will  be  required  to

compare  the  cost  of  providing  the  service  in-house

against the price quoted by private sector vendors.  If a

private sector vendor can deliver the service more  cost-effectively, it will be engaged to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an excellent approach to make sure that

we  get  value  for our money.  I urge  the  Ministry  of

Health  to  also consider introducing market  testing  in

healthcare, allowing the private medical providers to bid

for   the   service  in  the  public  healthcare  sector.

Currently,  the two healthcare clusters enjoy  a  captive

market.  They also practise cost-recovery.  It is  almost

like  a monopoly.  There is little incentive for them  to

operate cost effectively as whatever the cost is it  will

be  recovered from the Government subsidy and  topped  up

with the fee payable by the patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not surprising to hear that one could avoid

the   long  queue  at  a  specialist  clinic  to  get   a

consultation at a private clinic for an average  fee  of,

say,  $60-$80.  I believe this is not much different from

the  subventions from MOH to all these specialist clinics

plus  the  fees payable by the patients.  As  an  example

from  overseas,  in  a  comparative  study  between   the

National  Health  Service (NHS) of UK  and  a  non-profit

private  medical service provider, Kaiser Corporation  in

California, it was concluded that Kaiser achieved  better

performance  at roughly the same cost as the NHS  because

of   integration   throughout   the   system,   efficient

management  of hospital use, the benefits of competition,

and greater investment in information technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order for us to become the regional hub of

medical  excellence,  allowing  the  private  sector   to

participate  in  the provision of public healthcare  will

introduce  the  much-needed competition in  this  sector.

This would result in lower healthcare cost to our nation.

I urge the Minister to consider my suggestion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Most of the

Members  of the House have already voiced their  concerns

about  the high cost of Government hospitals. Some of  it

are  due to the clustering section that is occupying  80%

of  the market share of the total hospital services  that

are provided by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would try not to repeat the concerns of the

Members which I support, but I would just like to ask the

Minister  whether occupying 80% of the hospital share  of

the market in Singapore is going to be the long-term view

of  the Government.  And, if so, can the Minister make it

clearly known to the House so that we can be prepared for

the  high cost that we will be expecting in the years  to

come.   When I was looking at the Budget Book, subvention

funds  for restructured hospitals rose from $769  million

in FY 2000 to $1.6 billion for FY 2003, almost double the

amount spent in the year 2000.  If this trend is going to

continue, the House must be prepared for it.  However, if

it  is not going to continue that way, can I suggest that

maybe  we  privatise certain hospitals in  the  clusters,

while  the  Government keeps one or two  large  hospitals

like  the Singapore General Hospital and the NUH together

with  other research facilities?  The Government can then

regulate   the  cost  of  medical  services  of   private

hospitals  through  a subvention fund  and  leave  market

forces to determine which hospital is more cost-efficient

than the other.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Sir,

let  me  thank  all  the Members for raising  issues  and

concerns on keeping healthcare cost affordable. This is a

perennial issue and it must remain the main focus of  our

efforts.  Let me first just give the overall picture  and

after  that,  I  will  go into the  details  of  how  the

Ministry is proceeding to control healthcare cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the overall picture. Healthcare cost went up

by 4% last year.  We must see this in comparison with the

healthcare cost in other countries.  It went up  by  4.6%

in the US and 6.6% in Australia. We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>

cannot avoid healthcare cost going up, because we buy the

same  pharmaceuticals, we buy the same drugs, we use  the

same high quality medical devices, we use the most recent

medical technology, unless Members are serious in  saying

that  we do not progress as much as other countries.   If

we  want to keep up, then I think this is the price  that

we  have to pay.  But what we do is to try and keep  this

cost down as much as possible, while still providing good

quality care to Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite healthcare cost going up by 4% last

year,  our  overall national healthcare expenditure  last

year  accounted for about 3.5% of GDP.  Members will have

noticed that this has gone up compared to previous years.

In  previous years, it was 3%.  The main reason this  has

gone  up  is  because  our  GDP  did  not  increase  very

substantially in the last two years.  The denominator has

gone  down and so our national healthcare cost has  crept

up  to 3.5%.  3.5% is still quite low, compared to 7%-15%

of GDP in other developed countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other parameter that we should be aware of is

that  the average Singaporean household spends only  3.3%

of  the  household expenditure or $120 a month on medical

services,   meaning   the   out-of-pocket   expense    by

Singaporeans is $120 per month.  This is about  the  same

amount  that a household spends on telephone,  pager  and

Internet charges.

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, overall, our healthcare expenditure is not high.

Our  problem  is  that healthcare expenditure  is  not  a

steady  outlay across the population, nor is it a  steady

outlay   throughout  our  lives.   In  fact,   healthcare

expenditure is very lumpy, and comes mainly when we  grow

old.   That is why we have to deal with the lumpiness  of

healthcare  and the incidence during the last 5-10  years

of  our lives. And that is the reason why we need a very,

very sound healthcare financing system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have developed our 3M framework - Medisave, MediShield

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>

and Medifund - over the last 20 years.  This 3M framework

has served us well, but we need to constantly adapt it so

as  to meet our future needs.  There are two main reasons

for this.  First, our population is ageing.  Today, 7% of

our  population is aged 65 years and above.  This  number

will  increase  to 19% by the year 2030.   We  know  that

healthcare expenditure for an elderly person is between 3-4  times higher than that for a younger person.   So,  as

the  society ages, we can expect the national  healthcare

expenditure to increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second trend is that our economic growth is

likely  to  slow down.  We managed an economic growth  of

7.3%  per  year in the last 15 years.  We could therefore

afford  to spend more on healthcare without the share  of

the  GDP  going  up  by very much.  The  Economic  Review

Committee,  however,  estimates  that  GDP  growth  going

forward  will slow to 3-5% per year, in the medium  term.

With  this  slowing  of  our economic  growth,  and  with

healthcare  cost  still going up  by  between  4-6%,  our

national healthcare expenditure, as a percentage  of  our

GDP, will therefore increase as a result.  So, this is  a

very  major challenge for us.  We expect healthcare  cost

to go up, and we expect healthcare cost as a share of the

GDP to go up.  So how do we address this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has worked out three strategies to deal

with  it.  First, we have to strengthen the 3M framework.

Second,  the  money that the Government  is  prepared  to

spend,  the subsidies that the Government is prepared  to

give, should be targeted at those who are most deserving.

Third,  we should take all steps to manage cost.  Let  me

deal with the first strategy, which is to strengthen  the

3M framework.  Let me start with the first M - Medisave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave, as we all know, is the foundation. We

must build up sufficient savings, otherwise we would  not

have enough savings to pay for healthcare cost.  That  is

the  reason  why  we have decided to raise  the  Medisave

contribution rate by an extra 1% in the near future.  The

Government is also pitching

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>

in  by  paying a higher interest rate of 4%,  instead  of

2.5%,  for the Medisave account.  We have done  so  since

2001.   Last  year, for example, the Government  paid  an

additional  $380  million  into  Singaporeans'   Medisave

accounts  because  of  this change  in  paying  a  higher

interest  rate.   This is to help Singaporeans  build  up

their  Medisave account.  Let me stress that the Medisave

contribution  rate  of between 6-8% is  really  not  very

high.   In France, the equivalent contribution is 20%  of

the  employee's salary.  In Germany, it is 13.5%  of  the

employee's  income.  So Medisave funds are not  infinite.

We know there are many competing demands for it.  Members

have  raised  it  all  the time.   We  use  Medisave  for

hospitalisation  expenses, for health insurance  premiums

and   for   certain  outpatient  treatments.   We   must,

therefore,  strike  a balance between extending  Medisave

for  more healthcare uses and preserving it for the  time

when  it is most needed, ie, hospitalisation expenses  in

old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medisave contribution and savings account is

designed such that, for the average worker, he will  save

enough  in his Medisave account to pay for around  eleven

episodes in the hospital.  Our study shows that a  normal

person  would  probably  have three  episodes  before  he

reaches 65 years old and, therefore, the remaining  eight

episodes  are for the last 5, 10, 15 years of  his  life,

depending on how long he lives.  So when we look  at  the

Medisave  account,  he  must keep eight-eleventh  of  his

Medisave  total savings for his old age.  If he  were  to

deplete  his Medisave account very early, then  he  would

not have enough for his old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am very sympathetic to Dr Chong Weng Chiew's

request.  He kept raising the point whether we can extend

the  use  of  Medisave for home medical and home  nursing

services.   I have explained previously that by  allowing

Medisave   to  be  used  to  pay  for  the  premiums   of

ElderShield,  we  are,  in fact,  extending  the  use  of

Medisave to the more severely disabled, so that they  can

use the payouts to pay for home medical, home nursing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>

and  nursing  home services.  For those who  are  not  so

severely  disabled,  and if they meet  our  income  means

test,  they  will be highly subsidised by the Government.

An  average  home medical visit, after subsidy  from  the

Government, would therefore range between $30-$60, and an

average  home  nursing  visit,  after  subsidy   by   the

Government, will be between $13-28.  So, these levels  of

expenditure  should be affordable, and seen as  the  same

range as outpatient GP cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept Dr Chong Weng Chiew's argument that if,

indeed,  home  care is a substitute for in-patient  care,

that  means,  if there is medical evidence  to  say  that

instead of being hospitalised, home care is sufficient to

meet  the  problem,  and instead  of  eight  episodes  in

hospital,  you  only need four episodes in the  hospital,

and the funds that we set aside for the four episodes can

now  be  spent for home medical and home nursing, then  I

think  there is a case to extend it.  So we will  examine

this,  and I will be very happy if he can give us  proper

scientific evidence to say that home medical, in fact, is

a  substitute for in-patient.  Then I think Medisave  can

be extended for home medical and home nursing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all these, we are not frozen in time.

We   have  regularly  adjusted  the  Medisave  withdrawal

limits.  We have also progressively extended the  use  of

Medisave   to   more  outpatient  treatments.    Medisave

withdrawals increased by 62%, from $250 million  in  1991

to  $400  million in 2001.  If we had frozen the criteria

for  Medisave  withdrawals, you will not see  this  major

increase  in  the  withdrawals.  But I  agree  with  many

Members  -  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, among others - who  raised

the  point that Medisave withdrawals ought to be  attuned

to  the medical condition, and that our present system of

allowing  Medisave withdrawals by days in hospitalisation

and by the tables of operation, is outdated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, today I would like to announce that from 1st

July 2002, my Ministry will reset the Medisave withdrawal

limits  based  on the DRG system.  This new  system  will

allow Singaporeans to withdraw more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>

Medisave for the more severe medical conditions.  Let  me

explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Medisave withdrawal limits are set based

on  the number of days of hospitalisation and the type of

surgeries performed.  This is a very blunt tool  that  is

not  customised  to take into account the seriousness  of

the  medical  conditions and the resources  required  for

treatment.  In some instances, it is also restrictive  as

sub-limits  are set on the amount patients  can  withdraw

for each surgery performed.  With improvements in medical

technology,  some  patients may  require  very  intensive

treatment,  but only require a very short hospital  stay,

eg,   for  certain  types  of  heart  surgery.   In  such

instances,  the  amounts that the patients  can  withdraw

from  Medisave may not be commensurate with their medical

condition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DRG system is based on the resources required to

treat  the  medical  conditions, ie, the  more  resources

required,  the higher the severity level,  the  more  the

patient can withdraw from Medisave.  This means that they

will  need to pay less out-of-pocket cash.  These changes

will  apply  to in-patient episodes and day surgeries  at

both  the  public  and  private  hospitals.   With  these

changes,  more  than 96% of B2 patients  can  have  their

entire bill paid for by Medisave, compared to 80%  of  B2

patients  today.  This means that more Singaporeans  will

not  need  out-of-pocket cash for their  hospitalisation.

Let  me  now  ask the Parliament staff to distribute  the

brief  on these changes, which contains some examples  of

how   patients  with  serious  medical  conditions  would

benefit from these changes.  [Copies of brief distributed

to hon. Members.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me turn to the second M - MediShield. We

discussed  this last year and I mentioned that MediShield

in  fact  plays a very limited role in our  3M  framework

currently.  Today, MediShield payouts account for  around

1.1%  of  our national healthcare expenditure.   This,  I

think,  limits  the  role  of insurance  in  our  overall

healthcare   financing  framework.    My   Ministry   has

attempted   to   make,  over  the  years,   changes   and

enhancements

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>

to  the  MediShield, to try and keep up with the  medical

cost,  but  we  have  been  constrained  by  not  raising

premiums.   Premiums  have remained unchanged  since  the

scheme was introduced in1990.  So, these enhancements are

really not adequate to keep up with the medical needs  of

today.   As a result, today, 4 in 10 B2 bills are  higher

than  the  existing  MediShield claimable  limits,  which

means  that  MediShield does not fully cover catastrophic

bills,  as  it is meant to do.  And this number  of  non-coverage would go up with medical inflation.  So we  need

to  make quite major adjustments to our MediShield if  we

want  to  meet  the  objectives that  many  Members  have

raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang gave many suggestions on how to

enhance  MediShield.  I am happy to note that Mr  Yeo  is

supportive of increases in the premiums for the  enhanced

MediShield  scheme.  I agree with Mr Yeo that  we  should

also go for pre-funding of the policies, so that you  pay

more  when you are younger and you are covered  when  you

are older.  This is in line with our move to make medical

benefit  more  portable.   So I  assure  the  House  that

changes   to  the  insurance  element  of  our  financing

framework  will  be a major item in our agenda  over  the

next two years.  We need to make many changes, if we want

to  allow  MediShield to play a bigger role in  providing

coverage for Singaporeans, not only during employment and

in   between  jobs  but,  more  importantly,  also  after

retirement.  These are very major changes and we need  to

prioritise  the changes, otherwise Singaporeans  may  not

understand and keep up with these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the first priority is to raise the MediShield

claimable limits.  Today, the MediShield claimable limits

are  set  too  low and we must raise it so  as  to  allow

patients  with high hospitalisation bills to  claim  more

from  MediShield when they most need it.  They then  need

to  withdraw  less  Medisave and pay  less  out-of-pocket

cash.   And,  we have to adjust the MediShield  claimable

limits  in  line  with the DRG system.   I  hope  Members

understand  the  role  of MediShield  as  a  catastrophic

insurance scheme.  This means

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>

that  as  the medical bills go up, you cover the  highest

bill.  For the average bill, Singaporeans are able to pay

on  their  own using the subventions from the  Government

and  using  Medisave.  But for very high bills,  this  is

where   you  want  the  MediShield  to  kick  in.    And,

therefore,  we  must  raise  the  upper  limits  of   the

MediShield claimable limit so that it covers the top  end

of  the bill.  My Ministry will announce more details  of

how  we will enhance MediShield subsequently.  But, as  I

said, we need other changes, and we will definitely  come

back  to  the  House over the next few years  to  discuss

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One big issue that we have to discuss and decide,

for  example,  is the issue of whether we  want  to  make

medical  insurance compulsory.  Mr Yeo Guat  Kwang  asked

whether  the  Ministry has any plans to  make  MediShield

compulsory.   Let me say that this is a very  major  step

and we will need to consider this very carefully.  Today,

more  than 90% of the working population is covered under

either  MediShield  or  one  of  the  MediShield-approved

private medical insurance schemes.  This is quite a  high

participation  rate.  But, of course, as Mr  Yeo  pointed

out, more than 200,000 are not covered, and many of these

are  the  non-working  spouses or people  who  are  self-employed,  and these are the most vulnerable people.   So

we  will have to evaluate whether or not we want to  make

MediShield compulsory.  But as I said, this is a very big

step.    What  we  can  do  right  now  is  to  encourage

Singaporeans  not to opt out of MediShield.   Because  if

they opt out and when they retire or become jobless, they

will not be covered by their employers.  There is also no

guarantee that when they are no longer covered  by  their

employers  that  they will be insurable  at  that  stage,

because   they  may  then  have  pre-existing  illnesses.

Therefore,  I  think  our  first  step  is  to  encourage

Singaporeans to opt back into MediShield while  they  are

still young and healthy.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also suggested other changes to

MediShield, so as to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>

make  it  a national scheme, eg, covering only the  basic

tier  and  to have appropriate levels of co-payments.   I

think  these  are very important principles,  because  we

want to minimise the buffet syndrome.  If you introduce a

national  medical insurance scheme and you have a  buffet

syndrome, it will lead to escalating premiums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just describing to some Members during the

break   just  now  the  experience  of  Taiwan.    Taiwan

introduced a national medical insurance about five  years

ago  and  they  extended the medical insurance  to  cover

visits  to the GP.  In Singapore, Singaporeans visit  the

GP,  on the average, six times a year.  In Taiwan, it  is

around  11-12  times.   Why is that  so?   The  Taiwanese

Health  Minister  told me that in  some  clinics  in  the

suburbs,  it is very common for school children to  visit

the clinic and pick up pocket money from the GP,  because

every  time the GP sees a patient he can claim, say,  $20

from the state.  So, he gives a small pocket money to the

student,  and  there is no way you can stop  this  abuse,

because  it is entirely within the right of a school  boy

to go to a clinic, complain of headache or tummy ache and

be seen by the GP.   So, you may run very elaborate audit

systems,  but if the national average has gone up  to  11

times,  the school boy is entitled to visit his GP  11-12

times and collect his pocket money.  Although we do  want

to  make sure that we have good coverage, we also want to

make sure that it does not lead to abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to the third M, which is Medifund.

Medifund  kicks in for the small minority of Singaporeans

who  are  not  able to pay for their share of  healthcare

cost,   even  after  Government  subsidy,  Medisave   and

MediShield.  Over the years, the Government has  steadily

built  up  the Medifund capital sum.  It grew  from  $200

million  in  1993  to $900 million this  year,  with  the

latest  $100  million  injection,  as  announced  by  the

Minister  for  Finance.  I remember one Member  mentioned

why  is  the Ministry of Finance injecting an extra  $100

million  when, in fact, the Ministry of Health  is  quite

comfortable  with  $800 million and  using  the  interest

income from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>

the  $800  million.  The answer is that we  believe  that

Medifund  is  a very important safety net and,  with  the

additional funds given by Ministry of Finance, MOH is now

in  a  position  to  gradually  extend  the  coverage  of

Medifund.   For  example, when the  Ministry  of  Finance

raised  the capital sum last year, MOH is able to  extend

the  use  of  Medifund  to step-down care  organisations.

Similarly, we will continue to make full use of  MediFund

to  provide assistance to needy Singaporeans.  So, I urge

Members  that  when  they come across  a  deserving  case

during  their  meet-the-people sessions,  such  as  those

mentioned by Mr Zainudin and other Members, whether  they

are  the elderly, the handicapped or the retrenched,  for

chronic  cases  and  other cases, do refer  them  to  the

medical social workers at the hospitals and clinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, more than 99% of Medifund applications are

approved.  And with the additional funds that we have  in

the Medifund, I can assure you that Medifund, as a safety

net, will continue to be there for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second prong of our strategy is to increasingly

target  subsidies to the most deserving.  With increasing

healthcare  costs, the Government would do  its  part  to

increase  its share of healthcare expenditure.   We  have

done   so.    Government  subsidies   for   Singaporeans'

healthcare  costs through the hospitals, the  polyclinics

and  the VWOs have increased by more than 34% in the last

four  years.   For  example, in FY 2000,  we  spent  $896

million  in such subventions.   And this year, we  expect

to spend $1.2 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan wonders whether it is wise for us to

keep  this  80% market share because this will result  in

high  cost  to the Government, as he observed the  higher

budget  that the Ministry of Health is given  year  after

year.  His suggestion is to privatise the hospitals,  but

I  notice the other Members are, in fact, asking for more

C  class  wards and more B2 Class wards.  So, we have  to

strike a balance somehow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all of us know that financial resources

given to healthcare cannot be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>

unlimited and, therefore, I hope Members will agree  with

me  that  Singaporeans  who are able  to  pay  for  their

medical  bills  should do so themselves,  or  with  their

families' help.  Then the resources that we have, we  can

target  these  subsidies  at Singaporeans  who  are  most

deserving.   In  line  with  this  philosophy,  we   have

selectively  implemented means testing  for  the  Primary

Care  Partnership  Scheme (PCPS) and also  the  step-down

care  and  home  care services managed by  the  voluntary

welfare organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, my Ministry will consider extending

means   testing  gradually  and  selectively,   to   more

healthcare  services.   If there  are  proxy  methods  to

moderate  demand  and  target the services  to  the  more

deserving,  then  there is less need for  means  testing.

But  if our proxy methods are not effective, then I think

we  have to consider means testing, so that the subsidies

can  be more equitably distributed to those who are  more

deserving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members raised the situation in the specialist

outpatient  clinics.   Dr Chong Weng  Chiew  and  several

others said that there are long queues and that it  could

be  abused  because  the  fees are  only  $21,  which  is

sometimes  cheaper than a visit to the GP.   Singaporeans

know that they can enjoy substantial Government subsidies

simply   by  obtaining  polyclinic  referrals.   So   the

polyclinic  referrals,  as a proxy,  are  not  discerning

enough  to  differentiate between those who are deserving

and those who are not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Means testing at the SOCs will make the distribution

of  Government  subsidies  more  equitable  by  delinking

subsidies  from  the referral source.  It will  therefore

enable us to redirect public healthcare resources and  do

more for the lower income.  But we will have to study the

implications of this and we will have to make  sure  that

if  we  do implement means testing, that it achieves  the

purpose set.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah is right that if you want to do means

testing, the criteria must be made clear.  And to us, the

fairest and simplest criterion is per capita income.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with both Mdm Halimah and Dr Ong Seh

Hong that we need not run a single means test system.  It

is  possible to vary the income cut-off, depending on the

cost  of  service.   So, even though we have  implemented

means  testing  in the step-down care sector,  previously

the  subsidy in the step-down care sector was a  standard

50%.  When we introduced means testing, we provided three

tiers   -  75%, 50% and 25%.  So, it went down very  well

on  the  ground.   But  it does not  mean  that  we  will

necessarily  use  this  same method  for  the  hospitals,

because  in  hospitals today, Singaporeans already  enjoy

80%  subsidy in C class wards, 65% subsidy in  B2  wards;

50%  subsidy in the B2-plus wards and 20% subsidy in  the

B1  wards.   So it is possible for us to vary the  income

cut-off as well as the level of subsidy, depending on the

cost of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third prong of our strategy is really getting

down to the brass tacks and managing cost increases.  How

do  we do so?  My Ministry plays the role of purchaser of

healthcare services on behalf of Singaporeans, especially

the  low  and middle income.  As a purchaser, I  wish  to

reassure  Mr  Zainul Abidin, Mdm Halimah and  Mr  Chandra

Mohan  that  my  Ministry will ensure that  clusters  are

accountable and that their interests are aligned with the

Ministry's  goal  of providing good and affordable  basic

healthcare to all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua that performance

measurement is necessary to do so.   And to this end, the

Ministry has set out its requirements and expectations of

the  two  clusters in a service agreement with them.   We

will  review  the  service agreement  with  the  clusters

periodically to make sure that they abide by it and  that

it  is  relevant and effective.  In addition, my Ministry

provides  the  strategic  oversight  on  overall   public

healthcare capabilities and facilities.  We want to  make

sure  that  on capabilities, we have in place  a  medical

capability   framework  to  ensure  that  there   is   no

unnecessary duplication of the more specialised and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>

most costly services and facilities.  Such facilities and

services  are concentrated in the tertiary hospitals  and

national centres.  On facilities, the Ministry determines

the  number of beds and its distribution by ward  classes

in  every public hospital to minimise over supply at  the

national  level.  Public hospitals also need to seek  the

Ministry's   approval  before  they  can   expand   their

facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a purchaser, my Ministry will also ensure that

the clusters provide quality care that is appropriate  to

needs  and  not  drive up healthcare costs unnecessarily,

eg,  the  example which Dr Lily Neo raised that they  use

more expensive stents when a cheaper one is adequate.  In

fact, we have several mechanisms in place to prevent such

things from happening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first mechanism is, of course, all healthcare

professionals  are  bound to abide  by  their  respective

ethical   codes.   Breaching  the  code  could  lead   to

healthcare  professionals being  asked  to  defend  their

actions and, ultimately, to face disciplinary proceedings

for professional misconduct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mechanism is that the Ministry regularly

produces  clinical practice guidelines, so as  to  assist

healthcare  practitioners to manage their patients  based

on the best available evidence to date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Ministry also monitors key clinical,

financial  and  other  operational indicators  so  as  to

detect   trends   and  outliers  that   deserve   further

investigation  or  audit.  Let me just  use  the  example

which Dr Chong Weng Chiew raised that the specialist  may

ask  patients to make extra follow-up visits beyond  what

is  necessary.  We track this and our data over the  last

three years have shown that the ratio of re-attendance to

first  visit is very stable.  It is between 3.6 and  3.8.

So there is no escalation in repeat visits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members like Dr Lily Neo and Mrs Lim Hwee

Hua also asked whether the remuneration structure for the

doctors in the public hospitals is properly set,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>

so  as  not to create the wrong incentives.  This is  so.

We make sure that the doctors pay equal attention to both

private  and  subsidised  patients.   Their  remuneration

takes  into  account several factors, of  which  clinical

service load of the doctor is only one of them.   I  also

want  to  assure Members that the clinical  service  load

includes both private and subsidised patients seen by the

doctors.   So  the public sector doctors do  not  have  a

financial incentive to order more expensive tests, drugs,

or  stents, because they do not personally get a cut from

these  items.  The revenue from these items goes  to  the

hospital.  And at the hospital level, my Ministry has put

in  place  a  revenue cap framework to  discourage  over-servicing.   Under  this framework, excess  revenue  that

exceeds  a pre-determined cap will not be allowed  to  be

retained  by  the hospitals.  So there is less  incentive

for over-servicing and over-pricing.  What this means  is

that,  every  year,  we  do not allow  the  hospitals  to

increase costs beyond a certain limit.  So if they charge

more, they do not keep the money.  The money goes back to

the Government which will then reuse it for subsidies for

the system.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the purchaser, my Ministry will ensure that

Singaporeans  get  the best value  for  money  for  their

healthcare services.  My Ministry is not obliged  to  buy

only  from  the  public sector restructured institutions.

Dr  Ong Seh Hong and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua have suggested, and

I  think several others as well, that the Government  buy

services from the private sector as well.  I am  open  to

this  option.  If the private sector can offer lower cost

with  the  same or better quality in service, my Ministry

will  consider contracting the service from them once  we

put  the  proper framework in place.  For example,  under

the PCPS, the Government engages private GPs and dentists

to  provide outpatient medical and dental services to the

needy  elderly.  The patients pay polyclinic charges  and

the  Government  provides a subsidy to the  participating

GPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also put in place a similar

framework for the step-down care

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>

sector.    This  framework  will  include   means   test,

accredited  private sector facilities,  properly  audited

norm  cost  and revenue caps.  So the accredited  private

sector  nursing homes will be able to take in  subsidised

patients as of 1st April this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know many Members have raised this whole issue

about  healthcare  cost.  Dr Lily  Neo  and  Mdm  Halimah

suggested  a  watchdog body to monitor  healthcare  cost.

Let  me just say that controlling and managing healthcare

cost  is a job for all of us.  It is not the job  of  MOH

alone,  although, as I have outlined earlier, we  have  a

very  comprehensive scheme in place.  The individual  and

his  family  must also take the effort to understand  the

cost implications of their choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong Weng Chiew suggested that we do public

education  and  counselling  to  make  sure  that  people

understand what is the cost implication of their choices.

We  have done this.  If anything else, we err on the safe

side.   We  counsel them and many of them  then  take  up

class  B2  or C.  And this is part of the reason  why  we

have  an  over  demand  for these subsidised  wards.   In

addition,  over time, as the medical insurance  component

increases, I hope that the insurance companies will  also

build   up   the  competence  and  interest  to   control

healthcare cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me, over the next 10 minutes, cover the

other  specific issues which have not been covered in  my

reply so far.  Let me take it systematically.  First,  in

the  primary  care sector, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked  about

night  clinics.   We have night clinic  services  now  in

seven polyclinics.  The reason why we introduced it is to

make  it  much more convenient for Singaporeans  to  seek

care  at  night, instead of having to wait till the  next

day.    As   these   night  clinics  are  popular   among

Singaporeans,  my Ministry plans to extend night  clinics

to five more polyclinics this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked about our plans for development of

new  polyclinics.  As we have announced earlier, we  plan

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>

develop new polyclinics in Sengkang, Jurong West and also

to redevelop Queenstown Polyclinic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members asked about the Primary Care

Partnership  Scheme (PCPS).  I thank  Members  for  their

favourable comments on PCPS.  We agree that the scheme is

working  well.  But we really need to reach out  to  more

elderly  to make sure they sign on under PCPS.   Dr  Lily

Neo said that, today, we have probably achieved less than

50%  of  those who are eligible.  I agree with  her.   We

should  work  harder so that we could reach out  to  more

elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, some 6,200 elderly are participating in PCPS.

Singaporeans,   who   are  on  public   assistance,   are

automatically  eligible  regardless  of  their  age.   My

Ministry,    together    with   the    other    community

organisations,  like CDCs and VWOs, has started  a  joint

programme  to promote subscription to PCPS and the  IDAPE

scheme.   Voluntary organisations, like the Home  Nursing

Foundation, are doing a lot of promotion and I would also

like to encourage Members, when they do block visits,  to

help us distribute these brochures to get more elderly to

sign on the PCPS scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo suggested that we extend PCPS to chronic

care.  Mr Gan Kim Yong also wanted PCPS to be extended to

the  handicapped, the other low income group, as well  as

people   with   chronic  diseases.   These   are   worthy

suggestions  and we will consider possible extensions  of

PCPS  later.  Because right now, our priority must be  to

reach  out  to all the elderly who are eligible  but  who

still have not signed on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then turn to the hospital sector. Mr Nithiah

Nandan  wants  to  know if more class  C  beds  would  be

created  in the tertiary hospitals.  The answer  is  yes.

Dr  Lily Neo wanted to know whether we are deploying more

doctors and nurses to areas where there is an increase in

demand.   The answer is also yes.  NUH will increase  its

number of class C beds from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>

56  to  160  beds, an increase of 104 beds by April  this

year.  And SGH will increase its class C beds from 134 to

214 beds, an increase of 80 beds by September this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that any patient who requests

for subsidised beds in a particular class ward and if the

class ward is already full, he will be lodged in a higher

class ward temporarily.  But he will continue to pay only

the subsidised rates of the class ward of his choice.  So

even  though  we may not have renovated the  class  C  or

class  B2  wards to meet the demand, anybody who requests

for  such  a subsidised ward, if it is already  full,  we

will temporarily lodge him in a higher class ward but  he

pays  the  rates  of  the subsidised  ward  that  he  has

requested  for.   When the bed is available, we  transfer

him  back  to B2 or C class ward.  So he is not penalised

in  any way if there are temporary shortages in the B2 or

C class wards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members also raised about the difficulty of

specialist  outpatient clinic patients  who,  because  of

changes  in  their financial situation, may  request  for

downgrading.  I assure Members that, if indeed  they  are

in genuine financial difficulties, please raise them with

the  medical  social workers and they will take  care  of

them,  and if they do qualify, they will provide Medifund

support for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock wants to know whether the

specialist outpatient patients can request to break  down

their   prescriptions   or   medications   into   smaller

allocations so that they do not have to pay three months'

worth  of medication at one go.  In general, I would  not

want to interfere with the doctor's judgement of how much

prescription  is needed.  But I would like to  assure  Dr

Tan  Cheng Bock that indeed if a patient tells his doctor

that he cannot afford it and he prefers a shorter period,

say,  two weeks, as Dr Tan Cheng Bock suggested, I  think

the doctor will accede to his request.  But as a rule,  I

do  not think the Ministry wants to impose the rule  that

doctors  should only prescribe two weeks first,  and  not

three  months.   I  think we have  to  leave  it  to  the

professional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>

judgement  of the doctor.  If he prescribes too  short  a

period, then we will be forcing the patient to make  more

return  visits to SOC or to the pharmacy.  If  indeed  he

faces  financial problems, please do talk to his  doctor.

He or she is there for him to talk to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to the whole issue about the way we

organise  the  clusters, whether we should  have  two  or

three  and how we should encourage competition.  I  think

the  jury is still out.  Some can argue that if you  have

more  competition, you bring healthcare cost down.  Other

Members have made out an equally cogent case to say  that

competition  means the clusters try very  hard  and  they

induce demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, today, we have decided to have two

clusters.   Why?  Because we want to make  sure  that  we

have  a  full,  integrated service and that the  services

provided  to Singaporeans are seamless between  different

levels  of institutions, whether it is from the  national

centres  to  the  tertiary  hospitals,  to  the  regional

general  hospitals  or  to the polyclinics.   Because  we

believe  that integrated care is the most cost  effective

setting.  If you have an integrated care, the doctor  can

assign  the  right level of care commensurate  with  your

medical  condition.  If your condition is not so serious,

he  can  assign  you to the polyclinic.  If  it  is  more

serious, he can assign you to SOC.  Or if it is even more

serious, he can assign you to the tertiary centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise duplication, we make sure that the more

specialised   services  are  located  in   the   tertiary

hospitals  and the national centres so that the  regional

general  hospitals focus on the management of the  common

medical conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong Weng Chiew suggested that we keep the two

clusters to only doing the frills and we set up  a  third

cluster  to focus on the top-end medical treatment.   Let

us try out the two clusters system first.  If we create a

third  cluster,  I think there will be a lot  of  unhappy

comparison between what is available in the third cluster

compared to the other two clusters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a likely discussion about what we

should  do with the ERC's recommendation on the  regional

medical hub.  Our position is that we will encourage  the

private  sector health institutions, facilitated  by  the

economic agencies, such as the EDB, IE Singapore and  the

Singapore  Toursim Board, to spearhead this effort.   The

public  sector healthcare institutions will play  a  very

important  role to support these efforts,  especially  in

the area of training and research.  But the main focus of

the  public  healthcare institutions must be  to  provide

good  and affordable healthcare to Singaporeans,  and  we

will do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1993 White Paper on Affordable Healthcare, we

stipulated  that  no public sector hospital  should  have

more  than 13% Class A beds to serve private and  foreign

patients.   In  that White Paper, we also envisaged  that

the  overall private sector market share would grow  from

20%  to  30%.   I  believe  these  guidelines  are  still

relevant today and my Ministry would continue to  support

the   private  sector  institutions  in  achieving  these

guidelines.  And we will ensure that the public hospitals

remain  focused on their role to service the majority  of

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to two other issues. Dr Michael Lim has

spoken  on  HSA's  role.  We need  to  strike  a  balance

between regulating medical devices so that they are safe.

At  the  same  time,  we do not want to  impose  so  much

regulation that they incur cost.  I assure Dr Michael Lim

that  HSA's  regulatory  requirements  would  be  closely

aligned   with  those  set  out  like  their  counterpart

regulatory agencies in the USA, EU, Canada and Australia.

We  will  keep ourselves in line and we will not be  more

stringent  than them.  More importantly,  HSA  will  have

regular  meetings, every six monthly,  with  the  medical

device  industry to obtain industry feedback.   So  I  am

sure  HSA  will  get  in touch with Dr  Michael  Lim  and

encourage him to bring up the specific instances where we

have  over  regulated,  and we will  evaluate  the  cases

again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked about the precautions taken for

SARS and how we are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>

protecting our healthcare providers.  As Members may have

read  in the newspapers this is a worldwide problem.   We

suspect  the  cases could have emanated  from  Guangdong,

Hong  Kong  and  Hanoi.  That is why we have  set  out  a

travel  advisory, advising Singaporeans not to travel  to

these places, unless it is absolutely necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we have 23 reported cases, 21 in the

hospitals and two have been discharged.  All these  cases

stemmed from three index cases, ie, three original source

cases,  and  then they spread to the others.   They  have

spread  to eight healthcare workers and 12 family members

and friends.  So, if we are able to contain the situation

by  not allowing it to spread further, over time, we will

find  fewer  and fewer cases, and the situation  will  be

completely  under  control.  But if Singaporeans  travel,

get   infected  overseas,  come  back  and  infect  other

Singaporeans,  then I am afraid the cycle will  continue.

That  is  the  reason why we made it a  point  to  advise

Singaporeans  to avoid travelling to these three  places,

unless absolutely necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gone through these difficulties before. A

few years ago, we had an outbreak of the Nipah virus.  In

that  situation, fortunately for us, we were able to  cut

off further infection by not allowing pigs to be imported

into   Singapore.   Therefore,  by  cutting  off  further

infection,  we  were  able  to control  and  contain  the

situation.  In the SARS case, the infection is brought in

by  humans.  So, unless we encourage Singaporeans not  to

travel  and  avoid being infected overseas,  we  have  no

effective means to stop the chain reaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, let me emphasise, please avoid these places,

unless  absolutely  necessary.   We  are  monitoring  the

situation  very  carefully together with  our  regulatory

counterparts  in Hong Kong.  We have got assistance  from

WHO and from the CDC in the US.  So far, things are under

control.   It will require us another 10 to 14 days,  ie,

two more incubation cycles, before we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>

can declare it all-clear, if all things go well.  But  if

there are additional infections, then I am afraid we will

have to continue with the current measures.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.05 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the healthcare workers, I must say I am very

proud    of    them.    They   have   discharged    their

responsibilities  admirably, taken all  the  precautions,

even  though  eight of them have been  infected.   I  can

assure Members that we will spare no efforts to make sure

that they are well looked after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I missed out one point about cost management, ie,

just  to  emphasise that the cost that  we  set  for  the

hospitals   is  not  on  a  cost-recovery   basis.    The

Government  provides the norm cost,  and  we  expect  the

hospitals to manage their cost within that level.  So, it

is  very  similar  to  your  price-minus  proposal.   The

hospitals  are not allowed to incur cost and then  expect

the  Government to pay for all cost increases.   This  is

part of the discipline of managing cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To respond to Mr Chandra Mohan who described SGH as

a  5-star hotel, I am very flattered.  I am sure the  SGH

would be very flattered.  SGH was built 20 years ago and,

if  it  leaves the impression that it is a 5-star  hotel,

then  I  think it is doing a good job in maintaining  the

hospital.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I want to clarify that I did not

mention  anything on stents or the price of stents  which

the Minister gave the answer to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on my cut on doctors, in June last year, strict

new  limits on work hours for American medical  residents

were  imposed by the American Accreditation  Council  for

Graduate  Medical Education.  It said that up to 120-hour

work-weeks  were  harmful  to  young  doctors  and  could

endanger  patient care.  In America, thousands of  people

die annually from medical mistakes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new rules, the normal resident work-week

would be limited to 80 hours.  The standards also imposed

mandatory  rest periods of 10 hours between  shifts,  one

day  a  week off, restrictions on moonlighting, and close

faculty supervision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported in the Straits Times four months ago

that junior doctors here work on a 34-hour shift.  May  I

ask  the  Minister if such long shifts are not  affecting

their  concentration and standard of patient  care?   Are

our junior doctors not subjected to long, unhealthy work-weeks?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morale has been low among junior doctors for many

years.  Lately, there had been another issue contributing

to  this.  It seems that there was favoured-treatment  of

Singaporean medical graduates from overseas, as  compared

to  locally-graduated doctors serving under bonds.  Could

the Minister enlighten us on this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to pay attention to the

training  of our junior doctors to ensure the  competency

of future generations of our healthcare providers.  May I

ask the Minister for Health what steps have been taken to

ensure this?  May I also ask whether our hospital doctors

are too preoccupied with daily routines that require them

to  manage  maximal  numbers of patients  and  leave  the

seniors with little or no time to teach the juniors  who,

in turn, have no time to be trained?

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Health

and  the Ministry of Manpower have launched the Strategic

Manpower  Conversion Programme for the healthcare  sector

recently.   It  aims to increase the pool  of  healthcare

professionals    by    helping   non-healthcare    sector

individuals acquire the relevant skills in the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some features of this programme include a shortened

training   period,   cost  fee   support   and   training

allowances.  It also provides an on-the-job wage  support

to  sponsoring institutions that hire these  individuals.

I  must  take  this  opportunity to  compliment  the  two

Ministries,  as  this is indeed a good programme  and  it

brings relief to our current employment status.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>

Times are bad.  Encouraging individuals to re-skill  into

a  sector  that is critically understaffed is  definitely

commendable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must say that we are spending a lot of

resources  and effort on this programme.  It is therefore

imperative that we do not spend all this money,  only  to

lose   the  individuals  once  they  are  fully   trained

professionals.  I would urge the Minister to put in place

a  clear  career  path  for  these  individuals,  with  a

competitive  compensation plan, so that the  trainees  do

not  take  this  as  a  stop-gap measure  and  leave  the

industry the moment the economy recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the competition for healthcare staff in the

global arena is very competitive.  We need to be vigilant

to  guard  this  pool  of manpower  resources  jealously.

Otherwise,  other  countries  would  draw  away  our  new

nursing talents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, if one were to visit

our  local  hospitals,  especially when  approaching  the

nurses' station, one sometimes wonder whether one was  in

Manila!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds us how short we are in terms of our

local  nurses.   Indeed, there is a  shortage  of  nurses

worldwide.  Just as our nurses are sought after from  all

over the world, including the Middle East and the UK,  we

too  open our hospitals to foreign nurses.  I believe  we

have  employed  nurses from various countries,  including

China and the Philippines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which other countries do we have nurses from? What

was  the  experience like with these  foreign  nurses  in

terms  of  the  quality  of  their  professional  nursing

skills?  Are there plans to open the door to nurses  from

other countries too?  In addition, Sir, what is MOH doing

to attract and train more local nurses?

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Sir, the nursing profession is

the  backbone of the medical industry.  There is no doubt

about  it.  In meeting the manpower requirements  of  our

nursing  profession,  we spare no efforts  in  recruiting

nurses,  both locally and from abroad.  In fact, we  have

nurses

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>

from the Philippines, India, China and elsewhere.  At the

moment,  foreign  nurses form about 25%  of  our  nursing

workforce.  There are more than 4,000 foreign  nurses  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having recruited them, we similarly spare no efforts

in  training and orientating our foreign nurses to enable

them  to  perform  according to the way nursing  care  is

administered here.  We have also given due recognition to

our  foreign nurses' professional qualifications and  the

importance  of  their contribution through  opportunities

for  upgrading and career advancement.  Yet, in spite  of

all  these, many of these foreign nurses do not  stay  in

Singapore  for  long.  Some stay in their jobs  for  only

between six months and two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global competition for professional nurses is

hot, and definitely getting hotter.  For instance, the UK

made  no  bones  about their shortage of  nurses.   Until

recently,   they  have  gone  on  aggressive  recruitment

campaigns in some of our sources of foreign nurses,  such

as  the Philippines as well as China.  The campaigns also

include  Singapore, where they advertised in our  Straits

Times to recruit our nurses.  Attractive carrots, such as

offers up to treble their salaries, free flights,  and  a

chance  to  see another part of the world, were  used  to

entice them to work in Britain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are up against fierce competition and need

stronger  measures to retain our foreign nursing  talent.

Many  of  my  colleagues in the healthcare  industry  are

lamenting  the  short-term nature of our foreign  nursing

profession here, after investing vast resources on  them.

The  people who join the nursing profession do so because

they are driven by more than just the will to serve,  and

definitely  less  by the motivation of money.   I  simply

refuse to believe that having being here they would leave

for  other  destinations by the pure motivation  of  more

money.    The   slogan  of  the  nursing  profession   is

definitely not the quest for more money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we need to look at other areas on how we can

do more to retain these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>

foreign nurses in Singapore.  Have we done enough to make

them feel at home?  We need to treat them not so much  as

commodities  but as human resources.  If  we  treat  them

like  commodities, they will behave like one and  go  off

the  moment  their  contract is up.   Thus,  we  need  to

provide   for   their  welfare,  especially  recreational

facilities  outside their work, and their  commitment  to

Singapore.   We need to do more to make them really  feel

that  Singapore  is also part of them.  I therefore  hope

the Ministry of Health could show leadership on this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lily Neo, you can take both cuts

together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, 99 patients, or 11%, of the 924

patients admitted to St Luke's Community Hospital in 2000

had  to be re-admitted to a general acute hospital within

one week.  Fifteen died after their return.  Another four

died  before re-admission.  These deaths were  attributed

to  early  discharge  of  unstable  patients  from  acute

hospitals  to  St  Luke's  Community  Hospital.   It  was

believed  that  the medical problems these  patients  had

were  not  adequately worked out before  their  discharge

from the acute hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our community hospitals cannot and should not

be expected to provide the level of care available in the

acute  hospitals  and, therefore, there  should  be  more

caution  on  discharging patients.  Has the  Ministry  of

Health  done any surveys on this?  What has the  Ministry

done  to improve this situation?  With casemix in  force,

when hospitals are reimbursed on the diagnosis of medical

conditions of patients and not on the length of stay, are

doctors under pressure to discharge patients even earlier

and, thus, exacerbating this problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, patients in the subsidised wards in the public

hospitals  now  have to pay full price once  the  doctors

certify  them  as  ready  to  be  discharged.   But  many

patients,  especially the older ones, may still  consider

themselves as not fit to be discharged, and also may  not

be  able to leave the hospitals for various reasons.  Are

they not penalised unduly?  With

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>

casemix,  will there be more patients subjected  to  this

type of discharge?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on my next cut on nursing homes, the Ministry

of  Health has introduced means-testing to decide on  the

subsidy  to be given to patients in nursing homes,  based

on  a person's per capita family income.  In other words,

this  means-testing is based on the total income of older

family  members divided by the number of members  in  the

family.

This means-testing is thus unfavourable to small families

and  will  be felt by even more people in time  to  come,

because the trend has been tending towards smaller  units

of  families.   Often  times,  it  is  difficult  to  get

information on income from all the members of  a  family,

and  many  elderly fail to get subsidy because  of  this.

Other times, family members of applicants are not willing

or  unable  to  submit their documents for a  variety  of

reasons,   such   as  confidentiality  or   self-employed

situations.  Would the Ministry of Health further  refine

this method of subsidy in view of these factors?

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidies are only given to those with less than

$1,000  per  capita family income. Would the Ministry  of

Health raise this cut-off point so that more elderly  can

qualify?   May  I  also  ask  whether  there  will  be  a

centralised  government-run  "means-testing"  agency   to

facilitate and expedite applications and services?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Jennifer Lee, please take both cuts

together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> It has been over three years since

the  report  of  the  IMC  on the  Aging  Population  was

published  in  November 1999.  One major area  identified

was  for attention to be paid to healthcare needs of  the

elderly.    In the period, since the Ministry  of  Health

has   moved  many  initiatives  and  programmes  for  the

elderly,  I  would  like  to ask  the  Minister  for  his

assessment  and  satisfaction with the progress  made  so

far,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>

and   to   put   forward  a  few  suggestions   for   his

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I would like his observation with

regard to the following components in the delivery of  an

integrated healthcare service to elderly Singaporeans:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The roles of GPs in the system;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The role of VWOs in the private sector in the

provision of residential care;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Raising standards of care and service of

providers; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Assessing subsidies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the GPs, I know that the Minister has

already responded to earlier speakers on the PCPS.  I  do

have  one  additional point to make on the subject.   The

Minister has said that extending the reach of the PCPS is

the current priority.  However, I believe that there is a

need  to  enrol both senior citizens as well as  sign  up

more GPs into the scheme.  Dr Lily Neo has spoken of  the

restrictions  on  management  by  the  GPs   of   chronic

illnesses and this may be a reason why some GPs have  not

signed  up. If there is a concern that GPs are not  quite

up  to the job, should we not be looking to upgrading the

skills  and competence of the GPs since they form a  wide

network?   Indeed, the intent captured in the 1992  White

Paper  was that 80% of primary care is to be provided  by

GPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry had invested in a grant with the

College  of  Family Practitioners in 1999 to develop  the

Graduate   Diploma  in  Family  Medicine   (GDFM).   That

investment   has   yielded   good   results,   with   GPs

demonstrating  that they are keen to upgrade  and  indeed

willing to invest in their own development. Three batches

of  GPs have since signed up for the two-year course. The

first  batch  of  40 had graduated and the  latest  batch

numbers  70.   These  GPs pay their  own  fees  of  about

$3,600. Why not take the route to widen the scope of  the

PCPS, and tie it into the GDFM qualification? It would be

a win-win situation for all involved.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the provision of residential care,

MOH  has  set  aside  17 parcels of land  for  commercial

nursing homes to encourage the development of the private

sector.  What is the Minister's level of satisfaction  on

how  this is progressing?  Three parcels of land had been

awarded.   What  have  the outcomes  been?  What  is  the

current  thinking  regarding VWOs versus  private  sector

provision  of residential care services for the  elderly?

If the intent is to promote private sector participation,

I  believe that we must set the parameters so that we  do

not  end  up  with  developers jumping  into  the  arena,

thinking  there  is an opportunity for a  property  play.

One hears the usual private sector feedback that they are

somewhat squeezed between competing with the restructured

hospitals  for  staff and in this sector, competing  with

the  VWOs whose capital costs are highly subsidised.  The

result  may  be a tendency to warehousing, to squeeze  as

many  batches as possible out of each project  with  less

than satisfactory standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to standards of care, I expect that,

with  notable  exceptions of course, there  is  room  for

improvement in this area. The question is how to  achieve

this.   Currently, many VWOs, while having  the  best  of

intentions,  say that their efforts are compromised  with

the  constant concern regarding finding adequate  funding

for their activities, despite Government subsidies.  Norm

costs  that  are  calculated based on  current  level  of

activity and standards will likely be too low and tie the

VWOs into a vicious cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, might we want to consider putting in place a two-tiered level of norm cost, with the top set at a very

generous  level  but tied in rigorously  to  professional

management  and  stringent requirements on  standards  of

care while the bottom level can stay at current norms?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, regarding assessing of funding and

subsidies, most of my points have already been  taken  up

by Dr Lily Neo. The only other point I wanted to bring up

was that, as the patient navigates through

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>

various parts of the system, from outpatient and day-care

to  residential care and home care, the process of means-testing  is  sometimes  repeated  over  and  over  again,

because  each provider requires slightly different  items

of  information based on their estimation  of  what  they

subsequently  need to satisfy an MOH auditor.   Might  it

not be a good idea for the Ministry to specify a standard

set  of assessment criteria since all the subsidies  that

may  be  disbursed  through it,  and  if  some  are  also

disbursed  through  MCDS, then to engage  MCDS  into  the

picture,  so  that  we can do the processing  only  once?

These are for the Minister's consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my second cut, Sir, may I declare at this point

that I sit on the Board of the Tsao Foundation which is a

not-for-profit organisation providing home healthcare for

the needy in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2002, MOH implemented subsidy for home

care  providers.   This  was a  significant  step  as  it

signalled the importance that the Ministry puts  on  home

healthcare  and  the  funding is much  appreciated.   The

subsidy provided is subject to means-testing and is  tied

to  a   norm cost of $120 per doctor visit for up to  two

visits  per  month and $55 per nurse visit, up  to  eight

visits   per   month.   This  approach   of   per   visit

reimbursement  in  home care is  not  ideal  in  that  it

perversely encourages providers to be less efficient  and

make more frequent visits. This is even more so when  the

norm  cost of both doctor and nurse visits based on  Tsao

Foundation  experience is low on a per visit  basis,  but

potentially  very generous on a yearly  basis.   You  can

claim  up  to  $2,880 for doctors and $5,280 for  nurses,

adding up to a total of $8,160 per annum. So there  is  a

tendency  to  encourage them to make more visits,  rather

than   just  what  is  necessary.   Might  the   Ministry

therefore  wish to consider reimbursement based  on  care

over  a specified period, say, monthly, rather than on  a

per visit basis?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has responded to Dr Chong Weng Chiew

regarding  the  use of Medisave for home  healthcare.   I

would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>

like  to  pick  up on the Minister's point regarding  the

possibility, indeed, I believe the likelihood, that  good

home  healthcare  will  reduce  in-patient  episodes.   I

believe  that  a  comprehensive study  and  cost  benefit

analysis  into the cost of keeping elderly patients  well

cared  for in the home environment, compared to the  cost

that  is  incurred  the  moment a  patient  needs  to  be

admitted to a general hospital for acute episodes  of  an

illness, a community hospital for rehabilitative care  or

a  nursing home, will be most helpful to the Ministry, as

the trade-offs and balances in setting long-term policies

and  decide on resource allocation for many services  for

the  elderly  that need to be established and  developed,

including  the issues of level of norm cost and subsidies

and use of Medisave.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Sir, at the moment, the

Ministry   of  Health  is  organising  step-down   health

services  for  the elderly around three  zones,  ie,  the

west,  central  and  east.  Each zone  will  be  anchored

around   an   acute  regional  hospital  with   geriatric

department, for example, Changi General Hospital  in  the

east, Tan Tock Seng in the central zone, and Alexandra in

the west.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the needs of the elderly change over time, with

some  having disabilities that require extended care  and

step-down facilities, may I ask the Minister what are the

future  plans  the Health Ministry has in healthcare  for

the  elderly? Are there plans to increase the  number  of

community  hospitals to meet higher demands  as  well  as

more trained doctors and care-givers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still in keeping step-down care facilities

affordable   and  attractive  to  all  sectors   of   the

population, more has to be done, especially in attracting

private  sector initiatives in such services.  I  believe

that  private hospitals may be encouraged to venture into

such  an  area  and develop their own wing or  subsidiary

companies to handle this service. Image will improve  and

more  people will be encouraged to opt for such  services

that  will  eventually help ease bed shortages  in  acute

hospitals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgrading the standards of step-down care services

has  to  be  given greater priority if the  total  health

industry,  from  primary care up  to  tertiary  care  and

recovery, is to be of world-class standard.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Sir, my points have already

been  answered  by the Minister.  I would  thus  like  to

withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, firstly, I would like to

thank the Minister for being extremely patient with me on

this subject of ElderShield.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to belabour this issue more than

what  is  necessary but it is an important issue  and  it

affects  a very important segment of our population,  and

the  bulk of the Members in this House are part  of  that

scheme.   In fact, over time, all of us will be  part  of

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that in the Minister's reply to

my earlier question the Ministry has been working closely

with the operators to ascertain the reasons for the lower

than  expected take-up rate and it will review the scheme

at the appropriate time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to consider

three  specific  areas in reviewing  this  scheme.  These

areas  arose  from  a  survey that I  have  conducted  in

conjunction  with  some  students  from  the  university.

Firstly,  the  premium.  Many  residents  feel  that  the

premium is too high. Some feel that they could not afford

it,  especially  those who are already  affected  by  the

economic crisis. As a new scheme, I understand that it is

not  easy to determine what premiums will be appropriate.

However,  after  we  have gained some experience  in  the

claim  patterns,  I hope the Ministry  will  be  able  to

review the premiums.  It may even be possible to consider

a  rebate  system  to return some of the surpluses  after

providing for reasonable profits for the operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the qualifying criteria may need to be

relaxed. The second most common complaint is against the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>

stringent   criteria   to   qualify   for   the    claim.

Psychologically, it is difficult for a person to  imagine

a  situation where he or she cannot perform three of  the

six daily routines.  If it occurs, there is a good chance

that  the person might have many other problems to  worry

about.    Then,  the  amount  of  the  payout  from   the

ElderShield  will be of no comfort to him.   It  will  be

more meaningful and more attractive if a lower degree  of

disability  is  adopted,  perhaps,  different  levels  of

payout can be given to different degrees of disability so

that it is not an all-or-nothing situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a higher payout will make the scheme more

attractive.  One of the key attractions of any  insurance

scheme  is  to  have  peace of mind.  Therefore,  a  half

solution  sometimes  is no solution  at  all.   Yes,  the

payout will be helpful somehow but it is not designed  to

provide  full financial support.  It therefore  does  not

provide  the  much needed peace of mind.  If  the  payout

cannot be increased without increasing the premium,  then

we  can consider an add-on scheme with higher payout  and

higher premium for those who really want to have complete

peace of mind and can afford it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ElderShield provides a much needed safety net,

especially for the lower income families.  It is of grave

concern  that many of the lower income Singaporeans  have

opted  out of the scheme.  I hope that the Ministry  will

review  the  scheme as soon as practicable with  some  of

these  adjustments so that, hopefully, fewer people  will

opt  out of the scheme. And I know that the Minister will

say,  "Give the scheme some time to operate and  we  will

review it in good time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall patiently and eagerly await for the

review.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian:</b> Sir, I would just like to comment

on  the  Interim Disability Assistance Programme for  the

Elderly (IDAPE).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last July, the Ministry of Health announced a very

generous scheme,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>

setting aside $300 million for the disabled elderly for a

period of five years and with monthly allowances of  $100

or $150, as the case may be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme, an elderly has to be at least over

70  years  old, and must be possessed of at  least  three

disabilities  and also come from a family with  not  more

than $1,000 income per head.  Since the inception of  the

scheme,  and as at 1st November, I understand  that  only

slightly more than 2,000 people have qualified and  about

a  quarter million dollars has been disbursed.  If we  do

some  Mathematics, at $100, we should have  about  50,000

people, and for $150, about 33,000 should qualify.  So it

would  appear that not many people have qualified, and  I

would like to suggest a few revisions for the Minister to

kindly  consider, now that we have about nine  months  of

experience.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the age limit ought to be reduced to, say,

over   55  years  old.   Secondly,  there  should  be   a

redefinition  of disability again, so as to capture  more

people.  I was a little taken aback that a patient  in  a

wheelchair  was  told  that she was not  disabled  enough

because  she  can sell tissue papers to  earn  a  living.

Under  such  difficult conditions, we ought to reconsider

the  definition  of  disability.  Thirdly,  we  can  also

increase the allowance of $100-150 because it does cost a

lot  more to look after a disabled patient.  So  I  would

like  the  Minister to kindly reconsider  because  it  is

really  heartening  to  know that  under  such  difficult

times,  a very generous fund has been set up, but  it  is

not very meaningful if not too many people qualify.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> First, let me address the issues

of  junior  doctors raised by Dr Lily Neo.  I agree  with

her  that  we  want to set in place sensible requirements

for  our doctors, especially the junior doctors, to  make

sure  that  when  they serve the people, their  hours  of

service are reasonable.  And, at the same time, when they

undertake  training,  they have  time  to  develop  their

career further.  The situation in the past had not been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>

entirely satisfactory and that is the reason why we  have

been  progressively setting tougher and tougher standards

for the clusters to meet.  Right now, my Ministry closely

monitors  the  number  of night calls  performed  by  our

junior  doctors, and the latest figures we have is  that,

in  the  two  clusters, 74% of our junior doctors  do  an

average  of six night calls, or less, per month.   So  we

are  setting higher standards for the clusters  to  meet,

and  the  clusters  are  working  hard  to  increase  the

percentage of junior doctors who do six night  calls,  or

less,  per  month.  So, I want to assure the Member  that

the  clusters  will progressively set better  and  better

standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also asked the clusters to ensure, as far as

possible, that the junior doctors are able to go off work

by  lunch time, the day after their night call,  so  that

the total duration of the call is not more than 28 hours.

The  clusters  are, again, trying to  achieve  this.   We

obviously monitor the working hours guidelines  in  other

countries, and we are benchmarking against them.   But  I

hope  Members will understand that based on  the  current

manpower  situation,  we  cannot adopt  these  benchmarks

overnight and, therefore, we are working closely with the

clusters to try and improve this situation.  The clusters

are  actively recruiting more foreign-trained doctors  to

address  the  shortage of junior doctors  in  the  public

sector  hospitals.   I believe these recruitment  efforts

would  be greatly facilitated by the recent expansion  of

the Schedule under the Medical Registration Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her second point about the different training,

whether   you  are  a  foreign-trained  or  local-trained

doctor, let me assure the Member that there is no  policy

of  discrimination in our public sector hospitals, either

for or against overseas-trained Singaporean doctors.  All

doctors  are  appraised  and  assessed  based  on   their

performance  and  ability, and not which  medical  school

they  come from.  Similarly, all opportunities for higher

training and career advancements are awarded on the basis

of  the  doctor's individual merit and whether he or  she

has satisfied the necessary professional criteria.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the need to make sure that our junior doctors are

adequately trained, I totally agree with her.  We need to

make  sure  that  the  training  of  our  junior  doctors

continues  to be a major priority area for  us.   We  are

working  with  our  partners, like the Singapore  Medical

Council  and the Joint Committee on Specialists Training,

to  set  the training objectives, the standards  and  the

programmes   for  both  the  housemen  and  the   medical

officers,  as  well as specialist trainees.   We  have  a

system in place to look at and monitor the training  that

is conducted.  To audit this training programme we have a

system  of collecting trainee feedback so that we can  be

assured  that  these training programmes are  effectively

carried out on the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to the comments raised by several

Members  on  nursing.   The nurses are  a  very  critical

component  of our healthcare system.  We have to  do  all

that  we  can  to train more nurses and to  retain  them,

whether  Singaporean or foreign nurses.  So we have  done

several  things.  First of all, to set the backdrop,  the

public  healthcare sector is short by about  364  nurses,

which means a vacancy position of about 4%.  We are aware

of the current shortage of nurses around the world and we

know   that   we  have  to  compete  for  these   nurses.

Therefore,  the onus is on us to make sure  that  we  can

attract more local nurses to join the profession, and the

foreign nurses that we attract to come to Singapore, stay

with us as long as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have worked with the Nanyang Polytechnic and the

Institute  of  Technical Education  to  raise  the  total

nursing  student intake.  The target now has been  raised

from 728 to 820.  Because of the extensive publicity that

we  have  done,  both  with the  clusters  and  with  the

educational  institutions, we managed to  attract  almost

900 nursing students last year.  So we hope to do just as

well this year.  More importantly, as Dr Chong Weng Chiew

raised,  is really to make sure there is a proper  career

path  for nurses.  I believe he understands what we  have

been  trying  to do the last few years.  It is  not  just

adjusting the pay to be more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>

competitive.  It is also giving the nurses a wider  range

of  career  prospects so that they  can  develop  in  the

management   arena,  if  they  want  to,   administration

management or they can be educators and trainers, or they

can be specialist nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also widened the scope of training

possibilities.  Many of our nurses now go overseas for  a

stint   of   training  and  attachment  under  the   HMDP

programme,  and  they  are very,  very  happy  with  this

arrangement.  Similarly, for foreign nurses.  We  attract

foreign nurses from all over, and over time we would like

to   reduce   our   dependence   on   them   but,   quite

realistically,  I  do not see the  day  when  we  can  be

totally localised.  We have to have both local nurses, as

well  as  foreign nurses, for the simple reason  that  we

need  to  top  up our talent.  We need to  attract  these

nurses  to come here to work with us, and those  who  are

better,  we  would like them to sink roots in  Singapore.

So,  I  assure Members that this is an area that  we  are

definitely  very  concerned  about  and  we   will   work

continuously to improve the career path for nurses,  both

for the local as well as foreign nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the several questions raised on the

step-down  care  sector.  First, Dr  Jennifer  Lee  asked

whether  I  am  happy with the progress so far  since  we

started seriously to develop this framework two or  three

years  ago.  There has been some progress, but  obviously

we  need to make more improvements.  We still have a long

way to go.  I think we have done quite well in developing

and  becoming adequate in terms of facilities.   We  have

put more funding into the step-down care, but we need  to

do more now on standards and making sure that the care is

properly  integrated across the board.  We have also  put

in place means-testing for all the step-down facilities - a  three-tier subsidy level.  So, I think we have set  in

place the key things that we want to do.  But, as I said,

there are many improvements, and the questions raised  by

Members point to the improvements.  So let me take  these

questions one at a time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on means-testing. The most equitable way of

means-testing is per capita income.  This means  dividing

the household income by the number of family members.  So

it  does  not  discriminate  against  bigger  or  smaller

households.  The per capita approach is really  the  most

equitable  and  it  makes sure that there  is  a  minimum

income  level  per head.  If we use family  income  as  a

measure,  then it will disadvantage the larger  families.

So  the per capita income approach, to me, seems the most

sensible approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On how we go about adducing the income, how we go

about assessing the means-test, we require the family  to

produce  income statements.  I think this is a  pragmatic

approach  rather than asking them to self-declare.   And,

we are prepared to accept a number of different documents

as  evidence of family income - whether it is their  pay-slip,  income tax statement, CPF statement, or bank  book

showing  their monthly salary.  We are prepared  also  to

review  this  and accept self-declaration  provided  they

also authorise us to check with IRAS on their income.  So

if  the person says, "I declare this is my income  and  I

authorise the Government to check with IRAS that that  is

the   income",  I  think  we  can  examine  that   as   a

possibility.  But basically we need to have the means  to

determine income and I do not think the various  measures

that we have adopted are overly onerous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked whether we will raise the cut-off

point.  As I have explained earlier, previously the step-down  care  had  a single level of subsidy  of  50%.   We

raised it to 75% for the more deserving, and then we have

a  three-tier system.  Obviously, in due course, we  will

look  at the income cut-off, but I just want to make  the

point that when we changed over, we were already doing it

in a more generous way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked whether we would have a centrally-run

means-testing mechanism.  There are pros and cons.  If we

have  a centrally-run bureaucracy for means-testing, some

Members  earlier preferred variable criteria and variable

means-testing  to  tailor  it  to  the  different  needs,

whether it is in-patient, SOC or step-down

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>

care.  We have to be quite realistic.  The subsidy levels

are  quite  different.   What is suitable  for  step-down

care,  because  the person goes in, spends  weeks,  maybe

months,  may  not  be suitable for in-patient  where  the

episode may be 4-5 days and you want a very quick way  of

doing means-testing.  But we are prepared to look at  the

various possibilities.  Whether or not we should have the

same  system  with MCDS, this is something  that  we  are

studying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo pointed to some statistics about the

high   unscheduled  discharge  rate  and  the   premature

transfers from acute hospitals to community hospitals.  I

agree  that  this  is  not  entirely  satisfactory.   Our

community hospitals are not fully functioning as a  step-down community hospital because they have not quite built

up  their  sub-acute capabilities.  I have to be  candid.

Some  of  our community hospitals are just a  little  bit

better  than nursing homes and, therefore, over the  last

few  years,  we have aggressively moved to upgrade  their

capabilities.   Having  said  so,  we  are   not   slowly

upgrading, particularly the sub-acute capabilities of our

community hospitals, and so as we progress in this  area,

I am confident that this unscheduled discharge rate would

drop.   In fact, a survey by MOH for the last quarter  of

last  year  showed that the average unscheduled discharge

rate was 3.7% overall, and St Luke's Hospital achieved  a

rate of 5.4%.  So there is some improvement.  But I agree

with  Members that we have to move aggressively  so  that

the  community hospitals are able to receive the patients

and take care of them.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that casemix does not

incentivise  or  encourage  the  doctors  to  prematurely

discharge  patients  from the acute hospitals.   This  is

because, over and above the funding based on the episode,

if  a  doctor  says that the patient is not ready  to  be

discharged  and the patient is an outlier, the additional

days  that the patient needs to stay in the hospital will

be  funded by the Ministry of Health on a per diem basis.

So,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>

under DRG, we fund based on the norm cost per episode  as

well as on a per diem basis if it is an outlier.  This is

to  remove  the concerns by Members that if we just  only

fund per episode, then there may be a wrong incentive  to

discharge  patients  early.  I  have  assured  the  House

earlier that we also fund outliers on a per diem basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, we are counting on the doctors to

be    professional   and   to   make   the   professional

determination  when a patient is ready to be  discharged.

And if the patient is not ready to be discharged, we will

continue to fund that case as an outlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the step-down care has been

progressing reasonably well.  Today, we have  51  nursing

homes  with  about 6,700 beds.  75% of the  nursing  home

beds are run by the VWOs, for which our Ministry provides

90%  of  the  capital  cost  as  well  as  the  operating

subsidies,   depending  on  the  means-testing   of   the

patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have encouraged the private players to come into

the  nursing home sector by making land sites  available.

The means-testing allows us to channel subsidies to those

who  are  financially deserving, and  such  patients  can

either  be  managed at the VWO homes or in the accredited

private nursing homes.  As I said, our attention  now  is

to  focus  on quality, and we do so through our licensing

mechanism  and through several clinical quality assurance

initiatives as well as a fairly stringent clinical audit.

It  is our intention to develop this clinic audit so that

every  nursing  home will be inspected  and  audited  for

quality every year.  We have also produced guidelines  to

help  providers enhance the standard of care.  So I agree

with  Members totally that quality will be the focus from

here on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee also wants to know whether we can

involve  more GPs in the Primary Care Partnership  Scheme

(PCPS).  Today, we have 600 GPs in the scheme, and  I  am

sure all Members know of the clinics participating in the

scheme  in  their constituencies.  In Telok Blangah,  for

example, for each of the estate that I look

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>

after,  whether it is Telok Blangah, Dover Road or  Depot

Road, there are at least two clinics participating in the

scheme.   And  we  do  that systematically  for  all  the

constituencies to make sure that there are enough clinics

for the elderly to have access to the GPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think accessibility to the clinics is

a problem.  But we will continue to encourage more GPs to

sign  up.  Right now, we have 600 and we will try  harder

to get more to sign up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards norm cost, we will continue to review it.

This  is  very  important.   If  we  set  norm  cost  too

generously, then, of course, we are encouraging inflation

and higher cost.  We want to set a sensible norm cost and

try  to persuade the providers to try and meet this  norm

cost.  Of course, if we set it too low, then Members  are

concerned  that this will be at the expense  of  quality.

So we will have to review it regularly and make sure that

the  norm cost is sensible and, at the same time, it does

not lead to cost escalation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan wants to know the plan for the number of

community  hospitals.   Our  intention  is  to  have  one

community hospital co-located with each regional  general

hospital.  So, for the next general hospital that we  are

building  in  Jurong, we will have a  community  hospital

there  too.  Through this plan, we are confident that  we

will  have enough community hospitals to serve the  needs

of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our intention is to increase the proportion of

private  nursing homes from the current  25%  to  40%  by

2010,  so that the private sector can contribute actively

in  this  step-down  care sector.  We have  tendered  out

several sites.  The development is on schedule.   So  the

provision  of  the  private nursing homes  is  coming  on

stream  as  we planned.  And by extending the subsidy  to

the  private nursing homes, we are, in fact,  creating  a

level  playing  field between the VWOs  and  the  private

sector.  In so doing, we think this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>

will  incentivise the private sector to participate  more

actively in this sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, my Ministry runs annual dialogues

with the key providers in the step-down care sector.   To

this  end, we will welcome any new initiatives  from  the

private  sector  to  develop the  step-down  care  sector

further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on ElderShield and IDAPE. I commend Mr Gan

Kim  Yong for his patience and his perseverance.  I  hope

he  will  continue  to  be patient,  because  the  claims

pattern  cannot be determined in a matter of months.   It

must  be  clear after a matter of years.  So I  think  we

need  time  for the claims pattern to settle.  With  that

claims  pattern data, we will be able to make a  sensible

review of ElderShield.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong is an extremely sensible person and

he  knows  that  there  is  this trilateral  relationship

between  premiums, pay-outs and qualifying criteria.   We

cannot have low premiums, high pay-out and low qualifying

criteria.  Something has to give.  So we will look at the

system  when we get better claims history.  But  I  would

like  to  assure  him that we do have  a  clause  in  our

contract  with the two private sector insurers,  that  if

the  pay-out is less than what they anticipated in  their

calculation of the premiums, there will be a rebate.   It

is in the contract.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Fang Ai Lian asked about the IDAPE pay-outs. To

date,  more  than 3,600 Singaporeans are benefiting  from

the  monthly IDAPE pay-outs.  I agree with her  that  the

budgetary  provision  for the IDAPE  has  been  set  very

generously, because we expected a higher pay-out pattern.

As  it turned out, the people who qualify are fewer  than

budgeted.  But we have to work this system for a few more

months  to  be confident that this pattern is indeed  the

level of disabilities in our senior citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also qualify that for those who are already

handicapped  or  severely  disabled,  there  is  no   age

criterion.  Age criterion above 70 years old is only  for

those who are currently not disabled.  And if they become

disabled subsequently,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>

then they qualify under IDAPE.  For those who are already

handicapped and below 70 years old, they already qualify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take into account her suggestions, but let me

respond  quickly.  First, to reduce the age limit.    The

reason  why  we set the age limit at 70 is  to  encourage

those  below  70 to opt into ElderShield.   What  we  are

saying is that if we put those above 70 in the risk  pool

of  the ElderShield, it will cause a very high burden  on

the  rest of the people in the risk pool.  The Government

undertakes to fund the risk of those above 70 years  old,

so  that  the  premiums of those in the ElderShield  risk

pool  is  lower.  So the age limit is determined on  that

basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the definition of disability, we chose three

ADLs,  because that is the market standard.  This is  the

current insurance standard.  We are working with the  GPs

very  actively to make sure that their assessment of what

constitutes three ADLs is consistent and sensible  across

the  board.  With experience, I am sure we can  sit  down

with  the  College of Family Physicians  and the  SMA  to

make  sure  that the criteria can meet the needs  of  the

insurance companies and can serve the needs of Government

without  causing a huge pay-out if we change the criteria

too  drastically.  I think there is scope for us to fine-tune the criteria of what constitutes three ADLs as we go

along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we can increase the allowance, this is

something  that  we  have  go back  to  the  Ministry  of

Finance.   The fact that we have over budgeted  does  not

mean  that we can increase the allowance.  We have to  go

back  to  MOF  and  make  out a  sensible  case  why  the

allowance  of $100 or $150 ought to be increased  further

to help these people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have addressed most of the issues.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, can I seek clarification

from the Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, when I listened to the

Minister's reply to Dr Lily Neo's query on the statistics

of  mortality at the community hospitals, I am  a  little

bit  disturbed.  Because, sometime ago, when casemix  was

brought  before this House, I did warn the Ministry  that

they  must  be  able to match the casemix programme  that

they  are  introducing with the high end step-down  care.

When  the Minister says that the community hospitals  are

inadequate to take care of the acute cases discharged  by

our  hospitals, I think it is very telling.  We have  not

actually planned for this high end care very well  before

we  introduced casemix.  What I want is an assurance from

the  Minister that more funding should be put  into  this

high  end care, or else we will get more mortality,  like

the  statistics given by Dr Lily Neo.  I am  asking  that

the Minister should, first, make sure that the discharged

patients  are  carefully  evaluated;  and,  second,  more

funding for this high end step-down care.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I have explained in my

answer,  first  of  all, casemix is not  the  culprit  in

discharging patients.  We have to trust the  doctor.   If

the  doctor  says  that  the  patient  is  ready  to   be

discharged, that is his professional opinion.  I think we

have   to  trust  him.   The  casemix  system  does   not

incentivise  the doctor or the hospital to discharge  the

patient,  because, under casemix, we are subventing  both

the funding per episode, and if the patient needs to stay

longer in the hospital, we will continue to fund on a per

diem  basis. That has been my assurance and that is  what

is happening on the ground.  When Dr Lily Neo quoted this

study done on St Luke's Hospital which showed a very high

unscheduled discharge, the sub-acute capabilities of  our

community  hospitals  are still  not  there  yet,  and  I

readily admit to it.  And that is the reason why  we  are

building  the  capabilities.  We have a regional  general

hospital  with  a  geriatric department  supporting  each

community  hospital, so that the hospital does  not  just

discharge  the patient and shed its responsibility.   The

regional  general  hospitals  continue  to  provide   the

professional  support  to the nursing  homes  within  the

regional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>

catchment.   We  are  providing  the  funding   for   the

community   hospitals   to  develop   their   capability,

particularly in the sub-acute areas, as I mentioned.  And

as  a  result,  our survey showed that the situation  has

improved  and  my Ministry will continue to monitor  this

and make sure that the situation gets better and better.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I want to assure Dr Tan Cheng Bock that casemix

is  not the cause for premature discharge.  He and I must

agree  that,  in  the  end, we  have  to  depend  on  the

professional judgement of the doctors in signing off  the

discharge.  And I believe that all our doctors  discharge

that   responsibility  professionally.    They   do   not

discharge a patient if they, in their opinion, think that

the patient is not ready.  And our system is such that if

the  patient  is not ready, the patient continues  to  be

funded by us.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you, Minister, for the

assurance.   Sir, in year 2000, the Health Ministry  here

set up a Group Purchasing Office to buy drugs in bulk  at

better prices for the entire public sector.  This led  to

savings  of $12 million a year, despite the fact that  it

bought only roughly 700 essential drugs this way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospitals and polyclinics bought other non-standard

drugs  themselves from drug companies.  This has resulted

in differences in the selling prices for certain drugs at

the  various public hospitals and polyclinics.  May I ask

the  Minister why the Group Purchasing Office  could  not

extend  its service to include buying all drugs  for  the

public   institutions?   Now  that  the  Government   has

involved  the  private sector in the care  of  subsidised

needy patients as in the Primary Care Partnership Scheme,

why  has  this  scheme not been extended to  include  the

private sector to save patients' medicine costs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, the liver damaging drug "Slim 10"

was   brought   into  Singapore  and  sold   as   Chinese

proprietary medicine.  Chinese proprietary medicines and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>

health  supplements were sold over the  counter  products

that  could  be  purchased  without  prescription.   This

contrasts  with  western medicines that  are  stringently

evaluated  by  the  Health Sciences Authority  for  their

quality, safety and efficacy before marketing is granted.

"Slim  10"  has caused two persons to suffer  from  liver

failure and one person to die from liver failure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Ministry of Health done to-date to

prevent  such  repeat incidents?  As most  consumers  are

trusting  the  local system that the  Government  has  in

place to ensure that products available for sale are safe

for  consumption, are there now more stringent  marketing

regulations for Chinese proprietary medicines and  health

supplements?  What has the Ministry done to  improve  our

system to ensure that no adulterated drugs are sold?  Has

the  Health Sciences Authority been more proactive in the

surveillance  of  the  available  drugs  sold  over   the

counter?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I go on to my next cut, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you. Sir, on biomedical

research, Singapore is continuing to drive for excellence

in  biomedical  research  and development.   Whilst  this

holds  the promise of tremendous advantages for  mankind,

especially  in  finding new treatments for  diseases  and

promises  of vast monetary benefits in a new economy,  we

must be sensitive to the ethical, legal and social issues

in this area, especially in our multi-cultural and multi-religious society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Ministry of Health done to ensure

proper  conduct  in  the  various  aspects  of  research,

especially  in  clinical trials and human stem  research?

Are  patients  and  donors able  to  make  voluntary  and

informed  choices?   Are  there guidelines  in  place  to

ensure  that  donors  of  research  are  not  under   any

financial,  or therapeutic inducements, or coercions  for

their donations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Ministry of Health's stand on human

cloning?  Does the Ministry of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>

Health  specify  the distinction between surplus  embryos

and  research embryos and the protection of human embryos

because  there is contention that human life begins  from

the moment of conception?  How do we ensure protection of

the human embryo against the scientific value of research

embryos  and  the potential benefits to  be  reaped  from

research?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, there is no comprehensive legal framework

in  Singapore governing research on human embryos, except

for  guidelines,  namely,  the  "Guidelines  for  Private

Healthcare  Institution Providing  Assisted  Reproductive

Services".   Should not such research be effectively  and

efficiently monitored and regulated?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong Aljunied -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, I declare my interest as a

practising psychiatrist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we may boast to have one of the best

healthcare systems in the world, I am afraid that we  may

not  say the same for our mental health service.  We  are

about  50  years  behind time in the  way  we  treat  our

psychiatric patients.  Sir, in the past, before effective

medical  treatment  was  found for  the  mental  illness,

patients  with severe psychiatric illness were locked  up

in  jails, or in asylums.  Such a custodial approach  was

not only inhuman but was detrimental to the overall well-being of the patient.  Many of them became, what we call,

institutionalised,  lost  their  identity  and  literally

became a zombie.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the discovery of effective medical treatment

and  a  better  understanding of the  underlying  organic

causes of mental illness, coupled with the realisation of

the deplorable state of mental institutions, the movement

to  deinstitutionalise  mental  patients  and  help  them

reintegrate  back  to the communities was  started  in  a

number  of developed countries in the middle of the  last

century.   While  there have been  some  hiccups  in  the

process  of  deinstitutionalisation  in  some  of   these

countries, the overall result has so far been positive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we missed the opportunities to move towards a

community care model when the Woodbridge Hospital was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>

redesigned and rebuilt in the late 1980s and  1990s.   By

then,  much of the world already had moved on or  in  the

process  of closing down mental institutions and  getting

their   psychiatric  patients  to  move   back   to   the

communities.  Yet, in Singapore, we continue to lock them

up.   Worse  still, we miss another opportunity  recently

when  the Ministry of Health started the process of, what

they call, "decanting" long-stay patients from Woodbridge

Hospital  to the Pelangi Village Complex under MCDS,  and

this  continues the approach of custodial care.   To  use

the  word  "decanting" is what I find  demeaning  to  the

mental  patients.  This process, to me, I would  describe

it   as  "trans-institutionalisation",  ie,  moving   the

patient from one institution to another institution.  One

look  at  the  way in which this complex is  constructed,

with  high fencing and with patients pacing about in  the

complex,  stuck in their catatonic state, you  will  know

what I mean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here, I urge the Ministry to review its overall

approach   and  philosophy  towards  the  mental   health

service.   I would like to suggest that the Ministry  set

up  a  Mental  Health  Service  Committee  consisting  of

representatives  from the patients and  their  advocates,

mental  health  professionals  and  policy  makers.   The

Committee  should be tasked to: (1) chart  the  long-term

direction  of  our  mental  health  service  based  on  a

community care model with comprehensive support  for  the

patients, in terms of their medical care, rehabilitation,

psycho-social  needs, housing and employment  assistance;

(2)  educate  the  public in order  to  destigmatise  the

mental  illness; (3) review and revamp our mental  health

legislation  to facilitate community care and  treatment.

I  also  suggest that the Ministry set up a Mental Health

Service Directorate, with the appropriate budget, to take

full  charge of the implementation of this mental  health

service as proposed by the Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are already half a century behind in the way

we  view this mental health service.  But it is time  for

us  to  make changes.  All is not lost.  Because we could

learn  from  those  countries  who  have  undertaken  the

process  of  deinstitutionalising  their  mental   health

services.  We can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>

learn  from  their experience, avoid their  mistakes  and

thus  shorten  our  learning curve.   Sir,  we  owe  this

obligation to this group of our fellow citizens  who  are

unfortunate enough to suffer from mental illness.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Sir, I want to thank Dr Lily Neo and Dr Ong

Seh  Hong for their questions.  I begin, first,  with  Dr

Lily Neo's question on bulk purchasing and Slim 10.  With

regard to bulk purchasing, the Group Purchasing Office of

the  two hospital clusters already bulk purchase standard

drugs  and  commonly  used  non-standard  drugs  for  the

polyclinics  and health institutions.   As  Dr  Lily  Neo

noted,  this has resulted in a lot of savings.   But  the

institutions  have  also carried out some  of  their  own

purchases for non-standard drugs where smaller quantities

are  needed because it is more efficient and flexible  in

meeting  their  needs.  The Ministry of Health  has  also

requested  that clusters should explore the extension  of

these  services  with  willing partners  in  the  private

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Chinese proprietary medicines (CPM)

and  the  Slim  10 incident, the regulatory controls  for

Chinese  proprietary medicines were introduced in  phases

from  September  1999  and  were  fully  implemented   by

September  2001.   All CPM importers, wholesalers,  local

manufacturers  and  repackers must  be  licensed  by  the

Health  Sciences  Authority.  Among the things  that  the

Health  Sciences Authority looks at include an assessment

of  the  safety and quality of these medications.   There

are  also  full  labelling requirements before  they  are

allowed for local sale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the Slim 10 incident in 2002, MOH has

further  enhanced  the control of CPM through  additional

measures.   Since January 2003, all CPMs  must  carry  an

additional  label  on  the outer  sealed  packs  in  both

English  and Chinese.  This label says "Allowed for  sale

as a Chinese Proprietary Medicine".  This helps consumers

to better differentiate CPM from western drugs.  From 1st

January 2004, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>

test  reports issued by accredited laboratories  will  be

recognised and accepted by HSA.  The existing product and

quality  surveillance programme carried out  by  HSA  has

been  enhanced  and strengthened.  Also,  all  local  and

overseas  CPM manufacturers will be subjected to periodic

good  manufacturing practice audits, in  accordance  with

international standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPM regulatory framework in Singapore has

already been enhanced to a considerable extent and we now

have  one  of the strictest framework in the  world.   In

spite  of  this, no system, short of complete prohibition

of  products, can absolutely guarantee the prevention  of

deliberate  adulteration, as  occurred  in  the  Slim  10

incident,  and which can potentially occur  in  even  the

strictest of systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo's next question was with regard to

regulation of clinical trials.  For clinical drug trials,

a  clinical trial certificate is required from the Health

Sciences  Authority by law before research  can  proceed.

Issuance  of  a trial certificate is conditional  on  the

research  meeting  the  requirements  stipulated  in  the

Singapore  Guidelines  on Good Clinical  Practice,  which

include   specific  requirements  for   proper   informed

consent.   For other forms of clinical research involving

patients  or human subjects, there are ethical guidelines

on  research  involving  human  subjects  issued  by  the

National   Medical   Ethics   Committee.    Under   these

guidelines,  hospitals  and  institutions,   where   such

research is carried out, have Ethics Committees to review

the ethics of research projects and approval is necessary

before such research can proceed.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo was also concerned about human embryos.

Under  the guidelines for private healthcare institutions

providing assisted reproduction services, Regulation 4 of

the  Private  Hospitals and Medical Clinics  Regulations,

there  are guidelines regulating the use of human embryos

below  14  days  created  through in-vitro  fertilisation

techniques but which are not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>

used  in  assisted  reproduction  treatments.   This   is

permissible,  provided stringent regulatory  stipulations

are met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to donation of parts for research, no

person is under any compulsion to give, nor is any person

under  an  obligation to accept these  donations.   These

provisions   in  the  Medical  (Therapy,  Education   and

Research)  Act  ensure that patient donors are  protected

through having to make informed choices and are not under

any  financial  inducement.  But to further  enhance  our

regulatory  oversight  over biomedical  R&D  areas  where

there  are  greater  ethical concerns,  the  Ministry  of

Health  is  in the process of drafting a new  Bill  which

will  provide  for  the regulation  of  human  stem  cell

research  and  human  tissue research  and  banking,  and

provisions to extend the regulation to selected new types

of  biomedical  R&D as these evolve.  It  will  have  the

necessary regulatory and enforcement provisions to enable

the   Ministry  to  issue  licences  for  biomedical  R&D

facilities,  and monitor and control selected  biomedical

R&D  activities.   MOH  intends  to  enact  the  new  Act

sometime this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong was concerned about insane patients

being  locked up in hospitals.  I want to assure  Dr  Ong

that  we  have  come a long way since the  day  when  all

insane patients were just locked up in asylums.  In fact,

we   have  moved  into  the  area  of  preventive  mental

healthcare.   We have put in place a comprehensive  range

of  community  and institution-based programmes  for  the

mentally disordered.  These include various public health

initiatives  and  community  services,  such  as  nursing

homes,   rehabilitation  homes  and  day   rehabilitation

centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two major initiatives have been implemented in

Singapore.   They aim to educate the public on prevention

strategies,   decrease   stigmatisation,   and   increase

awareness  of  mental  conditions  and  availability   of

treatment.   The first initiative is the Mind  Your  Mind

Programme,  which  is  a  10-year  prevention   programme

started by the Health Promotion Board in 2001 as part  of

the National Mental Programme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>

The second initiative is the Early Psychosis Intervention

Programme,   which  is  a  comprehensive  and  integrated

treatment programme that targets the reduction of chronic

disability amongst schizophrenic patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge Hospital has also formulated long-term

and  immediate  action plans to achieve a  more  balanced

model  of  community and institutional psychiatric  care.

These  plans include enhancing the quality of  in-patient

care   and   ramping  up  the  development  of  community

psychiatric  care  services in the  next  three  to  five

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the day, whether a patient should

remain  in an institution or whether the patient  can  be

sent  home is a clinical decision, which we will have  to

leave  to the competent psychiatrists at our institutions

to decide.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the health of workers is a key

factor in influencing their productivity.  As the economy

of  Singapore  is heavily dependent on its  workforce,  a

healthy    workforce   will   enhance    the    country's

competitiveness in an increasingly global market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With about 2.1 million or 65% of Singaporeans aged

15  years  or  more working, the workplace  is  an  ideal

setting  for  the  development  and  delivery  of  health

promotion  programmes to the workers.   Workplace  health

promotion  programmes  should include  a  combination  of

educational, organisational and environmental  activities

designed  to support behaviour that is conducive  to  the

health of employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Ministry of Health help strategise the

uptake  of  workplace  health promotion  in  the  private

sector with the following four emphasis:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) As management remains the main driver behind

these programmes, there is need, therefore, to secure the

support  of a company's management with the provision  of

adequate   support  of  the  administrators   or   health

facilitators,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>

preferably facilitators with a healthcare background;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) There should be an expansion of the local scope

of   occupational  health  and  safety  to  include   the

promotion of workers' health through healthy living;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Financial assistance in the form of grants would

be   of   value   to  help  jumpstart  health   promotion

programmes, particularly for small workplaces; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Have in place guidelines on how to organise

effective  workplace  health  promotion  programmes   for

workplaces of different workforce and industry sector  to

adopt.    This  "cookbook"  approach  has  a   place   in

increasing  the uptake, particularly among new  companies

embracing the programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, on workplace health and

workers' health, I would like to support what Dr Lily Neo

has raised.  One other main concern that I would like  to

share  with the House on preventive healthcare is how  to

help Singaporeans reduce health risk factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these risks? They are the risks arising

from  not  eating  right,  not  exercising  enough,   and

smoking.   Let us take our diet, for example.  We  should

reduce salt and saturated fat intake, and eat more fruits

and vegetables.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Report 2002 showed that three-quarters of heart disease and stroke could be attributed

to  tobacco use, low fruit and vegetable intake, and lack

of  exercise.   More than half of deaths  and  disability

from  heart disease and stroke can be cut down.   All  it

takes  are  national  effort and  individual  actions  to

reduce  health risk factors, such as smoking, high  blood

pressure, high cholesterol and obesity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have put in much time and resources

to  promote and facilitate intervention programmes at the

workplace.   We  do  it  at the  tripartite  level  as  a

collective effort, involving the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>

Government,  union,  employers and all  Singaporeans.   I

commend the efforts of the HPB, but we have to do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we need to do next? We have to "awake the

giant    within"   Singaporeans   and   cultivate   self-responsibility through health risk management.  Today, we

still   see  Singaporeans  choosing  "not  to  face   the

reality".  They avoid health screening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us make a collaborated and structured effort to

make all Singaporeans aware of their own health risk.  We

can  start with basic health screening, followed by  ways

of    empowering    Singaporeans   to    take    personal

responsibility  for their health risk  factors.   We  can

help  create the "internal drive" within Singaporeans  to

stay  healthy.  In short, raise their awareness and  help

them  to  create the drive to take action.  What are  the

actions  we  are talking about?  It is just  as  easy  as

saying  CHEERS,  which stands for Cease smoking,  Healthy

Eating, Exercise Regularly, manage Stress!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last two years, the NTUC Health

Outreach  Programme has helped 50,000  workers  to  start

basic screening and monitoring their health risk factors.

I  would like to ask the Ministry of Health for an update

of  what  it  plans to do to help Singaporeans  regularly

assess  and  monitor their own health  risk  factors  and

basic  health profile, and better manage all  these  risk

factors for better health.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, I propose that

the  Ministry of Health re-examine and explore more  ways

in which minority races can learn about the importance of

good health in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare promotion plays an integral part in

ensuring  that  Singaporeans  are  better  equipped  with

knowledge  critical  to living a healthy  lifestyle  well

into   their   golden  years.   It   is   important   for

Singaporeans  to  develop healthy habits  through  health

promotion  programmes.  The nation-wide Community  Health

Screening  Programme is not only a good exercise  but  an

important one at that.  It would at the very least ensure

that our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>

people  are  able to manage their health in a proper  and

educated manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through health screening, Singaporeans will then be

able  to  spot  the tell-tale signs warning  of  possible

illness  early  and to seek treatment in time.   This  is

especially  true for cases of hypertension and  diabetes.

We  have  a  variety  of healthcare promotion  programmes

initiated by the Health Promotion Board.  However, I  was

disappointed  to learn that a significant  proportion  of

minority  races  do  not know enough about  these  health

promotion programmes.  I discovered that this was because

the  methods  used  to  disseminate  information  to  the

general  public,  although widespread,  could  be  better

targeted.  It is critical for us to reach out to our non-mainstream language speaking minorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the health promotion exercise in Singapore

assumes  that the audience is proficient in English.   It

assumes  this  of  the  many  elderly  targeted  by   the

Community Health Screening Programme.  As many Members in

this House will attest to, most of these individuals  are

usually  conversant in dialects and speak  little  or  no

English.   For  example,  I  have  come  across   several

instances where some minority race constituents  are  not

aware  of  the reasons why the Community Health Screening

Programme is conducted, much less how they can  go  about

getting  a  health  screening done.  This  was  primarily

because  it  was not explained to them in a  manner  they

could  understand or, more specifically,  in  a  language

they  could  understand through the various  media  forms

employed now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to consider how healthcare

promotions  can  better  reach  the  minority  races   in

Singapore.   Perhaps, it would be helpful if  the  ethnic

self-help  groups' assistance could be enlisted.   Having

more  promotional  materials in  Malay  and  Tamil  would

certainly help.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, Singaporeans are

reasonably health-conscious, both in terms of making sure

they are healthy, and also in terms of knowing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>

more  about  health matters.  Our Government,  especially

the  Ministry  of Health and the medical fraternity,  has

done a great deal to try and enhance health promotion and

dissemination of health-related knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that prevention is better than cure. In

this  connection,  Sir, what more  can  the  Ministry  of

Health  do  to bring about greater health promotion,  ie,

having  a  healthy  nation  of  citizens,  and  propagate

knowledge  on health, diseases, etc?  Would the  Ministry

consider  stepping  up the use of  the  mass  media,  eg,

newspapers, TV, radio, Internet and the MOH website,  and

also the schools and workplaces, to promote knowledge  on

health  matters  on a higher scale?  For  example,  there

should  be  more TV shows and radio talks to educate  our

people  about diseases and health care in simple language

in the four major languages.  A great deal can be done in

our  primary  and  secondary schools,  and  our  tertiary

institutions too, to promote health, guidance on  healthy

living, knowledge on health, preventive measures to avoid

or   reduce  health  problems.   There  should  be  well-organised healthcare and health knowledge classes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health promotion may be enhanced also if there is

less  tension  in  life.  In this  connection,  does  the

Ministry  of Health do progressive research in  and  work

with  other  Ministries, eg, the Ministry  of  Education,

Ministry  of  Manpower  and  the  Ministry  of  Community

Development  and  Sports, to coordinate health  promotion

through   education,   proper   lifestyle,   sports   and

recreation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, as

of  October 2002, 24% of adult Singaporean residents aged

18-69 are overweight, while another 6% are obese.  Weight

problems are largely attributable to a less than  healthy

lifestyle,  and  we note that there are  well-established

relations  between excessive body weight and  conditions,

such as diabetes, hypertension and osteoarthritis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the Ministry for having embarked on large-scale programmes to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>

combat   obesity  among  children,  such  as  the  School

Tuckshop Programme and the Trim and Fit Programme.  These

programmes have certainly helped to reduce obesity  among

children  from  14% in 1992, to 10% in 1996,  and  having

remained steady after that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has also started the Workplace

Health Promotion Grant in 2001.  Its target audience  is,

presumably, our workers.  The question is: how  effective

has  this grant been among our workers?  How many of  our

workers have benefited from this grant and how have  they

benefited?   In  1998, our death rate of 76  per  100,000

from  coronary heart disease is higher than the rates  of

58  and  60  in Canada and Australia, respectively.   Our

death  rate of 29 per 100,000 from stroke is also  higher

than  the  rate of 14 in Canada and Australia.  Have  our

figures improved since then?

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also seek to ask whether the Ministry has

conducted  a  detailed profiling of our adult  population

with  medical  conditions  to  see  whether  there  is  a

relation between their cultural or ethnic backgrounds and

a  propensity  towards certain diseases.  Is  educational

level  also a relevant factor in this relation?   If  so,

Sir, I ask whether there are in place specific programmes

that   target   these  specific  groups.  Such   targeted

programmes  would be more effective in  reaching  out  to

these  groups who may speak certain languages,  prefer  a

certain diet and subscribe to certain cultural practices.

These programmes can be more culture-sensitive and should

result in better buy-in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, a recent study in the US shows that the

weight patients vary in their readiness to adopt specific

weight  loss behaviours.  For instance, some are  willing

to  exercise  more  but not reduce  fat  in  their  diet.

Others are willing to eat more fruits and vegetables  but

are  not willing to eat smaller portions of food.  So  if

doctors can identify which behaviour

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>

patients  are  willing to change, they can assist  in  an

effective weight-loss programme.  But doctors are usually

constrained  by  time  and  not  reimbursed  for  obesity

counselling.  Will  the  Ministry consider  studying  the

effectiveness  of  individual  obesity  counselling   and

perhaps later start a grant to encourage the same?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the promotion of healthy

living,  such as having a well-balanced diet,  exercising

regularly  and  not smoking, is essential to  maintain  a

population of healthy citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many diseases can be prevented by maintaining

healthy lifestyles.  This means that the Health Promotion

Board  should not just be persistent but also  accelerate

such promotion. The hallmark of success of such promotion

is to be able to reach as many people in the community as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the publication of information booklets,

organising  of  health  talks and  health  screening  may

increase  the  level of awareness among  Singaporeans  on

health  matters but it does not make Singaporeans healthy

if they do not act on this information or advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to adopt a more structured approach to

ensure that health promotion messages are disseminated to

Singaporeans, especially the heartlanders and they  adopt

healthy lifestyles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in North-West CDC, we have formed the largest

network of brisk walking clubs in Singapore. To-date,  we

have 75 clubs, comprising over 8,000 members who exercise

regularly  to  keep  healthy.  I  hope  that  the  Health

Promotion  Board can be more proactive, to  work  closely

with  the  CDCs  to have more effective outreach  in  the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what kind of promotion has

been done to achieve the healthy lifestyle message?   Has

this  programme been successful in reaching the community

at  large? Are there plans to partner with the  CDCs  and

what  are  the  key  performance targets  of  the  Health

Promotion Board?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I want to thank Members

for their interest in health promotion. We have made good

progress   in   improving  the  health  of  Singaporeans.

However,  we  need  to reduce the prevalence  of  cancer,

coronary  heart disease and stroke, the major  causes  of

ill health and deaths among Singaporeans.  Other diseases

of public health concern include myopia and osteoporosis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Promotion Board was established two years

ago to spearhead national health education, promotion and

disease prevention programmes.  The main thrusts  of  the

Health Promotion Board (HPB) are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to educate the public on healthy living. The

four pillars of a healthy lifestyle are regular exercise,

healthy  eating, no smoking and managing  stress.   I  am

glad to note that many Members mentioned all these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, where it is cost-effective, screen children,

adults  and  elderly for common illnesses to  detect  and

treat these conditions early for better outcomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, collaborate with voluntary and community

organisations, including CDCs, professional organisations

to ensure a wide reach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, create a supportive environment for healthy

living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang brought up issues

on  workplace health promotion.  HPB has been encouraging

companies  to implement a comprehensive workplace  health

promotion  programme.   Several strategies  are  used  to

secure  management support, for example, chief  executive

officers  and senior management are invited to  sign  the

HEALTH  charter,  ie, Helping Employees Achieve  Lifetime

Health.    And   through  this  charter,   pledge   their

commitment to implement Workplace Health Promotion  (WHP)

programmes in their workplace.  There are also  breakfast

and  lunch  meetings  which are organised  for  CEOs  and

senior management to inform them of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>

the  benefits of implementing WHP programmes.  A  booklet

and  a video CD targeted at CEOs have been developed  and

distributed to CEOs to facilitate their understanding  of

workplace health concepts. A matching WHP grant of up  to

$5,000 for each workplace was made available from 2001 to

encourage  workplaces to implement  WHP  programmes.  To-date,  about 200 workplaces have been awarded the  grant.

For a more holistic approach to workplace health, HPB has

integrated  occupational health and safety,  productivity

and worklife balance in the WHP programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HPB conducts training courses to equip facilitators

of workplaces with skills to organise, plan and implement

WHP  programmes. A guidebook and a video CD  on  WHP  for

facilitators  have been developed to help them  plan  and

start WHP programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the components of a WHP programme is basic

health  screening.  HPB, in its consultancy and  training

programmes  for workplaces, emphasises the importance  of

conducting  basic  health screening  for  their  workers.

Workplaces  are  encouraged  to  include  screening   for

hypertension,  diabetes, high blood cholesterol  and  for

obesity  in  their health screening packages.   They  are

advised  to  monitor  the results of screening  of  their

workers and to organise intervention programmes for  them

based on the results of screening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Khalis wanted to know whether MOH has a

profile  of persons suffering from various diseases.   He

suggested that health promotion programmes be targeted at

high-risk  groups.  The major causes of  ill  health  and

death  among  Singaporeans are  coronary  heart  disease,

cancer  and stroke.  The risk factors for coronary  heart

disease   are   smoking,   high  blood   pressure,   high

cholesterol  levels,  obesity,  physical  inactivity  and

diabetes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national health surveys conducted regularly by

MOH  provide information on the prevalence of these  risk

factors  by age, sex and ethnic groups.  The 1998  survey

showed that the prevalence of these risk

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>

factors  is higher among the Malays and Indians, compared

with  the  general population.  For example, the  smoking

habit  is  most prevalent among Malay men, 43%,  compared

with Indian men, 30%, and Chinese men, 24%.  Smoking rate

among Malay women aged 18-24 years is 13%, compared  with

5%  among  Chinese  women, and  2%  among  Indian  women.

Diabetes  is  more  prevalent among  Indians  (16%)  than

Malays (11%) or Chinese (8%).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health promotion programmes are planned based on the

results   of   the  national  health  surveys.    Special

programmes  targeted at the high-risk  groups  have  been

implemented.  For example, a special programme  known  as

the  Ramandan programme has been implemented  to  address

the  high  smoking  rate among the Malay  community.  The

programme is a collaboration between HPB, MUIS and  other

Malay-Muslim organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Arthur Fong had asked about health promotion

activities  aimed at minority groups. In general,  health

promotion  programmes,  such  as  the  National   Healthy

Lifestyle  Campaign, National Smoking  Control  Campaign,

National  Myopia  Prevention  Programme,  Breast   Screen

Singapore   and  the  Osteoporosis  Prevention  Programme

target  all ethnic groups and media campaigns are carried

in  the four official languages through television, radio

and the newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the higher prevalence of risk factors for

chronic diseases among Malays and Indians, special  media

programmes   have  been  produced.   A  20-part   cooking

programme  was  aired  on  Suria  to  educate  the  Malay

community   on  cooking  tasty  and  healthy  traditional

dishes.   In  addition, "Rentak Sihat" a  13-part  health

programme was also telecast on Suria and focused  on  how

Malays  can  keep  fit  and stay healthy  through  simple

exercises.  HPB also works closely with Berita Harian  to

publish   stories  on  a  variety  of  health   promotion

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Tamil media, a 13-part health

programme  addressing health issues such as diabetes  and

hypertension, prevention and proper treatment to  prevent

complications  was  produced in  Tamil  for  telecast  on

Vasantham  Central.   We  will  continue  to  focus   our

attention  on high-risk groups and provide more publicity

on  health  promotion activities in the Malay  and  Tamil

media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are correct that prevention is better than

cure.  To achieve a healthy lifestyle, we need to  change

the  mindset  of  Singaporeans. To do this,  we  need  to

incorporate  the help of the community, CDCs,  grassroots

to bring this message to the ordinary Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the

Minister of State for his answers.  I would like to thank

the  Minister  for  Health  for his  good,  comprehensive

answers and, at times, even over-generous answers. Sir, I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2). Dr Lily Neo.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code OA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in January this year, it was reported in the

Straits Times that a doctor was jailed for two months for

tax evasion by the Courts and suspended from practice for

six  months  by the Singapore Medical Council.   And,  in

February,  a second case was reported. Again, the  doctor

was  jailed by the Courts and suspended from practice for

six  months  by  the  Singapore  Medical  Council.   Both

doctors were ordered to pay penalties of over three times

the amount of unpaid taxes by the Courts.  The doctors in

both  instances were rightly punished by the  Courts  for

their  offences  but  they were  also  penalised  by  the

Singapore Medical Council.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I have the Minister for Health's comments on

this  kind of "double punishment"?  Is the suspension  by

the Singapore Medical Council, especially the six months,

not  too  harsh?  As medical care is a very  personalised

service  and  patients under the doctors' care  would  be

affected   by   the   suspensions,  do   we   take   into

consideration   the   patients'   needs?    Rather   than

suspension  from  practice, would it  not  be  better  to

deploy  them to work without pay in our public hospitals,

community hospitals or VWOs?

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Health has been recruiting

doctors  from  non-traditional sources from  neighbouring

countries  such  as  Myanmar whose medical  degrees  were

recognised before.  According to the Ministry of  Health,

this was done because there has been a shortage of junior

doctors  in the public hospitals.  May I ask the Minister

for  Health  whether  he can assure the  House  that  the

standard  of  care  of  patients from  these  doctors  is

acceptable?  Has the Ministry of Health collected data on

mishaps and mistakes in public hospitals because of  poor

standards of care?  Has there been a survey done  on  the

causes of mistakes in the public hospitals?  Is there  an

assessment  done for the non-traditional  source  doctors

employed  from the neighbouring countries?   Is  there  a

comparison  and assessment on the standards of  the  non-traditional  sources doctors employed from  each  of  the

neighbouring countries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I have your permission to take the cut on

behalf of Mr Yeo Guat Kwang on training support for step-down services?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please proceed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you. The Ministry currently has

a Health Manpower Development Programme (HMDP) to develop

skills   needed  in  specific  areas  of  the  healthcare

industry.   Mr  Yeo  Guat  Kwang  understands  that   the

Ministry  plans  to  extend the  programme  to  providing

training for staff providing step-down care services.  Mr

Yeo Guat Kwang would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>

like  to ask the Ministry how much will be set aside  and

how  many training places will be provided.  At the  same

time,  Mr  Yeo Guat Kwang would like to ask the Ministry,

not  just  to  provide funding, but  also  to  provide  a

comprehensive training support system of assessments  and

monitoring  for  those trained to provide step-down  care

services.   The  Ministry should also  consider  training

those  without previous relevant background, but who  may

be keen to enter into this sector.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Neo, in future, if you were to

speak  on  behalf of a Member, you raise it as if  it  is

your point.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You may proceed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I will proceed to my next cut on

breast  cancer.   Sir,  I applaud the  mammogram  subsidy

scheme  for breast cancer by the Health Promotion  Board.

This scheme has been a great success in attracting a  big

jump  in  the  number  of  women  going  for  mammograms.

However, due to the increased demand, the women  have  to

wait  much  longer, almost one month, for the results  of

the mammogram.  Sir, I am concerned, especially for those

women  who were told that they needed to go for a retest.

There  were  3,500 such women last year, as they  had  to

wait  a  further six weeks for their results.   The  long

wait, especially after retest, gave the women much mental

anguish and anxiety from the suspense of whether they had

breast  cancer.  Although the second test  proved  to  be

unnecessary  for  hundreds of them,  they  were  recalled

because  the  radiologist preferred to play  safe.   Last

year,  8%  of the women tested were recalled and  all  of

them had to pay for the retest, and many of the less well-off found the extra cost to be a burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister for Health whether our public

test  centres  are  able  to cope  with  the  demand  for

mammograms?   Do we have enough radiologists?   What  are

the  steps  taken  to minimise errors of  interpretation?

Could  the waiting period be reduced?  Why are our  post-positive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>

rates   for  mammograms  so  high?   Would  the  Minister

consider further outsourcing of mammograms to the private

sector   in  order  to  tap  the  under-utilised  private

radiological centres and their radiologists?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir, for allowing me

to  speak on myopia in children.  I would like to express

my  concern  on  the  high incidence  of  myopia  amongst

children  in  Singapore.   Myopia  is  a  common  disease

amongst  children in Singapore.  One only has to look  at

the  photograph of an O-level class and he will see  that

almost  all the students in that photograph wear glasses,

evidencing  that they are myopic.  It is inconvenient  to

wear  glasses.  Girls do not like to wear glasses because

it spoils their looks.  As for boys, if they have to wear

glasses it may affect their chances of being accepted  in

a  sports team, especially in contact sports.  Boys  with

acute  shortsightedness may not be  accepted  in  certain

jobs,  eg,  a  fighter pilot or to be a commando  in  the

Armed Forces.  The best situation is, of course, one  who

has  good  eyesight and does not need to wear glasses  at

all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read in the papers recently that myopia can

be  completely cured with lasik surgery, but the cost  of

such  a  treatment is rather prohibitive.   The  cost  of

lasik   surgery  for  one  eye  is  almost  $2,400   and,

therefore, it is not possible to get every myopic  person

to  be cured of the myopia by this form of surgery.   The

more  practical  solution  would  be  if  myopia  can  be

prevented  amongst our children.  I read  in  the  papers

that  in  China,  the schools there have a  programme  to

engage  school children in exercising and relaxing  their

eyes to cut down on the incidence of myopia.  Sir, do  we

have such a programme in Singapore?  I also would like to

ask  the Minister whether the Government has set aside  a

budget to do research on how to prevent our children from

getting myopia.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, 1 in 4 pregnancies, or 14,000

babies  get  aborted each year, and almost 60%  of  these

abortions were sought by married women.  The reasons

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>

given  by  these women were that they were not  ready  to

start  a  family,  or  they did not  want  to  have  more

children.    Would   the  Ministry  of  Health   consider

introducing  innovative  ideas  aimed  at  reducing   our

abortion rates?  We should certainly have more programmes

to  teach  the  various  methods  of  contraception,  the

responsibility  of  contraception  and  the   trauma   of

abortion,   targeting  especially  the   married   women.

Married   women   should   be   persuaded   to   practise

contraception rather than resort to abortion as  a  means

of  contraception.  Could there be even more  counselling

mandated at the crucial time of decision making?  I  feel

that  it  is time that we looked into giving these  women

more  genuine  alternatives,  such  as  less  complicated

adoption  choices for those who really cannot  afford  to

have  more children, and match nanny-services for working

mothers to rely on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teenage abortions are on the increase. Is our sex

education   in   schools  adequate?   Are  our   teachers

comfortable  in imparting sex education to our  students?

Is  there enough emphasis on responsible and safe sex and

on   the   negative   impact  of  unwanted   pregnancies,

especially the physical and psychological risks?   Should

there  be  more  support  given to  teenage  pregnancies?

Could  the Ministry of Health consider studying  abortion

trauma, which is not much documented?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> I will begin first with Dr

Neo's  question on errant doctors.  The Singapore Medical

Council  places  great  emphasis  on  the  integrity  and

honesty of our medical practitioners, as these values are

fundamental to a good doctor-patient relationship.  It is

important  for  our  patients  and  the  public  to  have

confidence and trust in the doctors who look after  them.

For  this reason, the SMC has the authority to look  into

all  cases where a doctor has been convicted in a  court,

to assess whether there had been professional misconduct.

The  provision for those who have been convicted for  any

offence  involving fraud, dishonesty or moral  turpitude,

to  have their professional registration suspended is not

unique to the medical profession.  It also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>

exists   in   the   regulatory  legislation   for   other

professionals such as accountants, architects,  engineers

and  lawyers.  So what happens with regard to doctors  is

not unique to the medical profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMC judges each case on its own merits and the

penalties   may   differ  according   to   the   specific

circumstances in each case.  It should be noted  that  in

one  of the tax evasion cases, the SMC granted the doctor

one  month's deferment of his order of suspension so that

he  could  have  time to transfer his patients  to  other

specialists  for  care  and  management.   The  range  of

penalties  available  to the SMC  is  prescribed  by  the

Medical  Registration Act.  The SMC has no  authority  to

require  these  doctors to perform  compulsory  community

services, as suggested by the Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo was also concerned about the quality of

doctors  from  non-traditional  source  countries.   Non-traditional  source  (NTS) doctors  refer  to  those  who

graduated   from   medical   schools   that   have    not

traditionally  been  included  in  any  of  the  previous

versions  of  the Schedule of Registrable Basic  Degrees.

Such doctors may be granted temporary registration by the

Singapore  Medical Council to work under  supervision  as

medical  officers within the public sector.  A  total  of

<br><br>258&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTS  doctors  were  granted  temporary  registration

between 2001 and 2002 to fill the vacant MO positions  in

our  public  sector  hospitals.  These doctors  graduated

from   medical  schools  in  countries  such  as   China,

Indonesia,  India, Myanmar and the Philippines.   Another

19 doctors from medical schools that were in the pre-1993

Schedule were also granted temporary registration  during

this period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of all temporary registered doctors

is   closely  monitored  by  their  supervisors  who  are

required to submit assessment reports to the SMC  in  the

third  month  of  their appointment, and  at  six-monthly

intervals  thereafter,  until the  doctor  leaves.   Only

doctors  with  satisfactory performance reports  will  be

allowed to have their registration renewed for up to  one

year at a time.  All doctors

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>

with  poor  or  unsatisfactory reports will  either  have

their  contract terminated immediately, or after  further

monitoring,  if  they fail to show improvement  in  their

performance.   Only  6%  of the  NTS  doctors  registered

between  2001  and  2002 had their contracts  terminated.

The  majority were terminated by the employers  for  poor

performance, including poor command of English.  However,

none  of  these  NTS doctors have been  involved  in  any

complaint or disciplinary case investigated by the SMC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback from our clusters on these NTS doctors

has  generally been favourable.  Compared  to  our  local

MOs,  they are often more experienced, having worked  for

at  least six years, and many also possess some  form  of

post-graduate qualification.  There have been some issues

relating  to  adjustments to a different work environment

but,  on the whole, the clusters have found many of these

doctors to be hardworking and committed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo, on behalf of Mr Yeo, had asked about

training  for step-down care personnel and  how  much  my

Ministry  has allocated for this training.   My  Ministry

has  set  aside $3.3 million for the next three years  to

provide advanced training in elderly and continuing care.

Under  the  programme, doctors, nurses and allied  health

professionals,  such  as  physiotherapists,  occupational

therapists,  medical social workers, case  managers,  and

others working in step-down care services, can apply  for

funding  support to pursue training or skills  attachment

at  local  or overseas healthcare institutions  in  areas

such  as  geriatric  medicine, geriatric  rehabilitation,

dementia and mental health and palliative care.  Trainees

must  be Singapore citizens or permanent residents.   MOH

will fund 75% of the approved training expenditure, while

the   VWOs  will  fund  the  remaining  expenses  of  the

trainees.  They will be required to sign a bond  to  work

with  the  VWO upon completion of training.  The duration

of the bond will depend on the length and location of the

training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to ensure that patient care is not

disrupted, my Ministry will provide

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>

financial  assistance  of up to  75%  of  the  salary  of

temporary  staff employed to cover the work of the  staff

who   is   away  on  training.   To  encourage   training

attachments in local healthcare institutions  such  as  a

public  hospital for between 1-3 months,  MOH  will  fund

100%  of the salary of temporary staff.  We estimate that

a  budget  of  $3.3 million will be adequate  to  provide

training for 90 staff over the three years, comprising 10

medical  traineeships in geriatrics,  rehabilitation  and

palliative  medicine; 12 nursing traineeships in  advance

gerontology;   and  70  traineeships   in   other   areas

identified  to  be  of high priority for  step-down  care

service development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that the number of

traineeships only serves as an estimate to work  out  the

budget.  My Ministry is prepared to support more trainees

within  the  budget allocated.  We are also  prepared  to

consider more funding support, if required.  Our plan  is

to offer this as part of our overall operating subsidy to

step-down  care  service  providers.   We  have   started

inviting proposals from the VWOs for these awards for  FY

2003.   The  deadline for submission is 31st March  2003,

and the feedback has been positive so far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also asked about standards of breast

screening  in  Singapore.  Breast Screen  Singapore,  the

national  breast cancer screening programme, was launched

in  January  last  year.  A stringent  quality  assurance

programme was implemented from the start of the programme

to ensure that clinical quality and service standards are

met  for both mammograms and the assessment of women with

abnormal  mammograms.  The programme has also  instituted

minimum   service   standards  for  waiting   times   for

appointments   for   mammogram   screenings    and    for

assessments.  Breast Screen Singapore is available  at  a

total of 11 centres, ie, in 10 polyclinics and the Health

Promotion Board building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the quality assurance standards are

met, the centres are audited

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>

and  accredited every two years.  Hands-on  training  and

continuing education by international experts are carried

out  on  a  continuing basis for all health professionals

involved in the programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo noted that the recall rate for assessment of

women  with abnormal mammograms is about 8%.  This recall

rate   is  comparable  to  the  national  breast   cancer

screening programmes in other countries.  At present, the

average  waiting time is three weeks for a mammogram  and

two weeks for an assessment.  My Ministry is prepared  to

use private sector services in the national breast cancer

screening  programme,  provided they  meet  our  clinical

quality standards, and we are looking into this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam noted that many young people in our schools

wear  glasses.  My Ministry recognises that myopia  is  a

major  health  problem which needs to be addressed.   The

Health   Promotion  Board  launched  a  national   myopia

prevention programme in August 2001.  The programme  aims

to  prevent and reduce myopia progression as well  as  to

delay the onset of myopia in children.  As the onset  and

development of myopia occurs mainly during childhood, the

programme    targets   mainly   children   in    schools,

kindergartens and childcare centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main component of the national myopia prevention

programme  is public education, particularly in  schools,

on  good  eye care habits.   The main message is to  take

vision  breaks  after every 30-40 minutes of  near  work,

such  as  reading or using the computer.   HPB  has  also

produced updated guidelines for teachers on promotion  of

vision  care  in  schools,  kindergartens  and  childcare

centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancement of existing vision screening programmes

in  schools is also emphasised, placing greater  emphasis

on  follow-up  of  students detected to have  myopia  and

providing  more intensive counselling and  education  for

this  group.  There has also been introduction of  vision

screening  in  kindergartens  and  childcare  centres  to

identify  children with early myopia or  amblyopia,  lazy

eye syndrome.  For the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>

latter,  early  treatment can prevent the development  of

functional   blindness  in  the  lazy  eye.    Pre-school

children  who  are  detected  to  have  defective  vision

through  screening  are referred to  specific  refraction

clinics in polyclinics for further assessment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, about half a million students from Primary

1  to  Secondary 5 and 43,000 students in kindergarten  2

were screened.  In 2003, a similar number of kindergarten

1  students will also be screened for myopia.  Since  our

programme started, three new refraction clinics have been

set   up   in  polyclinics  to  provide  refraction   and

counselling  services  for pre-school  children  referred

from the screening programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked about lasik. At the present time,

lasik  is  an accepted treatment for treating  myopia  in

adults.   However, it is still not a standard  treatment.

And the day all eye surgeons give up their glasses and go

for  lasik,  we  know it is time to make  it  a  standard

treatment!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience in lasik treatment for children is

even  less  than  adults.  So, that is  why  we  are  not

advocating lasik as a standard treatment at this time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo was concerned about abortions and

abortion  numbers in Singapore, and we share her concern.

The  total  number of abortions performed has  decreased,

from  16,476  in  1993  to 12,749  in  2002.   Under  the

Termination of Pregnancy Act, all healthcare institutions

authorised  to  perform  termination  of  pregnancy,  are

required  to  provide pre-abortion counselling  to  women

seeking termination of pregnancy.  In addition, 48  hours

must  elapse  after  counselling  before  termination  of

pregnancy  can be performed.  This is to allow the  woman

requesting  for termination time to review the  situation

and  decision in the light of information and counselling

provided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also working with the Ministry of

Community   Development  and  Sports   to   enhance   the

counselling process to address the social issues faced by

married women seeking abortion, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>

to  encourage  them  to  continue their  pregnancies   by

providing appropriate help.  We are also concerned  about

teenage  pregnancies and we are working with the Ministry

of  Education  on  this. The Ministry  of  Education  has

implemented  a  sexuality education programme  for  upper

primary and secondary students.  The programme which  was

developed  together with the Health Promotion Board  aims

to  provide  knowledge  about  human  sexuality  and  the

consequences  of  sexual  activity.   It  is  hoped  that

through  this  programme, students would develop  healthy

attitudes  towards  sexuality  and  be  able   to   build

responsible relationships.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not

answered my question on whether or not the Government has

set  aside  a  budget  to do research to  prevent  myopia

amongst children.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Currently, SNEC is conducting

research on myopia and they have a budget for it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State

about  non-traditional source doctors.  He  said  earlier

that  those doctors who showed poor performance and  poor

command  of English had been sent back.  May  I  ask  him

whether  it  was fair to have subjected our  patients  to

their care before they were sent back?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On mammograms, could I ask the Minister of State

whether the Ministry of Health will consider waiving  the

charges for retests for the less well-off women?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, with regard to the first

question  on non-traditional source doctors,  during  the

time  they  were being assessed when they first  came  to

work,  they  were under close supervision of  the  senior

doctors.  So there was no compromise on patient care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to her second question, she can send in

a request and my Ministry will study it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Dr Neo.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code OD 3600.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, the Health Sciences Authority

changed the blood donor recognition programme for all new

blood donors with effect from 1st July 2002.  This ruling

removed the scheme that subsidises certain consultations,

hospitalisation  and  day  surgery  charges  for  regular

donors.   For example, if hospitalised, there  is  a  50%

discount on ward and meal charges for up to $200 per day.

Also,  all  consultations  at polyclinics  are  free.   I

believe this costs the Government about $1.7 million each

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Sciences Authority said that the discount

system  was  stopped  to ensure that  donation  is  truly

altruistic.  Nonetheless, this ruling has now created two

groups  of donors  -  the old donor group that  is  still

enjoying  the  discount system and  a  disadvantaged  new

group  that  does  not.  Sir, may I ask the  Ministry  of

Health  whether  other  methods of  encouraging  altruism

could  have  been  adopted rather than  taking  away  the

discount system?  May I also ask whether this ruling  has

caused a decrease in the number of new donors?  Will this

ruling  further exaggerate the perpetual shortage in  our

blood bank.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Neo, please go on to your next cut.

sunk  to  a historic low of 1.42, way below the  required

replacement rate of 2.1.  It has been reported  that  one

in  five  married  couples  in  Singapore  now  finds  it

difficult  to conceive.   The 20% figure shows  Singapore

moving  into  the upper end of infertility  rate  in  the

developed  countries, which ranges between  15-25%.   The

infertility rate here has risen steadily since the  early

1980s when it stood at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>

around 10%.  The best productive age for men and women is

in  their  20s and early 30s, but more men and women  are

postponing  marriage and procreation.   The  reasons  are

varied, and they include the emphasis on careers,  choice

of   lifestyles  and  economic  considerations.   Couples

seeking  fertility  treatment  often  undergo  a  lot  of

anguish  and  stress,  physically, mentally  as  well  as

financially.  I feel that more help should be rendered by

the  Ministry  of  Health to such  couples.   Apart  from

raising  the  amount of Medisave that can be used,  could

the  limit of three treatment cycles be further increased

because fertility treatments are often costly?  Would the

Minister   for  Health  consider  subsidising   fertility

procedures  and drugs to ease the burden for patients  at

all fertility clinics in the public hospitals?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is the Ministry of Health doing anything with

regard  to  our  low birth rate?  Should  there  be  more

public  awareness  raised  with  regard  to  the  various

aspects  of  reproduction,  highlighting  especially  the

marital  aspects that are detrimental and  other  aspects

that are favourable to procreation?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, with regard to Dr Neo's

question  on  the  rescinding of medical benefits  scheme

(MBS),  it  was  in  line  with  the  best  international

practices  and  the latest development in  blood  banking

that  HSA  rescinded  the  medical  benefits  scheme  for

regular  blood donors and nominees prospectively for  all

new  blood donors with effect from 1st July 2002.  To  be

fair  to donors from the past, this change does not apply

to  or affect regular blood donors who are already in the

MBS by virtue of their previous blood donation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood donors are proactively informed of the change

in  the MBS.  HSA has also continued to emphasise to  all

blood donors and to our public the importance of donating

blood  voluntarily and in the spirit of altruism  without

expectation of reward.  If we follow Dr Neo's advice  and

give them something for donating blood, then it will  not

be altruistic any more.  In

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>

line   with  this,  HSA  and  our  national  blood  donor

recruiters,  the Singapore Red Cross Society,  have  been

taking  steps  to  enhance  the blood  donor  recognition

programme   in  ways  that  do  not  involve  significant

material  incentives.   This has  included  upgrading  of

blood  donation  facilities  to  provide  donors  with  a

comfortable and pleasant environment and enhancing  donor

services to make the blood donor experience more positive

and  enjoyable.  The Champion Blood Donor Award programme

has  also  been  improved  to include  special  ruby  and

diamond  awards  at  the 75th and  125th  blood  donation

respectively.    Special  youth  programmes   have   been

introduced  to  encourage  our  youths  to  donate  blood

regularly  as part of the healthy lifestyle and community

spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood donors have, on the whole, responded

positively to the message.  The number of blood donations

collected  by HSA in 2002 was 74,750, compared to  66,028

in  2001,  which  is  a 13% increase.   This  shows  that

Singaporeans  respond to a call for altruistic  donation.

The  number of new donors has increased 12%, from  13,537

in  2001  to 15,121 in 2002.  HSA will continue  to  work

with  the  Singapore  Red Cross  Society  to  ensure  the

adequacy and safety of the national blood programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo has also asked whether the Government could

subsidise  fertility procedures and drugs.  The resources

which  we can devote to healthcare are finite and  should

be  targeted  at  the majority of patients  with  medical

conditions.   Couples can already use their Medisave  for

assisted  conception procedures and that is  the  current

assistance  that  they get from the  Government.   But  I

agree  with  Dr Neo that the real problem is that  people

are  postponing  their  marriages  and  having  children.

There  is  a  biological clock in all  women  and  it  is

ticking all the time.  You are most fertile in your  20s,

and  that is when you should get married and try and have

children.   So  we encourage couples to marry  early  and

have their children early.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, can I clarify? I have never

suggested that we should give

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>

rewards  to blood donors.  In fact, it was the Ministry's

policy  all along.  Why should the Minister of State  now

accuse me of suggesting this?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> I am glad that we all agree

that  altruism   should be the reason why  people  donate

blood.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I am glad he changed his tune. I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4), Dr Neo.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code OE 3100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a recent World Health Organisation report said

that  depression is poised to become the  second  largest

cause  of  disability worldwide after  heart  disease  by

2020.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to one in 10 Singaporeans suffers from

depression  or anxiety that is bad enough to  affect  his

everyday  tasks,  such as going to work  and  interacting

with  family members.  This is probably the  tip  of  the

iceberg as the stigma attached to mental conditions stops

people  acknowledging the conditions and seeking  medical

help.  In Singapore, a study in 1998 showed that 9.3%  of

adults  suffered from anxiety disorders and 7.8% suffered

from  depression.   This incidence  must  have  increased

lately  with  the economic downturn and the  record  high

unemployment in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxiety disorder is a condition where sufferers are

excessively  worried  about  everything  all  the   time.

Depression  sufferers  feel  a  deep  sadness  and   lose

interest,  sleep  and  appetite  for  prolonged  periods.

Those  who  are depressed are often dismissed  by  family

members   as  attention  seekers  and  they   are   often

misdiagnosed  because they tend to  complain  to  doctors

about physical pains, like backache and headache, instead

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>

saying  what  they  really feel.  Other depression  cases

seek  treatment  in hospitals; frequently  doctor-hopping

from one specialist to another and thus wasting a lot  of

personnel and public resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Ministry of Health whether it is

about  time  we  have  more public  awareness  on  mental

illness?   And what are the preventive measures taken  to

cushion this impending disability problem?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, when times are bad, and

you  have lost your job, or in danger of losing your job,

feeling anxious and depressed is normal.  This is  called

reactive  depression.   But  it  is  testimony  to  human

resilience that we all recover from this after  a  while,

as  we  look for ways to solving the problem.  But  where

depression or anxiety occurs for no good reason, that  is

a mental illness and requires treatment and, if possible,

prevention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health recognises the importance of

promoting mental health among Singaporeans to prevent all

mental  illnesses, including endogenous  depression.   To

place  greater emphasis on mental health, a mental health

education  programme "Mind Your Mind" was implemented  in

2001  by the Health Promotion Board and the Institute  of

Mental  Health.   The programme aims  to  promote  mental

wellness  and raise awareness of the importance of  early

detection and treatment of common mental conditions, such

as    stress,    depression,   anxiety   disorders    and

schizophrenia.    The  programme  is  targeted   at   all

Singaporeans - children and adolescents, adults  and  the

elderly.   A variety of strategies is used to  reach  the

target  groups.   Mass media, talks,  public  forums  and

exhibitions are carried out to create public awareness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To impart skills to healthcare professionals for the

early detection of these diseases, workshops and training

courses are carried out.  The programme focuses on stress

management  in  2001.  We have reached out  to  students,

adults and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>

elderly  educating  them on how to manage  stress.   Last

year,  the  programme focused on the destigmatisation  of

mental  illness.   We  have tried to  change  the  public

perception  and  attitudes  towards  mental  illness  and

people  suffering from mental disorders.  This year,  the

programme  will  focus on depression and  aims  to  raise

public  awareness of the signs and symptoms and treatment

of depression.

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
