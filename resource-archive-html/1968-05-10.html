<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express our thanks to the President for the speech

which he delivered on behalf of the Government at

the opening of the First Session of this

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  sure  that all thinking and loyal  citizens

will  not  disapprove  of my suggestion  that  the

present system of any schools for ethnic groups be

abolished sooner or later if we are to achieve 100

per cent unity among our multi-racial society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integration of races in the schools is the

best way to start educating our young citizens  to

the realisation that they are all Singaporeans and

therefore equal citizens. It always saddens me  to

go past a school specifically run for a particular

ethnic  group.  What better way can  one  have  of

isolating  one  race  from  another  than  by  the

presence  of such schools? Is it not more  logical

in  terms of nation-building to have every  school

open  its  door  to  our children  of  all  ethnic

groups? Then these young citizens will grow up  to

know,  respect and assimilate each other's way  of

life and thoughts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, please do not think that my

suggestion means that the abolition of any one  of

our  four languages will be in sight. In fact,  my

own feeling is that all our children can still  be

sbrought  up  to become at least bilingual  school-leavers  as  they  can  still  study  mathematics,

science  and technology in the medium  of  English

and  the  humanities  through  one  of  the  other

languages.  I  realise that this  integration  may

take a bug time to implement, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



knowing the efficiency and dedication of the staff

of the Ministry of Education -



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> - any such difficulty

encountered will be overcome. I would,  therefore,

like  to suggest to the Minister for Education  to

give  my  idea some consideration and to adopt  it

for all ethnic schools in the course of time.

<br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having dealt with children in

ethnic  schools, I would like to say that I  agree

with  the proposal that greater emphasis on sports

should be given by the Ministry of Social Affairs.

However, I note with some disturbance the  neglect

of one of the most popular forms of sports in this

country, namely, badminton. Not so many years ago,

we in Singapore could boast of a number of leading

world badminton players, but today we cannot  even

find  a  youngster in our midst who can be  ranked

among  the first ten leading badminton players  in

the world. We have ample talents in Singapore, but

we  do not provide suitable facilities for them to

develop and grow. The few indoor badminton  courts

available  are so humid and torrid that no  amount

of  practice  among the players can improve  their

standard,  as they are exhausted long before  they

can  bring  out  their  very  best  in  the  game.

Therefore,  I do hope that the organisers  of  and

planners  for the National Sports Stadium  Complex

will  bear  in mind that badminton is one  of  the

very  few  sports that can produce  for  us  world

champions.  It  is  obvious to  me  that  an  air-conditioned badminton stadium must be included  in

this  sports complex. I will not accept the excuse

that  such a stadium will cost too much money.  If

we  are  going  to  spend $50  million,  an  extra

expenditure  of  another  million  dollars  or  so

should  not prevent the building of such  an  air-conditioned badminton stadium. I would  also  like

to  point out that such a stadium can earn  money,

because  when  it  is  used as  a  venue  for  the

training of players and for international



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



badminton tournaments, money can be collected  for

the use of such a stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to make a few

comments  on  the  widening of the  main  arterial

roads and the development of dual carriageways.  I

am  sure  the  House will agree with me  that  the

Public Works Department has done an excellent  job

on these roads and everyone who uses them can have

nothing  but  a  lot  of  praise  for  the  P.W.D.

However, I am not too happy to see these beautiful

highways   cluttered  up  with  rows   of   parked

vehicles.  Such  a  display  of  lack   of   civic

consciousness can easily be seen in Queenstown  or

Paya Lebar, for example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Or Joo Chiat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Not Joo Chiat. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  surely  it  is  time  that  the  appropriate

Minister  should  see to it that  the  purpose  of

widening our main arterial roads is not to provide

parking bays for cars and lorries for some of  our

citizens, but for the smoother and safer  flow  of

the ever-increasing traffic on our roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finally I would like to make

some remarks on off-shore fishing. I feel that the

encouragement   of  off-shore  fishing   is   very

commendable,  but  I  wish that  the  Ministry  of

National  Development will  see  to  it  that  the

owners  of  abandoned  kelongs  be  legislated  to

remove   stakes  and  dismantle  structures   from

discarded   kelongs.  We  want  to  beautify   our

islands,  but  the presence of such unsightly  and

dangerous   stakes  surely  spoils  the  off-shore

silhouette.



<br><br>2.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

President's  Speech  has  ushered  in   the   most

difficult  period in the history of Singapore.  In

the years ahead, much has to be done to offset the

side effects of the complete withdrawal of British

forces   from  this  region.  Never   before   has

Singapore  been  in this kind of  situation  where

everything is left to herself. One would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



imagine  that the three years and eight months  of

Japanese  occupation  would  have  been  the  most

bitter times for Singapore, but, if Singapore  had

never  been recovered from the Japanese, we  would

not have lost anything, for Singapore was then not

ours and defence then was not our business at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 20 years ago, when the question was asked,

"Which  country  in  South-east  Asia  will   turn

Communist  first?", the answer  was,  "Singapore."

Twenty  years  later, the same question  is  asked

again, "Which country will go Communist?", and the

answer is still, "Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this must be the case with all the years of

hard  work put in by our people. We cannot  afford

to lose Singapore, for this is our country and our

stake  is  in it. Few countries in Southeast  Asia

can claim a higher living standard than Singapore.

Our social and medical services and public housing

are  second  to  none. Our progress  can  also  be

achieved by other neighbouring countries. What  we

lack is land, but, on the other hand, the kind  of

leadership  which is the propelling force  of  our

advance  and progress cannot be readily  found  in

other  countries. As I have said earlier, what  we

have  achieved  here  can  be  achieved  by  other

countries  if  only  they can produce  from  among

their   millions  of  people,  a  hard   core   of

dedicated,   clear-thinking,   incorruptible   and

dynamic  individuals  whom  we  in  Singapore  are

compelled to choose from only two million  people,

young and old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many advantages here: a good harbour, a

good geographical position, a practical population

and  an experienced business community. All  these

notwithstanding,   Singapore  must   survive   and

prosper along with other countries in this region.

To  believe that Singapore can survive on its own,

totally  disregarding others  in  the  region,  is

naive.  For  the  survival and prosperity  of  the

Southeast Asian countries, regionalism appears  to

be  the  only solution. We believe that nobody  is

dependent on himself alone but everybody is inter-dependent on one another.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my conviction that whatever

arrangement  Singapore enters  into  in  the  near

future, whether an economic alliance or a regional

defence  system, we must present  ourselves  as  a

credible and contributing partner. We have come  a

long  way  from the Colombo Plan, from a recipient

nation to a donor nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President, at the outset of

his  speech,  has  pointed  out  that  Singapore's

problems  in  the next 10 years would be  external

rather  than internal. I hope that by the  end  of

1971,   a   credible  defence  arrangement   could

materialise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has made history not only in the field

of  human  endeavour, but also in the  history  of

democratic    constitutional   government.    This

Parliament  will experience very difficult  times.

We  are in a unique position where, in spite of so

many  formidable  problems  facing  us,  effective

solutions  to them will not be found wanting.  The

people do not seem to show any lack of confidence.

The  result  of this is an all-P.A.P.  Parliament.

Yet  we  should  have no cause for complacency.  I

wish to point out that the absence of an effective

Opposition  in  this Chamber does not  necessarily

mean  that  we have one hundred per cent  support.

Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Prime Minister put it  in

his  speech upon your election as Speaker, if  the

Barisan Sosialis had decided to participate in the

last  General  Election, they would  have  secured

about six to eight seats in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was the folly of the Opposition that led

to  the  present situation of the  absence  of  an

Opposition. But the mere wanting of an  Opposition

in  order  to  fulfil the ideals of  a  democratic

institution  is  not necessarily relevant  in  all

cases.  There  is nothing wrong in having  an  all

P.A.P.  Government if the people decide that  such

an  arrangement  is to their best advantage.  This

will, of course, make our job as Backbenchers more

difficult. Not only have we to take on the  duties

of  the Opposition, but we have also, on the other

hand, to explain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



to  the  people that for the next half decade,  if

Singapore is to continue to survive and prosper as

a  separate entity in this region, much  sacrifice

will  have  to be made. There should be  tolerance

and    restraint    in   all   quarters,    higher

productivity,  and  a more careful  and  practical

handling of the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that there is no substitute for sheer

hard work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I join my colleagues in

supporting the motion standing in the name of  the

Hon. Prime Minister, expressing the thanks of  the

House to the President for delivering his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  just  like to seek clarification  from  the

Member  for  Changi. In his speech  he  posed  two

questions. I believe that the two questions should

be  thus. The first one was correct. That  was  20

years ago, when the question was asked as to which

country in this region would go Communist first -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Fong, you are seeking

clarification  but you seem to be embarking  on  a

speech.  May I suggest that you raise this  matter

when you speak substantively to the motion, if you

intend to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I just intend to seek

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In which case, please get to your

point very quickly and shortly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> The Member for Changi said

that  20  years ago, when the question was  asked,

"Which  country  would go Communist  first?",  the

answer  was Singapore. I would imagine the  second

question   would  be,  "Which  country  would   go

Communist  last?", the answer would be  Singapore.

Is that correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I thank the hon. Member for

Changi.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Nee Soon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It

is refreshing to note that our President has given

a   timely   speech   in  this  House   expressing

confidence  that  we will be able  to  ensure  our

future  in  a new environment when we are  in  the

decisive l970s. This important historical document

will  serve as a guide to us in sailing along  the

troubled waters at this time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President outlined three objectives in his

speech:  namely  the  optimum  use  of  the   time

available   to  build  up  an  effective   defence

capability;    greater   economic   growth;    and

enhancement  of  national  consciousness  of   our

problems. These three objectives have relation  to

the world situation, particularly to the situation

in   Southeast  Asia  consequent  on  the  earlier

withdrawal  of the British troops. Of these  three

objectives,  the  establishment  of  our   defence

capability   is   of   the  first   and   foremost

importance.  Of  course, this  will  increase  the

burden  on our people. Being a very small country,

Singapore   would  have  to  meet   and   overcome

difficulties  in  order to  set  up  an  effective

defence  capability. Fortunately,  ever  since  we

left   Malaysia,  we  have  already   started   to

encourage our people to undergo military training,

and  also in his policy speech, the President  has

clearly  pointed  out that  we  must  set  up  our

defence capability at the minimum cost so that our

financial resources will mostly be diverted to our

economic  development and industrial growth.  From

the   economic  point  of  view,  the  expenditure

involved in setting up a defence capability should

never  be  allowed to interfere with our  economic

growth  in  the  process of nation-building.  Both

economic  growth and economic development  have  a

decisive bearing on our national defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let us take the advanced countries

such  as  Germany,  Japan  and  Russia.  They  are

advanced countries because of their high degree of

development and the economic growth that they have

had  as  a  result  of their educational  reforms,

scientific progress and industrial development. It

would be better, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



course,  to  build  up a national  defence  force,

after   having   achieved  social   and   economic

stability. But judging from the time that we  have

in  hand and the situation that we are facing,  we

are  not  so lucky as to be able to enjoy economic

growth   first  before  building  up  our  defence

capability. So we must tackle both problems at the

same time. We must divert the greater part of  our

financial  resources into economic development  in

order to maintain our economic growth at eight per

cent  or even to raise our economic growth to more

than eight per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the three objectives

outlined  by our President are all geared  towards

the  strengthening of our economic growth. We  all

know that the economic growth of a country can  be

divided  into  two stages. The first  one  is  the

stage of germination and the second is the process

of growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in our country we are happy that we

have  reached  the second stage. We  have  already

completed  the  first  stage of  germination.  The

general   technical   preliminaries   have    been

completed   and  we  already  have  a  substantial

economic   and   financial  capability   and   the

technical  know-how.  So in this  respect  we  are

ahead  of  the backward countries and  some  other

developing   countries.   In   addition   to   the

quantitative  progress that we have already  made,

we must also have qualitative advancement in order

to  speed up our economic growth and build up  our

national  strength,  because  we  all  know   that

economic  growth consists of quantitative progress

as well as qualitative advancement. Both these two

changes  will cause a chain reaction in the  whole

structure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, economic growth is not so simple to achieve

as  one  would imagine, because it does  not  only

involve capital or technical know-how. The fact is

that other factors also have a bearing on speeding

up  our  economic  growth. These  factors  include

religion,   culture,   education,   customs    and

traditions, etc.. In this respect, I  am  glad  to

note  that  a. Cabinet Committee has already  been

set up with the Minister for Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



as Chairman, the Minister for Science and

Technology, the Minister for Finance and the

Minister for Labour as members in order to carry

out the reorganisation in our educational system

so that we will be able to train the technical

personnel that we require.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, human resources are very important in

promoting  economic  growth and industrialisation.

Therefore,  the re-organisation in  the  secondary

education   system  will,  in   the   history   of

education,  become a turning point  in  Singapore.

Mr Speaker, I believe you will agree with me that

our  country lacks natural resources to assist  us

in   our   economic  development.  But   we   have

inexhaustible  human resources.  These  resources,

with  hard  work  and diligence,  can  earn  extra

income  for our country. So the question  is,  how

are  we  to make full use of these valuable  human

resources and to ensure that there is no  wastage?

The  answer  lies  in  the reorganisation  of  our

secondary education system. We want to ensure that

every secondary school-leaver will be able to make

use of what he has learnt to contribute to nation-building and that all young graduates of secondary

schools  will  have  had some form  of  vocational

training  when  they leave school.  In  the  past,

people  said  that graduation meant  unemployment.

Now with the completion of the re-organisation  of

our  secondary education system, we can  say  that

graduation can mean employment. This will  be  the

ultimate  objective of the reorganisation  of  our

secondary education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other aspect of the

reorganisation  of our secondary education  system

is   that   we   can   increase   the   employment

opportunities of our young school-beavers  because

they  will  have had some vocational and technical

training when they leave school. When they take up

their jobs, they will be able to make use of  what

they  have  learnt  and  carry  out  their  duties

effectively.  At  least, after the reorganisation,

school-leavers  will be able to  leave  school  as

junior  technicians  and  directly  take  part  in

productive   activities.  This   would   be   more

practical  as  compared  to  the  present   system

whereby they receive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



technical training only after they have taken up a

job.  Therefore, reorganisation in  our  secondary

education  system,  economically  speaking,   will

produce  these results: firstly, to  increase  the

employment    opportunities   of   school-beavers;

secondly,  to  ensure that all our nationals  will

have  some  form of skill to enable them  to  take

part in productive activities; thirdly, to cut out

the  gap between productivity and the commencement

of  employment; fourthly, to ensure that there  is

no  wastage  in our human resources;  fifthly,  to

turn   our  school-leavers  from  consumers   into

producers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, Singapore is situated in a

turbulent  area of Southeast Asia. Southeast  Asia

has  all along been the centre of attention of the

world.  This is not because this area is rich  and

strong,  but  because it has been  recognised  and

considered  as  one of the weakest  areas  in  the

world.  It has been looked upon as a region  which

is not able to mobilise its political and economic

resources to bargain with the super powers  on  an

equal footing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a country with a reputation of having a high

standard  of  living and with a harmonious  multi-racial  society and a non-aligned foreign  policy,

we,  in  Singapore, have the duty  to  help  other

countries  in  Southeast Asia to  transform  their

present  pitiful state into modern  societies.  At

the  same  time,  we  can  also  exercise  a  very

decisive  influence  in  stabilising  the  present

turbulent situation in Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the future of Southeast Asia in the next

few  years? Will it be able to gain a greater  say

in   international  affairs  and  take  a   strong

position in their relationship vis-a-vis the super

powers? So, if we are to restore the stability and

security  of this region, it is vitally  necessary

for  countries  in  Southeast Asia  to  put  their

houses  in  order and to be self-reliant.  As  the

Minister  for Foreign Affairs has said, there  are

two  approaches to the solution of  this  problem.

Firstly,  we  must  secure  greater  regional  co-operation.  Secondly, every  nation  in  Southeast

Asia must make greater efforts in modernising  its

society and its infrastructure. As to the first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



approach, we have set an example by achieving  co-operation in the economic field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his recent broadcast

mentioned  the promotion of the tourist trade  and

our  co-operation with Indonesia to  develop  Bali

Island  as  a tourist spot so as to derive  mutual

benefit for Singapore and Indonesia. We have  even

sent a mission to Indonesia to go into the details

of  this  scheme, namely, to investigate potential

in  Bali  Island in order to promote  the  tourist

trade in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, we can also carry out

regional co-operation in industry, agriculture and

other fields through A.S.E.A.N.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to modernisation, the Government has

achieved  significant progress. In the President's

Speech,  it  is revealed that the Ministries  will

make  an  overall greater effort to modernise  our

Republic. This shows that we are adopting  a  very

positive  approach to modernise our society.  This

is highly commendable and deserves our applause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a result of our unrelenting

efforts in the past five years to promote economic

growth,  Singapore  has  been  able,  among  other

things,  to achieve a good reputation as an  ideal

place for foreign investment. Let me quote from an

official  study entitled "Comparative  Grading  on

the Selection of Eight Asian Cities for Setting Up

Regional   Centres."  This  document  shows   that

Singapore   has  been  selected  by  international

enterprises and entrepreneurs as a good  place  to

set  up their trading and industrial centres.  The

eight Asian cities are Bangkok, Hong Kong, Manila,

Sydney,   Naha,   Taipei,  Tokyo  and   Singapore.

Compared  with these cities, Singapore  is  second

only  to Hong Kong in the advantages provided  for

foreign investors. In the selection of cities  for

their  investment, economic conditions, geographic

position, communications, transportation, currency

stability,  banking  services, education,  health,

standard of living and political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



stability,  etc, come  into  consideration.   And

Singapore has fully met their demands. The scoring

for  every  condition ranges  from  zero  to  five

points  and  Singapore has been able to  score  94

points,  which is second only to Hong  Kong  which

scores  97  points.  Thus, we  are  positive  that

international  traders have  every  confidence  in

selecting  Singapore  for  their  commercial   and

industrial  enterprises. If we can  modernise  and

provide better facilities and services, it will be

a  question  of  time before we become  the  first

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to increase

productivity, promote industrial growth and  speed

up  our economic growth, it is necessary to review

and amend the existing Labour Ordinance, 1955, the

Shop Assistants Employment Ordinance, 1957 and the

Clerks Employment Ordinance, 1957. The purpose  is

to keep abreast with new changing situations. This

review  will  create more employment opportunities

and  will  solve,  to  some  extent,  our  present

unemployment problem. From the economic  point  of

view,  developing  countries are  generally  faced

with  the problem of unemployment and the  raising

of  the standard of living of their people. If  we

want  to  raise  the standard  of  living  of  our

people, we must, first of all, resolve the problem

of    unemployment.   Therefore,   I    think    a

comprehensive  labour  law  introduced   at   this

juncture  is  in  keeping with  the  need  of  the

present development of our country. All economists

know  that  if  many  people are  unemployed,  the

purchasing power of the average national  of  that

society    will    be   lowered   correspondingly.

Therefore,  the main solution to the  unemployment

problem  is  to raise the living standard  of  the

people   and  set  up  a  more  balanced  national

economy.   The  diversification  of  our   economy

carried  out at present is the most effective  way

of  increasing  employment opportunities  and  the

national  income. As the Member for  Nee  Soon,  I

welcome  the introduction of comprehensive  labour

legislation proposed in the President's Speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our country is small, but our

citizens realise their duties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



especially when they are faced with decisive years

ahead. Two-thirds of our population are youths. If

we  can  provide  them  with effective  and  well-planned  training, they will be  able  to  make  a

useful  contribution to our country. Therefore,  I

stress  the importance of reforming our  secondary

education  system. At the same time, I express  my

full  support  for  the suggested  reform  of  the

secondary  education system, as contained  in  the

President's Speech, which will enable our  school-beavers  to  become  producers  instead  of   mere

consumers.  This  point is very important,  as  it

will  have a decisive effect on the future of  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me sum up what I have said

in  this  House.  For the sake  of  the  long-term

interests  of  the Republic of Singapore  and  the

future  of  our  younger generations  to  come,  I

welcome and support the policy speech delivered by

the President. At the same time, I will do my best

during  my  term of office to help in  the  smooth

implementation of the Government's policies.



<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I express my support for the motion

moved by the Prime Minister thanking the President

for his speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P, won a complete victory at the

recent   general  elections  because  the   people

supported us. Thus we shall once more do our  best

to  serve the country. Although there is only  one

party  in  this Parliament, we are not  dictators.

Apart   from   the  Ministers  and   Parliamentary

Secretaries, there are other Members in this House

whose  duty  it is to make constructive criticisms

of Government's measures and policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think some regulations relating

to  the  Housing  and  Development  Board  of  the

Ministry of National Development should be changed

because  of  certain incidents  which  have  taken

place. Recently, in the Tiong Bahru area, a coffee-shop  owner committed suicide by jumping down from

his flat because he had allowed his premises to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



be  used  as  a  gambling  place.  I  suppose  the

regulations  of the Housing and Development  Board

have    been    inherited   from   the    previous

administration, and not drafted by the P.A.P., and

they  have caused difficulties. I hope that  these

regulations will be amended to avoid difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the present Government is going

to  introduce  pools gambling in addition  to  the

present   Singapore  Sweepstake,   and   yet   the

Government  does  not allow ordinary  citizens  to

gamble in a small way in coffee-shops! Is this not

a  contradiction? On the one hand, the  Government

allows big sweeps to be run in Singapore and wants

to introduce a new form of pools gambling, but, on

the  other hand, it prohibits the small  man  from

gambling  in  a  small way. I hope the  Government

will change these regulations and stop this unfair

treatment.  The regulations should be  revised  in

such  a  way that first offenders would be  warned

and  second offenders would be fined without being

evicted from Board premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is the sale of flats. Those unable

to  buy flats under the home ownership scheme will

be  asked  to  move to Toa Payoh,  and  this  will

certainly  cause hardship to them. Of course,  the

principle  behind  this scheme  is  good,  but  if

people have no money to buy their own flats, it is

not  proper  to  evict  them.  The  Minister  must

investigate  such cases and find out whether  this

policy of evicting tenants because they cannot buy

the  flats  they  live in is in keeping  with  our

democratic  socialist  principles.  We  must  look

after the interest of the poor people. We must not

think too much of those people who have money.  We

must equally pay attention to those people without

money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards transportation, all the bus companies

should  be  nationalised. Then there  will  be  an

overall  improvement in our public transportation.

Unfortunately, the Minister for Communications  is

not here. Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see today that

people  are suffering great inconvenience  because

of the poor transport system. Every morning when I

go to office, I see a lot of civil servants



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



waiting  for  buses.  This is  a  pathetic  sight,

because  they have to waste a lot of time  waiting

for  buses to take them to work. They are like  so

many  ants, and like ants trapped in a frying pan,

they  suffer greatly. So because they cannot board

the buses in time for work, they have to travel in

pirate   taxis.  Before  the  bus  companies   are

nationalised,  we must allow the pirate  taxis  to

Operate  as  express taxis. We must  not  consider

pirate  taxis as illegal and confiscate them.  The

operators  of these vehicles have no  money.  They

have  to borrow it from finance companies  to  pay

for  the vehicles. So how can you confiscate their

vehicles  when they have not fully paid for  them?

For  the  time  being, we must allow these  pirate

taxis to continue to operate as express taxis,  so

that  although  they are not allowed  to  pick  up

passengers  at the bus stops they are  allowed  to

discharge passengers at such places. In this  way,

pirate  taxi  operators  will  have  a  means   of

livelihood.  Instead  of  Government  confiscating

their   vehicles  if  they  have   committed   any

offences, they should be fined. The point is  that

they  are  self-employed  people.  They  are  also

people with self-respect. Although they are  poor,

they  do  not go to the Social Welfare  Department

for  assistance.  They make their  own  living  by

operating a pirate taxi. So the Government  should

not  confiscate  their vehicles  which  are  their

means  of employment. Mr Speaker, in my view,  if

the  pirate  taxi  operators  are  arrested,  they

should  be fined instead of having their  vehicles

confiscated, because they have to borrow money  to

pay for these vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of education, I hope the Minister

for Education will pay attention to what I have to

say.  All  the  primary school-leavers  should  be

posted  to  the  secondary  schools  nearer  their

homes.  If the students live to the north  of  the

bridge in Chinatown, they should be posted to  the

schools  in  that area instead of  to  schools  in

Jalan  Kayu, or Jalan Sungei or some other places.

If  a  student in Chinatown is told to go to Jalan

Hwi Yoh, then his posting is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



blind posting. He should not be posted to a school

so  far away from his home. Many students in Tiong

Bahru  have  complained to me  about  their  wrong

posting.  I have written on their behalf  for  re-posting to schools in the Chinatown or Tiong Bahru

area.  All  students should be posted  to  schools

nearer  their homes. This is the policy we  should

be  implementing. There should be no mistake about

this.  But there have been so many wrong postings.

This   is   very  exasperating  to   the   parents

concerned. I wonder if the Minister for  Education

is  aware of all this. If the principle of posting

students  nearer to their homes is  adopted,  then

the parents will not be exasperated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards secondary school-leavers, there are

many of them who are unable to find places in  the

upper  secondary classes. They and  their  parents

are  very  worried. They are so worried that  they

cry  because  their parents had  hoped  that  they

would   be   able  to  further  their  education.

Although  the  points  they  got  in  the   School

Certificate  Examination  exceeded  21,  there  is

latent  talent  in  them. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  some

children  develop their latent talent at  a  later

stage.  I  shall deal with the question  of  money

later on. We must think of these students who have

failed  to  gain  places in  the  upper  secondary

classes  as  well  as  their  parents.  If   these

students have to leave school half-way, it will be

a   very  sad  thing.  I  hope  the  Minister  for

Education  will have more classes set  up  at  the

upper secondary level. If he has no more money, he

can  come  to this House and try to get some  more

money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards health, I believe we should set up

more  markets in Singapore. I do not know  whether

the   Minister   for  Health   is   around   here.

[Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will Members please listen to the

Member for Ulu Pandan with the same courtesy  with

which he listens to other Members?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We should set up

more markets to accommodate more hawkers. If we do

not have enough money to set up more markets, then

we can get the people to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



invest in the building of markets. I believe there

are  many  rich  people in our  country  and  they

should be invited to invest in the construction of

markets.  They  can  set up limited  companies.  I

believe we require at least 200 markets. I do  not

know  how  many  markets we have. Can  I  ask  the

Parliamentary  Secretary? We have  less  than  .20

markets now, I understand. We must have at  least.

200  markets. This is very important. If we do not

have  enough markets, then we have to worry  about

the  hawkers'  problem. I am the  adviser  to  the

Hawkers'  Association and I am  in  close  contact

with them. I am fully aware of their problems.  We

want  our State to, be clean, but without  an  ade

quate  number  of  markets we are  bound  to  have

hawkers  in the streets. Because of these hawkers,

we  will not be able to keep the streets clean. So

the  authorities will arrest them and cancel their

licences. So we must provide an outlet for hawkers

to  operate. Give them the markets and  they  will

not  come  to the streets. If we try to keep  them

out   of   the  streets  and  do  not  give   them

alternative accommodation, it is not fair.  If  we

build  more  markets  to  accommodate  them,   our

streets  will be clean. There will be less traffic

congestion.  It  is a pity that the  Minister  for

Communications is not here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On national service, Mr Speaker, the graduates

of  the universities and the colleges should  have

their  period of national service reduced  by  one

year, so that they will be able to contribute more

to  our nation-building after their graduation. We

should  not keep them in the army too long at  the

expense  of  their  parents. I  think  two  years'

national  service is too long. It  should  be  cut

down  to one year so that these graduates can come

out into society and do more work for our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we must also pay attention to the

setting  up of a marine college or institute.  The

Prime  Minister has already said that we are going

to  embark  upon  deep-sea  fishing.  But  without

trained  marine personnel we will not be  able  to

implement  our scheme in deep-sea fishing.  If  we

have  a  marine  institute, we cannot  only  train

enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



personnel for our own use but we may also be  able

to  train some of them as captains and masters  to

serve on foreign ships as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about industrialisation, do we have a big

steel  mill?  We must set up one. We must  welcome

investments in this mill, something like $200,000.

We  must  also  have  proper planning  to  run  it

properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we should also try to improve our

foreign  trade  so  that we can  sell  our  local,

products.  We  should  hold trade  expositions  at

least  twice  a  year. We must seek  international

markets  for our products, otherwise our factories

will  close down. I urge the Minister to note what

I have said on this point.



<br><br>3.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the President in his speech to the House  on

the  evening  of  6th May, 1968,  expressed  three

objectives which the Government seeks to  achieve.

The objectives principally are, (1) to build up  a

defence  capability  to ensure continued  national

security;   (2)   to  eradicate   bad   industrial

practices and to increase productivity in order to

create  a  good climate for increased  investments

and,  in conjunction with this objective, to build

a  sound  relationship between labour,  management

and  Government;  (3) to enhance solidly  national

consciousness to tackle the impending problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to record my support for these three

objectives, without necessarily agreeing with  the

diagnosis of the problems and their solutions. Any

sane  and thinking person will have realised  that

the next few years are crucial and vital years for

the  Republic  and  its  people,  because  of  the

withdrawal of the British Armed Forces, which will

affect  our national security and income  and  the

political situation in the whole of this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do believe that the people of

Singapore  have  the  ingenuity,  discipline   and

spirit to face the challenges that are to come, as

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



had  in the years gone by. The workers, of whom  I

am  one,  do recognise that when there is mounting

unemployment,  economic and  industrial  expansion

for  the Republic is ever more imperative for  our

own  job security and more for our own well-being.

I am sure they will support any reasonable measure

to  solve the grave unemployment situation in  the

Republic.  However, Mr Speaker, it is regrettable

to note that Ministerial speeches tend to give the

impression  that the workers have all  along  been

mainly   responsible  for  malpractices  and   bad

productivity, and the only way to cure it  all  is

to  introduce  some labour taming or maybe  labour

killing  measures.  Is  the  labour  movement   so

irresponsible?  Statistics show  that  there  were

fewer  and  fewer strikes, and records  also  show

that  whenever  there  were  disputes,  the  trade

unions  would use the good offices of the Ministry

of  Labour  or  would  use the  machinery  of  the

Industrial  Arbitration  Court  to  settle   their

disputes.  I  believe that at this point  of  time

when  we  are entering into a crucial  phase,  co-operation  between the workers and the  Government

is  important  and  necessary.  I  would  strongly

suggest  to the Government not to make the workers

their   natural   whipping-boys.  The   Government

should,  I  think,  desist from making  hysterical

allegations    of   malpractices   and    publicly

castigating the workers. Such an attitude  is  not

conducive  to  bringing  about  good  co-operation

between the Government and the workers. Sir,  this

is  not going to create a good image but will have

the  opposite  effect of creating an  untrue  ugly

image.  If  it  is  the  Government's  policy   to

establish   sensible  relations  between   labour,

management  and Government, the Government  itself

must  show the way. The only way to get  real  co-operation  is to have consultations on matters  of

mutual interest. And where matters concern labour,

consultations  must be held with  the  appropriate

trade  union  organisations. To  illustrate,  when

there  are  legislative or other kinds of  changes

affecting  labour,  consultations  must  be   held

preferably ending



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



with  agreement  rather than that the  changes  be

rammed down the throat of labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, there must be genuine

consultations between the Government and the trade

union movement on the proposed Employment Bill. If

the  purpose  of  this Bill is to  create  greater

employment, it is worthy of support. But it  might

as  well be said now that with the repeal  of  the

Clerks   Employment  Ordinance,  1957,   and   the

standardising of working hours for  clerks  at  44

hours   per   week,  theoretically  speaking,   an

employer  requires  five'  clerks  less  for   the

functions  that were formerly carried  out  by  44

clerks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aim of the proposed Bill is also to reduce

certain  fringe benefits like leave,  the  overall

effect  will be worse. In such a situation,  there

will be greater unemployment through retrenchment,

which  gives a result contrary to the aim  of  the

Bill. One of the aims of the Bill is to check  the

abuse  of fringe benefits. May I say, without  any

reservation, that the fringe benefits provided  in

the Labour Ordinance, 1955, or the Shop Assistants

Employment   Ordinance,  1957,   or   the   Clerks

Employment  Ordinance, 1957, are not all  of  them

adequate? In fact, more have been obtained by  way

of  free union / management negotiations or awards

of the Industrial Arbitration Court.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think that if there is abuse of fringe

benefits  by  individuals, the  cure  is  for  the

employer - this includes the Government -  to  put

it  under  control. To reduce or to  limit  fringe

benefits because of the misdemeanours of a few  is

an  admission of poor management, which is not  in

accordance with the Government's declared  policy.

It  would  be  pertinent to ask the  question:  in

which  sector is abuse of fringe benefits rampant?

Is  the bad area in the private sector? I am  sure

this is not found in the private sector. I do  not

think any hard-headed private employer would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



tolerate  for a day, or an instant, the  abuse  of

Standing  Orders  or  the terms  of  a  collective

agreement.  May I remind the Government,  lest  it

has  been  forgotten, that it was only  in  recent

years  that trade unions have managed  -  and  not

without   struggle  and  sacrifice  -  to   secure

reasonable wages, fringe benefits and job security

for   its   members.   Therefore,   very   careful

consideration should be given to the  question  of

depriving  the workers of the benefits which  they

care most.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have said earlier that the workers can

make  sacrifices for the nation, and the sacrifice

of  certain fringe benefits can be made if  it  is

definitely going to create more jobs in  the  firm

or  in industry. But it is most unlikely that  the

trade  unions  can  give up the  basic  rights  to

organise, to protect its members and to have  free

negotiations without objection and dissent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my earnest hope that in the end the

proposed  Employment  Bill does  not  degrade  the

dignity  of  labour, does not cause job insecurity

and   demoralisation.  I  hope  the  Minister  for

Labour,  who  is  concurrently  the  Minister  for

Foreign Affairs, will not have the task of selling

Singapore in that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the programme of the Ministry of Labour,

I wish to commend the Minister for his proposal to

allow  the Central Provident Fund balances  to  be

used  to  pay for the first instalment of  Housing

and   Development  Board  flats   and   that   the

additional  contributions made by the  member  and

his  employer  can  be used  to  pay  off  monthly

instalments of both Housing and Development  Board

flats and privately-built houses. I have commended

the  Minister  not  so  much because  the  Central

Provident Fund balances can be used but that  home

ownership  fulfils the desire of every  person  to

own a home. And also because the scheme itself  is

in accordance with socialist principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would venture to suggest to the Minister to

allow  current Central Provident Fund balances  to

be  used  to pay off loans from building societies

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



finance  societies  for the  purchase  of  houses,

because  of  the high rate of interest charged  by

these financial companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the programme of the Ministry

of  Labour,  I wish to draw the attention  of  the

House to the fact that no provisions are made  for

unemployment  insurance. With the high  degree  of

unemployment,  surely this must  be  an  important

matter.  Can the Minister elucidate what  happened

to  the  payroll tax collected which was meant  to

start an unemployment fund? What are the prospects

of   a  person  who  is  to  be  made  jobless  by

termination of service? Outside the provisions  of

collective  agreements  generally,  there  is   no

provision  in  any of the three labour  Ordinances

for  payment  of  service  gratuity.  The  jobless

person  gets  $21 as public assistance,  which  is

hardly  enough  to meet the daily necessities  for

survival,  let  alone pay for Housing  Board  flat

rent.  It  is  now  proposed by the  Minister  for

Health   that   such  a  person  be  charged   for

hospitalisation. Would such a person,  if  he  was

injured  doing work for his employer, be asked  to

pay  for  his  recovery? I  think  the  Government

should not be too smug about what welfare benefits

they provide to the unemployed or sick people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the Government's objectives is to

awaken and to infuse national consciousness in the

population  to  meet the national problems  coming

ahead. I do suggest to the Government to use fully

the   mass  media  of  radio  and  television   to

publicise  the  patriotism of our  loyal  citizens

Instead of almost subserviently depending  on  one

local  newspaper to announce contributions to  the

National  Defence Fund. This particular newspaper,

I  learn  from one well-known employee,  responded

quickly to an appeal of another country; but not a

stir of response to just as urgent a need for  our

Republic.  Even their own employees recently  gave

something, but not them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think hon. Members must feel heartened that the

people  of Singapore have demonstrated their  love

and  loyalty to the country. This is surely a good

sign.  The ordinary people - the workers,  trishaw

riders,  taxi-drivers, hawkers, farmers and  their

children   -to  the  greatest  degree,   must   be

commended   for  sacrificing  their   savings   or

earnings  for  the  national  need.  Some   worked

overtime  and  gave  their  overtime  pay  to  the

nation,  while  others  gave  their  whole   day's

earnings. But there are executives who shudder  to

give  up  their one day's entertainment money  for

the  National Defence Fund. This latter  group  is

apt  to put the blame on the ordinary workers  for

anything that goes wrong in industry. This  brings

up  the  question  as to how much the  executives,

including those in Government service, who are not

covered  by the employment law should be  made  to

sacrifice.  It  is  common  knowledge  that  these

executives   enjoy  fringe  benefits,   especially

annual  vacation,  far  in  excess  of  what   the

ordinary worker gets. They are the ones who  judge

whether a day's work put in by the ordinary worker

is  worth  a  day's  wages. But under  our  social

system who is to judge whether the executives  are

worth  their  salary? I purposely  use  the  terms

"wages"  and  "salary", because in the President's

Speech  the  Government has used the word  "wages"

which  usually refers to earnings of the  ordinary

workers.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary workers would like to ask whether

the   fruits  of  their  sacrifices  go   to   the

businessmen and executives and are remitted out of

the  country. What measures are there to see  that

more  people  are  employed by  business  concerns

after the proposed legislative measures have  been

introduced? The ordinary workers have the right to

know, for they just cannot pack up and migrate  to

another land.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, next I wish to deal with the

Ministries  of  National  Development,   Law   and

Health. The matter is the question of the handling

of  rubbish by these Ministries. I hope they  will

decide  among themselves as to which  Ministry  is

responsible  for  this  before  the  question   of

cleanliness becomes unmanageable. The question  is

that   the  Public  Utilities  Board,  under   the

Ministry  of  Law, wants to impose a trade  refuse

fee  of  $4 for work not done by them in  Petaling

Road  Market in Kallang Constituency. The  problem

is  that  the  Housing  and Development  Board  is

already charging $35 and $30 for cooked foodstalls

and  wet  foodstalls  respectively  inclusive   of

service and conservancy charges. The worst  of  it

all  is  that  the Public Utilities  Board,  after

initiating  the  move, passed the problem  to  the

Ministry   of   Health  for   a   decision.   Such

bureaucratic    wrangling   and   tug-of-war    is

definitely not conducive to good administration of

the public service. I support legislative measures

to   punish   litter  bugs,  but  the   Government

departments responsible for clearing rubbish  must

also  do the jobs they are paid for. In connection

with  this  matter, I wish to make an  observation

that  some Housing and Development Board  Estates,

including  the  Kallang  Basin  Estate,  have   an

unsightly appearance caused by rubbish whether  at

nine  in the morning, or at noon or three  in  the

evening, which are within working hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To round off my speech, I wish to say that only

the  People's  Action Party has  manifestly  shown

itself  to  be the only party that has  shown  its

concern  and  welfare  for the  Republic  and  the

people. Only the People's Action Party has been  a

true  and  genuine Opposition Party and  governing

Party.  Only  the People's Action Party  has  been

through  thick  and  thin under all  circumstances

with  the people. In spite of all the tasks ahead,

the  People's Action Party is willing to undertake

the  responsibility of looking after the  country.

The  people have clearly shown their faith in  the

Government.  The  Government cannot  jettison  the

trust and faith of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition group and

parties    outside   Parliament    have    behaved

outrageously  by  not offering  themselves  as  an

alternative  government, and it  can  be  expected

that  they  will  be  more  irresponsible  as   an

Opposition   in   Parliament   and   still    more

irresponsible  as a Government. They  deserve  the

people's rejection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last and not least of all, I wish to express my

appreciation  and gratitude to the  President  for

his  honourable presence and his speech on  Monday

evening.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to  support  the

Prime   Minister's  motion  of   thanks   to   the

President.



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   President's  Speech,  the  Addendum  to  the

speech,  and  the  series of Ministerial  speeches

provide  a  clear  and adequate  analysis  of  the

problems  we  have  to face in the  crucial  years

ahead and the not so pleasant measures we have  to

face in overcoming these problems. These measures,

bold  and  imaginative,  will  require  more  than

average effort on the part of everyone to succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our record for the past 2- years of independence

should   not  leave  any  doubt  that   both   the

Government  and the people have the will  and  the

capacity,  the  courage and determination  to  see

through  these  challenging years  and  to  return

triumphant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour will have on its hands

problems  of such a nature that what have hitherto

been  regarded as unpopular measures  have  to  be

taken  to  aim  at changing the workers'  and  the

unionists' attitude towards society at  large.  To

cope  with  the  acute  unemployment  problem,  to

streamline the conditions of service, to  regulate

overtime  to  enable a wider spread of employment,

to  leave out certain fringe benefits, to increase

productivity and to promote industrial  growth,  a

comprehensive Employment Bill will be  introduced.

Sir,  this  is  a  bold and farsighted  move.  Our

potential  investors must be adequately  convinced

that here



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore  we have a disciplined labour  force

and a sound and healthy industrial climate so that

they may, after weighing the pros and cons, decide

to  stake their money with us. I am glad  that  in

this respect, the Member for Bukit Ho Swee, who is

also the Secretary-General of the N.T.U.C., has in

no  uncertain terms declared his support  for  the

proposal  for  and  on behalf of  the  workers  in

Singapore. This in itself is a clear indication of

the workers' understanding of the problem. Sir,  I

have not the slightest doubt that the Minister for

Labour,  when  considering  these  measures,  will

always  bear in mind the fact that the P.A.P, has

all  along  been returned on a socialist  platform

set  up to eradicate any form of exploitation  and

that it will not be tripped over by the apparently

over-whelming  temptation posed  by  the  need  to

provide  more  employment  opportunities  and   to

promote  industrial growth in  the  coming  years.

Neither do I doubt the wisdom of the unionists who

need  not  be  reminded that  the  surest  way  of

destroying  any  organised trade  unionism  is  to

allow  the  country's economy to  fall  apart  and

unemployment    to    assume    proportions     of

uncontrollable magnitude. May I, however, add that

outdated  Ordinances, which this  Employment  Bill

will seek to repeal, such as the Clerks Employment

Ordinance,   1957,   were  designed   to   provide

advantages  to the white-collar workers  over  the

blue-collar  ones who will in the  years  to  come

ensure   the   success  of  our  industrialisation

effort.  It will, therefore, not only be necessary

at  this  stage  to standardise the conditions  of

service  but  also  to provide incentives  in  the

coming   Bills  to  the  blue-collar  workers   by

possibly  enhancing  their  social  position   and

giving them advantages over their counterparts  in

white-collar  employment,  for  after  all,  rapid

industrialisation is the order of the day.  May  I

also add, Sir, that when introducing the Bill, the

Government  should always bear  in  mind  that  it

should encourage its own employees to be exemplary

in  their attitudes. Hon. Members will agree  with

me that in the years gone by, employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



in  the  various statutory boards were found  most

likely  to abuse any fringe benefits. Let us  also

hope that this Bill will bring with it a change of

heart among these workers for, being on the public

payroll,  they have to be more than just  ordinary

employees. May I also call upon the Government, as

an  employer, not to abuse any restrictions on the

workers  that  may be introduced in  the  proposed

Bill, lest others will follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now draw the attention of

the  House  to  the section on urban  renewal  and

redevelopment  in the Addendum to the  President's

Speech.  I come from a constituency which will  in

the  next  few  years  be completely  changed  and

altered  by these schemes. I will not be so  naive

as  to dispute the necessity of urban renewal  and

redevelopment. Indeed, I welcome the  Government's

measures   taken   to   encourage   and    promote

substantial participation from the private  sector

in this respect by making necessary administrative

changes  and providing incentives, so  that  these

schemes may be more rapidly and efficiently pushed

forward.   However,  may  I  remind  the  Ministry

concerned  to treat assurances given,  that  there

will  be  adequate compensation and that  affected

tenants  will  have adequate time to  move  on  to

alternative accommodation, with more effectiveness

and  seriousness, especially in its administrative

machinery?    Officers    charged     with     the

responsibility of resettling affected tenants must

demonstrate a clear understanding of the  problems

involved.  These officers must, in  spite  of  the

stresses  and strains that go with the  job,  stay

composed  and in their treatment of this sensitive

problem  must  at  all times be beyond  doubt  and

reproach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will quote a recent case of resettlement

in  my  constituency to support what I  have  just

said.  At least four engineering works were  asked

to   move   out   without  their   being   offered

alternative accommodation. The officer  in  charge

made  an offer by asking them to move out as  soon

as possible and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



possibly  to  move  back at  a  later  stage  when

circumstances permitted. Sir, if only this officer

would  understand better the cost and  the  labour

involved  in moving out and moving back  foundries

and  machinery,  I think possibly this  might  not

have  happened.  It is hoped that steps  could  be

taken  early  enough  to prevent  my  constituents

having  to  operate their foundries  and  to  park

their machinery along the roadside. May I suggest,

Sir,   that  local  organisations,  such  as   the

Consultative    Committees,   be   requested    to

participate   and  help  in  solving  resettlement

problems  so that with an understanding  of  local

conditions, resettlement will not only be  carried

out fairly and efficiently but will also appear to

have been so done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me hope that in the very near future

slums  will be replaced by high quality  buildings

and that people who are resettled in the course of

doing   so   will  feel  happy  that  the   little

sacrifices  they may be asked to make are  not  in

vain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I think it is appropriate for me

to  congratulate the Ministry of Law and  National

Development and the Public Works Department on the

grand  work  they  have put in to  cope  with  the

phenomenal  increase  in  power,  water  and   gas

consumption over the last few years.  But  I  must

confess  that  I  am alarmed by the  feeling  that

overhead charges added to the production  cost  of

these  amenities might have increased too  rapidly

for  anyone to be comfortable. I hope it  will  be

checked and brought to order. I also feel that  it

is  my  duty to caution the Public Utilities Board

against  allowing itself, on account of trying  to

cope  with  the  increase in demand  for  electric

power,  to  be  intimidated  into  expanding   its

generating  network at such a rate  as  to  affect

sound  planning, or to retain or employ expatriate

officers,  who do not have our interest at  heart,

to  manage  and  superintend over these  extension

stations,   especially  if   such   officers   are

inefficient  and  proved to be  irresponsible.  We

must  and  have to allow our own local bright  and

energetic   engineers  to  participate   in   such

management,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



because ultimately it is they who cannot afford to

see  their own country's progress affected by  any

disruption  in the power generating industry,  the

result  of  which will be too horrifying  even  to

imagine.  In  this context, I must hasten  to  say

that  the  mere sending away of officers on  short

training  courses and conferences is  not  enough.

Local bright engineers must be given the trust and

encouragement to manage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to make a further

suggestion  to  the Ministry of  Law  and  to  the

Public  Utilities Board, and that is to look  into

the   possibility   of   making   some   kind   of

arrangement,  say in the form of a  grid  network,

with  our  neighbour  in  the  north  in  ensuring

security  in loading capacity. Such an arrangement

will  not only help establish good neighbourliness

but  it  will  also help to cut down expenses  and

inefficient   standby  plants.  Of  course,   even

countries which are technically more advanced than

we  are  are co-operating or seeking to co-operate

in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the Ministry of Science and

Technology, I must first of all welcome the timely

setting  up  of this Ministry. I read  with  great

interest  the speech of the Minister  for  Science

and Technology on science education and industrial

development.  In his speech he has shown  a  clear

understanding  of  the  need  to  streamline   our

technical   education  system   to   satisfy   the

requirements  arising  from our  industrialisation

effort.  True  enough, our engineers,  technicians

and   their  supporting  artisans  are  not  being

produced in the right proportions. But if it is  a

set-up  of  a  quasi-Government to have  a  set-up

whereby  10  engineers with four  technicians  are

supervising  and  being  supported  by,  say,  ten

artisans,  and  if  such a  set-up  is  not  being

checked,  I  would  contend that  any  attempt  to

streamline  and  produce  manpower  in  the  right

proportions would become meaningless.  Sir,  I  am

optimistic that the high-powered Cabinet Committee

established to tackle this problem will soon  come

out with a solution. And one day - we hope it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



will  be  soon - we will see our education  system

harmonising  with  our  social  and  environmental

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember also there was talk of

centralising our apprenticeship training. In  this

connection, I hasten to request the Government  to

institute  a centralised apprenticeship management

without  further  delay, and  no  effort  must  be

spared  to  ensure its success. Private  employers

must   be   urged  to  institute  a  comprehensive

apprenticeship scheme with active assistance  from

this  management. In so doing, it will be able  to

provide a well-trained technical base.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, Sir, the Ministry of Science and

Technology  must  take  on  rapidly  the  task  of

providing enough people with the know-how  at  the

right   place  to  ensure  the  success   of   our

industrialisation effort. Talking about  technical

know-how,  I  would request the  Finance  Ministry

seriously to consider instituting stricter control

over  the  quality of products that bear the  mark

"Product  of  Singapore". It is no  use  producing

synthetic leather bags at a cost higher than  what

is imported from outside if these locally produced

bags  are  not going to be any good in quality  at

all. It is no use protecting these products if  we

are  producing them at such low quality that  they

will never be able to have a chance to go into any

international market. Sir, if we are to compete in

the  highly competitive international market,  let

us ensure that our products are up to the mark and

that the quality is up to specifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I conclude by saying that come what may in

the years ahead, we have no choice but to succeed.

The  result of failure is too much even to ponder.

I  am  confident, as I said earlier, that we  will

make it. I quote the Prime Minister in saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The response of our population to these

difficulties  that  we are  faced  over  the  last

decade  has been a constant source of inspiration,

the ability to adjust, to adapt and to change.  It

is  this collective sense of endeavour which  will

carry us through.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I say triumph we will. Sir, I beg to support

the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is convenient to

<br><br>5.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, one encouraging point in the

President's  policy speech is that our  Government

will  be making use of the available time to build

up  our  defence capability, because by  1971  the

British  will  have  withdrawn their  troops  from

Singapore. We can make use of our available  human

and  other  resources, not to expand  rapidly  our

military  establishment, but  to  recruit  only  a

limited  number of regular national servicemen  to

be in the reserves. They will be receiving regular

training  so  that our resources may be  used  for

nation-building  and for constructive  production.

Furthermore,  our  population  may  take  part  in

production while they are always ready for combat.

This is a very wise policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that not very long ago Israeli troops

defeated  their  enemies who were ten  times  more

powerful than they were in just a matter of a  few

days.  What  does  this mean? It  means  that  the

people  of a country should place the interest  of

the country above individual interest. At the same

time, the people should have very high morale. Our

Government  realises that we are a  small  country

with  a  small  population. We have been  able  to

learn  a lesson from the historical incident which

I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



just  mentioned and we shall implement our  policy

accordingly. This is laudable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that there was not enough emphasis on

a  programme  for public construction  and  social

welfare   in  the  President's  speech.   Such   a

programme  will  improve  the  livelihood  of  the

people.  Also,  there  is a lack  of  planning  to

reduce  the difference between the living standard

of  the rural people and that of the urban people.

It cannot be denied that the People's Action Party

was elected to power for the third time because it

has  shown  a high degree of efficiency, integrity

and  incorruptibility. But more important is  that

it  has  made significant achievements in  raising

the  standard of living of the people.  Otherwise,

the   P.A.P, would  have  already  followed   the

footsteps  of  some  Afro-Asian  countries   whose

governments do not have a firm foundation. In some

of   the  Afro-Asian  countries,  no  matter  what

political pattern or political party is in  power,

it  is  only a matter of eight to ten years before

military men take over the government. There is no

democratic  election.  Following  this,  there  is

violent  revolution and the Communists take  over.

Then  there  is a one-party dictatorship  and  the

young  shoot  of democracy is uprooted.  Why?  The

cause  for this kind of situation mainly  lies  in

the  fact  that the people in power are interested

only  in making money and they have forgotten  the

well-being  of the people and the duty  to  be  of

service to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that in the 1970s we have to

spend  large sums of money on defence and military

establishments.  But  it  cannot  be  denied  that

public  construction in the rural areas  is  still

lagging far behind that in the urban areas. So  we

must  redouble our efforts in public  construction

in  the  rural areas. Otherwise, what happened  in

1963  in the rural areas would be repeated,  i.e.,

the  rural  areas  would be manipulated  by  anti-national elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me talk about education. We all know

that   in   a   newly  independent  country   like

Singapore, the long-term



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



policy and objectives of the People's Action Party

have  a telling effect on the future of the people

and  on the policy of democratic socialism amongst

the  new  generation. The long-term objectives  of

the P.A.P, will play a very important role in this

aspect.  One  of the means to achieve these  long-term objectives is education. Ever since we in the

P.A.P, came to power, we have been allotting large

sums  of  money  on education. The purpose  is  to

educate  and  bring up our younger  generation  so

that in future they may make a better contribution

and  render more service to our country. It cannot

be  denied that the achievements of our country in

education have been meritorious. But now,  because

of  the  rapid  changes in our  situation,  it  is

necessary to make our education pattern  meet  the

needs of a new environment. We have to review  and

reform our existing education policy. In the past,

there  was  a  quantitative bias in our  education

policy  because  we  had to  eradicate  illiteracy

quickly. This objective has now been achieved. The

teachers  played  an important role  in  achieving

this  objective. But today, the quantitative  bias

in  our education policy is outdated. What we  are

looking  for  today  is  a  qualitative  education

policy  because, in such a country as  ours  where

there are no natural resources, the youths are the

precious wealth we have. If we do not educate them

well  and  turn  them out into rugged,  brave  and

intelligent  people  endowed with  scientific  and

technological  knowledge, the perpetual  existence

of Singapore will be at stake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in July last year, I saw the Youth Festival

organised  by the Ministry of Education.  We  have

witnessed  the sudden re-awakening of the  younger

generation  who have changed their past attitudes.

They   have  responded  keenly  to  cadetship   in

schools,  the Police, the Army, the Air Force  and

the Navy. This is proof that they are awakening to

new  challenges and demonstrating the spirit of  a

new  generation. If the Ministry of Education  can

make  military  training  one  of  the  compulsory

subjects  in  the middle school curriculum,  these

youths will be like hedge-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



hogs which cannot be swallowed easily. The task of

cultivating   group  interest  to   serve   as   a

generating  force  for  our  progress  cannot   be

undertaken  by the administrators in the  Ministry

of   Education   alone.  Therefore,   all   school

administrators and teachers must do their  bit  to

help  in this task. So the re-training of teachers

and  administrative  personnel  is  necessary.  Of

course,  this  can  be  undertaken  during   their

vacation or holidays. The main purpose is to  give

them  a  clearer understanding of the Government's

education policy, to make them aware of the  trust

that the country and the people have in them,  and

to  inculcate in them a love for their country. At

the same time, our society and new country need  a

group   of   dedicated  intellectuals   to   help.

Therefore, the Ministry of Education must adopt  a

new  criterion  for  the  promotion  of  teachers,

namely,   their  contribution  and   services   as

teachers   to   society:   for   instance,   their

activities    in   the   Citizens'    Consultative

Committees, community centres, voluntary and other

organisations,  and services rendered  to  society

generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that when inspectors of schools

find teachers making mistakes, they should try  to

make  the teachers correct their mistakes  on  the

spot  and not lord it over them and make a  record

of  the mistakes in their files for the purpose of

record and not for the purpose of improvement.  It

is  important  that inspectors of  schools  should

impart to the teachers a spirit of patriotism  and

inform  them of the nature of our education policy

in  order  to help them carry out more effectively

their duties as teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me supplement what the Member for

Serangoon  Gardens said yesterday on  the  present

examination  system. First of all, I  support  his

views  on  the  abolition of  the  Primary  School

Leaving Examination. We all know that the Ministry

of  Education calls it the Primary School  Leaving

Examination.   But,   in  fact,   this   sort   of

examination is a judgment on the future of  a  13-year old child, because his fate is sealed by  the

result of the examination. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  will  put  him  either  in  an  academic

secondary school, or a secondary technical  school

or a secondary vocational school, depending on his

result.   Sir,   a  13-year  old  child   has   no

fundamental  understanding of or any  concern  for

his  fate. Ninety per cent of the questions in the

present  Primary  School Leaving  Examination  are

objective tests and there is an element of chance.

This  kind  of examination cannot truly  determine

the intelligence of a student. It is rather unfair

to  seal his fate in this manner and many  a  fine

boy's  future  may  be  destroyed.  Attention  has

already  been  paid  to  this  point  in  advanced

countries like England. I hope we can take a  step

forward  and  abolish the Primary  School  Leaving

Examination  and  replace  it  by  a   Middle   II

Selective Examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of our discussion about building up a

brave  and rugged generation, I am surprised  that

there  is  no  physical education subject  in  the

Middle  IV,  Secondary  IV  and  Higher  Secondary

Examination.   Sir,  although  our   schools   are

expanding  to saturation point, we are very  short

of  art  and craft teachers. Even the inter-school

sport  meetings  organised by  Government  schools

have  been  largely stopped, because many  schools

cannot   get   physical  education  teachers   and

coaches. To ask a trainee teacher who has not much

knowledge of physical education and who  has  been

trained two hours a week in the Teachers' Training

College to take up the onerous and important  task

of  becoming  a teacher of physical  education  is

like  looking for a fish in the woods.  Therefore,

it is necessary for us to set up an institution of

physical  education in order to train teachers  of

physical  education so that they can  bring  up  a

rugged,  brave, strong, determined, energetic  and

enduring new generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to science and technical

education.  It  cannot  be denied  that  our  past

prosperity   has  all  along  been  dependent   on

commerce and entrepot trade. But now that  we  are

independent, we have to provide our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



own  defence. The British military forces will  be

withdrawing  from Singapore. On top of  this,  our

population  is  increasing and a large  number  of

people  are unemployed. Hereafter, we may  not  be

able  to  depend solely on commerce  and  entrepot

trade  to maintain our economy. The Government  is

going  all  out  to  promote industrialisation  in

order to bolster up our economy, establish our own

defence, resolve the unemployment problem  because

of  the  British  withdrawal from  Singapore,  and

create more employment opportunities for thousands

of  school-leavers every year. It  is  encouraging

local  merchants and even entrepreneurs to  invest

large  sums  in factories in order to create  more

employment    opportunities.   To    succeed    in

industrialisation,  investments  and  markets  are

natural problems. But it is even more important to

reduce production cost, increase productivity  and

raise  the  quality of our manufactured goods.  In

order to achieve this, our education system should

naturally  stress the importance  of  science  and

technical  education. This  is  the  only  way  to

succeed  in industrialisation and achieve economic

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have not only a sound education system

taking in science and technical subjects, but also

well-equipped laboratories and workshops.  At  the

same  time,  it  is also necessary  to  have  more

qualified science and technical teachers who  will

be  responsible  for the teaching of  science  and

technical subjects. Further, full use must be made

of  the  facilities to teach the students so  that

they  will  understand thoroughly  the  theory  of

science   and  its  actual  application.   Science

education  should also emphasise applied  science.

Pure  science  has the objective  of  seeking  the

truth about science and ascertaining the facts  of

phenomena.  It  is  not  of  much  value  to   the

practical  application of science.  Usually  large

sums  of  money and much energy are spent on  pure

science  and, as a result, it does not  contribute

much  to our industrialisation programme. It  does

not  promote the well-being of our people.  If  we

want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



to  succeed in our industrialisation programme, we

must   encourage  applied  science  and  technical

education. In order to industrialise, we need  not

only   ordinary  manual  workers  but  also  large

numbers of technical specialists and engineers. In

addition  to having a sound mind in a sound  body,

these people should also have knowledge of applied

science.  They should also undergo a  considerable

period  of  strict technical training before  they

can become qualified industrial personnel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, from now on the secondary school

curriculum   should  stress  the   importance   of

teaching Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. These

three  subjects are the basis and the  gateway  to

more advanced scientific knowledge. There are  two

points  I  wish  to  emphasise.  One  is  on   the

theoretical aspect of science. The other is on its

practical application. The subjects taught  should

include  not  only the ordinary  basic  theory  of

science  but  they should also be related  to  the

actual  application of the theory and  the  actual

application of the techniques. The first  type  of

science  education is more suited to students  who

are interested in pure science. The second type is

more suited to students who are interested in  the

actual   application  of  science   in   industry.

Comparatively  speaking, applied science  is  more

important  and  there should be more  teaching  of

this  subject than pure science. Thus we may teach

the   students   according  to  their   individual

inclinations,  so  that  we  may  train  them   as

scientists  or  technologists or  experts  in  the

various  fields.  In this way,  there  will  be  a

bright future for our industrialisation programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I fully express my support for the

Prime Minister's motion thanking the President for

his speech.



<br><br>5.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, may I have the privilege of joining our Prime

Minister  in expressing my vote of thanks  to  the

President who has graciously delivered his  Speech

to   the  Second  Parliament  so  soon  after  his

recovery from his recent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



illness.  The measures as outlined in the Addendum

to  the  President's Speech have my full  support.

Without  such  measures to meet the challenges  we

have  to  face  during the next  four  years,  our

chances   of   survival  as  an  independent   and

sovereign people are less hopeful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish now to touch upon the

subjects under the headings "Comprehensive  Labour

Legislation"  and  the  "Central  Provident  Fund"

contained  in  the  memorandum  presented  as   an

Addendum to the President's Speech. The industrial

climate  in  the Republic of Singapore  to  induce

foreign  investors has been attractive during  the

last two years and has improved considerably since

then. But investors have not come forward in large

numbers  as  had  been  expected.  Investors  from

countries  like Japan, Taiwan and  Hong  Kong  and

countries  in Western Europe are still wary  about

labour  conditions in the Republic. The number  of

investors is not up to our expectations because of

the   prevailing  conditions  of  uncertainty  and

instability  in  the surrounding regions  of  this

part of the world, except our island Republic.  We

can  take  pride  in our country as  an  oasis  of

political  and  economic  stability.  We  have   a

currency  which is one of the strongest  in  Asia,

and  labour  with a high standard of  literacy,  a

high  degree of skill and endowed with  a  natural

aptitude for taking up new skills with comparative

ease. We have excellent harbour facilities and our

financial, insurance and banking services  are  of

the  highest  order  and efficiency  in  Southeast

Asia.  Despite all these advantages,  we  are  not

attracting  enough  industries  with  both  labour

intensive and export-oriented types. What are  the

underlying reasons for this lack of enthusiasm and

response? Since the

P.A.P.  Government came to power in 1959,  nothing

has  been  done  in regard to our existing  labour

laws which require long overdue reforms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the bugbears which deter foreign companies

from  investing in our Republic is our labour laws

which require tidying up and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



rationalisation.  Clerical  staff  in   industrial

offices  work 44 hours per week, whereas the  same

kind of clerical staff performing the same kind of

work  in commercial houses work only 39 hours  per

week.  To  give you another example, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  clerks  in industrial plants  have  11  paid

holidays  per  year, whereas clerks in  commercial

firms   and  in  the  administrative  offices   of

industrial establishments have 16 paid holidays  a

year. There is no difference in the nature of  the

work  and  the conditions governing  the  work  of

clerks,  whether they work in commercial firms  or

industrial firms. The human element of frustration

and  dissatisfaction  is accentuated  by  creating

different benefits due to the shortcomings in  our

existing  labour laws. A new situation has  arisen

because  our Government is now concentrating  more

effort    on    the   intensification    of    our

industrialisation.    As    a     result,     both

administrative and production work will be carried

out  within  the  same compound and  in  the  same

office.  These new conditions and situations  will

be  found in the new industrial estates. In  other

words, clerks will be performing the same kind  of

work  and amidst the same environment. Because  of

the existing labour laws, the industrial clerk  is

discriminated against by having a lesser number of

public  holidays. If we want to  get  rid  of  the

human  frustration and dissatisfaction and  if  we

believe in the equality of all citizens, then  the

Government has to rationalise our existing  labour

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past I have pointed out to Ministry

officials  dealing with labour that  some  radical

changes have to be made to standardise the working

hours  and other conditions of employment and,  at

the  same time, to rationalise the fringe benefits

so  as to reduce abuses to the minimum. Even  with

rationalisation,  our labour conditions  are  much

better off than those obtaining in other parts  of

Asia.  Our  wage rates are still much higher  than

those  of  any other countries in Southeast  Asia,

and  our per capita income is the highest in  Asia

next to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



Japan.  Without  the  accelerated  withdrawal   of

British  troops  from  Singapore,  I  believe   no

attempt would have been made to bring about  these

changes in the proposed Employment Bill. Something

has  to  be  done by way of legislation  to  bring

about  more  equitable and satisfactory conditions

of  employment for all workers irrespective of the

nature  of  the  work  they are  doing.  This  new

Employment Bill will create a better impression on

would-be foreign investors and much publicity must

be given to it abroad by our Government. I commend

the  Government  for  having taken  the  bold  and

forward-looking  policy of  taking  the  necessary

steps to repeal the three Ordinances now existing,

namely,  the  Labour  Ordinance,  1955,  the  Shop

Assistants  Employment Ordinance,  1957,  and  the

Clerks    Employment   Ordinance,   1957.    These

Ordinances should have been repealed long  ago  as

they  are  out-dated and do not fit  in  with  our

times and the policy of our Government. These  are

relics  of the past when divide and rule  was  the

best  policy to govern a people. These  laws  have

given  rise to misgivings and much ground for  bad

industrial relationship during the years from 1955

to  1963.  They  have caused many  heartaches  and

headaches  to  management  on  the  one  hand  and

frustration  and dissatisfaction  to  trade  union

leaders on the other. They were enacted to enhance

the  status of white-collar workers and  to  treat

with  contempt  those who earn their  living  with

their hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of Singapore today we can ill

afford this situation. Government has taken a wise

step   to  introduce  the  proposed  comprehensive

Employment  Bill.  In view of the  fact  that  the

Government  is  pro-labour in its  policy,  it  is

courageous to repeal the existing labour  laws  by

substituting one comprehensive Bill to standardise

and   regulate   the  terms  and   conditions   of

employment.  This  will be  progressive  and  far-sighted  legislation and will go  a  long  way  to

erase many areas of discontentment and grounds for

dispute   between   employer  and   employee.   It

demonstrates our Government's concept of an equal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



and  democratic society in which all  wage-earners

will  be  governed  by  the  same  conditions   of

employment and enjoy the same fringe benefits.  It

is  gross injustice and, to say the least, creates

areas  for discontentment if two workers  work  in

one  place and within one compound and do the same

kind  of  work but observe a different  number  of

weekly  working hours. If we are to  hold  to  our

belief and concept of equal opportunities for all,

then  all workers should be treated alike. I  hope

the  new  Bill will apply equally to all employees

in  the  Government  sector  and  other  statutory

bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To touch on the aspect of industrial relations,

the proposed new legislation will erase many areas

of   friction   and  pave  the  way   for   better

understanding and co-operation between labour  and

management, which is very essential for industrial

peace. But if we are to take full advantage of the

implications  of  this new Bill  which  is  to  be

legislated   by  this  House,  then   labour   and

management   will   have  to  see   that   greater

productivity  relative  to  cost  and  output   is

achieved through these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to allay the fear

expressed  by the hon. Member for Bukit  Ho  Swee,

that  maximum co-operation may not be  forthcoming

from employers if this new Bill is passed. Here  I

must  sound a note of warning to all employers  in

the  industrial  and commercial  sectors  to  take

cognisance of the personal sacrifice every  worker

will have to make in the long-term interest of the

nation  in the industrial front when this Bill  is

passed. It is only fair and reasonable that  they,

as  employers, have to make up something in return

to compensate for their losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as employers, we should not take

advantage of the new changes in the labour  policy

and  make  more  profit  at  the  expense  of  the

workers.  There should be no exploitation  of  the

situation  by  employers if the proposed  Bill  is

passed. Economic and political considerations have

brought about the introduction of this Bill  which

is aimed at ensuring the survival of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both labour and management should co-operate and

work  towards the common goal of building a stable

and viable Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second Central Provident Fund, which will be

set  up,  should therefore compensate for the  new

conditions of employment resulting in the loss  of

certain  fringe  benefits. This second  fund  will

also  assist  in  further economic development  by

providing  capital  for more  investments  in  new

industries and, at the same time, will provide  to

the   workers   a  secure  source   of   financial

assistance  in  the  form  of  savings  when  they

retire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the new changes come into force, trade union

leaders  should educate their members to see  that

productivity  and efficiency, the main  objectives

of  this new Bill, are achieved. This will put the

Republic on a more competitive basis compared with

Japan or Western European countries in many of our

industries;  but still less so than  countries  in

Southeast Asia, like Hong Kong and Taiwan. We have

a small domestic market for our manufactured goods

and  we  have  to  export by  producing  goods  at

competitive cost and quality. The output  of  each

factory  is  in  excess of local  consumption.  To

capture  the  domestic market, every encouragement

should  be  directed towards our  people  by  mass

media of communication to buy locally-manufactured

goods  even at a slightly higher price. Government

and  statutory bodies which spend a great deal  of

money  on foreign imported materials should insist

on local manufactures even though the price may be

10  per cent more than the imported items. In this

way, we will also prevent import leakages and save

our  foreign exchange reserves. The more we import

from  abroad to meet our local needs, the more  we

have to dip into our reserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion, Sir, that when the proposed

Employment  Bill  is  passed  by  this  House  and

becomes law, there will be weeping and gnashing of

teeth among the workers. The clerical staff of the

commercial sector will be the most affected. Among

employers, there may be a few who will try to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



take  undue  advantage  of the  changed  situation

brought  about  by this new legislation.  To  this

class  of employers, I would strongly advise  them

that  they  will  not  get  the  support  of  this

Government  and they will be looking  for  trouble

for  themselves. I hope the Employers' Federation,

the Chambers of Commerce, and trade unionists will

meet  often  round  the table to  iron  out  their

differences and problems to minimise the areas  of

dispute to prevent incidents of industrial strife.

Both management and labour must strive hard not to

offer  opportunities to the  enemy  camp  to  find

excuses   to   generate  industrial   instability,

thereby scaring potential investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the accelerated withdrawal of the British

Military  Forces, it is the bounden duty  of  both

employers  and  workers to  project  an  image  of

confidence,  good government, political  stability

and  responsible labour to make our  Republic  the

industrial  centre of this region. In this  sacred

task of meeting the challenge and the problems  we

have to face in the crucial years ahead, everyone,

as  long  as he is a citizen of Singapore,  has  a

vital role to play. Workers and employers in  this

respect   have  to  think  more  of  the  national

interest than personal or sectional interest. Each

is  dependent  upon  the other  and  only  through

partnership in the common endeavour will  win  the

day.  We sink or swim together. This message  must

be communicated to the lowest level of the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I give my full support to the

motion moved by the Prime Minister.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  yesterday the Member for Katong  and  a  few

other   Members  had  occasion  to  discuss   some

problems  that face the evolution of a progressive

and enlightened educational policy in Singapore. I

got  the  impression that in the  course  of  this

discussion, there is one aspect relevant at least,

if not important, which was not adequately can-vassed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



And  I would like to say a few  words  on

this   for  the  purpose  of  setting  a  rational

framework for any future discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that we have come to the end of one

phase  in our evolution of our educational  system

and  we are about to embark upon another. We have,

to a large extent, solved the problem of providing

equal opportunities in education in a quantitative

sense. I am not so sure that qualitatively we have

done the same thing. And it is no secret, and  is,

in  fact,  known  to everyone in  Singapore,  that

every  time the year ends and the new term starts,

there  is  a scramble among parents to  get  their

children   into   the   best   possible   schools,

especially  on the secondary level. It  is  either

Raffles  Institution  or Anglo-Chinese  School.  I

have  become interested in this problem  for  some

while  now  to  find out what the  cause  of  this

attitude  really  was.  It  became  apparent  that

children  naturally wanted to go to schools  which

had firm established traditions of teaching, where

standards were certain, and they got the  best  by

way  of teaching from the teachers. This, I think,

is  connected also with the way in which transfers

of   teachers   and  principals  take   place   in

Government schools. I can see there was a  certain

logic in the past for having done this. Because of

the  expansion of the educational programme, there

was  a  shortage  of teachers for the  purpose  of

servicing  all the schools and it became necessary

to  follow this kind of practice. I hope that this

state  of  affairs has come to an  end  with  more

teachers  coming  out to perform their  respective

duties  and  that  it  will be  possible  for  the

Education  Department to allow teachers to  remain

in  a  school for 10, 15 or more years until  they

retire   and   thereby  develop   a   personality.

Teachers, like children, have got a way of growing

up with their respective schools and institutions.

This  is something that we must foster and we must

also  allow individuality on the part of  teachers

and   principals  in  the  performance  of   their

teaching  duties  within  the  framework  of   the

national policy laid down by the Government. This,

I think,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



is  very  vital  if we are to build  up  the  firm

educational  traditions that we have been  talking

about  in  our schools, whether it be intellectual

traditions   or  whether  it  be  extra-curricular

traditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I would like to refer to the

various  Ministerial  statements  that  have  been

broadcast  and  also  the  Speech  made   by   the

President.  It is quite clear that the  Government

is  setting us firmly on the course of building up

a modern society. And at the end of five years, it

may  be a fair assessment to say that the internal

consolidation of the State of Singapore would have

matured.  If this be true, we would have succeeded

in  creating a national ethos at the end  of  five

years  which would make it more and more difficult

for  extreme political parties, efferent political

parties  like  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  to  create

trouble in Singapore. If our internal difficulties

are  solved  and rationalised, it is fair  to  say

that  most of our difficulties in political  terms

must  come  from  the  outside.  So  long  as  the

difference remains between us in Singapore and our

immediate  neighbours  in the  conception  of  the

nature of a State or politics and the exercise  of

power,   there  is  bound  to  be  this  political

friction. And this is something we must  learn  to

live with. This we can do provided, of course,  we

strengthen  ourselves militarily and otherwise.  I

was  wondering whether through diplomacy and other

means  we could, instead of concentrating on these

political  differences, strike out  boldly  as  we

have   done  in  internal  matters  and  establish

relations  in  educational,  cultural,  trade  and

economic matters with our neighbours, and  in  the

process  help  in  muting the  frictions  and  the

differences that crop up from time to time between

us.  I know it is a difficult proposition, because

we   come   face  to  face  with  all   kinds   of

irrationalities  at  different  times.   This   is

something, I think, we have got to keep hitting at

and  perhaps with the evolution of the  respective

societies,  we  will  find a way  to  come  closer

together in economic matters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  President in his speech  outlining  the

policies  of the Government said that  this  is  a

Parliament  which is faced with problems  of  more

than  usual  magnitude. Is  it  because  of  these

problems  which we are facing that the  Opposition

have chosen not to contest the elections? This  is

the Second Parliament in which the P.A.P, has been

given  a clear mandate to govern the country.  The

people  of Singapore can be assured that  we,  who

have  been  in government for the last nine  years

and  with  the  experience of  our  leaders,  will

certainly  resolve the problems facing us  and  we

will do the best we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the President's Speech and also the statements

by   various  Ministers,  emphasis  is  placed  on

sacrifice and greater effort by our people and  by

our  workers. I think we should restate  our  aims

and  objectives. What are we making sacrifices for

and  why  are we asking our workers to make  great

sacrifices?  I  think we have to ensure  that  our

economy is good, because we all know that we  need

to  expand our industry and create more  jobs  for

our young population and those who will lose their

jobs  as  a result of the run-down of the  British

Forces  in  Singapore.  But  I  think  it  is  not

sufficient  just  to  ask  the  workers  to   make

sacrifices.  The Government must ensure  that  the

sacrifices  which the workers make will eventually

benefit the country and not a few firms or  a  few

individuals who want to make money as  quickly  as

possible  and  call it off. If the Government  can

ensure  that  there  is  a reasonable  balance  of

interests between workers, management and capital,

I  am  sure that at the end of our five-year  term

the  workers will find that their sacrifices  will

not have been in vain, otherwise I am sure that we

will be in for trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great emphasis is placed on productivity. The

Government  can  help by ensuring that  incentives

are  given  to  those workers  who  contribute  to

productivity. There must be a basic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



change  of  thinking on rewards. For instance,  in

the  past under the colonial system, rewards  were

measured in terms of seniority of service. A clerk

who starts with $150 a month need not put in great

effort, because he knows that at the end of  every

year he will get $15 a month increment. But if  he

reaches the $500 a month grade, why should he  put

in  extra effort to produce more work? So if  this

kind  of  thinking  is  not changed,  it  will  be

difficult  to  induce  our  citizens  to  be  more

productive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to touch on two points

which  are  most  disturbing to a section  of  the

people  in Singapore and of which most Members  of

Parliament in this House are fully aware. They are

citizenship  and  work  permits  which  are   tied

together.  Some time ago when citizenship  was  of

less  value, it took an applicant about six months

for  his citizenship to be considered, and  if  he

qualified  for citizenship it normally took  about

six   months   to   get  his  citizenship   paper.

Citizenship   then   became  more   valuable.   An

application for citizenship took about a  year  to

be  considered and approved. At present, I believe

there are about 40,000 applicants for citizenship.

It  takes  about  a year for applicants  who  have

filed  in  citizenship papers to  be  interviewed.

Some   of   them   are  wondering  whether   their

applications will be successful. Many of them  are

still  waiting  for an answer even after  a  year.

This  is a very unhealthy situation. Although  one

may  ask,  "Why should you worry about them?  They

are  not  citizens. They cannot vote for you?",  I

think we have to be humane about this. There  must

be  a  certain time limit for applications  to  be

considered,  and  the applicants  should  be  told

whether they qualify for citizenship or not. It is

true  that  in the past many chose to sit  on  the

fence  and they have only themselves to blame  for

the  situation they are in today. I am not so much

concerned  about  those  fence-sitters   who   are

finding it difficult to get citizenship, but I  am

concerned  for  quite a number of people  who  are

neither



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



citizens  of  India nor citizens of Malaysia,  who

are  stateless through no fault of their own,  who

have   lived   here  and  who  have  applied   for

citizenship.  If  they so qualify,  I  think  they

should  be dealt with more expeditiously,  because

citizenship  is  now  tied up with  work  permits.

There  are quite a number of stateless persons  in

Singapore and if they are permitted to live  here,

surely they should not be denied the right to work

here. Yesterday, the Prime Minister stated in this

House  that  it is not our intention  to  withdraw

work  permits, but because of the situation  where

we have large numbers of less educated citizens we

should accommodate them and make jobs available to

them.  He  also  said that he did not  mind  other

persons doing "tough" jobs. If that is the case, I

would suggest that when a work permit is withdrawn

from  a  person doing a "soft" job, he  should  be

offered a "tough" job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment on the

Ministerial  broadcast on tourism by the  Minister

for  Finance.  I  am glad that at  long  last  the

Minister  for Finance is on the right track  about

tourism  when  he said that a lot of nonsense  was

being said about how to attract tourists. He  then

went  on  to  give the correct view of  the  basic

trends  of  tourism.  I  would  suggest  that  the

Ministerial statement on tourism should  be  given

wide  publicity  to correct the  thinking  of  all

those  persons  associated with the  promotion  of

tourism.  Mr Speaker, Sir, Bali for a tourist  is

not  new. Before confrontation, Bali was a selling

point  for  American  tourists.  But  because   of

confrontation  and  the  difficult  conditions  in

Djakarta,  American  tourists  stopped  proceeding

south  of  Singapore  to  Djakarta  or  Bali  and,

therefore, Singapore was affected. Now that we are

back  to more normal conditions, it is correct  to

say that we could benefit if Bali could be further

developed  and  we may not be at the  tail-end  of

this enormous Pacific tourist traffic. In fact,  I

would  like  to  make another  suggestion  to  the

Minister   for  Finance,  that  if  the  Singapore

Government  and the Governments of  Australia  and

America  can  be persuaded to get the airlines  to

lower



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



fares  from America to the South Seas via  Tahiti,

Australia, Bali up to Singapore, we certainly will

not  be  at  the tail-end, but we will be  on  the

correct  circuit of a booming tourist  traffic  in

which  the  American tourists can come either  via

Tokyo, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, down to Bali,

Australia  and back to the United States  or  vice

versa.



<br><br>6.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): MrSpeaker, Sir, after a history of 150 years

Singapore is now marching forward steadily into  a

new  stage. It can be expected that this new stage

will  not be smooth going all the way. It will  be

beset with difficulties and obstacles. Never  have

there been so many problems and difficulties which

need  us to rack our brains for their solution  as

it  is now. But the people of Singapore have never

been  daunted by any difficulty. We have  creative

ability and the capacity to accomplish tasks which

others  think  cannot be completed.  Therefore,  I

believe with our group intelligence and under  the

dynamic  leadership of our Government, we can  all

attain a bright future if our people can be united

for one purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the Addendum to the President's Speech,

you can see that we may face many difficulties. We

are   not  adopting  a  negative  policy.  We  are

adopting   a  positive  policy  to  increase   our

economic growth. This is the best way to enable us

to  march forward. It is true to say that  in  the

coming years our social structure will not be  the

same as it is at present. We hate violence because

we  believe  that social reforms can  be  achieved

through  peaceful means. On the other hand,  there

is  the  human  desire for peaceful living.  As  a

rule, people are not willing to go through violent

and  bloody revolution. Ideologically,  there  has

been  a great change in our people ever since  our

independence. The past colonial thinking  has  now

been  replaced  by  new  ideas.  There  is  a  new

attitude of self-reliance and nationalism. In  the

coming  crucial  years there will  still  be  some

remnants of the old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



thinking which should be eradicated. Perhaps  this

is  a painful process but it is necessary. In  the

new  era  group interest should be above  personal

interest and personal enjoyment. For the  sake  of

national  interest individuals will have at  times

to make some sacrifice. We must always be prepared

to face any challenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me talk about education. From the

Ministerial  policy statement which was  broadcast

over  the  air  and  from  the  Addendum  to   the

President's  Speech, we know  that  our  education

policy  will  go  through  a  major  change.   The

traditional  education policy of producing  white-collar  workers will be changed. The emphasis  now

will  be on the production of blue-collar workers.

Sir, this change is very necessary. Otherwise  the

large  sums  of money that are being  expended  on

education will produce a large number of  students

who will not be required by society. This would be

a   waste   of  public  funds.  They  would   also

constitute a hindrance to social progress.  It  is

true  to say that the purpose of education is  not

just to enable those receiving education to have a

means  of  making  a livelihood. Education  should

also  teach  students to develop  good  character.

About 20,000 of our secondary school-leavers  have

the same standard of ordinary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah (Mr Ho See Beng)

walked into the Chamber and took his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho See Beng, may I draw your

attention  to Standing Orders which preclude  your

walking  between  the hon. Member  addressing  the

House and the Chair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker:

Mr Ho Kah Leong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): There will be

school-leavers  entering the labour  market  every

year.  But,  on the other hand, the new industries

we  are  having now lack the necessary  industrial

personnel.  This  will  undoubtedly  produce  many

social  problems. The Government is now trying  to

rectify this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



unfavourable  balance  in  our  society.  This  is

really a laudable act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some parents of students who still

have  the traditional bias for white-collar  work.

They  think  that white-collar work is better  for

their  children  and that it will  ensure  them  a

better future. They regard vocational schools as a

place  for  students  of  lower  intelligence.  If

possible, they do not like their children to  have

a vocational education. This wrong attitude should

be  changed.  As  the  Minister  for  Science  and

Technology has pointed out, there are three  kinds

of   technical  personnel,  namely,  the  ordinary

craftsmen,  the  artisans in the middle,  and  the

technologists  who  are  of  a  higher   standard.

Vocational and technical schools are not meant for

students of low intelligence. On the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



hand,  in  the present circumstances, it  will  be

easier for technical personnel to get jobs. It  is

very  obvious. But the bias of people  for  white-collar

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Pursuant to the resolution made

earlier  today,  the House will  adjourn  now,  it

being  half-past six o'clock. The debate  will  be
