  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs what are the current criteria for approving applications for citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore requires an applicant for Singapore citizenship to satisfy the Government that he:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) is of good character;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) has resided in Singapore throughout the 12 months immediately preceding the date of his application;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) has resided in Singapore for periods amounting in aggregate to not less than 10 years during the 12 years immediately preceding the date of his application;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) intends to reside permanently in Singapore; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) has an elementary knowledge of the national language if he is less than 45 years of age and is not deaf or dumb.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the period of residence in Singapore, we take into consideration periods of absence too. If the applicant has been away on study or on official business, such as being posted to a foreign branch, the period of absence will be treated as residence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution also provides for the qualifying period of residence to be reduced to not less than five years out of six years immediately preceding the date of application. The Government has given citizenship under this provision to special categories of permanent residents, such as professionals and university graduates, who are an asset to Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a view to attracting more talent into Singapore, the very talented is now guaranteed citizenship after five years of permanent residence subject, of course, to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> their having a good character. Hitherto, wives of Singapore citizens are eligible for Singapore citizenship after two years of permanent residence. Husbands of talented Singapore citizens are now eligible for citizenship after two years' residence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, permanent residents who have performed national service are granted citizenship after five years instead of 10 years' residence. This has been further relaxed so that permanent residents are now eligible for citizenship upon their completion of national service. Foreign scholars who are prepared to perform national service will be granted citizenship before they start their national service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of constitutional requirement (v) above, the Honourable Member may recall that an amendment to the Singapore Constitution was introduced on Monday, 16th March 1981. If the amendment is approved by the House, an applicant for citizenship can in future elect to be tested in the other three official languages besides the national language.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship is a privilege, not a right. Apart from the basic constitutional requirements that I have mentioned, applicants must also be an asset and not a liability to the Republic. In applying this criterion we have been flexible. For example, if the applicant is the only member of the family who is not a citizen, citizenship is granted even if the applicant's income is low. Also, aged parents who are not gainfully employed but whose children are well able to support them are also granted citizenship. Applicants such as monks and priests who by their calling are not likely to earn a steady or high income or have family roots are nonetheless granted citizenship if they have been rendering community service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also relaxed the criteria for the grant of citizenship to wives and children. Previously, wives of Singapore citizens had to wait for a definite period after marriage before they were granted citizenship. This was to prevent marriages of convenience. Now, wives are eligible for citizenship if they have given birth to a child after marriage.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of children who were born out of wedlock, their citizenship status should follow that of their natural mother. However, we have conferred citizenship to some illegitimate children whose mothers have left them and their natural fathers are Singapore citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of relaxation of the criteria and a flexible application of these criteria, the number of applications for citizenship that have been approved has been increasing over the last three years. The figures are:
  <pre>
                      No. of applications
      Year                 approved

      1977                   5,051
      1978                   7,589
      1979                  10,628
      1980                  18,475

   <b>CRIME IN BEDOK NORTH</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Preventive measures)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Saidi Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Encik Saidi Shariff</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many incidents of house-breaking, thefts and other criminal offences in Bedok North were reported to, and dealt with by, the Police in 1980; and (b) what steps have been taken by the Police to prevent such incidents from happening again, particularly in Neighbourhoods 6 and 7 where the residents have just moved in.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1979 there were 17 robberies, 28 house-breakings and 68 thefts of motor-vehicles in Bedok North HDB Estate. In 1980, there were again 17 robberies but only 15 house-breakings and 64 motor-vehicle thefts. These figures indicate that the crime situation in this Estate has been brought under control and the number of incidents slightly reduced in spite of the fast expansion of the estate and population since 1979.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bedok North Estate, including Neighbourhoods 6 and 7, is within the Police 'G' Division. Two team-policing cars manned by six police officers from the 'G' Divisional
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Headquarters Station at Joo Chiat cover the estate 24 hours a day. The patrol cars not only respond to emergency calls but also carry out preventive checks on suspicious persons and mount road blocks. In selected areas these patrol teams also patrol on foot. There is also one scooter-patrol manned by two police officers covering the estate between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily. During selected periods, members from the Police Task Force carry out saturation foot patrols. Policemen in plain-clothes are also deployed for observation and intelligence gathering duties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, foot patrols are performed daily by the full-time Police National Service reservists between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. and by the part-time SCNS between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crime Prevention Officer of the Joo Chiat Police Station visits residents of the estate regularly to advise them on physical security of their premises. The Police had also organised Crime Prevention Exhibitions to make residents aware of the need and the methods of preventing crimes. Two such exhibitions were held in 1980 and one has just been held this month.

   <b>BEDOK INTERCHANGE AND FEEDER</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>BUS SERVICES IN BEDOK NORTH</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Saidi Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Encik Saidi Shariff</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour whether there are plans to improve (i) the facilities at the Bedok Interchange and (ii) the feeder bus services in Bedok North; and, if so, how and when the plans will be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Communications and Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Communications and Culture (Encik Sidek bin Saniff) (for the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two integrated questions here. The first is the Bedok Interchange and the other is the feeder bus services in Bedok North.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans to redevelop the existing interchange into a much bigger one with a large
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> passenger concourse have been finalized. Construction is scheduled to begin in July this year. This will be done in stages so as to minimize disruption to present operations. The redevelopment will cost some $3 million and the new interchange is expected to be completed in early 1983.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new interchange will occupy a land area of 1.7 hectares. It will have a 15 metres by 180 metres passenger concourse, 32 end-on berths, seven saw-tooth berths and 33 remote parking bays.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the convenience of passengers, the roof of the concourse will be extended beyond the concourse floor to provide shelter from rain and sun. Queue railings will also be installed to facilitate peak period passenger boardings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides crew amenities, there will also be public amenities like toilets, telephones and a sundry shop.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for feeder services, Bedok North, where some 29,300 dwelling units have been balloted and occupied, is presently served by:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) five feeder services, namely, 221, 225, 226, 227 and 228 from Bedok Interchange;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) two services, namely, 221C and 223 from Chai Chee Terminal; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) ring Service 224 originating from Chai Chee Terminal and linking all neighbourhoods in Bedok North and Bedok South.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 38 buses are deployed on these services. During the peak period these services provide a capacity of 120 buses per peak hour. As demand grows, more buses will be added to the relevant services. The SBS is closely monitoring this demand and a survey is carried out every 6-8 weeks, under SBS' Market Analysis Programme (MAP).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service 226, introduced on 22nd February 1981 to serve Neighbourhood 6, is the latest service for Bedok North. On 29th March, Service 227 covering Neighbourhood 4 will be extended both to serve the newly occupied flats as well as Industrial Park E. This extension will require the addition of two buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS will introduce at a later stage a feeder service to Chai Chee Street where a school, some flats and a few factories are being constructed. With the introduction of this new service, the whole of Bedok North will be fully served by feeder services.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Saidi Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Saidi Shariff (Kaki Bukit):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the feedback and the numerous complaints that I have received from my constituents, in particular their dissatisfaction with the feeder bus services in Bedok North, particularly the routes taken by the different services, I have asked my CCC to form a working committee to look into and make a study or a survey on all the bus services. I hope I can get the assurance of the Hon. Parliamentary Secretary that the Ministry will take up the recommendations of this committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, I would like to commend the initiative of the hon. Member and his activists. I can assure him that the Ministry, and especially the SBS, will always consider any good suggestion or recommendation made by the public or by the constituents subject, of course, to the confirmation of our engineers or people who are concerned with this matter.

  <!-- Encik Saidi Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Encik Saidi Shariff</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour (a) how many applications to contract marriage between non-Singaporeans and Singaporeans or permanent residents were received in 1980; (b) how many of those applicants were approved; and (c) if he will state the Labour Ministry's policy on such applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee) (for the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1980, there were 2,385 applications from non-Singaporeans to contract marriage with Singaporeans or Singapore permanent residents. Of these, 848 were approved.

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval of marriage applications are normally granted if the non-Singaporean worker is skilled and has satisfied our marriage policy criteria such as five years of employment on work permit and that both parties are above 18 years of age.

   <b>IN-CAMP TRAINING FOR RESERVISTS</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Exemption and Deferment)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister of Defence under what circumstances a Reservist may be exempted from prolonged periods of in-camp training if, indeed, such exemption is allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of Defence (Mr Howe Yoon Chong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Enlistment Act, Reservist Officers are liable for service up to the age of 50, while Reservist Other Ranks serve until 40. A Reservist may be called up for Reserve Service up to a maximum of 40 days a year. In practice, however, the duration of the annual in-camp training is normally three weeks, except on occasions where the reserve units are sent for overseas training and exercises, in which case the in-camp training may stretch up to five weeks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Reservist may be exempted from Reserve Service or in-camp training only when he is pronounced medically unfit for such service by a Medical Board. No exemption is granted on hardship grounds as any loss of income arising out of his in-camp training can be reimbursed in the form of make-up pay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reservists are normally informed six to 12 months in advance of the dates they have to report for in-camp training. This is deemed adequate prior notice and should enable the Reservist and his employer to make arrangements to enable him to attend in-camp training.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Reservists who are attending regular courses of study overseas or working abroad may have their liability deferred but they will have to make up for their deferred liability on return to Singapore.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferment from in-camp training may also be granted to Reservists on compassionate grounds or when there are extenuating circumstances such as when they have serious family problems and the like at the time of their being called up for in-camp training.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Reservists who are deferred from in-camp training can make up their training at a later date with another unit, the SAF does not grant deferment liberally because a Reservist Unit has to operate as a cohesive team. When a member of this team is absent during annual in-camp training, the work of a team will be materially affected. When the Reservist goes back the next year for in-camp training, he will have to do two years' liability instead of one and this adds to the burden that he has to discharge.

  <!-- Encik Saidi Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Saidi Shariff (Kaki Bukit):</b> Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced by $10 in respect of Subhead LC-04 Object Group 2610 of the Main Estimates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take this opportunity to comment and make suggestions on the Extra-Curricular Activities Programme of the Ministry of Education. My ideas are not new but I believe they are worth repeating in this House to ensure that the Ministry give them due consideration in the interest of education for the benefit of our people and nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that there is no increase in the estimates for all the different items listed under ECA. So I can assume that the Ministry will be repeating these items, though their format may be different. In comparing all the items listed in the ECA programme, I observe that the budget for Combined schools camp for pupils and teachers gets the lowest
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> allocation. Probably this activity is considered of least importance. May I seek some information on this particular item? How is this camping activity organized, which is allocated only $6,000? How many schools, students and teachers have participated in camping activities, and to what extent has the objective been achieved?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my view, as one who loves outdoor life and who has gone on many mountain-climbing and adventurous camping expeditions with youths and students, that camping could be used as one of the best means for the overall development of intellectual, physical and psycho-socio-emotional well-being of young people, particularly in the context of our rapidly changing urbanized society. There are many things about life that teachers and pupils can learn from each other outside the classroom.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that schools nowadays are mere knowledge factories and they have become impersonalized without any identity and do not give a sense of belonging to the students. Schools are looked upon as places to gain knowledge, pass examinations and get certificates to serve as passports for entry into the real world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays every housing estate or new town will have its own schools - primary, secondary and junior colleges. With industrialization and modernization, we will now have many mothers working in factories and offices. The school will have to assume a larger share of responsibility for the development of our young people, and therefore the school will be in a stronger position to exert influence over its students. The school will thus have tremendous potential, in terms of opportunities, in shaping and developing our students.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I believe that our schools should be developed in such a way that they blend with community life in the estates where the students live. They should look upon the school as their second home. The residents in the estate should look upon the school as part of their belonging in the whole community. During the school holidays particularly, camps can be organized where
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> students can live together in the school and learn the demands of community living, the need for cooperation, team spirit, team work, caring for one another, and showing concern for one another. Basically the camp is to provide pupils with experience of group life. There would not be any book learning but the practical learning of relating to one another, living with each other and working for one another. The psycho-socio-emotional needs of our young children or youths could be enhanced with the guidance of adults, i.e. the teachers. Better relationship between teachers and pupils and between pupils and pupils could be developed. Teachers could have a better insight of their pupils, and pupils a better understanding and acceptance of their teachers. Teachers could better learn about their students' problems, needs and learning capacity and their aspirations, etc.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware that camping as an activity has been and is being continually organized by the different student societies, particularly the uniformed organizations. But what I am suggesting is that every student should be given at least an opportunity to experience group life, staying up, living, working and playing with their classmates and teachers at any one time during their study in the school. It is important that we need to cater consciously and to promote the psycho-socio-emotional well-being of our students.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been pointed out to me that there is a relationship between the psycho-socio-emotional well-being and academic achievement of a student, and also between the psycho-socio-emotional well-being and the well-adjustment of a student. In my experiences of dealing and training youths in leadership, I notice that those who have had experiences of group life - that is of living, working, facing hardships and challenges and enjoying life together with other members of their peer group, are more self-reliant, good mixers, outward going, more confident. In short they have better potentials of becoming leaders, if not, at least good followers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camping in any form, on a classroom basis, on a school basis or on a society basis,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> according to the prevalent situation or resources available to the school, should be made as an ECA for every student to attend and participate. Some of my school teacher friends object to these ideas for they believe that it will be an extra burden for them, particularly if it is being held during the school holidays. I suggest that this project could get the involvement of Residents' Committees and Parent-Teacher Associations in organizing, planning, and implementation of such projects. The whole community of the whole housing estate could be involved. In fact, community service projects could be organized during the camping period of the school holidays.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only ten minutes but if I have an hour I can present the project proposals or the values of camping. I am sure the many ECA officers from the Ministry of Education who are present here would definitely back me up on this. So I hope that the Ministry would consider more seriously and perhaps provide more money to schools to organize such camps.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Sir, I have not been out camping as often as my good Friend, the hon. Member for Kaki Bukit. But I share his views about the importance of outdoor life, particularly for children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if I may, I would like to make one small suggestion - that while the holiday camp is organized with emphasis on group interactions, I am wondering whether the Ministry can add another component in the week-end camping, that is, to relate it to the study of nature. In this regard I would very much like to hear if the Minister would consider the possibility of expanding or of having more week-end camps, by making use of the nature reserves in Bukit Timah Hill. I think there is tremendous potential in encouraging our children to study nature, organize group investigations and help them to acquire a wider outlook towards the importance of ecology.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the ECA, I am wondering if the Minister could ask his ECA officials to ensure that. the conduct of sports, either inter-school or inter-district, if they are still being organized, should not in any way lead to any bitterness between schools or even occasionally fights between students. I think it will be a shame if, at the end of all these efforts of promoting sports among school children, we have children fighting amongst themselves.
  <br>3.00 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what are the possible reasons. Maybe they were over-zealous in the competition, or possibly we had not explained to the children the basic purpose of sports, or had not adequately ensured that the teachers guide the children in promoting the positive purpose of sports. I hope the Minister could emphasize this point so that while our children become good sportsmen they would also become people of high character.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister of Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of Education (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Sir, may I first begin by taking the two points mentioned by the Member for Kampong Kembangan. First of all, the extension of the camping programme to include a nature study camp at the nature reserve in Bukit Timah and, secondly, to make sure that there is no bitterness between schools in their sports programme, I will tell my ECA officials to take these points into consideration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kaki Bukit has spoken at some length about the value of camping. Let me take a few minutes to describe the varied programme of camping activities that the Ministry of Education has arranged for schools. Schools not only take an active part in the Ministry's programme of camps but also organize their own camping activities. First of all, the St. John's Island Camp. There are two camp sites on St. John's Island which are available for the exclusive use of schools. In 1979, 70 schools made use of these sites; in 1980, 79 schools: and in 1981, up till now, 76 schools have booked to use these sites and more will come in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next type of camp I would like to mention is the Immersion through ECA camp, and this has been arranged through the Ministry of Defence which has made available the use of SAF camps for this project. In 1980, four camps were organized and this year there will be seven camps.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next camps are the Outward Bound School courses. First of all, the five-day adventure training course camps. This course was introduced for Pre-U 1 and Secondary 4 students, In 1979, four courses were organized; in 1980, seven courses; and this year, there will be ten courses for Secondary 4 boys and nine courses for Pre-U 1 boys. In addition, there will be a 14-day junior course camp which is being introduced by the Outward Bound School for pupils who are in the uniformed organization?. Schools will be encouraged to send as many pupils as possible to this course. In addition to the above, as I have said, many schools organize a wide variety of camping activities to cater to the varied interests of their pupils.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also asked why there has been no increase in the allocation for camping activities between 1980 and 1981. The answer is that the funds are adequate and that Mindef has been very generous in totally subsidizing many of the camps.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Wan Hussin Zoohri -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Wan Hussin Zoohri (Kampong Ubi):</b> Sir, can I just make a short observation on the answer given by the Minister of Education? From the statistics given, it seems to me that only about 70 or 80 schools make use of the camping sites at the St. John's Island, and we know that in Singapore there are more than 120 secondary schools. In terms of numbers, I think there were many schools which did not have the chance of attending these camps at St. John's Island. Perhaps the Ministry of Education could look into the possibility of scouting for some other suitable islands as camp sites. The camp sites at St. John's Island are very good and it has got a good land area where the sea is available and the facilities are there. Perhaps in the not too distant future the Ministry will look into other areas for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> camp sites so that all schools will have camps at least once a year rather than compete for this limited space at St. John's Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the Ministry will take the suggestion of the Member for Kampong Ubi into consideration.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Saidi Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Saidi Shariff:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my amendment, I would like to again draw the attention of the Hon. Minister to this point. I am quite aware of the camping activities that have been organized by the Ministry. I wish to thank the Minister for giving the information.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Ubi mentioned the shortage of places for camping. What I would like to suggest is camping in the school during the holidays where activities can be organized at the school grounds. Camping can be carried out in many different forms. What I am interested is to provide an opportunity for all the school children. Many school children have come to see me and asked, "Mr Saidi, can you organize camping for us?" I said, "Why do you not ask your teachers to organize?" The children said that the teachers did not want to organize. So is it not possible to organize camping in the schools during the school holidays as this will provide an opportunity for community living?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the answer is yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Saidi Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Saidi Shariff:</b> Sir, I withdraw my amendment.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency of Radin Mas there are a lot of children who cannot find suitable primary schools for themselves.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to seek information from the Hon. Minister about the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. I notice the subsidy for this Institute is steadily growing year by year. For this reason, I trust the Minister would inform the House what are the objectives and the success criteria of this Institute; what has it done; how well does the work carried out to-date measure against these objectives and success criteria?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the objective of the Institute of South-east Asian Studies (ISEAS) is to promote research on South-east Asia and on all matters pertaining to South-east Asia. In the 12 years since it was founded, ISEAS has made a good start towards achieving this objective. In quantitative terms, ISEAS has published an impressive array of books, monographs, documents, papers, reports and discussion papers. It has sponsored more than 150
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> research and visiting fellows who have come from all over the world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities of ISEAS cover three main areas. First of all, research. The focus of research is on modern South-east Asia, particularly the multi-faceted problems of development, modernization, political and social changes in recent years. The on-going research programmes include economies of ASEAN countries, foreign investment and its impact on South-east Asia, problems of modernization, maritime issues and resources and management of population problems. Besides research, ISEAS also organizes conferences and seminars involving discussion on topics of current regional interest and importance. The last seminar was held in November 1980 on "Trends in Indonesia".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On publications, ISEAS has published more than 160 books, monographs, reports and papers on South-east Asian matters. Its library holdings have grown to over 100,000 volumes of books, bound periodicals, microfilms and microfiche, together with scores of newspapers and other current periodical literature.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISEAS has made a good beginning towards becoming an outstanding centre for advanced high quality research on and in South-east Asia. If we give it adequate support it will flourish and in due time be a credit to Singapore.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a teacher-in-training is very often told by his supervisor to provide some time at the end of his lesson for, what is commonly termed, recapitulation. This is not a jargon. This is a layman's term. As I am the last Member to move amendments on the Main and Development Estimates for his Ministry, I shall treat my comments as a recapitulation or a resume of what has been said previously. As such, there is bound to be some overlapping and I hope the House will bear with me.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before touching on the general issues, I would like to mention two specific items. The first is the Curriculum Development Institute. With the setting up of the CDIS at Kent Ridge and sparing the CDIS of the "bureaucratic interference" of the Ministry of Education, the Institute is now on a steady road towards curriculum development. As of now, there are 17 project teams concentrating on English and Chinese languages, Mathematics and Science. CDIS is also developing supplementary and suitable materials for the monolingual courses. We are also informed that when more talented teachers have been identified, more project teams will be formed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education is sending groups of teachers to the Innotech Centre in Manila and to-date there is a sizeable number of teachers and senior officers who have returned from attending courses there. One of the many items made known to the course participants was the Project Impact. I am told that this project, described as one of the many successful educational innovations in the region, is more relevant to other countries in South-east Asia than to us. However, one aspect of this educational innovation is in the construction of teaching materials through the module system. Perhaps the CDIS would consider examining the feasibility of producing curriculum packages along the module system especially
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for pupils of below average ability. The module system has within it the learning of specific skills in a particular subject, along certain definite stages. Learning through the module system along these stages will, of course, enhance the pupils' sense of achievement and confidence. One other possibility is to use these module packages as supplementary materials whereby the pupils could work on them at their own time, either during the week-end or during the holidays.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the Ministry of Education's School Building Programme. Much to our delight, the HDB will now build schools together with the houses, and the Ministry of Finance will foot the bill on school buildings. There is, however, one other small contribution which the Ministry of Education could request the HDB to do. This is in the area of beautifying the school premises. Up to now when the schools are ready for occupation, the premises is devoid of any greenery in the form of plants and trees. It is left to the school principal concerned (sometimes the principal will not be appointed immediately) to work his way to beautify the surroundings. In this connection, the Ministry of Education could invite the Parks and Recreation Department to be involved in its building programme. The expertise available in the Parks and Recreation Department could help in enhancing the physical, aesthetic beauty of our schools. The Department is doing a good job in beautifying our roads. This could, of course, be extended to our schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to make some general observations on the education system and its effects on the teaching profession vis-a-vis the morale of the teachers. When the Minister for Finance informed the House that the morale of the workers in the Civil Service is excellent, I sincerely hope that it includes the teachers in the Civil Service too. However, indications are that the morale of teachers is fluctuating with the tide of the educational policy changes. The survey by STU seems to indicate that the fluctuation is higher on the negative side. But let us look at the educational scenario and try to re-trace some of the major developments in order to arrive at a more balanced picture.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we need to look at its objectives as spelt out in the Goh Report, 1978. Two fundamental points stand out clearly. The first is to reduce wastage by allowing each child to learn and develop at his own rate or pace. The second is to produce school leavers who are literate in at least one language. How can these be achieved? As I see it, this is being done by upgrading the professional standards both at HQ and in the schools. Thus, the strategy which the Ministry is adopting now is the multi-pronged approach towards upgrading professionalism and attacking the problems on different fronts. It is in the course of initiating these changes along this multi-pronged approach that has given rise to the ups and downs of public response, including the teachers themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the changes, which are laudable in their intentions but have resulted in causing anxieties and uncertainties among the teachers and the public, include the following:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) In the course of reorganizing the Ministry of Education, "The dismantling of the Education Development Division caused much anguish in the (teaching) profession." [Quoted from the Addendum to the President's Address on the Ministry of Education.]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The streaming exercise has and is still causing much psychological and emotional uncertainties to the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The controversy over the release of the PSLE results has enhanced these psycho-emotional anxieties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The suggestions made on the dissolution of the teachers' unions have aroused much public discussion both within and outside the teaching profession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the other side of the coin, there have been other changes which are, to my mind, generally acceptable to the teachers. These include, among other things:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The revision made to the Education Scheme of Service in 1979.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The liberalization and the encouragement given to non-graduate teachers to gain admission into the University.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The various language courses at the Language Project Centre and the British Council to increase the teachers' proficiency in English.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The setting up of the CDIS and the various projects being undertaken.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The proposed Senior Education Service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting these changes on an educational balance sheet, how do we see the results? I would say that considering the short time of just over 2 1/2 years, much has been done towards raising professionalism. But the basic question is still being asked: i.e. what is the morale in the teaching profession? As I have said earlier, at best It is still fluctuating.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my humble observation, there seems to exist between the HQ and the schools a kind of "cultural-lag" or "cultural-gap". This cultural-lag exists, to my mind, at two levels. One is the psychological level and the other is the intellectual level. On the psychological level, it seems to me that the personnel in HO are totally committed to increasing professional standards. However, I am not too sure if this total commitment exists in the schools for a variety of reasons. On the intellectual level, the HQ, with all the expertise at its disposal, is far ahead on educational issues and developments, so much so that the schools feel that they cannot keep up with the pace and tempo set by the HQ. Rightly so, the Ministry of Education is trying to remedy these by improving its communication system with the schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schools Council, it seems to me, only reaches the principals. When the message is given to the teachers through the principals, very often some distortion or variation takes place. This is the common trait or characteristic in any oral tradition which is being handed down. In this respect, why can the Ministry of Education not find some ways of reaching the teachers direct? May I suggest that the Ministry of Education meet the teachers at least once a term on a zonal
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> basis. There are enough Junior Colleges to accommodate the teachers in each zone. Here, a face-to-face dialogue on the educational changes would help bridge this cultural-lag that seems to exist on the psychological and intellectual levels. If the Ministry of Education can talk to the Members of Parliament and the principals, surely it can find time to talk to the teachers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Minister for Trade and Industry had a successful meeting with the Residents' Committees of Ang Mo Kio -
  <br>3.25 p.m.

  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <!-- Mr A. Rahim Ishak (Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the main head of the Ministry of Education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of full-day schools, the question of food would be foremost in the minds of any thinking and, I think, all concerned parents. Ideally, parents would expect an overhaul of the school tuckshop not only in terms of physical layout and facilities but also the proper preparation, handling and quality of the food served. At present, in most primary and secondary schools, the tuckshop is just a place for drinks and quick snacks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, to most school-going children, breakfast is a skimpy meal of a cup of beverage, bread with jam or butter or margarine and an egg or two in more affluent homes, unlike the nutritionally balanced Western breakfast of fruit juice, cereal, egg, meat, whole milk, bread with jam and butter and tea or coffee and the like. The only substantial meals of a Singaporean child are lunch and dinner where the staple rice is often served with soup and accompanying dishes of meat and vegetables, rounded off perhaps with fruit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With full-day schools, a child would have to take lunch in school for five days a week
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for at least 40 weeks in a year. The food he eats in school then would be of vital importance as his health can be damaged by eating too much of certain favoured foods low in calories and proteins but high in animal fats and carbohydrates which is typical of most fast-foods.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period from birth to adolescence is one of vigorous mental and physical growth in an individual. These are the vulnerable years because deficiency or excess of the five groups of nutrients, namely fats, carbohydrates, proteins, minerals and vitamins, needed for physical well-being could lead to malnutrition or, at the other extreme, obesity with all its attendant illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I requested a school principal, a friend who works closely with me in Siglap constituency, to look into this matter. A recent survey on the breakfast habits of our pupils in the morning session revealed that about 11% (38 out of 332) of our pupils do not take any breakfast at all before attending school. Of the remaining lot, about 90% take breakfast consisting of a cup of beverage with milk, bread or cakes or porridge or noodles and an egg occasionally at home while about 10% take breakfast consisting of only a hot drink and/or bread at school.
  <br>3.30 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To supplement their meagre breakfast, most of our pupils have a drink and snack during recess at the tuckshop. Besides hot or cold drinks, our tuckshop vendors sell mee siam, mee goreng, noodles with soup, fried beehoon, rice broth, Malay cakes, bread, cakes, kachang puteh and a whole host of other kachangs, packaged tit-bits like krupuk, etc, preserved fruit and fresh cut fruit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the food available shows that they are made up mostly of starch with very little greens and minimal high-quality proteins in the form of a thin slice of egg or meat. Such food if taken regularly as lunch will, I think, definitely impair the health of active growing children who need a well-balanced diet.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children by nature are playful and it is likely that most will rush through or may even
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> forgo their lunch so that they can have more time for boisterous play with their peer groups. I see the danger of bringing up a whole generation of fast-food consumers who will subsequently look to canteens and hawker centres for most of their meals. Even closer to where I am speaking from, I see some adults too going for fast-foods almost every day.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, to implement the full-day school, it is imperative that improvements be made to food items sold in the school tuckshop. To a child, meal-time should and must be a source of pleasure. Hence, it is important that the tuckshop should be clean, spacious and airy with proper adequate seating facilities. This, I believe, is already the case with most of our schools. Tuckshop vendors need to be reorientated and educated in the whole process of preparing wholesome food. Besides occasional briefings on food hygiene and handling, correct cooking procedures and time in cooking is equally vital, as over-cooking will deplete and destroy the nutritive value of food, especially minerals and vitamins. They will have to discard old steadfast habits of putting lots of starch in favour of more animal proteins and vegetables.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep control over the quality of school tuckshop food, I wish to propose to the Hon. Minister the setting up of a team of nutritionists to go round all schools to oversee and advise the vendors. I am not suggesting that the food items now provided at our school tuckshops be completely substituted with new ones. This would be too drastic a step. In any case, it would be impractical to do so as our children would still prefer food items which they are used to taking. What is needed is the introduction of, for example, more proteins and other nutrients presently lacking in the existing items. In any event, a team of nutritionists would, I am sure, be quite capable of looking into the details. Now that health science, including the study of food constituents, has been left out of the school curriculum for a considerable number of years, thus rendering our younger generation less if not completely
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> uninformed about food facts, the very least we could do for our children is to ensure that they be provided with nutritious food in our schools for their physical nourishment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, there will, of course, be parents and guardians who would prepare or have prepared some substantial easy-to-carry food which their children and wards can take to school for lunch. But for the majority of our school-going population, many with working mothers, I believe the solution would still be with the provision of upgraded nutritious food catered in our full-day schools.

  <!-- Mr Lau Ping Sum -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lau Ping Sum (Yio Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on many an occasion Ministers and other leaders have stressed the desirability of learning two languages, English and the mother tongue. Through the learning of these languages, we will appreciate better our basic values and understand human nature and the relationships between individuals or groups of individuals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the learning of languages requires time, determination and will-power if it is undertaken in adulthood. The majority of our people are still monolingual. Thus there is a continuing need for effective translation. In addition, the development of Singapore as a convention centre will necessitate the provision of efficient translation services. In emphasizing the importance of the bilingual policy, the Government appears to have over-looked an important area. We do not seem to have provided adequate training facilities for those who aspire to be translators. There is little formalized and systematic training for our students to master the art and science of translation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, translation is not and can never be a mechanical process which can be undertaken by anyone with a working knowledge of two languages. It is an art because a certain degree of flair is a prerequisite. It is a science because systematic training and constant practice will make possible and facilitate the recall of an equivalent image or expression in the other language. Effective translation must be a paraphrase which expresses the point accurately. To do this, therefore, the translator must have a broad
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cultural background to enable him to perceive the full connotations of the passage being translated. When an Hope went to China, the Chinese translator did an excellent job until Bob Hope mentioned Caesar's Palace and Raquel Welch. In Singapore, not only have our translators been largely self-taught and deprived of formal training, they are also not rewarded for performing a task which is both demanding and uninviting. May I suggest that the Ministry look into the feasibility of setting up a training institute for translators for students who wish to pursue this career.

  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall have to be brief in my reply in order to beat the guillotine time. First of all, on the point made by the Member for Yio Chu Kang regarding the importance of translators. I agree with him but I am the wrong Minister to deal with this matter. I think the Minister for Culture or perhaps the Speaker of Parliament would probably be the right person to deal with it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall consider the suggestion of the Member for Siglap that it would be worthwhile to get a team of nutritionists to study the needs of our school children regarding food in their tuckshops.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Ubi has made three points. First, regarding CDIS, I should like to inform him that the CDIS will consider the use of modules in the development of teaching materials where appropriate. Secondly, with regard to the beautifying of schools, the Ministry of Education has consulted the Parks and Recreation Department and they have strongly advised us not to plant trees while construction is going on as the saplings can easily be damaged by the workers. So the planting of flowering plants and shrubs will have to be done by the schools and by the principals after the schools have been completed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as regards teachers' morale, I have spoken at some length on this yesterday in my reply to the points made by the Member for Jurong and I have nothing more to add.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> By all means, carry on. You have one minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Wan Hussin Zoohri -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Wan Hussin Zoohri:</b> The Minister has mentioned that he is very concerned with the morale of teachers. But it seems to me that although much has been said about things to be done, communication seems to reach only at certain levels of the hierarchy. And more often than not, the teachers do not get much of the publicity early as expected. In one of the recommendations made in the Goh Report under the section on morale of teachers, if I may be permitted to quote, it says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Director of Education should brief principals and selected teachers from schools on major policy changes before these are publicized and implemented. This will ensure that teachers will not be the last to know of these changes.' Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister whether his Ministry will be reporting to Parliament in the not too distant future on the status of our education system, as required in the additional amendment moved by the Member for Kampong Chai Chee on 28th March, 1979, and I quote from Hansard, Vol. 39, col. 93:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... that the Minister of Education do report to Parliament after 2 or 3 years on the progress, unresolved problems and state of implementation of the revised structure of education.'

  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10 in respect of Subhead VA-01 of the Main Estimates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I would like to touch on is a matter relating to the inadequate public assistance given to recipients under certain special circumstances. According to the public assistance scheme, the maximum amount that a household can receive is $100, no matter how many dependants there are in the family. According to a social survey in 1973, it was established that $240.11 was the monthly subsistence amount for a family of four, excluding educational expenses. So if one is to consider the inflation from 1973 to 1980, then the subsistence level for a family of four would definitely be more than $240.11. Sir, but the amount given to families on public assistance is even less than 50% of the monthly subsistence amount, which makes one wonder how these families manage with the amount of financial assistance given and how the families can become self-supporting with this amount.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Ministry will argue that public assistance is given to help recipients to tide over their temporary financial difficulties while in the meantime they have to look for employment for their subsistence. I say this argument does not hold water because most of these recipients were formerly employed as labourers and seasonal workers. These jobs require strength and stamina and hence it is unlikely that the recipients who are sick and handicapped can
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hope to go back to their former jobs. Neither can they take up any skilled or semi-skilled jobs as they do not have the necessary skills required. Therefore, Sir, if a public assistance recipient with a wife and two school-going children receives $100, the family will definitely not be able to subsist without additional subsidy. And with the head of the household incapacitated, the wife will have to undertake a part-time or a full-time job to help supplement the household expenditure. But most wives cannot undertake a full-time job as they have young children to look after. The Social Welfare Department should not withdraw the public assistance on the ground that the wife is working and so they do not deserve public assistance. Therefore, I would like to request the Acting Minister for Social Affairs to look into the matter and review the policy in the light of the circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Sir, this question of Public Assistance Scheme has been debated over and over again in this Chamber. As the Member for Khe Bong has rightly pointed out, the objective of the Public Assistance Scheme is to help families tide over their financial difficulties. It is not meant to be a Scheme to help them indefinitely. But for those who are genuinely incapable of earning a livelihood, the Public Assistance allowances will be supplemented by other schemes administered by the Social Welfare Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his suggestion that my Ministry should review the policy on the Public Assistance Scheme, I will take note of it. In fact, the Public Assistance Review Committee, the formation of which I announced last week, just met yesterday, and among the things looked into were those suggested by the hon. Member.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10 in respect of Subhead VB-02 of the Main Estimates
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) has done a good job for the Muslim community. Most apparent is its success in the mosque building programme, under which six mosques have been built under Phase I and eight more will be built under Phase II. The recent successful organization of the mass celebration of Prophet Mohammad's Birthday is another feather in the MUIS cap. Last year I suggested that MUIS should strengthen its administrative and public relations capability to meet the new challenges ahead. The Hon. Acting Minister then elaborated the steps he would be taking. I trust the implementation of these steps is well in progress and that the good results are benefiting the Muslim community in particular and the Singapore society as a whole. In this respect, would the Acting Minister inform the House of the progress to-date in this direction?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been brought to my attention that the time taken to deal with the cases submitted to the Syariah Court is far too long and this is causing anxiety among the parties involved. Furthermore, it was also pointed out to me that there are only two social case workers attached to the Syariah Court. What then is the cause of the delay? Is the delay due to the shortage of manpower? In this respect, would the Acting Minister inform the House of the steps that he would take to alleviate this problem?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, may I be given the permission to also say something about the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I join my colleague, the Member for Telok Blangah, in commending MUIS for effectively implementing various programmes which have brought about the rationalization of the religious services in Singapore and the upgrading of various facilities including mosques, religious schools, the collection and payment distribution of fitrah, the administration of pilgrimage, and so on. It
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> would be pertinent for us to consider a number of issues that could crop up, bearing in mind the rapid implementation of various programmes which have never been experienced by the Muslim community in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to make particular reference to the mosque. Normally, in a mosque which exists in an enclosed kampong, there is a general homogeneity of people and the thinking and values of the residents are quite uniform. There is no likelihood of any fundamental disagreement within the residential area concerned. But as we introduce and construct modern mosques in the new housing estates, where the community includes Muslims and non-Muslims, it is important to remind the mosque officials that they are administering their mosques in a totally different environment. It is important for MUIS to ensure the proper selection of mosque officials, MUIS should not just be a regulator but should also help the officials to upgrade their programmes. It should also ensure that the mosque programmes will not only serve the needs of Muslims in the Housing Board estates but will also be consonant with and contributive to the overall development of Singaporeans as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to mention that, unlike the experience of the mosques in the kampongs, the mosques in new housing estates are multi-functional in nature. They not only conduct religious activities but also implement educational programmes, missionary activities and even organize social recreational programmes which are not normally organized by mosques in the kampongs. It also handles large amounts of money. Previously in the kampong, it was quite normal for mosques to handle about $1,000 to $2,000 per month. However, the cash flow of new mosques in housing estates entails large amounts of financial transaction, maybe four or five times the amount which is normally handled by a mosque in a kampong. It is extremely important therefore for the management committees of these new mosques to have a sufficient level of competency in handling cash and the management of accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that the officials are able to make good use of the funds which are being entrusted to them. The people who contribute to the mosque building fund are not only people who stay within the catchment of the mosque but are Muslims all over Singapore. The extent of responsibility in ensuring proper accountability of the funds becomes much wider.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for the Minister to consider the feasibility and even the urgency of trying to attract a larger number of professional people to be involved in the running and management of mosques, either directly or indirectly. Presumably there are many professional Muslims who are not yet active in this area. Perhaps the Minister could consider formulating programmes to attract their active involvement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to raise concerns the mosques in the central business district area. I understand that my colleague, the Member for Radin Mas, has a point to ask in his Notice of Amendment and so I would not like to mention that specific case. But I foresee that in five to ten years' time the whole area of the central business district will be subject to an overall development. Old buildings will be pulled down and multi-storey modern business houses will be constructed. It is important for us to ensure that the total development of the central business district should not be impaired, not because we are against any traditional institutions but for the lack of advanced planning to provide for the necessary institutions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard I am wondering if the Minister could inform the House whether his Ministry has any long term plans for the possible relocation or even redevelopment of mosques in the central business district. I see this as important for two reasons. First, there is a large population of Muslims in the central business district. From the experience we see in the present mosques in town, there is usually severe congestion during Friday prayers. Secondly, consistent with our policy of encouraging residents to stay within the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> central business district, it will be useful if the Minister could provide religious institutions with facilities like those enjoyed by residents in housing estates, so that those who will eventually stay in the central business district can also enjoy such facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Sir, I thank both the hon. Members for Telok Blangah and Kampong Kembangan for their praises of the Muslim Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first answer the two questions raised by the Member for Telok Blangah.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he touched on the reorganization of the MUIS secretariat. Sir, if you recall, sometime last year I did mention in this House that the Management Services Department (MSD) of the Ministry of Finance had been invited by the Ministry of Social Affairs to make a study of the MUIS secretariat and to come up with recommendations on how to improve its administrative set-up. The Department has come up with certain recommendations. I will only highlight the more important of these recommendations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the recommendations is that the MUIS should have a full-time Accountant to look after its financial matters. The MSD has also proposed the post of Assistant Director (Public Relations and Information) to deal with the publicity aspects of MUIS' work. Another recommendation is the provision for a full-time Director to head the Secretariat. This latter recommendation is made on the assumption that the post of the President of MUIS is only a part-time appointment. As a variation to this recommendation, the MSD has also proposed the appointment of a full-time President of MUIS who could then double-up as the Director of the MUIS secretariat as well. Of the two alternatives, my Ministry has opted- for the latter. Those are some of the major recommendations, Sir, made by the Management Services Department of the Ministry of Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now inform the House of the outcome of my Ministry's request to Finance Ministry for the posts recommended by the MSD. Our request for the post of a full-time
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Accountant for the MUIS secretariat, sad to say, has been turned down. Finance Ministry feels that the number of accounts kept by MUIS and the amount of funds available for investment do not justify the appointment of a full-time Accountant. In Finance Ministry's opinion, Sir, the complexity of accounting work rather than the sheer volume of accounting entries is a more relevant factor in considering whether there is need for an Accountant. However, in place of an Accountant, the Ministry of Finance has approved the post of a Financial Officer in the Executive Personnel Group. Finance has not agreed to the post of Assistant Director (Public Relations and Information) as recommended by the MSD; instead it has approved the post of Public Relations Officer on a grade equivalent to that of an EO in the Civil Service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most important, Sir, what I would like to say here is that the Minister for Finance has agreed to the request made by the Ministry of Social Affairs that the post of President of MUIS be upgraded from one of part-time appointment to that of a full-time Superscale 'H' post. I would like to thank the Minister for Finance for that!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the question of the Accountant, Sir: as a result of Finance Ministry's decision, the Ministry of Social Affairs has been exploring the possibility of seconding a professionally qualified officer to head the Finance Section of the MUIS secretariat. Unfortunately, the search has not been successful so far, as serving officers with the necessary experience and qualifications could not be released from their duties in the departments in which they are serving. In view of this, MUIS will be advertising the vacancy of a Financial Officer in the press soon.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's second question on whether or not the two Muslim social case workers in the Syariah Court are heavily loaded with work, my answer to him is 'No'. They are not heavily loaded with work, and I will give the reasons why. There are, first of all, two posts of Muslim social case workers in the Syariah Court and both these posts are
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> filled. The workload of the two Muslim social case workers depends on the incidence of marital disputes and the time and effort needed to resolve these disputes. During the three-year period 1978-80, the number of new marital disputes registered in the Syariah Court increased at the rate of 7% a year. The average number of new disputes registered during this period was 1,151. During the same period, the number of cases disposed of rose by 17 1/2% a year and the average number of cases disposed of in the same period was 1,052. The Member for Telok Blangah will see that the number of cases disposed of during the period in question was only marginally less than the number of new cases registered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add, Sir, that the workload of the Muslim social case workers cannot be measured by numbers alone. The man-hours spent on a case vary over a wide range depending on the complexity of the case. Likewise, the interval between registration of a new case and its disposal also varies considerably.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked whether the delay in concluding a divorce proceeding was due to the shortage of manpower. The answer, again, is "No". Divorce proceedings are time-consuming, to say the least. Sir, I have not experienced any marital conflict. God forbid, No! But I think Members will agree that marital conflicts are complicated and fraught with emotions. Couples often manifest such emotional distress by resorting to assaults, child neglect, financial irresponsibility and a host of other irresponsible actions and behaviour. It is therefore the duty of the Muslim social case workers to understand and help couples gain insight into the causal factors of their problems and establish rapport so as to assist them in settling their differences and find workable solutions. This takes time - a long time, if I may add. Here I would like to stress, Sir, that the sole purpose of counselling is to save marriages, wherever possible, and not to expedite divorce proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If efforts towards reconciliation fail, then the couples are referred to a Kathi for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> registration of the divorce. However, all claims such as maintenance and custody have to be mutually agreed upon before a divorce is registered. If no agreement can be reached, the case is then referred to the Syariah Court for hearing and decision will be made by the President of the Court. These are the various steps and procedures which have to be carried out before a case comes up for hearing by the President of the Syariah Court.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also sought the opinion of the President of the Syariah Court on whether or not the two Muslim social case workers are heavily loaded with work as alleged by the Member for Telok Blangah. The President is satisfied that the two Muslim social case workers can cope with their present case load. My Ministry is monitoring the incidence of new disputes and their disposal. I would like to assure the hon. Member for Telok Blangah that if there is evidence that the number of new disputes is growing so rapidly that the quality of the service rendered by the two Muslim social case workers is likely to decline, we will consider appointing more Muslim social case workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some of the points raised by the Member for Kampong Kembangan. I have taken note of his suggestions that only proper persons are to be appointed by MUIS to serve on mosque management committees; that MUIS should also oversee and upgrade the kind of activities conducted by mosques; and MUIS ensures that the management committees of mosques have the required level of competency in the management of financial accounts. I will certainly ask MUIS officials to look into them. On the management of mosques' financial accounts, I think the Member for Kampong Kembangan is aware that MUIS has so far conducted two courses on accounting procedures for the benefit of mosque officials. These courses were organized with a view to raising the level of competency of mosque officials in the management of mosques' funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with the hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan that young Muslim professionals should be asked to serve on mosque management committees. I would even go one step further: that they also be asked to serve on the numerous other committees under the MUIS umbrella. As a start, MUIS will be glad to consider any recommendation that the Member for Kampong Kembangan as well as the other Members of this House may have of young and dedicated Muslim professionals who wish to serve on these committees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Member has enquired on the long-term plans for the redevelopment of mosques in the Central Business District. Here, I would like to define the Central Business District as that area which comes under the Area Licensing Scheme (ALS). If we accept that definition, Sir, then there are altogether six mosques in this area. They are (1) Masjid Moulana Md. Ali in Market Street (which, according to the hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan would be raised by the hon. Member for Radin Mas later), (2) the Masjid Abrar in Telok Ayer Street, (3) Masjid Jamae in South Bridge Road, (4) Masjid Omar Kampong Melaka in Omar Road, (5) Masjid Dawoodi Bohra in Hill Street, and (6) Masjid Haji Mohd Salleh in Palmer Road, next to the Habib Noh shrine. I will give my comments on Masjid Moulana Md. Ali together with the points which the Member for Radin Mas may want to raise later on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the five remaining mosques, Masjid Abrar in Telok Ayer Street and Masjid Jamae in South Bridge Road have been declared monuments by the Preservation of Monuments Board. Masjid Omar Kampong Melaka in Omar Road, though not a monument in the eyes of the Preservation of Monuments Board, will not be affected by urban redevelopment of the areas surrounding it. I have been assured of this. In fact, in a written reply to a query by the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of National Development has assured my Ministry that "as redevelopment plans in the area do not affect the mosque, it will therefore remain." On account of this assurance, the mosque is currently undergoing major
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> renovations at an estimated cost of $3/4 million. However, I would like to assure the Member for Kampong Kembangan that MUIS is still appealing to the Preservation of Monuments Board to have the mosque preserved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other mosque in the Central Business District is the Masjid Dawoodi Bohra in Hill Street. For the information of the House, Sir, this mosque is sandwiched between the TAS building and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry building in Hill Street. Again, Sir, the Ministry of Social Affairs has been told that this mosque may not be affected by urban redevelopment. The land on which it stands is just too narrow for any urban redevelopment project.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, at this point of time I cannot predict the future of Masjid Haji Mohd Salleh in Palmer Road with the same degree of certainty as I have in the case of the other mosques I have discussed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go slightly outside the ALS area, Sir, in particular to the Jalan Sultan/North Bridge Road area, we find three other mosques, namely, Masjid Sultan in North Bridge Road, Masjid Hajjah Fatimah in Java Road and Masjid Malabar Muslim Jamaath in Victoria Street. Both Masjid Sultan and Masjid Hajjah Fatimah have been declared monuments by the Preservation of Monuments Board. But, like Masjid Mohd Salleh in Palmer Road, I cannot at this juncture say very much on Masjid Malabar Muslim Jamaath in Victoria Street.
  <br>4.15 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the number of mosques in the Central Business District that may be affected by urban redevelopment is small, there is, therefore, no pressing need to have long-range plans for their replacement, unlike the construction of new mosques in HDB new towns for which MUIS has a definite mosque building programme for this decade. I had, on many occasions in the recent past, announced that MUIS would be building eight new mosques in this decade under Phase II of its mosque building programme. The question of replacement of any mosque
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in the Central Business District affected by urban redevelopment will, therefore, be tackled piecemeal.

  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my amendment, I wish to thank the Hon. Acting Minister for his reply. However, I also wish to make a clarification, Sir, nowhere did I mention that the cases are divorce cases or otherwise and that they should end in divorce. Sir, I am an optimist, and therefore I said that the cases should be dealt with quickly, i.e. resolved amicably; in other words they should be reconciled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the post which MSD has recommended and which apparently the Ministry of Finance has turned down, may I suggest that the Hon. Acting Minister tackle the problem at source. In other words, he should take the Ministry of Finance by its "Hon" (horn). On that note I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to speak on the mosque at Market Street, that is the Masjid Moulana Mohd Ali. Members of the management committee of that mosque have appealed to me to ask the Acting Minister to consider the problem which this mosque is facing. For a long time the Muslims, especially the businessmen and those who are working in town, have been going to that mosque for their prayers. A big bank has purchased the property recently. The management of that bank and the management committee of the mosque have made proposals and counter proposals, but they have not yet come to any settlement. According to the proposal, an alternative place below the car park will be given to the Muslims for their prayers. If a place above the car park can be given, it will be acceptable to the Muslims. I would, therefore, request the Minister to intervene and bring about a workable solution.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Sir, the site at Market Street referred to by the hon. Member for Radin Mas on which Masjid Moulana Md. Ali stands, belongs to the Singapore Muslim League. The United Overseas Bank is contemplating buying it over from the Muslim League. Negotiations between the parties concerned are still going on. Amongst other things, the Mosque Management Committee have been having discussions with the bank on the replacement site for the mosque. MUIS officials are involved in these discussions. As pointed out by the Member for Radin Mas, the bank has offered the Mosque Management Committee the basement of the complex to be built as a replacement for the mosque. However, I have been told that this offer has been turned down by the Mosque Management Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a little premature for me to disclose at this point of time what has actually transpired in subsequent discussions. Suffice for me to say that, in deference to the wishes of the Mosque Management Committee, the bank is actively looking for an alternative site. No firm agreement has yet been reached among the parties, and the discussions are still continuing.

The whole world commends the leadership of our Prime Minister. People like me can speak in Tamil. Others can speak in Mandarin. There is freedom of speech and writing under the Government of our Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. I have faith in this Government. The people too have faith in this Government. In the last elections, all the PAP candidates were returned to power. Mr Speaker has heard my Tamil speech. Members have heard it and the Ministers have also heard it patiently. If they have any difficulties, I hope they will excuse me and welcome my comments and ideas. The views of the Back-

No one should feel that way because we have been working hard to assist every section of the community. The PAP leaders come from the workers. The PAP members have gone through the colonial period as well as the Lim Yew Hock Government. I would like to point out that we have gone through many hard times. People have given credit to us for our hard work. We, therefore, occupy all the 75 seats in this House.
  <br>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10 in respect of Subhead VC-05 of the Main Estimates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I just want to tell the Hon. Minister that I am not too happy with his reply to the hon. Member for Khe Bong on the subject of public assistance allowance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote to the Minister the case of a widow who is a recipient of a public assistance allowance. In struggling to support her young dependent children, she became a washerwoman or a hawker stall assistant, earning a meagre salary. Of course, if the investigation officer were to discover that, the public assistance allowance will be stopped. I think this is very unkind.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the fact that, as the Minister has said, a committee has been formed to look into appeals, I would urge this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> committee or the Hon. Minister himself to seriously consider the appeals made by Members of Parliament on behalf of the constituents who are public assistance recipients. We hope these appeals will be favourably considered and considered quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak. I fully support the sentiments expressed by my good Friend, the hon. Member for Changi. I have had on various occasions mentioned in this House that there should be a constant review of public assistance or dole, as it is often described for financial assistance to those who are less fortunate. Let me give one example to prove the point that we can afford to pay out a little more. This example may not be the best case but it is a strong case here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember that in the first URA sale of land in the late 1960s, perhaps 1967 or 1968, some $10 million were netted. And in the latest URA sale, I am reliably informed that some $1,000 million, that is, $1 billion, have been raised. Surely, Sir, we are rich enough to pay the less fortunate in our society a little bit more. As with the case indicated by the Member for Changi, the widow has to raise her own family and as she receives only a meagre sum in public assistance, she has to work as a washer-woman or as a hawker's assistant. But the assistance was withdrawn when the Department found out. I think this is too much.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House has heard about the generosity of the Hon. Minister for Finance in his handouts. I would suggest to the Hon. Acting Minister for Social Affairs to find a quick way through to the generosity of the Hon. Minister for Finance.

  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Sir, if you look at the Budget under the Public Assistance Programme, you will note that the direct cost of running this programme is about $900,000. If we add the administrative overheads, including the salary of the Hon. Minister, the total cost of running this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> programme is well in excess of a million dollars. Sir, it costs the Government more than a million dollars, mainly for the payment of staff salaries in the Ministry of Social Affairs, to administer the reliefs of $3.4 million. With the gradual reduction of the public assistance allowance in the Budget, I think the main beneficiary of the public assistance scheme is not the needy public but the staff of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with the Government's policy to increase productivity, may I suggest to the Hon. Minister to examine ways to increase productivity in the public assistance department, i.e. minimum input, maximum output. It will be desirable to cut down the number of staff, cut down the red tape, do less queries, ask less questions, save some costs and pass the benefit to the public who need assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Sir, my answer to all these queries will be a very simple one. We have certainly taken note of the views, expressions and unhappiness of the Member for Changi, suggestions by the Member for Punggol, and comments by the Member for Boon Lay. As I have mentioned earlier on, the PARC has just been formed a week ago. We only met yesterday for the first time. This is a new committee. I think we should give it a chance to get down to its task first before we pass judgment on its performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, we will give this committee a fair chance to prove itself. But, on the other hand, does the Hon. Minister not know that this appeal has been argued year in and year out in this House. Let us get on with the work. Please do not come here and say, "We have taken note of your comments and we will do something about it." Let us translate it into - - -

  <br>
  <br>

  <br> because a lot of complaints have been aired in this Chamber and a lot of complaints have been sent to me by Members.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment by leave, withdrawn.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Tan Soo Khoon -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by $10 in respect of Subhead VD-01 of the Main Estimates.

  <b>Encik Wan Hussin Zoohri:</b> Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall confine my comments to the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS). May I at the outset congratulate the Majlis for the good work it is doing and doing it with increasing tact and patience. But of late, I am of the opinion that the Majlis is feeling the manpower constraint in wanting to embark on new areas of work. The present strength of 12 Majlis members is not adequate compared to the volume of work it has to do and much more work it has to fulfil. My shortlived experience and service, regretfully, with the Majlis strengthens my belief that in order not to overburden the Majlis members who are serving part-time anyway, the Ministry should seriously consider increasing the present strength of the Majlis.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to touch on is in regard to its present premises. For a statutory body like MUIS, the present premises that it is occupying is in no way comparable to the premises of other statutory bodies. The conference room, to cite an example, though functional, is dull and drab. It is ironical that some of the conference rooms of the satellite mosques which MUIS helped to build are far superior to that of the MUIS itself. Foreign visitors, including important government dignitaries from Islamic countries, very often visit MUIS. I am therefore interested to know whether the Ministry has future plans for MUIS to have its own premises.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I wish to touch on is with regard to the appointment of an accountant. But since the Minister has pre-empted it with his answer to the first Member who raised the point, I only wish to raise the first two points.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Administration of Muslim Law Act provides for the appointment of not less than seven members to the Majlis from a list of nominees proposed by Muslim associations. As there are only the prescribed minimum of seven such members on the Majlis now, the number of members can be increased, if necessary. From the point of view of the workload and responsibilities of MUIS, Sir, what is important is not so much the number of members of the Majlis but the ability of the members to devote more of their time to the work of MUIS. As I have stressed in my reply to the hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan earlier on, what MUIS needs more urgently are more persons who are willing to serve on mosque management committees and a host of other committees under the MUIS umbrella. I would therefore look forward to receiving nominations from the hon. Member for Kampong Ubi as well as other Members of this House. But the Member's suggestion that the number of members on the Majlis be increased will certainly be looked into.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member's proposal that MUIS should function from its own premises is a good one. However, there are two major
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> obstacles. The first is to find a suitable site for the MUIS office and the second is to accumulate sufficient funds for the new building. Sir, the utilization of MUIS' funds is governed strictly by Islamic laws. Consideration will therefore have to be given to the setting up of a special fund for the building project. This matter will have to be studied very carefully in view of the high cost of land and the rising costs of construction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, for the benefit of the Member for Kampong Ubi and the Members of this House too, I am pleased to announce that the MUIS secretariat in Empress Place will be renovated by October this year at a cost of $300,000. When completed, the Secretariat will be more in keeping with a modern office.

  <b>Encik Wan Hussin Zoohri:</b> Sir, on the answers given by the Minister, there are encouraging signs that things are going for the better. On that note, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980 Budget Statement, it was announced that stamp duties would be abolished or rationalized on certain documents. The stamp duties concessions were effected by the Stamp Duties Act (Substitution of Schedules) Notification, 1980. However, some consequential amendments remain to be made to the provisions of the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to make these amendments. It will also introduce four minor amendments to streamline the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill makes the consequential amendments to sections 2; 12; 15(1); 21 (2), (4) and (5); 29(1), (2) and (4); 35(e); 65(l)(c): 66; 71 (1); 72 and 80 of the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to the other amendments which are intended to streamline and improve existing legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 21 (1) of the Act by deleting the phrase "made in Singapore under seal or under hand only". Section 21(l) imposes an ad valorem duty on contracts and agreements executed in Singapore on the sale of any equitable estate or interest in any property. It also imposes an ad valorem duty on some contracts and agreements on the sale of legal estate or interest in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the property except lands and properties situated outside Singapore, goods, stocks and ships. This is inconsistent with section 4(l)(c) of the Act which requires any instrument, which is executed outside Singapore and subsequently returned, to be stamped for duty. It has also created a tax loop-hole for avoidance of payment of duty by executing such agreements outside Singapore and subsequently bringing them back. The proposed amendment will, therefore, remove the inconsistency and seal the existing tax loop-hole as it has the effect of making such contracts and agreements, which are treated as conveyances on sale, liable to ad valorem duty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 47(a) of the Act so that the grace period of 14 days does not apply to receipts, as section 64(c) of the Act requires receipts to be stamped before execution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 59 of the Act which imposes a statutory limit of six months for making an application of refund of duties paid for misused stamps. The proposed amendment gives the Commissioner of Stamp Duties the discretionary power to extend the time period. This is to alleviate hardship in cases where the delay is unavoidable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 68(2) of the Act stipulates that any person who appoints a proxy to vote but does not have the documents stamped will be liable to a fine not exceeding $100 and the vote declared null and void. This is an unnecessary trap for the unsuspecting public, who may not be aware of the requirement of this provision in the Act. Clause 5, therefore, deletes section 68(2) of the Act as it does not really serve any useful purpose.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a straightforward short Bill and I will deal briefly with all its clauses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important, in my view, is clause 5 which deals with the language requirement for an applicant for citizenship by registration. At present under Article 123(1)(e) of the Constitution, an applicant must have an elementary knowledge of the national language in order to qualify for citizenship. The amendment will enable an applicant to satisfy the language requirement for citizenship if he has an elementary knowledge of any one of our four official languages, namely, Malay, English, Mandarin or Tamil, the languages which we use in this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses 2 to 4 deal with amendments relating to the Public Service Commission. Clause 2 will provide for the appointment of more than one Deputy Chairman for the Public Service Commission and will also increase the maximum number of members of the Commission (apart from the Chairman) from 9 to 11. In recent years there has been an increase in the scope, complexity and volume of work of the Commission and these amendments will help the Commission to carry out its functions more effectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 will enable any professor or lecturer from the National University of Singapore to be appointed as a member of the Commission as his knowledge and experience of various academic qualifications and standards would be useful in assisting the Commission in its work. At present paragraph (b) of Article 106 of the Constitution precludes a University professor or lecturer from being appointed as a member of the Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 will introduce some flexibility with regard to the period of appointment of members of the Commission apart from the Chairman. At present a member can only be appointed to hold office for a period of five years. The amendment will enable a member to be appointed for a shorter period of not less than three years.

  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act has been an effective piece of legislation in suppressing criminal activities, such as secret society activities and drug trafficking. Secret societies and drug distribution networks have been smashed. However, remnants exist and they must not be allowed to lure others into joining them or ex-criminal law detainees rejoining them. We are now putting greater emphasis on the rehabilitation of detainees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of their rehabilitation, detainees have a choice to pursue their studies or work in prison. On 28th February, 1981, 93 detainees were doing full-time studies in the prisons. In the last three years, 96 of them sat for the 'O' level examinations and obtained certificates. Fifty-eight of them obtained three or more 'O' level passes. Another seven detainees obtained partial 'A' level certificates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an initial period of strict regimentation, those who want to work are given work. On 28th February, 1981, 598 out of 946 detainees or 63% were working in prisons. Of these 598 detainees, 167 were doing maintenance work and 431 were working in the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) workshops. They made rosewood and rattan furniture, electronic capacitors, digital radio clocks, electronic calculators, etc.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to achieve two very important objectives of rehabilitation. They are to instil in them work discipline and to enable them to improve themselves through studies or the learning of new skills. This will not only give them a better chance to get a good job and go straight when released but also help them to regain their own self-esteem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, detainees released from an institutional environment often find it difficult to rejoin society. One of the main obstacles is the difficulty in getting a regular and proper job. They have no difficulty in getting jobs, such as bar bouncers, debt collectors and odd jobs but these soon get them into trouble again. In order to overcome this problem and better prepare the detainees for total release, my Ministry has worked out a Day Release Scheme. This Scheme will bridge the gap between the strictly controlled regime in the prisons and the completely free environment outside. It is based on the principle of a halfway house.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Scheme, a Day Release Camp or Camps will be set up. Detainees who are considered ready for day release by an Advisory Committee appointed by the Minister, will be transferred to the camp. They will be found jobs outside the camp by a Job Placement Unit and be paid wages at current market rates. They may also be self-employed provided the work is legal and proper. They have to return to the camp every day after work. If they misbehave at their place of work or breach any of the camp rules, they will be sent back to prison. After about a year's stay in the camp, the detainees will be released under police supervision.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This half-way house will enable the detainees to gradually adjust to the environment outside, earn normal wages and thus resume some of the obligations of a free man, such as supporting their families and build up their self-respect. It will be a test of their preparedness to rejoin society as useful and law-abiding citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme will be similar to the day release scheme for ex-drug addicts which was introduced on 1st September, 1979. In fact, the idea of this Scheme for criminal law detainees came about as a result of the success of the day release scheme for ex-drug addicts. 1,145 ex-drug addicts have so far gone through the scheme successfully. Most of them have no difficulty in finding their own jobs after their release from the day release camps. Preliminary results of a comparative study of ex-addict supervisees who have gone through the day release scheme and those who have not, suggest that the recidivism rate of those who had the benefit of day release has gone down by about 25%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, as in the case of ex-addicts, we may have some difficulty getting jobs for the detainees because of the prejudice of some employers who are chary of employing detainees. However, as in the case of ex-addicts, we have to demonstrate to these employers that the detainees are good and able workers. In addition, those who employ detainees will be assured that if any of the detainees misbehave they will be sent back to prison. In such a situation or when a detainee absconds, a replacement will be sent to the employer straightaway. In return, we expect the employers to treat them fairly and no differently from their other workers. Employers who participate in the Scheme will be making an important contribution to the total rehabilitation of the detainees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To implement this Scheme, section 42 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act has to be expanded to enable the detainees to be temporarily released from custody so that they can engage in employment outside their places of detention. The amendment is also to enable the Minister to grant them leave, for example, home leave during weekends.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar (Bedok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like, with your permission, to comment on certain general principles of this Bill. I would like to start off by saying that I support the Bill in its general principles. It has a progressive approach in our treatment of criminal detainees but it raises certain interesting implications not only for the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act but also for all those who are detained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I studied the Bill, I was wondering what aspects of our national interests are being advanced by this amendment, i.e. what particular interests are being promoted. Was it to rehabilitate the detainees? Was it to contribute to alleviating our labour shortage problem? Was it intended to solve some financial problems of the detainees and their families? I think that doubt has been resolved by the Minister's statement that the primary intention of the Bill is to rehabilitate the detainees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first observation, Sir, is that this scheme for the release of detainees for purposes of employment is limited to criminal law detainees under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. Speaking generally, I think it can be said that there are at least three broad categories of persons who are detained in our prisons. The first category would be those who are detained pursuant to a jail sentence imposed by a court of law after a person has been charged for an offence, undergone a trial and duly found guilty by a judge and then sentence is imposed. In that category, of course, there is a fixed duration of jail sentence. He knows exactly when he will be released.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category would be the category of preventive detention detainees, such as the category of detainees referred to by the Minister, and it would also cover the other category of detainees under the Internal Security Act who are also preventive detention detainees. The significance of this category is that they are detained under preventive detention provisions on the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> rationale that they are a special category and classification by themselves and cannot be subjected to the normal criminal law processes and trial procedures. In the case of detainees under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, I presume the difficulty of getting a conviction under the normal court processes is because witnesses are not willing to come forward to testify for fear of victimization. We have these two broad categories and, of course, there is a third category where drug addicts are sent to drug rehabilitation centres. We are not concerned with them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My comment, Mr Speaker, is that here we are introducing a scheme for release of criminal law detainees for employment purposes but the scheme has not been applied to those detained under the first category, that is to say, persons who are in jail serving a period of jail sentence for a variety of offences for which they have been found guilty. The Hon. Minister has told us that the detainees are supposedly engaged in rather serious activities, i.e. secret society activities and drug-trafficking, both of which are quite abhorrent to our society. Logically, if we want to release them, a case can be made out for considering a similar release scheme for those in the first category, i.e. those being detained pursuant to a court decision or conviction, particularly those who are serving fixed jail sentences for offences which are not associated with crimes of violence or offences which are not otherwise abhorrent to society. I wonder whether the Hon. Minister would care to comment on that and to indicate whether what we are witnessing now is a step in a series of further reforms in this direction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second observation is that in a scheme of this nature, it is absolutely important to have safeguards. Here I am not talking about safeguards of the public when detainees are released but safeguards for the detainees. The Minister did point out to us that employers will be assured that the detainees will have to behave themselves. But bearing in mind that these detainees have no pre-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> determined period of detention and that their detention could be extended, the detainees will be under tremendous pressure and they could be exploited by unscrupulous employers. I am thinking of situations where unscrupulous employers, fearing that they would lose the employment of these detainees, might threaten the detainees with false reports of their work and the detainees might then fear that their period of detention might be lengthened unfairly. I am sure this is a point which the Minister must have considered and he might have some measures in mind.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mr Speaker, a scheme of this nature can work if there is an incentive and detainees must have some indication that if they do their work well there will be some indication of an earlier release. If the Minister could comment on this, I would be very grateful.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Member for Bedok for taking an interest in this Bill and also for his support on the general principles of the Scheme. He has made three very valid points. The first is whether unscrupulous employers will take advantage and exploit the detainees who have accepted employment. As I have said, before we launch the Scheme we had nearly 18 months' experience of a similar scheme for ex-drug addicts. We are, therefore, quite conscious of the fact that such a situation might arise. But as far as ex-drug addicts are concerned, the employers have been fair. They have been on the level and have not taken advantage of them or exploited them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Job Placement Unit as far as ex-drug addicts are concerned, and they have been closely monitoring the whole situation. I am sure that with such close monitoring, any employer would not like to take the risk of exploiting them and then be shown up. The public is very conscious of what is going on with the day release scheme. In fact, the press is quite interested in it and I do not think any employer would be foolish enough to expose himself to adverse publicity if he attempts to take advantage of the ex-drug
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> addicts. I think that is not the problem. The problem is to convince the employers that, whether they be ex-drug addicts or criminal law detainees, they will be good workers; that they will not be a burden but instead make a contribution and, in return, be entitled to a fair wage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is why we have not included the prisoners, as the hon. Member has said, prisoners who have been sentenced for a fixed term. The difficulty has arisen precisely as a result of the conviction. If we want to include them, then we have to make certain changes in the law to vary the position. Perhaps we have to involve the Judiciary because, as far as the prisoners are concerned, their term of imprisonment is determined not by any executive authority but by the court. Therefore, if we wish to include the prisoners, we must make changes to the law. As I have said before, we are, in fact, implementing this Day Release Scheme without any precedent to go by. We are doing it slowly, step by step, and learn from experience. I cannot find any precedent in any part of the world where criminal law detainees are being put on a day release scheme. We have only the benefit of our experience with the day release scheme for ex-drug addicts, and so we are now extending it to the criminal law detainees. If it is successful, we will certainly extend it to prisoners. But, as I have said, it is a little bit more complicated because it involves the judicial system as well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, with regard to incentives, of course, incentive is a very important aspect of rehabilitation, apart from instilling self-respect and discipline. We always have incentives in mind. If the detainees were to work well, behave themselves and demonstrate to the employers and to the rehabilitation officers that they should be released earlier, a recommendation will certainly be made and the detainees will be released earlier.

  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9A of the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act deals with newspaper companies with a paid-up capital exceeding $4 million, while section 9B deals with smaller newspaper companies with a paid-up capital not exceeding $4 million. Both sections stipulate that no person shall hold either directly or indirectly through his nominees more than 3% of the ordinary shares in a newspaper company. However, while section 9B contains a provision empowering the Minister to exempt the small newspaper company from the 3% restriction on the holding of ordinary shares, there is no similar provision for Ministerial exemption for the bigger newspaper companies under section 9A.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sections enacted in 1977 did not anticipate the establishment of other major newspaper companies. They also do not provide for the increase of share capital by smaller newspaper companies originally registered with a capital of less than $4 million and exempted from the 3% restriction on ownership of ordinary shares.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Situations can arise where it is desirable to waive the 3% restriction. This can happen in respect of both small and large newspaper companies. There may be specialized newspapers which require expertise from certain specific sources. The Minister may consider it desirable to allow the organizations that can provide such expertise to hold more than 3% of the ordinary shares. Then there may be new newspaper companies which, being newcomers, are unable to go public because there is no assurance of good dividends for some time from the new investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Organizations which have the necessary financial resources to invest in such newspaper companies may have to be allowed to hold more than 3% interest, at least in the initial stages.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment that we are proposing does not mean that organizations holding the surplus shares will be able to control the policy of the newspaper or act in a manner prejudicial to the interest of Singapore. The Minister's approval would still be required for the holding of management shares, each of which commands 200 votes in any resolution relating to the appointment or dismissal of directors or any member of the staff of a newspaper company. The approval to hold management shares can also be revoked at any time by the Minister. Thus the main safeguards contained in the present Act will not be diluted in any way by this amendment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Act to empower the Minister to approve the holding of more than 3% ordinary shares in any newspaper company irrespective of its paid-up capital. Section 9B of the Act is repealed as there is no need to differentiate between newspaper companies with different paid-up capital.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 9A deals with all newspaper companies, as I have said, irrespective of their paid-up capital. No person shall hold directly or indirectly through his nominees more than 3% of the ordinary shares of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font>

  <br> company except with the approval of the Minister. In approving the holding of surplus shares, the Minister may impose any conditions that he deems fit. He may also revoke the approval at any time without assigning any reason.

   <b>STANDARD OF MEDICAL PRACTICE OF LOCAL DOCTORS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry and Minister for Health if he will clarify his statement that "The success of a medical centre, in large measure, depends on the reputation of the foreign doctors we can attract to Singapore."; whether it implied that the standard of medical practice of local doctors fell short of his expectation and, if so, how does he explain the increasing number of foreigners who come to Singapore for medical treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> We have one of the best medical practices in Asia. There is no question about that. The increasing number of foreigners coming to Singapore for medical treatment testified to this. The credit goes largely to our local doctors as only 10% of the doctors in the medical register as at 31st December 1980 were non-Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: how do we build upon our indigenous strength to become an international centre of medical excellence? We are good in standard disciplines such as general surgery, orthopaedic surgery, internal medicine and many specialities such as cardiovascular surgery and neuro-surgery. We have inadequate number of specialists elsewhere, such as ophthalmic and ENT surgeons. Even for those disciplines in which we are good in, we can become better by inviting distinguished specialists to practise in Singapore, for short periods if necessary and for long periods if possible. The presence of a large number of reputable doctors in Singapore is necessary before we can succeed as an international medical centre. Hence, the importance of attracting foreign doctors of eminence to Singapore to give added strength to our medical service.

   <b>ADMISSION OF FOREIGN DOCTORS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry and Minister for Health if he will elaborate on his expression "without demanding reciprocity" when he stated that Singapore's "medical registry should be open to foreign doctors with recognized qualifications without demanding reciprocity."; whether this proposal is to be limited to the public service only or to the private sector as well; and whether it is the intention to admit a selective type of high calibre expertise only or all foreign doctors with minimal recognized qualification.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> In preparing the Economic Development Plan for the Eighties, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has suggested that the medical registry should be open to foreign doctors with recognized qualifications without demanding reciprocity. This was to ensure that there is no closed-shop practice. I have now been advised by the Ministry of Health that reciprocity has never been a condition for registration by the Singapore Medical Council. Foreign recognition of Singapore qualifications is not a prerequisite to our recognising foreign qualifications. Besides medical graduates of the National University of Singapore, any doctor holding medical qualifications listed in the Schedule to the Medical Registration Act is eligible for registration in Singapore. A doctor holding any other unlisted medical qualification may also be registered if the Medical Council is satisfied that he possesses medical or surgical knowledge, experience and skill which are of value to Singapore. This principle applies whether the doctor is working in the public or private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not our intention to limit admission of foreign doctors to specialists in selected disciplines. Any qualified or skilled foreigner is welcomed to practise his profession or skill in Singapore. In the case of a doctor, he has to satisfy the Singapore Medical Council that he possesses the requisite skill.
