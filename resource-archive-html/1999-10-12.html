<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Second Allotted Day)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [11th

October, 1999],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the

President be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express  our thanks to the President for the Speech which  he

delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening  of  the

Second Session of this Parliament.".  -  [Mr Davinder Singh].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for  calling  on me to give an address.  I shall  make  it  a

short one, if possible.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President has given a comprehensive plan of the

Government  to  take  Singapore through  various  social  and

economic  challenges in the new millennium.  I must say  that

it is a very carefully thought out plan which can help us all

to  achieve  the tasks ahead.  We need to persuade  different

people  with different interests to work out the  plan.   And

unless  we are able to get people to work as a team, I  think

it  is  going  to be a difficult task for us to  be  able  to

realise the vision that we have set out to achieve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for us to look at some of the

problems  outside  Singapore which  we  sometimes  have  very

little control, and I think it is very important that  we  do

so because the problems that are confronting us in the region

do,  in  a  way,  affect some of our plans that  we  hope  to

achieve.   And  this is particularly important  in  a  region

where  we  are  often met with very volatile  situations  and

problems.   Therefore, we have to be very sharp, be  able  to

analyse, be able to forecast and be able to appreciate  these

changing circumstances, which are very critical in our  plans

to achieve the goals that we have set.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as usual, the Opposition Members have not suggested

anything concrete on how we could improve on the Government's

plan.   All  they  have  said  is their  common  rhetoric  of

democracy  for  Singapore.  They said  that  the  President's

Address  did  not  say  anything  about  democracy  and  what

direction  we  are  taking.   In  fact,  the  President   has

translated  democratic ideas into concrete plans  to  improve

the lives of Singaporeans.  I think if they visit some of the

areas,   the  suggestions,  the  agendas  of  the   different

Ministries,  they  will  begin  to  realise  that  there  are

democratic ideas, viewpoints, which are translated into  very

concrete actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many brands of democracy - the Taiwan

brand, the Philippine type, the South Korean kind, the Indian

type  and many others.  I am not sure what brand of democracy

they  want  to promote.  Having said and done, I think  their

brand of democracy has not produced anything that is concrete

for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans.   And many Singaporeans have not  bought  their

brand  of democracy, and I think that is an important  aspect

that we should be aware of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure of the kind of democracy that they are

promoting,  but  at  least the PAP  brand  of  democracy  has

produced decent housing, education and health for the people,

and  that is very concrete.  Over the last 30 years, we  have

realised the impact on the lives of Singaporeans, and that is

the  measure  we  should look at and that is  the  democratic

brand that Singaporeans should adopt and support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is crucial for us to look at the changing

external  events.   However, I foresee  that  there  are  few

emerging  social issues that we should pay attention.   These

need  to be attended to because I feel that they are specific

and concrete areas that we should pay particular attention in

the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of social and economic dislocations of

older   workers,  the  continuing  dislocations   of   labour

intensive industries will affect the livelihood of our  older

workers,  as  they would find it  difficult  to  obtain  work

because they do not have the necessary skills to fit into the

new  production  sectors demanding higher and better  skills.

They have to make various adjustments to their living and  it

may  be  difficult  for some.  The number  and  the  problems

facing  this group of older workers will increase, as  labour

intensive  operations  flow  out to  countries  with  cheaper

facilities and cheaper manpower.  Here, I feel that the NTUC,

ITE  and  the  Ministry of Manpower should set up  additional

worker  training centres with the least red tape to give  on-the-job  retraining to older workers.  ITE can play a  bigger

role  in the direction of the training of older workers.   We

should,  in  fact,  project and assess the  impact  on  older

workers in terms of their employability, and this is  a  very

important area that we need to focus so that we can  minimise

the dislocations on the livelihood of this group of people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on increasing health care cost for older persons, I

feel  that  the  costs of health care for older  persons  are

increasing  steadily.  This will become more acute  with  our

ageing  population.  Many families would find it  financially

burdensome,  especially if they have older parents  who  need

long-term care.  Currently, many older persons are treated in

acute wards in general hospitals when they need to be treated

and  followed up in less acute care hospitals.  Older persons

referred by GPs often land up in higher paying wards, when we

know  that  they  come from very low-income background.   All

these  problems  of health care cost could be contained  from

runaway  increase if both the hospitals and the GPs can  work

together  in partnership in the delivery of health  care  and

the  establishment of more community care hospitals.  I think

this  would be a challenge for us in the next decade  or  so,

and  unless we begin to look at more innovative ways  in  the

delivery   of  health  care,  this  group  of  older   ageing

population  can  be  dislocated  and  affected.   But  I   am

confident  that  the  Ministry of Health  together  with  the

medical  personnel in the community would  be  able  to  work

together   to  find  a  more  effective  solution   to   this

challenging issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the aspects of racial harmony and respect, I

would  like  to state that we should not take racial  harmony

for  granted.  We must get our young of various races,  right

from school-going age and those who are living in the various

neighbourhoods,  to live and interact and to  have  a  common

arena  where  they can share and appreciate their  sentiments

and  their  emotional  ties  could  be  strengthened.   Where

possible,  grassroots organisations should take  more  active

steps  to  promote social interaction among  Singaporeans  of

different  races, be they Malays, Indians, Chinese, Eurasians

and  others.    When we have better emotional ties  and  good

relationship, that we are Singaporeans after all and we  need

to  care  for one another, we can move ahead as a  team,  and

this  is  very critical and crucial to Singapore in terms  of

our   need  to  become  a  better  integrated,  better  self-respecting community and a community

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>

that  has the capacity to build up its bonds.  And if we  can

do  that,  then  Singapore will stay steady and  be  able  to

manage the different difficulties that may arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, it is very important that I

personally feel, as a minority group member, that Singaporean

Indians and Malays who are in the minority groups not to feel

small,  but  we  need  not  feel that  we  are  going  to  be

marginalised, but we should be able to stand tall and see how

we can seize the opportunities that are available to make the

best and improve the stations of our life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As minority group members, we should make all the

efforts  to  take  the equal opportunities  provided  to  all

Singaporeans  for our advancement in the social,  educational

and   economic  arenas.   Where  would  we  get  such   equal

opportunity   -   in  Malaysia, in India,  Sri  Lanka,  Fiji,

Europe, South Africa, United Kingdom, and even in the  United

States?   I  think  a lot of these places  talk  about  equal

opportunities, but when you get to the brass tack, you  begin

to  realise  that many of them do not have equal opportunity.

They all remain rhetorics and cannot be realised.  But in the

context   of   Singapore,  we  know   that   every   citizen,

irrespective  of race, irrespective of religion, irrespective

of  different  persuasions,  is given  equal  opportunity  to

access  to  services,  to  education,  to  various  types  of

opportunities that are available if they are prepared  to  be

challenged with it and if they are prepared to manage with it

at their best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many of these countries that I have highlighted,

although  they  claim to treat every citizen irrespective  of

his  colour, language and religion, they do not really do  so

in  terms of their social policies.  As minorities, we should

be  proud  about ourselves.  Chinese Singaporeans  must  work

together  with  all  other  Singaporeans,  whether  they   be

Indians,  Malays, Eurasians and others.  I think we  need  to

work  together.  We need to appreciate one another.  We  need

to  see how we can support one another in order that we  will

be able to make more progress in the interest of Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that our younger Singaporeans, when they

become  leaders,  must  ensure  that  all  policies  do   not

discriminate against any ethnic group and it must be based on

merit irrespective of their ethnic background.  In this  way,

we can hold and make Singapore society cohesive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of my parliamentary colleagues have given

ideas  and  suggestions for Singapore 21.  Many of them  have

articulated  issues related to how we can help to  strengthen

Singapore and how we can realise Singapore 21.  We also  know

that many countries have also good plans and ideas.  But many

of  their  plans have not been realised.  I am sure  that  if

Members have read and visited many of these places they  will

begin  to  see that many of them have laudable and idealistic

aspirations  about what they will do for their  citizens  and

how  life for their citizens could be improved.  But in  many

of  these places, lives have not improved at all despite  all

these aspirations that they have shared or identified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ask why this is the case. In the final

analysis, it is not good ideas that are sufficient.  We  must

have  good people at the helm to manage and make good  social

institutions.   These are important issues that  Singaporeans

will have to realise.  Unless Singaporeans realise that it is

good  people that can manage these institutions appropriately

in their interest, all these ideas, plans and visions that we

have cannot be realised.  So I would urge Singaporeans to  be

able  to  know and appreciate how they can be discerning  and

take  every  opportunity to ensure that  we  have  people  of

integrity, honest, and willing to be committed to manage  the

various social institutions that we have in our context.   It

is  only through this assertion and achievement that we  will

be able to realise some of the visions that we aspire for.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise in support of the motion standing in the

name of Mr Davinder

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>

Singh, thanking the President for his Address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the regional economic crisis has severely tested

our  economic resilience, political resolve and social bonds.

It was indeed a harrowing experience.  We can now say, with a

sigh of relief, that we have turned the corner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our sound economic policies and management, non-corrupt and good Government, and the willingness of the

people   to   take  the  CPF  cuts  and  make  the  necessary

sacrifices, we have passed the test.  We have obviously  done

better than many other countries in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a closer bonding between the people and the

Government,  a  new  sense of purpose,  a  new  vitality  and

vigour, as we march in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are not out of the woods yet. We still have some

distance  to cover.  We are affected by what happens  in  the

other  countries  in  the region. The fundamentals  have  not

changed.  We are a small country, a prized strategic hub in a

very  turbulent  region, with the need  to  defend  ourselves

against  any predators, with a small population and  a  small

talent pool, and a small economy that is vulnerable to global

economic swings and cycles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fault lines remain, whatever some may say.

Issues  of  race and religion can still ignite  and  fan  the

emotions.  Let us not pretend that these issues do not matter

and have no impact on our lives.  We should be aware of these

fault  lines and make sure they do not entrap us.  With  this

in  mind,  we can do our utmost to promote and uphold  multi-racial and multi-religious harmony in our schools, workplaces

and  neighbourhood.   I  agree fully with  my  colleague,  Dr

Vasoo, that we must all build up this multi-racial heritage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we overcome the latest economic crisis and cross

over  to the new millennium, we must be no less vigilant,  no

less ready to defend our sovereignty,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>

and be even more competitive and creative in ideas as well as

technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the crisis was on, there was gloom and doom. My

point  is, now that the crisis is receding, we must not swing

to  the  other  extreme of euphoria.  It is a marathon.   The

race  is  not  over.  There can always be  another  storm  or

typhoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a small population and talent pool.

Hence,  manpower development and training are crucial to  us.

I am glad that the Government is focusing on this in Manpower

21.   It saddens me when I go to the ground and meet ordinary

Singaporeans who are unskilled or semi-skilled, who could not

fit  into our fast-moving knowledge-based economy.  They  are

indeed  at a loss.  Many are still looking in vain for  their

unskilled  jobs that have gone off in the restructuring,  and

are  no more there for them.  We must therefore do all we can

to train and retrain this group of Singaporeans, many of whom

are in their 40s and above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can have more retraining and upgrading courses for

them in languages that they understand or are conversant  in.

Most  of them are main breadwinners themselves.  So ways have

to  be  found  to  keep them going while they are  undergoing

training,  either on-the-job training or sponsored  full-time

courses and in ITE courses, as suggested by Dr Vasoo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should change their mindsets and be more pro-active in training and retraining, in particular towards

older   workers.    Many  older  workers  are   indeed   very

discouraged and disappointed when they are told by  employers

that  they  are  too old, or the time is past for  them,  for

training.  Such attitudes must change.  It would be  a  waste

of  our  precious national human resources if this  group  of

Singaporeans is left out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers, too, must have the aptitude and thirst for

retraining   and   upgrading.   With  the   rapid   pace   of

technological  change,  workers will  have  to  re-learn  and

retrain many times over in the course of their careers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one half of our population is female. In view of

our limited resources and talent pool, we should all the more

make  full use of woman power and talent.  We have top  women

bankers like Mrs Theresa Foo of Standard Chartered Bank,  top

hoteliers   like  Ms  Jennie  Chua  of  Raffles  Hotel,   top

accountant like Mrs Fang Ai Lian, Managing Partner of Ernst &

Young, and Ambassador to the United States of America,  Prof.

Chan  Heng Chee.  Now we have a woman Permanent Secretary  in

Ms Lim Soo Hoon in the Ministry of Community Development.   I

hope  the  list will grow.  It makes no sense for us  not  to

make  full  use  of  woman power for the  betterment  of  the

country.  If I may add too, we should have more woman MPs  in

this House to liven up the debates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the regional turbulence and upheavals have proven,

beyond  doubt, the wisdom of allocating a significant portion

of  our  resources  for defence and security.   The  regional

crisis underlines the crucial importance of total defence and

National Service.  Without creditable defence and deterrence,

we  will  be  at the mercy of others.  If we are defenceless,

others  will just walk in, and we will have to bow  to  their

every whim and fancy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sons who are National Service officers told me that

National Servicemen take their training seriously.  And  with

apologies   to  the  Minister  for  Education  for   speaking

Singlish,  they  say,  "Don't pray,  pray,  this  is  serious

business."   And  they  do  take  their  training  seriously.

Indeed, the regional crisis has driven home the message  more

than any other pep talks can do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new millennium is our new frontier. We are

revving to go forward to invest and apply new technology,  to

be  creative in all that we do, to do things better, to do it

differently,  if  necessary,  so  that  we  can  all  make  a

difference to the lives of our fellow Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we march into the new millennium, we must remain

united  and cohesive, taking the ups and downs as one  people

and one nation. Our hearts must beat as

one  for  Singapore.   We will then be able  to  weather  any

unexpected storm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise in support of the motion. The last quarter of

the  20th  century  has  witnessed unprecedented  growth  and

development  of  the  economies of Asia.   The  expansion  of

consumption and the market force doctrine expanded trade  and

created wealth.  We had measured our success by the profit we

made.  The economic crisis is therefore a warning signal  for

us to reassess our value judgment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people-centred approach in the President's Speech is

timely  and the shift of emphasis from money and economy   to

the  people  is  most  welcomed.    We  are  excited  by  the

Government's intention to create more opportunities and space

for  Singaporeans  to  develop  their  full  potential.   The

private  sector  is keen to participate fully in  partnership

with Government in shaping our future together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look forward to a creative and innovative environment

for  ideas to blossom and be tested.  Not all new ideas  will

succeed  though.  We must be prepared for failures.  Failures

must be seen as a stepping-stone to potential success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While strict observance of procedures has served us well

in  the  past,  it  has also prevented lateral  thinking  and

lateral  decision-making.  The mindset  of  the  people  that

operates  the policies must change if we are to  achieve  the

full potential of ideas in order for Singapore to benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Technology will be an integral part of the

Singapore  lifestyle in the 21st century.  It helps  us  plug

into  the  world.   When technology and humans  meet,  a  new

relationship  is  inevitably created.  We  have  seen  movies

depicting the doom day scenarios when the two cultures clash.

I am confident this would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>

not   happen.    Technology,   in   particular,   information

technology,  has been beneficial.  However, I have  witnessed

children  more comfortable with communicating with  computers

rather  than with fellow human beings and this frightens  me.

We must recognise this phenomenon and address it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing our people goes beyond the training of

skills.   It  involves the releasing of  their  potential  by

providing opportunities for them to exercise their ideas  and

talents for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore buys skills and has 400,000 foreign workers

working  for  pay. Singaporeans must work for  Singapore  for

more than just pay.  They must have a passion in their chosen

careers to do the best for themselves and for Singapore.   We

must  wean  students from picking a career based on  monetary

returns  only.   It is a role that both parents  and  schools

must  play  an  active part in.  Only then can  our  children

develop their full potential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the Government's intention of turning

Singapore into a Renaissance City.  The rebirth and expansion

of  cultural  activities will allow the arts,  music,  drama,

sculpture  and the appreciation of aesthetics to flower.   We

must  also  ask  ourselves  why  our  artists  had  to  leave

Singapore  to  win  accolades  in  foreign  lands.   We  must

establish  the conditions and climate for them to  return  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will know that we have succeeded in establishing a

Renaissance City when our artists choose to return  home  or,

even  better, if their talents can be acknowledged  at  home.

We  must  start to nurture a people with a sense of aesthetic

sophistication   that  demands  the   best   in   the   arts,

architecture and other aesthetic disciplines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many talented Singaporeans but our population

size  requires support from talented non-Singaporeans.   Many

talented non-Singaporeans have taken up the challenge to come

to Singapore to join

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>

us  in our effort.  We welcome their contributions.  However,

we  sometimes  wrongly equate foreigners to foreign  talents,

and we know that this is not so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next millennium will see a new Down Town in the

Marina  South area.  This virgin piece of land challenges  us

to design an ecologically-sustainable city with minimum or no

private  vehicle  traffic, no pollution;  and  where  natural

green areas removed by development are re-incorporated within

our built environment; where rainwater collection is part  of

the infrastructure of every building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A highly urbanised Singapore is in a position to pioneer

ultra-tall  buildings to accommodate a large  population  and

yet  maintain its livable quality.  We look forward to a  new

Down  Town with mixed usage to ensure a more vibrant people's

environment.    Together  with  Government,  we   must   seek

alternative  proposals  that  can  only  enrich   the   final

implemented solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we develop our recreational areas, we must make a

conscious effort to retain some of our wilderness.  It is  in

the  natural wilderness that bio-diversity exists.  Singapore

should  not  only be a `pretty garden', but a real experiment

in  co-existence  between  nature and  an  urban  population.

Pulau Ubin is one such place, a place where we can relax,  go

back to the simpler things in life and experience our harmony

with nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a people-focused programme outlined by

the  President has excited us and we have been  motivated  to

make it happen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the motion, moved by the Member for Bishan-Toa  Payoh GRC, in expressing our thanks to the President for

his Address at the Opening of the Second Session of the Ninth

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the President's Speech, in essence,

substantially  hovered over Singapore 21  which  was  debated

intensely in this House fairly recently, I believe it  serves

as a staunch reminder

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>

to  Singaporeans of the emphasis and weight the Government is

attaching to the Singapore 21 vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People, the President clarified, will be the focus of

our  Government, as we brace ourselves for the next  century.

Although  this  current emphasis appears to be stronger  than

ever, I recall that this represents a continuation of a trend

which was first mooted by Prime Minister Goh in 1997 when  he

suggested  the  need  for  a  "people-centred"  vision  which

transcends  material achievements to a society  which  places

people first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singaporeans, we have demonstrated ourselves to be

pragmatic  and realistic.  Our leaders have brought  us  thus

far,  that  we can stand tall and walk with our  heads  high,

having faced the severest of any conceivable adversity during

the separation days, and turning obstacles into opportunities

for the future, in the more recent regional economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the odds, Singapore has not only survived but

also  flourished to be a nation envied by many from any  nook

and corner of this world.  For what we have today, we owe  it

to   our  early  leaders  for  all  their  untiring  efforts,

sacrifices   and   all  they  have  done  for   the   present

generation's betterment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what we have today - be it material wealth,

racial  or  social  harmony - as has been mentioned  in  this

House  countless numbers of times - these can never be  taken

for  granted.   It  is  incumbent upon  all  of  us  that  if

conditions were difficult in the early years, all indications

are,  we  are  potentially confronted with  an  even  tougher

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is the inevitable fact that we have no other

choice  but  to transit to a knowledge-based economy  in  due

course,  the  sooner  we are ready, the  better.   The  rapid

changes in the global economy and technology have already led

to  a  feeling among some Singaporeans that they have to  run

even  faster just to keep pace with the changes.  As a  small

open  nation, we are inextricably tied to the global  trading

system and have little choice but to meet

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>

the challenges of competing within the constraints of the new

global arena, or perish.  Thus, Singapore has no choice,  and

the economics of survival is, and will always be, Singapore's

priority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as we enter the new millennium, it is

apparent  that the accelerating pace of technological  change

will  be a key defining characteristic of the new millennium.

It  will  be a world in which economic value is derived  from

the  active generation and application of knowledge, a  world

where human capital forms the new basis for wealth.  It  will

also  be  a  world  where the rapid pace of change  puts  the

social fabric in all countries under strain.  Competition for

trade, talent and investments will become increasingly  tense

as  it  takes  on  a  global  dimension  and  as  people  and

investments become more mobile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has to remain economically competitive. To

achieve  this,  we must continuously develop capabilities  in

key areas in which our competitors are lacking and finding it

difficult  to  emulate.  In addition to our cost  structures,

the  quality of our human capital is key.  It is a known fact

that we can no longer compete in industries that are land and

labour  intensive.  We must compete based on knowledge  -  on

the  generation  and  application of  ideas,  innovation  and

information.  To do this, we must develop our human  capital.

Singaporeans must realise that this is the reality in an area

of   intense   global  competition  and  rapid  technological

changes.  They must constantly upgrade themselves to  prepare

for the new competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge is adequately preparing Singaporeans from

all  walks of life for this inevitable change.  I have little

doubt  that  our  better  educated young,  and  being  better

endowed, will be able to live up to the challenge.  My  worry

is  for  the older workers, as was also earlier expressed  by

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar GRC, Dr Vasoo.  Several hundred

thousands  of  them  have between 10  and  20  years  yet  of

economic  life to look up to.  I applaud what the  Government

and  the NTUC have done by way of the multitude of programmes

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>

Manpower  21  and NTUC 21 to prepare them for the  inevitable

KBE  transition.  This is a clear demonstration that we  care

for   our  people   The  lingering  fear  is  how  far  these

programmes - many of them are already in place, and I am sure

many   yet  in  the  pipeline  -  have  reached  the  people,

especially the truly vulnerable ones.  I fear, Sir,  if  this

is  not aggressively pursued, we may run the risk of creating

an  underclass  where a segment of society  loses  hope.   If

every Singaporean  truly matters, then we must be prepared to

go  that  extra mile or kilometre to reach out to the  bottom

strata.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, while I am comfortable that our young are

adequately  prepared,  I have a different  concern  for  this

group.  Can we expect that they stick through thick and  thin

with  Singapore  as our seniors and we have  done?   Or  will

their  patriotism  be just skin deep and a  function  of  the

peaks  and valleys of the economic cycle?  Can we expect  the

emanation of a sense of community in them that will  lead  to

the  much  desired  community  bonding  and  ultimately,  the

togetherness as a nation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has laid the ground work by emphasising

the  sharing of wealth, building and preserving of ties, care

for  the young and aged, and the Singapore heartbeat as  part

of Singapore 21.  Are young Singaporeans aware of the problem

and,  more  importantly, will they respond to the  call?   Or

will  they become just armchair critics, as Minister of State

for Defence, Mr David Lim, has put it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes a people a nation is their sense of being

implicated  in  a  common  destiny.   Unity  is   sought   in

diversity.  It is also the same sense that makes it  possible

that  the unity will prevail in conditions of adversity  too.

To  some  extent,  the  latter has  been  demonstrated  by  a

generation  of  Singaporeans who threw  their  weight  behind

policies and programmes that turned a looming debacle into  a

synonym for success.  But as the moment of danger appeared to

have  passed, so did the urgency for collective action, which

was replaced by the desire to derive the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>

maximum benefit for oneself or his immediate family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While such an outlook is understandable, it may be seen

as   quite  dangerously  incomplete.  On  the  premise   that

happiness  cannot  be  bought,  greater  personal  affluence,

therefore,  need not necessarily translate into  satisfaction

that  comes from being at ease with oneself.  And, since  not

all  can do equally well in a competitive society open to the

effects  of  international economic forces, the  relationship

between  those thriving and those labouring to keep up  could

not but emerge as an issue over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent financial crisis, if its effect were

prolonged on us, could have provided a clearer barometer, but

unfortunately or fortunately, we got out of it sooner  rather

than later.  The absence of a serious crisis makes a sense of

shared destiny harder to develop and gauge.  Yet, it is  that

bond,  and  not  only economic success, that can  provide  an

enduring  perspective  on  personal  achievement  and  ensure

social  divisiveness  is  kept at bay.   No  legislation  can

generate that bond; no campaigns can sustain it.  It can only

emanate  from  a people who see Singapore as a country  where

the  legitimate  and necessary pursuit of material  interests

concurrently provides space for inhaling patches of cultural,

artistic and spiritual green.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact that no one owes Singapore a living but

that  does not mean that Singaporeans owe the country no more

than  just  doing National Service and taxes as  payment  for

making  a  livelihood here.  We owe it to  one  another,  the

recognition  that  we are fellow citizens  of  this  enviable

little island republic, called Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That recognition holds within itself the social glue

that Singapore needs today.  Will it stick?  That depends  on

whether  people,  especially our young, are willing  to  look

beyond  their immediate interests.  That depends  on  whether

people  are willing to act to realise the Singapore 21 Vision

and become involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Mr Inderjit Singh,

yesterday warned of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>

danger of over-emphasising academic performance being carried

into the workplace, especially in the uniformed services.  He

said  such emphasis could run the risk of creating an elitist

class  system.  Sir, what is important is the fact  that  the

elitists,  whether academic or economic, need  to  understand

that  their  position, while deserved, depends ultimately  on

how  they  carry, conduct and position themselves.   Elitists

inevitably  exist in every society, but elitism  -  the  idea

that  the  elitists do the rest of society a  favour  through

their existence - can be damaging, even lethal, especially in

a   small  crowded  country  like  Singapore,  where   social

visibility is high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Singapore 21 Vision to work and for Singapore to

make  it  in  the future, diverse voices must be  allowed  to

participate  in, or even celebrate the reality,  mystery  and

vibrancy  of  Singapore, not necessarily  to  register  their

specific  interests  but  as  a  beneficent,  collective  and

protective reach they belong to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if some voices may be out of tune, but if they are

sincere and honest, they will ultimately synchronise with the

grand  orchestra  whose  proudest song  is  none  other  than

Majulah Singapura.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for this opportunity to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people welcome the Speech by the President. They

appreciate its people oriented focus.  This time the  economy

took  a  back seat.  By this, Singaporeans should not  assume

that the economic battle is won and, from now on, the economy

will  hum along.  The economic battle is endless.  We need  a

strong  economy to survive and progress.  We must never  lose

sight  of its importance.  Over the years, we have made great

progress on the economic front.  We have now reached a  level

of   economic  development  that  the  country  can  put  the

development  of  our people on the forefront.   Nevertheless,

the  Speech  by  the  President is  not  devoid  of  economic

considerations,  but  only  that it  considers  the  economic

effects through the people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>

We  have  to develop our people as it is they who  drive  the

economic engine and growth.  People and the economy are sides

of a coin.  We need both for a strong nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing an economy is demanding. But developing a

people  is  even more difficult.  Developing our people  will

take  not  just a matter of years but perhaps a lifetime  and

longer.   But  the sooner we start, the faster  we  will  get

there.   The  country has started developing our  people  for

years,  since 1965 and even earlier, not just now.  Over  the

years,  we have developed an education system that the  world

admires.   But  the  emergence of a  knowledge-based  economy

dictates  that  we change our education system  to  encourage

more  creativity and an innovative spirit among our children.

But  in  making these changes, we must ensure that the  quest

for  excellence  and  the capacity  for  hard  work  are  not

displaced.  Excellence is the centre piece of a great nation.

Without excellence, achievement and success is shallow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellence comes from hard work. We must not fear hard

work.   There are no easy and painless paths to success,  and

we  should not look for one.  But as we develop as a  nation,

it  is  understandable that our people want a less  stressful

life for their children and themselves.  But that should  not

be  at  the  expense of excellence and hard work.  In  making

changes to meet a globalised, knowledge and information-based

world,  we  should  not inadvertently  cause  the  people  to

discard  those values that girdle the nation.  A change  made

on  a  firm foundation creates growth.  Otherwise, it is just

becoming  different.  We have to send a clear and  consistent

message to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talents are necessary for a nation to compete and

grow.   In  the  future  globalised knowledge-based  economy,

talent will become even more critical.  If the United States,

the  leading economy in the world, hungrily soaks up  talents

that  it finds from around the world, how much more important

this  strategy  of  attracting talent must  be  for  a  small

country like Singapore.  However, the foreign talents

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>

and  workers can strain national cohesion for they bring with

them different cultures and value systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to develop and strengthen our own symbols,

institutions  and  value  system to  anchor  Singaporeans  to

Singapore - to permit us to identify ourselves and to  enable

us  to be unique.  But this can be a dilemma for we also want

to  conform to international standards to enable Singapore to

link  to the world and to exploit the opportunities.  We must

be  mindful that this conflict exists.  The balance will  not

be  easy to find.  Perhaps, in some instances, we may need to

allow two systems to develop in parallel: one for our link to

the world, and the other for our national identity and unity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education and skills provide the means for growth and

development  of  nations and individuals.  But  it  can  also

divide  the  people, for those who are educated  and  skilful

advance faster and further than those who are not.  Over  the

last  few decades, we have been able to keep this divide from

widening.  With the addition of creativity and innovation  to

education  and  skills,  our drive into  the  knowledge-based

economy  will  accentuate  this divisive  pressure.   As  the

economy  becomes global and high-tech, Singaporeans with  low

education  and skill will find it harder to get work  at  low

level jobs, as low level jobs move out of Singapore.  Besides

the  able reaching out to help the less able, it behoves upon

Singaporeans to understand and appreciate the future  -  what

is  meant  by a high-tech knowledge-based economy  -  and  to

seize  the  opportunities for education and the opportunities

to  upgrade  their skills and acquire new skills.   Not  only

would  there be more educational opportunities for our young,

the  school of lifelong learning and other schemes  like  the

Skills    Redevelopment   Programme   will   provide    ample

opportunities for our adult population.  If all who can  make

it  do so, then it will be easier for society to take care of

those who, despite their efforts, fail.  I urge our people to

seize these opportunities to upgrade and improve themselves.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major difficulty working with people is the mindset.

This is a set of personal principles and values that a person

uses  to  live  life.   To  get  a  person  to  do  something

different, the mindset first has to be changed.  This is  not

easy  and  takes  time.  We have plenty of  this  experience.

Many  public  housing residents once lived  in  villages,  in

houses  with  their  own compounds.   Today,  we  still  have

difficulty getting some of them to remove their old bicycles,

pots,  shoe  racks  and  other  belongings  from  the  common

corridors.   Some  residents give  scant  respect  to  common

properties.   Hence,  junk  mails  litter  the   void   deck.

Playgrounds  with  equipment are  vandalised.   Lifts  become

convenient  toilets.   Thus, in spite of  over  30  years  of

nationhood, over 30 years of living in high rise flats,  over

30  years  of  campaigns and other forms of exhortation,  old

habits persist.  Mindsets are firm anchors of behaviour.   It

will take more than just a few years to achieve the goals  of

Singapore 21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our youths are our future. We must help them to

reach  their  best.   For many families, both  parents  work.

After school, some youths hang around shopping malls and game

arcades.   The  number of delinquents among secondary  school

students is increasing.  Quite a few of them are involved  in

more  serious offences.  I would like the Government to  give

more  support to our youths.  They need facilities to  occupy

themselves in purposeful and worthwhile pursuits.  One  thing

that  we can do is to set up more youth centres.  Here,  they

will  have their peers for company.  Here, they can  join  in

meaningful  activities.  Here, they can find help  when  they

need it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth is an age when they seek independence and their

identity.   This  is  also the time where parents  show  more

concern for them.  If youths, who have the urge to spend time

away  from home, have youth centres to hang out, parents  may

not  need  to cross examine them when they reach home.   This

will  remove a cause of friction between youths and  parents.

Rectifying an error usually cost more than preventing it from

occurring  in the first place.  If we do not help  them  when

they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>

are young, wayward youths can become a lifelong liability for

society  and  the  nation.  Help our youths  before  they  go

astray.  It costs less this way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the focus on our people. I

endorse the call to our people to develop themselves  and  to

be  more  involved in the community.  But we  must  not  lose

sight  of  the importance of the economy.  We must  also  not

inadvertently  dilute  the values  that  girdle  the  nation.

Excellence and hard work are essential to success.  There  is

no  easy  path.   While we welcome foreign  talent,  we  must

encourage  our people to strive to be the best they  can  be.

Hence,  the  Singapore 21 journey will neither  be  easy  nor

quick,  though the sooner we start, the earlier we  will  get

there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

President's Address indicated that the Government is  placing

emphasis  on  people development.  When this  was  published,

some  people  questioned why the Government  is  focusing  on

people,  seemingly  for the first time.  And  this  idea  was

verbalised  by  the article in Chua Lee Hoong's  article  "Mr

Cynics  meets  Mr Govt" on 9th October in the Straits  Times.

Is  that a fair comment?  Surely, we all must agree that  the

Government  policies, since the founding of  Singapore,  have

always been people oriented.  It was not explicitly stated so

in  the past.  In the early years, in fact, the focus was  on

job  creation and the idea was to allow the market  mechanism

to  distribute the benefits to the people.  The emphasis,  as

stated  in  the  President's Address, simply means  that  the

Government  is now addressing the development and  fulfilment

of  the  individual  in  a more direct  manner.   Why  is  it

necessary  now and not so in the past?  Is it because  it  is

expedient  to do so today as that would be in tune  with  the

time  when people are becoming more educated and enlightened?

I think not, Sir.  My colleague, Dr Tan Boon Wan has actually

expressed it very well.  He said that people and the  economy

are  two  sides of the same coin.  Sir, the new  emphasis  on

people is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>

probably  the  right  approach and perhaps  the  only  viable

approach  to tackle the challenges of the future because  the

future is going to be very different from the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the future going to be like? At the dawn of

the new millennium, I think it is tempting for many of us  to

reflect and forecast the future.  As we all know, doing so is

very difficult.  Most of the forecasts made by very prominent

people  in  the past were mostly wrong.  However,  there  are

some  fundamental  trends in our society that  could  not  be

changed  no  matter what we do in the near  term.   In  other

words, these are trends that would predict the future of  our

society  in  the  next 10 to 20 years.   In  effect,  we  can

actually  talk  about the future that has  already  happened.

This  is  a  term I borrowed from the management guru,  Peter

Drucker.   I  think it is important to do so lest we  collide

into  the  future unprepared.  It is almost like  the  recent

train  accident in Paddington Station in London.  The outcome

could be very unpleasant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I have your indulgence to focus on two trends,

namely,  demographics and technology.   The  first  trend  is

demographics.   As  we  all know and as has  been  repeatedly

said,  Singapore's population will be ageing  rapidly.   This

has already been touched on by several speakers, including Dr

Jennifer   Lee,  who  spoke  extensively  about   care-givers

yesterday.   The youthful nation that we were just  15  years

ago will have a more elderly look in the next 15 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed becoming an old folks' home. The 4th

October issue of Newsweek magazine reported that by the  year

2050,  Japan  will  have the world's  largest  share  of  old

people, people aged 100 and above, followed by Singapore  and

Finland. There will be pressure to minimise discrimination in

all fields of human endeavours by age in our society.  In the

future,   we   would  be  like  United  States  today   where

discrimination  by  age  will  be  illegal.   There  will  be

heightened  demand on public services such  as  health  care,

transportation and recreation by the elderly. Those  measures

announced by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>

the  Ministry  of  Communications and Information  Technology

(MCIT)  on the accessibility of MRT for the elderly are  just

one very clear example.  But what is not so obvious, and that

requires  reinforcement, is that the aging of  the  Singapore

society is occurring at a pace unparalleled in the history of

mankind.   We  must be one of the fastest aging  nations,  if

not,  the  fastest  aging nation in the world.  This  is  one

important  factor  for  us  to  consider  because   all   our

institutions,  social  systems  and  cultural  instincts   to

respond  to  problems do not prepare us to handle this  rapid

pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to become a caring and loving society, we must

harness  the  energies of the senior citizens in the  future.

In my mind, Sir, it is not so much to tap the senior citizens

as  a pool of human resource or a pool of labour since we are

short  of younger people.  I think it is important to  do  so

because of the fulfilment of the individuals and these senior

citizens  of tomorrow a job will bring.  Yet, in catering  to

the  needs  of  the  senior citizens  to  stay  involved  and

engaged,  we  must also remember that in Singapore,  we  have

developed a culture of youth, a culture where high flyers  in

our  civil service move up the ladder very rapidly. So, would

we  be  able  to  continue  this practice  when  the  current

generation  could continue to work way past what we  perceive

today as the retirement age? This is but one example of  what

I  meant by cultural shock of being one of the fastest  aging

societies in human history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that this Government is already taking

concrete  steps  in  this direction.  Prof.   Low  Seow  Chay

yesterday  spoke  about the six Committees looking  into  the

various issues faced by senior citizens and consolidating the

views  of close to 1,000 respondents.  And when we talk about

senior  citizens,  we  are not talking about  the  generation

before us, nor are we talking about the generation after  us.

In  fact,  we  are  referring to ourselves, the  baby  boomer

generation,  the generation in charge today  but  the  senior

citizens of tomorrow.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we are not the only society where the elderly

population is increasing at a very fast pace.  Of  the  other

countries  with  similar proportion that come  to  mind,  ie,

Japan,  the  European countries, United  States  and  Canada,

these  are developed countries where a much higher proportion

of   their  aged  are  educated  or  are  already  considered

knowledge  workers.  For these countries, they  could  extend

their retirement age for these senior citizens and turn  what

seems   as   a   handicap   into  a  comparative   advantage.

Unfortunately, for us in Singapore, a high percentage of  our

elderly  are not very well-educated and as we are not  yet  a

developed  country, not many of our aged today  and  tomorrow

could  be considered knowledge workers. Thus, engaging senior

citizens  in  a  meaningful  manner  will  be  a  very  major

challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung had already earlier on touched on the

problems  faced by the elderly in going through  training  to

acquire  new skills because of their current inadequacies  in

educational background.  Mr Lim Boon Heng had also touched on

the  need  for life-long training and worker retraining.   If

that is his task, Mr Speaker, Sir, he has an unenviable task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second trend I would like to touch upon is

technology.  Several technological developments  are  already

obvious and have immense implications.  For instance,  mobile

phone  is  one  of these. Finland is a leading example  where

most  teenagers today already possess their own mobile phones

and  they are willingly paid for by their parents who believe

that  technology will bring about unpredictable  benefits  as

the  new  way of communication becomes second nature  to  the

young. The phone sets are becoming more capable, allowing  e-mail  retrieval,  Internet connections and even  payment  for

goods  dispensed by vending machines, also connected  to  the

Internet.  It is likely that mobile phones might be the  most

common platform for e-commerce, and not the PC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, mobile phones have already liberalised a

lot  of the professionals and entrepreneurs from being  bound

to their desk. I am sure many of us

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>

have  come  across golfers who continue to engage  in  value-added   activities  while  playing  a  round  of   golf.   As

penetration of mobile phones reaches a critical mass, I think

society  will be completely transformed. Again,  how  do  you

predict  the future?  I suggest we observe the Finns as  they

go onto this new technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us are already familiar with the spread of

Internet and its importance.  I do not have to dwell into it.

We  are all aware that the stock markets in the United States

and  also in Singapore are paying high premiums for companies

engaging  in Internet e-commerce, in particular, business-to-consumer  e-commerce. What is not so obvious is the  changing

landscape of employment brought about by Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Internet, individuals are able to sell their

service directly to the consumer in the global market.  There

is  less  need for intermediaries like companies  to  provide

employment.  In fact, there is no barrier in the new Internet

market  such  as  national borders.  For instance,  India  is

already exporting its software services to the world via  the

Internet.  Today, this export is worth close to US$2  billion

and  has  been growing by more than 50% over the past several

years.   Other services are also available over the Internet.

Jobs  that  are  traditionally done in the  home  offices  of

corporations are being out-sourced to the suppliers with  the

best  economic  value-added  regardless  of  time  zone   and

location.  For  example, US companies and Japanese  companies

are  engaging  software professionals in  Singapore  via  the

Internet  while  Singapore companies are  doing  likewise  in

India  and  China. With Internet, the importance of companies

and  corporations as an employer will diminish over time.  It

is  being  replaced by the ascendancy of the  individuals  as

agents  working  on contractual basis.  The question  is,  if

individuals can make a living from the world on the Internet,

would  they  still  feel an obligation to  the  society  that

nurtures  and  shelters them?  In fact, the very  concept  of

nation  state  might  be an obsolete idea  in  the  world  of

Internet.  This is a very pertinent question  as  we  try  to

build a society of active

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>

citizens.  It is also a soul searching question that we  must

ask ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Singapore would like to migrate from labour-intensive industries to the knowledge-based economy as my

good  friend,  Mr Ahmad Magad had elaborated earlier  in  his

speech,  the  advent  of Internet is bringing  forth  greater

competition  to  our knowledge workers as  large  numbers  of

knowledge workers from countries like India, China and  other

European countries will become available on line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we are being squeezed on both sides, from the lower

value  skills  side by cheaper countries, and also  from  the

higher  value  side  from more capable  countries  with  more

skilled workers.  So, is the future a bleak one?  Sir,  I  do

not  think  so.  I attended a seminar recently where  Mr  Lim

Swee  Say  was the Guest of Honour.  In his short speech,  he

said that the raw material of the knowledge-based industry in

the future is bright ideas.  I think he is right on the mark.

The question is how to turn these bright ideas into goods and

services which the world is prepared to pay for.  In this, it

is  obvious  that we have only one option and, that  is,  the

education  of  our  next generation.   This  topic  has  been

touched on earlier by Dr Tan Boon Wan.  The question  that  I

have in mind is: is the education system we have put in place

still appropriate? Should we change that education system?  I

would  point  out  that  there is a movement  in  the  United

States'  institutes of higher learning such as  the  Stanford

University to revert to core curriculum.  This curriculum  is

not  to  prepare students for a specific job in a job  market

but  to  enable them to create their own jobs in  the  future

when they come to the job market.  And what is to be included

in this core curriculum?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I find the views of Yotaro Kobayashi,

Chairman of Fuji Xerox and Founder of Aspen Institute, Japan,

as expressed in his article "Education, Knowledge and Wisdom"

featured   in   Look  Japan  magazine,  April   1999,   quite

interesting.  He felt that Japan has specialised in economics

and  technology  but  as  a developed country,  the  Japanese

education system should be more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>

balanced.  Japan should evolve into the kind of society  that

other  people  can  honestly say that it is  exciting  to  be

living there or that the Japanese are interesting to interact

with.   When one specialises in economics and technology,  it

is  acceptable to learn through memorisation.   But  what  is

needed  is  an education that encourages people to  form  and

hold  their own opinions.  Unless the Japanese become  people

with  their own ideas and philosophies, the Japanese are  not

going  to  be  interesting and exciting people.   Unless  the

Japanese have their own ideas about how life should be lived,

the  Japanese will never truly be able to have dialogues with

people  from other countries.  He concluded that the Japanese

perhaps  would have to study subjects like history.  I  think

the  wisdom in these words would be of relevance to Singapore

as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to education, I am glad to note that the

Government  is putting the highest emphasis on  education  as

evidenced by the fact that the Ministry of Education has  the

highest concentration of Minister and Ministers of State.  It

has put together many programmes of improvement in curriculum

and  facilities,  teaching,  training  and  recruitment.  For

instance,  we  are  aware  of the  PRIME  programme  for  the

rebuilding  and  refurbishing of  schools.  The  Ministry  is

allocating budget by providing one PC for every two  students

in our schools, one of the highest, if not, the highest ratio

in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also realises that IT will be the key

technology  that  will ensure whether a  nation  would  forge

ahead in the future or not. The Government is taking all  the

right  steps  such  as  the  formation  of  the  Ministry  of

Communications   and   Information   Technology    and    the

establishment  of  IT infrastructure like cable  network  and

broadband  network like Singapore One.  I think we  have  put

all the pieces in place.  As Dr Tan Boon Wan pointed out, the

key thing is how to inculcate creativity in our young people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of knowledge workers where creativity of

people  is  a  key  focus of our education programme,  it  is

absurd  that  the NCMP yesterday asserted in his speech  that

this Government is trying to stay in power by instilling fear

in the people. He quoted extensively from one Ian Buruma that

Singaporeans  cannot  think  or  are  afraid  to  think   for

themselves  as if Mr Buruma is an expert on how  Singaporeans

feel  and  think about our country.  Perhaps, we  should  ask

ourselves:   who  is this Mr Ian Buruma?   I  looked  up  the

Internet  and found out that Mr Buruma is a freelance  author

and  journalist,  one time Resident Scholar  at  the  Woodrow

Wilson  International Center for Scholars.  He is a  frequent

contributor to the New York Times Review of Books. He is said

to  have very sharp critical faculties and is described as  a

critic par excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP presumably also did the same search and found

this one critic whose opinions are in resonance with his  own

prejudices and he holds up the words of this critic as gospel

truth.  My regret is that he did not consider the opinions of

the   hundreds,   if  not,  thousands  of  Singaporeans   who

participated  actively in the various Feedback Unit  dialogue

sessions,  surveys  and also in the S21 discussions.   May  I

remind  the NCMP that Mr Buruma is a columnist who makes  his

living  writing  provocative articles.  I  do  not  think  Mr

Buruma  has ever even managed a company, let alone a  nation.

Actually,  we can get a measure of Mr Buruma and  his  biases

from  the title he gave to a review of the book The Singapore

History  - Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew.  And that title  is  "The

man  who would be king" to describe Mr Lee Kuan Yew.  I think

it is very provocative for Mr Buruma to do so. In this House,

I  think no one would agree that the word "King" can be  used

to describe a political leader like Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a leader

who,  at the peak of his power, arranged for the transfer  of

that  power to his successor, our Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok

Tong.  And no one could deny that when the PAP holds absolute

majority  in Parliament for so many years that the democratic

institutions in Singapore are left intact.  So, may

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>

I  suggest  to  the NCMP that Mr Buruma adopt  a  provocative

stance to gain a higher profile  -  in fact, this is the  way

he  makes  a living  -  and the NCMP, in his desperation  for

some justification for support, swallows the story line, hook

and sinker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have a copy of the review here. I took it

from  the  Internet  and printed it.  In fact,  if  you  read

through the review, you will discover that the NCMP's  speech

is, by and large, Mr Buruma's speech but in a different form.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP talked about Mr Lee Kuan Yew preferring to rule

by  fear  and popular support is not one of his  style.   And

that  very sentence is in this Buruma's review and  I  quote,

"Courting popularity never was Lee's style.  He preferred  to

be feared."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further down the article, you will find that - the

NCMP also said so directly  -  in the concluding remark,  for

instance, the various biases, "To call that "Asian values" is

an  insult  to the rest of Asia."  It is in the same  article

and reproduced from the review written by Buruma.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the reference to the Memoirs of a Mendicant

Professor  could also be found in exactly the  same  article.

In  fact, in the scholarly circle, taking major extracts from

other  people's reviews or articles can be called plagiarism.

So,  it  is regrettable that the NCMP does not have  a  fresh

look  and original ideas but to take someone else's articles,

couch  it  and come to Parliament to put it out  as  his  own

ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I have touched upon

several trends with major impact on our nation in the next 10-20  years.   The  problems we face are  difficult  ones  that

require  in-depth  analysis and effective  implementation  of

strategies.  I am gratified that this Government is cognizant

of the trends and is adjusting our policies to respond to it.

And  the new focus on the people to deal with the future that

has  already  happened is the right  way  to  do  so.   I  am

confident  that under the able leadership of our  Government,

Singapore will continue to achieve its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>

goals and to bring a better life to all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I would like to support the motion

standing in the name of Mr Davinder Singh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the motion to thank the President for his Address  to

this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the points made in the President's Address are

points which I, as a trade unionist, can identify with.  Some

of  these points could even sound like issues which unionists

raise  with  our employers.  Examples of these  are  treating

people as a valuable asset, developing and motivating them to

reach  their  full potential, enabling them to contribute  to

their  full  potential, putting people first  and  take  into

account people issues when making decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a unionist, I can only feel happy with the focus

given to people in the President's Address.  Two things  that

struck  me  most  was  a  call  for  active  citizenship  and

heartware.   In  the  industrial relations  language,  active

citizenship  is participation and involvement.  Heartware  is

emotional bonding by increasing commitment.  For companies to

be  high  performing  enterprises,  the  involvement  of  all

workers  is  necessary.  The old divide between thinkers  and

doers  is  no longer relevant in the knowledge economy.   All

workers have to be thinkers.  For Singapore as a nation to be

a  high  performing  economy, it  is  necessary  to  get  the

commitment and involvement of all citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to share some thoughts on this active

citizenship and heartware.  Active citizenship is more than a

reaction to demands for a greater say in the matters  of  the

State from some quarters of our society.  A knowledge economy

in  the  face  of  globalisation  and  increased  commitment,

coupled  with technological and social changes, requires  the

active contribution of all players.  I acknowledge that there

is  some  form  of consultation and involvement in  Singapore

through the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>

Feedback  Unit,  grassroots  organisations  and  the  various

committees formed like the Singapore 21, Manpower 21,  IT  21

and  so  on.   However, we must do more  as  there  are  many

benefits  from  active citizenship.  There is an  educational

value   in  active  citizenship.   Our  citizens,  by  asking

questions and getting answers from these questions as well as

reacting  to  feedback, will learn more of  the  issues  that

affect  them as citizens.  By participating, the  consent  of

citizens  is  gained  together  with  their  commitment   for

policies and actions that affect the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to recognise that the abilities and outlooks of

our citizens will differ.  Some of us may not be academically

bright. Some may be physically impaired.  Others may  not  be

interested in participating in political debate.  Yet  others

may only want to work at grassroots level.  Yet, they are all

our citizens with rights and responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaders can also learn more about the feelings,

concerns,  aspirations  and  thinking  of  the  people.    By

listening  to citizens and taking their views seriously,  the

leadership will be harnessing the creativity and knowledge of

all  sectors  of  our population.  Knowledge  cannot  be  the

monopoly  of  a few individuals.  The collective contribution

of many will result in better decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why I support active citizenship is that

it  allows  for changes to take place in an orderly  fashion.

Drastic change is painful and can be avoided if change can be

made gradually with the support of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect of this participation is that

it  will  result in improving the quality of  lives.   People

will  have  a  sense of fulfilment in so far  that  they  can

contribute ideas, suggestions and even criticisms to  make  a

difference.   It  is  empowerment.   It  is  taking   greater

responsibility   for   matters   affecting   them.     Active

citizenship has to be taught and understood by all  to  yield

maximum benefit.  If not applied and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>

understood  well,  it could affect our social  cohesion.   It

would   be   spending  more  time  and  energy  talking   and

quarrelling rather than moving forward.  We must realise that

active citizenship goes beyond politics and we will therefore

have  to  build  up institutions that can contribute  towards

active  citizenship.  These institutions should be membership

based,    people   focused   organisations,   trade   unions,

cooperatives,  voluntary welfare organisations and  self-help

groups.   They  will build up strong institutions  for  civil

society and strengthen democractic institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions and cooperatives can contribute immensely

towards  achieving  this  vision of  active  citizenship  and

building   up  heartware.   Trade  unions  promote  workplace

democracy.   The  ordinary  worker  can  influence   outcomes

through his union.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address has acknowledged the

contribution of unions.  I am also glad that the Ministry  of

Manpower  lists  strengthening  partnership  as  one  of  its

important strategies for Manpower 21.  Partnership  can  only

be strengthened if partners are effective to play their part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both employers and Government have acknowledged the role

workers and their unions have played in helping Singapore get

out of the economic crisis.  An important aspect of heartware

is  keeping  faith and building trust.  It is  therefore  not

only  important to restore to workers the CPF cut as  quickly

as possible according to the ability of the economy to afford

it,  but  also to take steps to strengthen unions and  reward

workers.  The best reward the Government can give to  workers

is to ensure that there is not only full employment but there

are  good paying jobs for which workers are able and  willing

to  take on.  Unions can be supported by making it easier for

them to organise workers and form unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should not go against unions' organising

efforts.  If they are not prepared to support unions  openly,

they  should at least remain neutral without working  against

unions.  Our current laws

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>

need  to be reviewed for unions to organise workers based  on

the  new  evolving employment relationships of the  knowledge

economy   which  sometimes   are  different  from   the   old

industrial age definitions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tripartism has been a positive factor in getting us out

of  the  recession.   It  is  one  of  our  most  competitive

advantage.   It should not be devalued.  It should  be  built

on.   Employers  should  be actively  encouraged  to  promote

bipartism at the enterprise level to reinforce tripartism  at

the national level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperatives are commercial organisations formed by

citizens to address both commercial and social needs.  During

the  last economic crisis, they played an important  role  in

stabilising  prices  and helping the  lower  income.   As  we

promote  local enterprises, cooperatives should also  benefit

from  the  many schemes in place for small and  medium  sized

enterprises.   They  have  added  value  to   the   life   of

Singaporeans and they must therefore be supported to do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I must emphasise that the role of the

Government must be that of an enabler, for citizens  to  take

more   responsibilities  for  themselves   and   the   State.

Government must help institutions that can bring about active

citizenship,  and come out to be more tolerant  of  differing

ideas and views.  With this in place, the people of Singapore

can   thus  be  active  citizens  that  can  build  upon  our

achievements.  We must not deflect from the mission of giving

our citizens a better life.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

President  has  outlined the Government's initiatives,  plans

and  programmes for our citizens in the new millennium.   The

Government  has  been  careful and purposeful  in  forging  a

national  consensus  on  the changes needed  to  improve  the

quality of life of Singaporeans in the years ahead.  However,

the  Government cannot do it alone.  It requires the  support

and  participation of every Singaporean to achieve the  goals

envisioned  for Singapore as we march onwards into  the  21st

century.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is fitting that the focus is on our people and

their  development.   We have reached  a  stage  of  economic

growth  and development that our people no longer  just  look

for  material  success.   They are interested  in  where  our

society  is heading, national and parochial issues  affecting

the neighbourhood and community, and relationships with other

countries.  Many are also spending time appreciating  culture

and  the  arts.  With growing affluence, it is not surprising

for people to reflect on the meaning, value and priorities of

life and seeking peace and joy in the spiritual realm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yet we cannot afford to relax and be content with

the status quo.  We have to be proactive in responding to the

challenges  of  a  knowledge-based  economy.   With  a  small

domestic  market, our companies have to counter  the  threats

and  to seize whatever opportunities offered by globalisation

and  technological advancement to bring Singapore to the next

level   of   economic   development.    With   more   intense

competition,  it  would be an uphill  task  to  attract  more

foreign  investments  and trade to Singapore.   Creating  new

employment  opportunities and enabling those already  working

to keep their jobs are areas that require the close attention

and  collaborative  efforts of Government,  employers,  trade

unions and individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to thrive and prosper in a knowledge-based

economy  lies  in  the  skills, competencies,  ingenuity  and

values  possessed by our people.  "Intellectual capital"  and

"weightless  economy" relate to using talent and brain  power

to  create wealth through creative design and innovation.  We

plan  the  long term by preparing and equipping our young  to

face  the  new  competitive working and business  environment

with confidence and optimism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where our teachers and schools can make a

significant  contribution.  Though the Ministry of  Education

does not think it necessary to make education compulsory,  it

is still important for us to send the right strong signals to

all parents on the desirability of sending their children  to

school.  We need to understand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>

why some parents are depriving their children the opportunity

for  education and to take appropriate steps to  correct  the

parents  for the sake of their children.  We must make  every

effort  to ensure that all children receive proper education,

otherwise our society will suffer the long-term economic  and

social  repercussions if thousands of children each  year  do

not attend or drop out from school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are living lives. This means Singaporeans

have  many more years to remain economically active.   It  is

therefore  essential that our schools lay a firm  and  strong

foundation to imbibe the values and learning abilities to our

children   so  that  when  they  grow  up  they  can   become

independent learners and go through life being able  to  look

after themselves and their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPC for Education is pleased with the initiative

taken  by  the  Ministry of Education (MOE) to fine-tune  and

improve  the  school ranking system.  We wish to commend  MOE

for adopting the quality assurance approach, normally used in

private sector organisations, in the School Excellence Model.

This  is  another way to persuade schools not to  concentrate

only  on academic results.  It shows that the MOE is prepared

to  acknowledge  efforts  to  cultivate  values  in  schools.

Schools  are no longer penalised for any slip in ranking  nor

should they be afraid to admit students who are strong in non-academic subjects like sports, music and arts.  If we want to

achieve  the Desired Outcomes of Education, it is only  right

that we focus on education as a whole and view the school  as

a  system.   Our teachers and schools have the confidence  to

assess their own performance and will work towards continuous

improvements  to  achieve  the  targets  they  have  set  for

themselves and for the students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to support the ability-driven approach taken in

education  to  tailor to the different needs of every  child.

Instruction  should invariably take into account the  child's

individuality and his mental and physical development.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>

Children  develop at different rates in different  areas  and

should always be treated as unique individuals. On the whole,

about 80% of each cohort are able to adapt and cope with  the

standard  curriculum requirements.  As for the remaining  20%

or  roughly 8,000 students, we should pay close attention and

devote needed resources to develop them into good and capable

assets.   It is important for us to strike a balance  in  the

curriculum.  Though science and technology are important,  we

should   not  neglect  the  other  aspects  like  creativity,

history,  geography, literature, moral and  civic  education.

Our  students  are generally strong in the  contents  of  the

syllabus  but lack general knowledge.  We should develop  our

students  as  well rounded individuals who are the  pride  of

their families and country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are overseas countries whose tendency is to

overhaul and make the quantum leap in education with dramatic

effect  rather than introduce gradual incremental changes  to

improve  and  strengthen the education system.  By  overdoing

this,  there is the danger of doing irreparable harm  to  the

education system.  Once broken, it would take many  years  to

make  the  education system right again.    A  generation  of

students would have lost out in the process.  This, we should

avoid  in  Singapore,  as we make changes  to  our  education

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our schools are provided with an integrated IT

infrastructure and the school syllabuses use  IT  widely,  we

need  to  be mindful of the importance of character  building

and  values education.  We have to counter the adverse effect

of  IT on social interaction.  We do not wish our children to

be   lacking  in  social  skills  or  face  difficulties   in

interpersonal  human relationships.  Computers  can  be  fun,

exciting  and  absorbing but doubts have been  raised  as  to

whether  real  learning takes place.   We  should  avoid  the

pitfalls  asserted  by Clifford Stoll in his  book,  `Silicon

Snake Oil'. Stoll wrote, and I quote:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children love computer classes because they do not have

to  think for an hour, teachers love them because . they (do)

not  have  to teach and parents love them because it  (shows)

their schools (are) high tech.  But no learning happens."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

Our children should be taught to master IT but not become its

victims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been following the press reports on the

controversies afflicting Chinese High School.  It is sad  and

disappointing that the Board of Directors of the Chinese High

School  Association could not resolve their differences.   It

requires   the  Ministry  to  intervene  by  appointing   the

Committee  of Management to take over the management  of  the

school.   The  principal,  teachers, parents,  community  and

alumni  association  all  have critical  roles  to  play  and

significant  contributions  to make,  acting  in  the  larger

interest of the school and the students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the public have criticised the MOE's

stand  against the involvement of students on the  matter  of

the retirement of the principal.  I wish to support the stand

taken by the Ministry.  It is amazing how some people can  be

misled  into  believing  that  because  we  want  to  develop

thinking students, our 12 to 15 years old students should  be

allowed to involve themselves on staff matters.  It is almost

like suggesting that our young and impressionable students be

allowed  to  join  the  picket line in  employment  disputes.

Singaporeans must learn to draw the line between what can and

cannot be allowed to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must develop stronger mechanisms to involve the

parents  in  the nurturing and development of  their  school-going  children.   More  and  more,  we  are  seeing  parents

delegating and even relegating the responsibility of bringing

up   their   children  to  the  schools.   School  programmes

involving   parents  on  a  regular  basis   should   feature

prominently in the school calendar of activities.  Over  time

rapport  and  mutual  understanding  will  develop,  and  our

children will be happy enjoying the warmth and affection both

at  home  and in school.  Our students will learn and  behave

better in this favourable psychological environment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no doubt that our school children have never had

it  so  good.   An  area  that now needs  addressing  is  the

continuing  education of working and job-seeking  adults  who

left  school  many years ago.   We should revive  the  active

programme   of  adult  education  and  continuing  education.

Though employers and companies should train and develop their

employees, many adults should be encouraged to learn on their

own.   We should increase substantially the number of  places

in  the  continuing education programmes of our  universities

and  polytechnics offering degree and diploma  courses  on  a

part-time  basis.   Access to educational  opportunities  for

adults  holds the key if we are to develop a learning culture

in  Singapore.   National  resources  devoted  to  constantly

improving the performance and competencies of our people will

bring immeasurable benefits to the individuals, families  and

the  country as a whole.  I hope the Government will  provide

more funding, facilities and teaching resources on continuing

education programmes for our adult population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our people grow and mature, Singapore will be well on

its way to become a more gracious and compassionate society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the motion standing in the name of the Member  for

Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move into the new millennium, it is apt that we

should  develop  a  vision  for  Singapore  that  focuses  on

developing  our  people.   For the past  34  years,  we  have

focused  our resources ostensibly more on the development  of

the  physical infrastructure.  We have built up  one  of  the

finest  road  systems, ports, airports, housing estates,  and

information  technology  infrastructure,  to  name   a   few.

Indeed,  any foreigner coming to Singapore will not  fail  to

notice  the  tremendous progress that this country  has  made

since independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the house is put in order, one would suppose the

more  challenging issue is how do we turn this house  into  a

home.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us in Parliament, I believe our bigger challenge in

the  new  millennium is to build a greater sense of belonging

and of being rooted amongst Singaporeans for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indeed we begin to ask this question, the starting

point  I  believe for the discussion lies in the question  of

how  we strengthen the sense of belonging to this place.  The

key really lies in the strengthening of community bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, we understand that the Singapore 21

vision  is  meant to develop our people into a more  cohesive

society for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can possibly redefine the strategy into two broad

areas.   The  first is a focus on the individual Singaporean,

and  the second being, the Singaporean as a member of a wider

community.  I  believe that the outcome of our work in  these

two  areas will to some extent have an impact on the people's

sense of being rooted in and belonging to Singapore.



<br><br><i>The Singaporean as an individual</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to know that our Government is not

sparing  any  effort  in  preparing the  next  generation  of

Singaporeans  for the knowledge-based economy.  Towards  this

end, I note the Education Ministry is adopting a new approach

in education that is ability driven and tailored to the needs

of  every  child.   It is also heartening to  note  that  the

Government  is trying to redefine the meaning of  success  to

include a wider range of skills such as the arts and sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that every child is created differently.

Some are more artistically inclined while others are more  at

home  with scientific research and mathematical calculations.

It  is unfortunate that in the early days of our development,

we  had no choice but to place a high priority  and a premium

on those skills that are better able to help us contribute to

the  development  of  our economy.  Accordingly,  we  had  to

produce the engineers, the scientists and the bureaucrats  to

meet the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>

needs  of our country.  The arts and the sports, in the order

of  things, were given relatively less emphasis.  Those  with

abilities in the arts and the sports may not have been  given

as  much  recognition as they deserve.  As a consequence,  we

have  either lost these sons and daughters to faraway  places

or  we have not provided a conducive environment for them  to

develop  their  talents  further.  Hopefully,  with  the  new

emphasis,  we  should be able to address  the  difference  in

recognition.  Those who are artistically inclined  and  those

with sporting talents can now have much hope in getting their

hard work and success more widely recognised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is, if we want to recognise the

potential  value of every Singaporean and want  to  encourage

them  to  develop  every talent that they  have  further,  we

should  not just confine our recognition of success  to  just

academic achievements, the sports and the arts.  The issue in

this  is not whether we should widen the scope of success  to

recognise   such   skills,  but  rather  in   extending   our

recognition  of what constitutes success, are we  encouraging

Singaporeans  to  constantly  devote  themselves   to   their

interests and undertakings in order to excel in what they do.

Sir,  excellence is a relative term and must be seen  in  the

context  of  what  is  achieved.  For  example,  in  our  new

definition  of  success,  do  we  give  recognition  to   the

handicapped child who surmounted his handicap to complete his

education  in  a  normal  manner, even  though  his  academic

achievements  may not be as remarkable as the  top  achiever?

By  all  accounts,  one  would surely not  deny  the  child's

efforts  are an enduring testimony of endeavour and  courage.

And for this reason, it should be sufficient for our purposes

to  qualify  the child to be held up as a model of excellence

and success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as part of the people development programme,

we  recognise that we must go beyond using knowledge  created

by others by creating new knowledge ourselves.  This approach

has  deep  implication in the way our society  develops.   To

create  new  knowledge, one must expect  Singaporeans  to  be

inquisitive and creative.  To be creative and to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>

expand  the  frontier of knowledge, one must be  prepared  to

question basic assumptions and, if need be, to slaughter some

sacred  cows.  It is only by being able to accept changes  to

our basic assumptions that society can find progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we progress to the new millennium, we must be

prepared  to  move away from our mindset and be  prepared  to

change  and  perhaps  give up some of our  own  values.   The

values  that have served us well may not necessarily  be  the

same  values  that will serve our interests for  the  future.

The  question  is, are we prepared to change with  time,  and

change more radically, if necessary?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is right that we should speak of lifelong

learning and of continual training of our workers to  prepare

them  for  the  demands  of changing technology  in  the  new

millennium.   Continual training will constantly upgrade  our

workers' productivity and skills and, in turn, allow them  to

earn  a higher margin of wages and improve their quality  and

standard  of  living.   As  we  restructure  our  economy  by

emphasising  on higher valued-added products in manufacturing

and services, it is important that our workers continue to be

retrained  and re-tooled themselves to prepare them  for  the

challenges ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of training and retraining is especially

important  for  workers  who  have  been  retrenched  in  the

industry.   For those who have been retrenched, we send  them

for  courses  and training in order that they,  after  having

found  new  skills, can then be re-employed in the  industry,

thus  allowing  them the opportunity to continue  with  their

work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, for many of these older workers, a

lack  of skills that is solved by education and training,  is

only  part  of  the  problem.  For many, their  age  and  the

relatively  higher  salary  that  they  command   make   them

unemployable.   What can we do to ensure that  these  workers

who  have  gone for training are given employment?   At  this

moment,  we  recognise  that there is  some  tension  between

leaving  employment  entirely to  market  forces  and  having

employment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>

regulated to a greater extent by legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is that there are many older

workers  who  have  been retrenched, and  having  spent  time

acquiring  new  skills, are still having  difficulty  finding

jobs.   Will  the  Government be prepared to consider,  aside

from the present scheme of helping them find jobs through  an

exchange  run  by the Manpower Ministry, more initiatives  in

getting these retrenched older workers back to the workforce?



<br><br><i>The Singaporean as a member of a wider community</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Speech touches on the fact that it is

not enough for Singaporeans to be individually talented.  Our

drive towards making Singapore a better society depends  very

much  on  getting Singaporeans to vote together and having  a

common  sense of commitment to Singapore and to one  another.

Here we speak of the Singapore "heartware".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that social bonding and cohesion is an

essential ingredient for the long-term survival of Singapore.

In   order  for  Singaporeans  to  have  one  heartbeat   for

Singapore,  it is important that we continue to emphasise  to

all  Singaporeans that they, irrespective of  colour,  creed,

age or gender, will always have a place in this country.  Our

policy statements must therefore be sensitive to not creating

artificial  distinctions  within society  that  unnecessarily

stratify  people according to categories.  We  divide  people

into  the Normal and Express stream students, the gifted  and

non-gifted  students, the EM1 and EM2 students, the  overseas

scholars and local scholars; or for that matter, the  scholar

class as opposed to the non-scholar class; and more recently,

the  distinction between foreign talents and  local  talents,

and,  of course, the cosmopolitans and the heartlanders.   If

one  thinks  about it, it is essentially these categories  of

distinction  that divide people into being  more  capable  as

opposed to being less capable.  How will this division,  Sir,

help  with the bonding process that we are all trying so hard

to create?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the reality of inequality in life is a fact that

we  must  all  recognise and live with, it is another  to  be

typecast  and  to  be  constantly told, whether  directly  or

indirectly, that one is less capable than the other.   I  can

understand  and appreciate the circumstances in  which  these

distinctions have emerged.  However, we must be mindful  that

in  harping on this subject, we may lead to a situation of  a

deep  divide  within our society.  This would  surely  put  a

strain on our social cohesion rather than reinforce it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should perhaps give more emphasis to the principle

that  for  those  who are more capable, the rewards  will  be

there  for  them, and more is expected of them to  serve  our

society.  For those who are not as capable, they will  always

be  a  part of Singapore, and be made to feel that  they  are

just as wanted and appreciated for what they have contributed

towards  the making of this country.  Here, I like  the  idea

that  we  should  have more emphasis on bonding  between  the

successful Singaporeans and those who have not done as  well.

We  must  not  envy  or  begrudge those who  have  succeeded.

However, every Singaporean has a given right to share in  the

country's  success.   Equally, those who contribute  more  on

taxes  must  not  begrudge  the  various  schemes  aimed   at

improving  the  lot of the not so fortunate.  After  all,  we

must  remember  that it is our duty to look  after  the  less

fortunate in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we speak of an active citizenship under the

Singapore 21 vision that envisages more avenues for  citizens

to  participate in the nation's affairs, in order to  tap  on

the widest range of views.  My colleague, Mr Thomas, has also

touched  on  this issue earlier.  We want to be able  to  get

citizens to participate in the building of Singapore, and  to

get them to contribute ideas so that they can understand what

is  at  stake.  In law, we have this maxim that justice  must

not  only  be  done,  but  must be seen  to  be  done.   This

principle  applies  equally  well  in  our  desire  to   want

participation of our people in the policy-making process.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Feedback Unit and the regular dialogue

sessions with our grassroots leaders.  Many people have often

wondered  how  much of the feedback that is  given  has  been

taken into consideration in the formulation of policies.   No

doubt,  there is certain feedback which has translated itself

into changes in policies and legislation.  On the other hand,

there has also been numerous feedback that has been perceived

to  have  been  ignored.  Perhaps more can be  done  in  this

regard  to  convince the people that their  views  are  taken

seriously.  As a simple illustration, there are many Bills in

this  Parliament  that have been passed which  have  had  the

participation  of many concerned Members.  Yet,  despite  the

input  of  the Members, the Bills nonetheless are immediately

passed after the Second Reading.  In some cases, we have  had

assurances from the Government that subsequent amendments  to

the  Act  will take into account the feedback.   However,  in

some  other  cases, it did not appear that the  feedback  was

taken seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our focus on the development of people in this debate

touches on the issue of the kind of civil society we want  to

create  in  Singapore.  My learned colleague, the Member  for

Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, has asked pertinent questions  in  this

debate.   He  asked  whether  the  people  of  Singapore  are

prepared to take responsibility for their decisions  and  how

the  Government  can  send  clear signals  on  the  terms  of

participation from the citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many forces at work in society. While

some  may  like  to  argue  for more political  space  within

Singapore, I agree with my colleague that others may not feel

as  comfortable for the kind of space that is asked for,  and

we  would  be quite happy with the status quo.  To those  who

clamour for Singapore to be a better civil society, there  is

a   certain  presumption  that  this  is  what  the  rest  of

Singaporeans want.  The truth of the matter is that your  HDB

heartlander may not be so interested in these issues so  long

as  the  integrity of the Government of Singapore is  not  in

doubt and the people continue to enjoy a standard and quality

of life that is unparalleled anywhere in the world.  What

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>

makes this vocal minority think that they have a better right

to  impose  their  views  on the silent  majority?   We  must

recognise that the responsibility of the Government rests  in

balancing the various forces at work.  We must also  remember

that  a duly elected government has the mandate of the people

to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we accept that it is not always possible for the

Government to agree to every issue.  However, where there  is

indeed   a   constructive  attempt  being  made  to   improve

legislation or policies, the Government must be  seen  to  be

taking this effort more seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to extend my deepest appreciation

to  the  President for delivering the keynote Speech  of  the

Government.   No  doubt, the Speech is  meant  to  chart  the

course  of the Government in the coming years.  It  has  also

provided us a valuable opportunity to take stock of where  we

are coming from and where we are heading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Clarification with the

Member.   In  his speech he mentioned that civil society  may

not  be desirable for HDB heartlanders and the Government has

a duty to balance their interests.  I would like to know from

him,  in his view, how does civil society, as implied in  his

speech,   come   in  conflict  with  the  interest   of   HDB

heartlanders, if the Government decides that civil society is

desirable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I think central to the debate on civil

society  is  a  certain perception that a civil society  must

entail  certain values.  These values are to  some  extent  a

reflection  of  the kind of values that is  often  associated

with  the  more liberal society of the West; where  there  is

greater freedom of speech, greater civic participation, and a

more  liberal media.  These are the sorts of issues that  one

would  normally associate with a civil society.  Having  said

that, and this is consistent with the kind of debate that has

emerged in recent months, the sort of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>

ideas  that  go  into  a debate for civil  society  need  not

necessarily dovetail with the kind of interests that the  HDB

heartlanders may have.  And to that extent, therefore, it may

not  necessarily  be  the same kind of agenda  that  the  two

interest groups are pursuing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise in support of the motion  and  wish  to

express my thanks to the President for his Speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come across many Singaporeans who, like Mr Chiam

See  Tong, think that the President's Speech does not contain

anything  new  in  terms  of  the  Government's  visions  and

policies for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I do not expect anything new nor do I think

there  should be one.  Indeed, the economic crisis has served

to adequately remind us that our current policies with regard

to  managing the economy, responsiveness to changes, openness

and transparency of information, being pragmatic and ready to

take  the pain and involving our best and brightest, both  in

the Government and private sector, remain relevant now and in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps what is quite less understood by many

Singaporeans is the fact that the changes made to the banking

and   financial  sector,  recommendations  contained  in  the

Committee  on  Singapore's  Competitiveness  and  policy   on

foreign talent, are by any measure a major transformation and

reformation of our economy and society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that this was implemented without any

accompanying  violent protest and political instability  that

have rocked our neighbours does not make it less exciting  or

significant.   Many have lost their jobs, suffered  wage  and

CPF  cuts.   Small  and medium enterprises continue  to  face

severe challenges posed by a variety of global pressures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one visible aspect during the economic crisis

has been the important role the private sector has played  in

tandem with the Government through

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>

the various committees to draw up plans to get us out of this

crisis.   To  the Singaporeans at large, they have  witnessed

how  collective  efforts of both the Government  and  private

sector  have brought about the desired results during one  of

the most serious crisis experienced by Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, allow me to respond to the two main

issues that were discussed, ie, active citizenship and social

cohesion.   It  is  a great day for me as a member  of  civil

society to listen to Members of the House speaking in support

of  active citizenship.  This alone demonstrates how  far  we

have  progressed  in  terms of developing  an  active  people

sector.   This  is  a strong endorsement to the  many  people

working  in  civil societies.   Let me remind the House  that

civil society is not a western concept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there remain many challenges to overcome and I

would like to highlight a few of them:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is changing mindset. In the past, it is quite

common  to  hear  of civil societies being  categorised  into

social  workers and armchair critics and social  commentators

who are frequently challenged for the lack of involvement  in

social  and charitable activities.  It is as if one  must  be

involved in charitable activities before being considered  as

doing something for society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is clear that the ultimate objective is for the

best  and ablest in the society to help the less able through

volunteerism, members of civil society are usually  initially

driven  at  least  by  enthusiasm, passion,  spontaneity  and

idealism.   Quite  often,  it starts with  them  articulating

their  views as many feel the need to contribute in terms  of

ideas   and  feedback.   The  more  accessible  communication

channels today make it more convenient for many to make their

first  start  by contributing ideas.  The more  involved  and

committed  -  perhaps  prompted  into  action  -  would  then

participate as members of the various organisations that best

suit them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is a need to change the mindset and to

view  these people, not as irritating commentators to  policy

makers,  but perhaps as a growing and untapped pool of  young

idealistic citizens who can play a part in our common goal to

help improve society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help change this mindset, we can do a number of

simple things:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) have civil servants, employees of statutory boards

and  Government  corporations to be more  involved  in  civil

society so that they can have a better appreciation of  civil

society  and  perhaps become civil society's active  citizens

themselves.    Quite  frequently,  the  problems   of   civil

societies   are  at  the  operational  level   -   with   the

bureaucracy;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) have Government agencies involving relevant civil

societies to participate in the various activities and to  be

invited  to  some  of the relevant functions  organised.   Of

course,  civil societies too must reciprocate  but  here  the

common complaint is usually the unenthusiastic response  from

Government agencies;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) civil societies themselves should start by not

excluding  other  organisations like the CDCs  and  self-help

groups  and  many  other agencies as not being  part  of  the

larger  family of civil society.  We should not differentiate

the Government sponsored civil society and independent groups

as,  ultimately,  they  both serve  a  common  goal  for  our

society; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam talked about the fear that

Singaporeans  have  in  involving themselves  in  debate  and

public  discussions.   First, it  must  be  clear  to  anyone

intending  to venture into public discussions to be  prepared

to  be intellectually challenged, even robustly.  This is  to

be  expected.  However, I do sense that some of  the  replies

from  the Government may be a bit too personal which may tend

to discourage public discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I would say that being thick-skinned

must  certainly  be  one  of the necessary  prerequisites  of

anyone intending to engage in public debate.  For

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>

those who feel personally slighted or rebuked, I have this to

say  to them, "Don't Quit" because this country was not built

by quitters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, is for the Government agencies to use the strength

and  not  weaknesses of civil societies.  Quite often,  civil

societies  are bogged down by fund-raising activities.   Lack

of   financial  and  administrative  resources   are   common

complaints  of  civil  societies.   This  is  where   greater

collaboration  between Government agencies and civil  society

can  be  more  effective to tap their enthusiasm, commitment,

network and not rely on their weaknesses for fund raising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, globalisation. Like anything else, civil

societies  too  are  affected  by  internationalisation   and

globalisation.  Their values on society and environment,  for

example,  are  no  longer domestic or  national  issues.   It

transcends  geographical  boundaries.   Increasingly,   civil

societies  will  find  more  things  in  common  with   civil

societies in other countries.  There will be greater need for

joint  collaboration and mutual assistance.   This  is  where

civil  societies  in  Singapore are  sometimes  unnecessarily

disadvantaged  as many exercise self restraint  in  obtaining

assistance of financial help from other institutions overseas

as they may be perceived to be promoting a foreign agenda or,

worse   still,   become   elements   of   other   undesirable

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to recognise that working with foreign

organisations  is  going to be part and parcel  of  a  larger

civil   society  as  we  become  part  of  a  global  family.

Therefore, we must not only be prepared to learn from  others

but also become active contributors ourselves to other causes

in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I would like to respond to the very

encouraging  gestures that Simon Tay  and  I  would  like  to

undertake   a  study  on  "Civil  Society  in  21st   Century

Singapore".  This, in our view, is an indication of how civil

society  can  proceed  and  progress  beyond  discussion  and

debate.  The report would address on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>

potential contribution and personal limitation and challenges

facing Singapore's young civil society.  The issues that  our

report  would address include the registration of  societies,

limits  on  speech, assembly and association,  especially  in

public,  and  the role of private foundations and  Government

agencies  in  supporting  civil society  organisations.   The

report  would  also look at civil society in Singapore  in  a

broader regional and international context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to quote from Judith Shklar an extract

from the National Standards for Civics and Government:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Active citizens . are public meeting-goers and joiners

of  voluntary  organisations who discuss and deliberate  with

others about the policies that will affect them and who serve

their  country not only as taxpayers and occasional soldiers,

but  by  having a considered notion of the public  good  that

they  genuinely  take  to  heart.   The  good  citizen  is  a

patriot."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to touch on another issue of

social  cohesion.  I am prompted today to include  these  two

issues  in  view  of the recent incident  which  in  my  view

demonstrates the fragility of a social cohesion and that each

and  every  Singaporean has a part to play  to  preserve  and

enhance social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent Mendaki-MUIS Tea Party to congratulate

Malay-Muslim graduates from higher institutions last week,  I

was  seated  with four young Malay graduates,  whom  I  later

discovered,  two of whom will be going for further  education

overseas.  I was delighted to find out that all four of  them

told me their families no longer depend on them for financial

contribution.   This  demonstrates how far  sections  of  the

Malay-Muslim society have progressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I asked them what would be the most

difficult  problem  they would face when they  enter  working

life,  they remarked that the perception others have of  them

would  be  the  greatest obstacle they would  face  and  they

expressed   concern  that  they  may  not  be   given   equal

opportunities  by employers.  If the best and ablest  of  our

society  and those who have profited and benefited  from  our

system  feel pessimistic, I wonder how less successful Malay-Muslims feel.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another occasion, as a member of the Work Group on

KBE,  initiated by the Malay PAP MPs, we met  two  groups  of

bankers   separately:  one,  Malay-Muslim  workers   in   the

financial sector and, two, representatives of major banks who

coincidentally  are  all Chinese.  Our  discussions  revealed

wide differences of perceptions one has of the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are no small matters which cannot be resolved

overnight but efforts must be taken quickly as part of a long

and  permanent process of bridging these perceptions.  For  a

start,  I  have asked these bankers whether they are prepared

to  help Malay-Muslims in the financial sector to improve and

upgrade  themselves  as the community  is  short  of  skilled

expertise and resources to face the challenges of KBE.   They

are quite happy to help knowing that their efforts will go  a

long  way  towards bridging these perceptions.  I must  thank

them for their willingness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Malay-Muslims too need to be more

relevant  on  national and international issues and  be  more

actively   involved   in   the   various   social   community

organisations  outside  the  Malay-Muslim  community.   Malay

values  of  gotong-royong must be extended to  include  other

Singaporeans.   I  personally know of many organisations  who

are  desperately  looking for Malay-Muslim  members.   Malay-Muslims must and need to respond to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to touch on the issue of Malays in

the  SAF which was touched upon by the Member for Cheng  San.

First,  let  me say that the Senior Minister's comments  came

from  his  personal  experience.   More  significantly,   our

geography makes this issue a relevant and permanent one.   In

my  view,  the reaction of the community is good  because  it

indicates  that  Malays  care about what  other  Singaporeans

think  of  them.   It  would  be worse  if  Malays  have  not

responded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the only way to change perception is for Malays

themselves,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>

especially those in the SAF, to continue to demonstrate their

commitment  through working with other Singaporeans,  earning

mutual respect and trust of fellow soldiers and Singaporeans.

Beyond rhetoric, we need to demonstrate good deeds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must caution that it would be unwise for anyone to

think  that this can be solved through one dialogue  session.

Anyone  is  free  to write and speak on this  issue  provided

racial  sensitivities are not breached.  While Malay  leaders

like Encik Othman Wok and Encik Rahmat Kenap have earned  the

trust  and confidence of the Senior Minister, I am sure there

are   many  other  younger  Malays  deserving  of   such   an

association.   Hopefully,  over  time,  many  more  will   be

identified.  Because only then can perception change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a young

nation  with  limited natural resources, Singapore  has  done

well  to  position  itself to be a world-class  city  in  the

world.  Over the last 34 years, the Singapore Government has,

through  careful  planning and prudent use of  public  funds,

developed   Singapore  into  a  modern  city  with  excellent

infrastructure  and  amenities. Today, Singaporeans  live  in

high quality housing, a clean and green environment and enjoy

a comfortable lifestyle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has also made its mark of excellence in the

global  market.  We are known in the world for  our  airline,

SIA; our seaport, PSA; our public housing programme, HDB; and

our  clean and green environment.  We have successfully built

a positive corporate image for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>

Singapore.  Today, many people are aware of the existence  of

Singapore. They know where Singapore is and what is Singapore

like.   But not many people understand Singaporeans  or  know

what is a Singaporean.  We have yet to develop a "brand name"

for  Singaporeans.  Instead, some  foreigners  have  negative

perceptions  of  Singaporeans such as  Singaporeans  are  not

allowed  to  chew chewing gum in Singapore; Singaporeans  are

fined  for  not flushing toilets; Singaporeans are  caned  or

jailed  for  any wrongdoing.  These perceptions always  cause

embarrassment  to many Singaporeans when they  meet  up  with

their foreign friends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read in the papers about the ugly Singaporean or

the kiasu Singaporeans who misbehave themselves and project a

bad  image  for  Singaporeans  especially  when  they  travel

overseas.  If such behaviours were to propagate, we would  be

embarrassed  to be called Singaporeans.  Thus,  there  is  an

urgent  need  to erase these negative images of  Singaporeans

and take action to develop a Singaporean identity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must nurture Singaporeans to be caring and

considerate  citizens of the world. More  efforts  should  be

channelled  to inject meaning into the lives of Singaporeans.

Singaporeans must learn to be more "human" in a fast-changing

and  materialistic  world.   We must  live  life  to  make  a

difference  to other people's life and that is  our  ultimate

goal of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the President's call for the Government

to focus on people.  This is a timely call for all Government

departments   to   pay   more  attention   to   Singaporeans.

Singaporeans need more attention and listening ears.   Today,

if  you  make a call to any Government department,  you  will

most likely be speaking to a voice-mail system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our drive to achieve higher productivity and save

manpower,  we  have  sometimes lost the human  touch  in  our

public services. Many Singaporeans are still not familiar  or

comfortable  to  use  the voice-mail  system,  and  thus  are

deprived of such public services.  Sir, I strongly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>

support  the  use  of technology to increase  efficiency  and

productivity  but technology should bring the  public  sector

closer to Singaporeans instead of alienating them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the public sector should take the lead, we must

also  understand the pace of change acceptable to the masses.

We  must synchronise the use of technology to meet the  needs

of Singaporeans.  In this way, the public sector will have  a

closer  rapport with the general public and would be able  to

serve them better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern which I would like to raise is the issue

of  heartlanders  and  cosmopolitans.   I  believe  that  all

Singaporeans should aim to be heartlanders and cosmopolitans.

We  must  upgrade and maximise our potentials to be a  global

knowledge  worker or entrepreneur and, at the same time,  our

hearts  must be with Singapore.  Singaporeans must strive  to

be global players, be they contractors, food court operators,

entrepreneurs,  professionals  or  service  providers.  Every

Singaporean stands a chance to be a global player  if  he  or

she  strives to achieve his or her best.  The Government must

play  a  more  creative and proactive role to facilitate  and

provide opportunities for Singaporeans to achieve this goal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want to achieve "One people, one nation and

one  Singapore", I agree with my colleague, Mr Sin Boon  Ann,

that  we must not classify or segment Singaporeans. This will

create  cracks in our society, thus hindering our efforts  to

strengthen  community  bond  and  nationhood.   We  must  set

realistic goals and hopes to motivate Singaporeans to achieve

greater heights in their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the S21 report has set out useful directions to

guide Singaporeans into the next millennium.  I would like to

highlight  one of its key pillars, namely, "Strong  families:

our  foundation and our future."  The need to develop  strong

families  must not be understated.  Strong families  are  the

foundation  for  healthy  lives  and  wholesome  communities.

Every  Singaporean must make every effort to keep our  family

strong and healthy.  Strong families

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>

will  provide  the  impetus to build a cohesive  society  and

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's fast-paced society, families are at risk of

disintegration.     Our    home    ownership    scheme    has

unintentionally  resulted  in  the  rapid  nuclearisation  of

families  in  Singapore.   This coupled  with  the  HDB  flat

allocation system has caused many families to be located  all

over  Singapore.  As a result, many Singaporeans  are  living

away  from  their parents, thus making it less convenient  to

visit  their  parents frequently.  Family  contact  time  has

reduced  drastically over the years, thus threatening  family

bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation will gradually erode family ties,

especially  among  siblings  and younger  families.   Without

strong family support, Singaporeans will find it difficult to

cope with the complexity of urban living in the next century.

Consequently,  some  may  seek  greener  pastures   elsewhere

resulting in a brain drain phenomenon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recently spoke to a young Singaporean who just

graduated from the United States. I asked him why he returned

to  Singapore  despite  the abundance  of  opportunities  and

excitement in the United States. His answer is simple.  It is

because  of his family.  His parents are migrants from  China

who  have  spent  their lives making a living  in  Singapore.

They have experienced hardship and seen the transformation of

Singapore  from poverty to its present state. They  are  true

heartlanders  of Singapore who have faith in  our  Government

and believe that their children will have a bright future  in

Singapore.   They  have  a  strong  sense  of  belonging   to

Singapore  and  make  concerted efforts  to  encourage  their

children to return home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not sure whether this young man's generation

will  have  the same sense of belonging to Singapore  as  his

parents.   Will younger generations of Singaporeans encourage

their children to stay in Singapore?  We need to address this

issue of rootedness of younger

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans.  We must help Singaporeans to develop pride  to

be Singaporeans and live in Singapore with their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore strives to be a world-class economy and a

world-class  home.  We must also strive to be  a  world-class

people.  This  is  a  challenge for both the  Government  and

Singaporeans in the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun A Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

thank  you for giving me the opportunity to speak in  support

of  the  motion moved by the Member for Bishan-Toa Payoh,  Mr

Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed, allow me to touch on a newspaper

article which somehow or rather belittles the Opening of  the

Second  Session of Parliament which was full of Parliamentary

tradition.   I  believe  that each one  of  us  has  his  own

weaknesses  but  what  is important is  the  content  of  our

speech.   We  depend  heavily on  journalists  to  assist  in

educating  and conveying the intent of our speeches  for  the

information of the general public.  We hope that this can  be

done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, coming back to the Presidential Speech, I

fully  support  the  decision to make  people  the  focus  of

Government policy.  Of course, there are cynics who criticise

this  effort. In fact, the voices of these cynics is a  great

concern  of  mine because it is a sign that  shows  that  our

society  is  still  far from its aim of  becoming  a  dynamic

society  that  does not focus on material  wealth  and  where

there are children who would no longer remember the deeds  of

their  parents  who have brought them up.  They  would  drive

away  the  parents from the homes or abandon them  without  a

place  of shelter.  If this trend continues, we will  have  a

society that would not know the meaning of responsibility and

a  society  that would forget its origins.   So  I  hope  the

values of courtesy should be the emphasis of our education in

schools right from primary to university levels.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the concept of active citizenship, which

is the idea of encouraging every citizen to shape his future,

it  is  a new phase for giving him a stake in the future,  as

mentioned  by  the President in his Speech.  Lately,  and  in

recent   years,   the   Government  has  introduced   various

programmes to enable every citizen to share in the prosperity

of  Singapore.  For example, the share ownership schemes, the

CPF  top-up scheme and the Medisave top-up scheme.  These are

efforts to give Singaporeans a stake in a concrete form  that

they  can  see.  But if Singaporeans only see  the  stake  in

material  terms,  I think it is a matter of concern  for  us,

compared with the policy of active citizenship.  It would  be

more  meaningful  if  every citizen is invited  to  share  in

determining our future.  We are all asked to offer our points

of  view as best as we can to make the Singapore 21 Vision  a

success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to touch on is the wider

definition of success which does not only involve success  in

academic  terms  but also in sports and the arts.  I  welcome

this change of mindset, because it will allow us not only  to

be  a  prosperous nation but also a gracious nation  that  we

hope for.  However, no matter how prosperous a country is, we

cannot  deny the presence of certain people who are not  able

to  share in the prosperity.  There will always be those  who

are  left out and those who struggle to keep up.  So, I would

encourage all Singaporeans to practise the concept  of  life-long  learning.  We know of the difficulties of the  workers,

especially  those 40 years and above, and who have  secondary

or lower education, to undergo lessons to upgrade themselves.

We  can perhaps reduce the burden of these workers if we  can

provide  classless learning facilities, ie, capitalise  fully

the potential of radio and television.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, not a long time ago, the Malay radio

station  had a special programme for the teaching of English,

which was conducted by Asmah Laili.  If we can adjust this to

the   needs  of  today  and  combine  it  with  the  national

certification  programme, it would enable  mothers  and  also

fathers to listen to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>

radio.   By having such radio programmes in all the languages

we  could have English lessons suited to the needs of  today,

such  as  Business  English  or Cyber  English,  which  would

explain  the  terminology in the Internet world.   Wafer  fab

English,  for instance, will explain the terms  used  in  the

sector.  We can also widen this effort through television.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These educational programmes, of course, will not have

popular  ratings similar to entertainment programmes,  but  I

believe that rating is not the only reason why we have  radio

and  television.  The life-long learning culture  depends  on

the  effort  of  individual  citizens.   They  are  the  main

factors,  whether  they  would  be  able  to  continue  their

education or not.  But I think there is no loss for the  mass

media  to  provide this facility and to ensure that  we  will

provide this facility in full.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also faced with the problem of drop-outs who are

unable  to  study  or  who  have been  trapped  in  unhealthy

activities.   I  am  of the view that if these  students  are

placed  in  a special school which provides only  sports  and

athletic activities as well as the arts, it would enable them

to gain excellence in the fields that they are interested in,

apart  from providing English, Mathematics and mother  tongue

lessons for their academic needs.  Perhaps from this, we  can

produce sportsmen or artists who can do Singapore proud.  And

if  these drop-outs are not monitored, they will be a problem

to us later on, as we try to achieve the Singapore 21 vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Malay Muslims are taught the

teachings of Islam which say, to love our nation is  part  of

the  faith.  From Malay sayings, the Malays are called to  be

loyal  to  the  land where they live, and remember  that  the

grass may be greener on the other side but it is still better

here.   So,  if  there  are any speeches  that  question  the

loyalty  of  the  Malay  Muslims,  it  must  be  thought  out

rationally  and  not  emotionally.   We  must  look  at   our

situation.  We should not react angrily. We are taught to  be

patient.  Patience is part of our faith.  And there might  be

wisdom in what has been said.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also evidence that maybe there are some among

us  who  are more loyal to another country or who deride  the

leadership  of  a country.  A bad apple may spoil  the  whole

basket  and it is therefore our duty to prove our loyalty  to

our  country.  I believe that this loyalty and love  for  the

nation will be proven in due course, and the world would be a

better place if we work together towards it.

<div align="center"><b>DEBATE ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  thank you for allowing  me  to  join  in  the

debate.  I rise to speak in support of the motion standing in

the name of Mr Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President in his Address to open the Second

Session  of  this  Parliament  had  highlighted  Government's

efforts  to  promote life-long learning and  to  enhance  our

people's  skills and capability under the Manpower  21  plan.

Several  hon.  Members have also spoken  in  support  of  the

Manpower  21  plan.  I thank them for their  endorsement  and

support  for  the  initiatives contained in the  Manpower  21

Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Lim Boon Heng, speaking about the employee

share  option scheme, urged caution on our companies to adopt

such  an  approach of rewarding their employees.  I think  he

made  a  valid  point.   We  should proceed  with  care  when

adopting such new ideas.  He said that one should be wary  of

adopting  new  ideas  that  appear  to  be  great  but  their

consequences   are  not  fully  known.   I  agree  with  that

approach. But there are other ideas which, although  new  and

novel, are self-evidently

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>

relevant  and applicable to our situation, and we  should  be

prepared to adopt them immediately and wholeheartedly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give you an example, Sir. The latest issue of

Business  Week  (18th  October) contained  a  special  report

entitled  "Learning  to Lead".  It described  how  an  energy

company in the US, Conoco Inc, coped with a 1998 downturn  in

oil price and surplus capacity within the company.  The usual

approach  in  such  a situation, when your product  price  is

going  down,  would have been to cut spending  and  to  close

plants,  which would mean retrenching some workers.  Instead,

the CEO made an unusual decision.  He decided to make a major

investment  in  the company's managers.  He  approved  a  new

comprehensive leadership-development programme for his senior

executives.  The CEO explained,  "Even though oil was at $10,

it  was the right decision.  You're going to be successful in

the  long term if you have good people".  That was why in the

worst  of  times, Conoco was still investing in training  its

people  to  provide good leadership, so that the company  can

weather  the  crisis  and emerge more  competitive  and  more

successful.   Conoco was not alone in taking  this  approach.

According  to  the same Business Week report,  and  I  quote,

"Corporate America has concluded that investing in people  is

the way ahead."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is one idea that we must adopt and embrace

wholeheartedly, and apply as soon as we can.   And  this,  in

fact,  is  what M21 is all about.  It sets out a strategy  or

blueprint,  if you like it, for Government and  employers  to

invest  in our people as a means for Singapore to stay ahead.

It  provides  a  framework  for all  Singaporean  workers  to

upgrade  their skills, knowledge and capabilities  so  as  to

stay relevant and to remain employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent economic recession, though rather brief,

was  a  timely reminder of our vulnerability.  It  shows  how

easily  tens of thousands of Singaporean workers can be  made

redundant.   Now  that  the crisis is largely  over  and  the

Singapore  economy seems to be well on the road to  recovery,

it is indeed timely for us to reassess our situation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can sit back and simply ride this wave of recovery by

doing, more or less, the same, doing what we have been  doing

before the crisis itself.  It is the easiest way out.  It  is

the  course  of least resistance.  But the danger  of  taking

this approach, this pathway of least resistance, is that with

increasing  globalization, we would be exposed to  increasing

competition  and, over time, our economic space will  shrink.

We  have  to  seek  out new opportunities  and  adopt  a  new

paradigm for growth and prosperity.  So, what we should do is

to  use  this recent experience to plan for the  future.   Of

course,   we cannot precisely determine what the future  will

hold for us, but we can safely assume that the 1998 recession

would not be the last nor would it be the worst.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the pre-crisis days, economic growth resulted in

the  creation  of  as  many  as  120,000  new  jobs  a  year.

Singaporeans  were,  in fact, spoilt for  choice.   Companies

rushed to carry out "green-harvesting" exercises.  University

graduates  were offered jobs before they actually  graduated.

Production workers could quit a job and walk down the  street

to  another  factory  and find another job  with  a  $50  pay

increase.   In  fact, many jobs had to be filled  by  foreign

workers,  due to a sheer shortage of Singaporeans.   In  some

areas,  it  was a shortage of suitably skilled and  qualified

workers;  but  in  many other areas, it  was  a  shortage  of

workers who were  willing to take on the less attractive  and

less pleasant jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the post-crisis days, as the economy recovers, we

cannot  expect the labour market to return to the  conditions

prevailing  in 1995 to 1997.  If our GDP grows at the  target

rate  of  about 5% a year, and at least half of  this  growth

comes from productivity gains, the balance will have to  come

from  an  expansion  of labour supply, to  yield  a  net  job

creation  of around 60,000 jobs a year.  This means  that  we

must  be prepared for a lower level of job creation, even  as

the economy recovers and settles to its long-term growth rate

of between 4-6%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to ask ourselves what are the jobs which

will support sustainable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>

economic  growth over the longer term.  As we move towards  a

knowledge-based   economy,  the  jobs  are   likely   to   be

transformed into knowledge intensive jobs.  What  this  means

is  that  while  industries  will need  fewer  people,  these

workers will be of much higher calibre, higher skilled,  able

to   perform  more  valuable  jobs  and  earn  higher  wages.

Singaporeans must begin to prepare for these changes now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be the developments affecting jobs in the

future?   We think there are three developments that we  must

look  out and be prepared for.  These developments will  form

the   backdrop  and  provide  the  challenges   for   us   in

implementing Manpower 21.



<br><br><i>IT/Technology Based Workplace Environment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first is the technology-based workplace

environment.   There  is  no question  that  technology  will

reshape  not  only  the  electronic and  manufacturing  based

industries.   Every  other  industry  and  business  will  be

affected  by  the use of technology.  Information  technology

and  e-commerce are just examples of how technology has  been

applied to improve business efficiency and customer reach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, information technology is progressively

being  applied  in  sectors  such  as  retail,  banking   and

insurance  to  dramatically expand the delivery channels  and

the  reach  towards new customers, and, of  course,  also  to

improve  the  service to their customers.  In education,  the

intranet  and the Internet provide opportunity to  apply  new

learning  methods which can bring a whole host  of  education

materials to the fingertips of students.  Retail staff,  bank

staff, insurance salesmen, as well as teachers, will all need

to  be  prepared for such changes.  Increasingly, our workers

have  to  be  IT savvy, attuned to the latest technology  and

comfortable with the demands of the new jobs which are  being

created.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in traditional fields such as construction, the use

of   technology  will  result  in  sizeable  improvements  in

productivity and reduction in the need for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>

low  skilled  foreign construction workers.   Next  week,  my

Ministry  will launch the Construction 21 Report and announce

new measures to transform the construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our new school leavers and graduates of

polytechnics and universities will be well prepared for these

changes and demands of new jobs, we must not forget the older

workers  who  may not have the same skills and  are  in  many

cases  hampered  by their lower education.   The  concept  of

"lifelong  learning" put up by the Manpower 21  Committee  is

designed to help mature workers learn new skills to help them

to keep up with the changing job requirements.  While younger

entrants  to  the  workforce will be better  equipped,  their

stock  of knowledge and skills will also get outdated in  the

face   of  technological  progress.   So  even  today's  well

educated  younger Singaporeans must adopt a new  mindset  and

embrace lifelong learning so as to stay employable.



<br><br><i>New Growth Industries</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major development is the accelerated pace of

rise  and  fall  of companies and industries.   This  is  the

result  of  the unprecedented pace of technological  advances

and   applications.    To  succeed  and  remain   profitable,

companies  are  constantly  seeking  new  products  and   new

services.   They  are  always looking out  for  better,  more

productive and lower cost opportunities.  Those which  cannot

keep  up  with  the pace of change will soon find  themselves

shut   out  of  the  market.   In  response  to  this  trend,

restructuring will become part and parcel of business  growth

and  survival.   When companies reorganize to concentrate  on

their  core  activities or to venture into  new  areas,  very

frequently, there will be employment disruption and, in  some

cases,  retrenchment of surplus staff.  So while  the  demand

for  a people with knowledge and capabilities in growth areas

will  increase, other workers may well find that their skills

are  no longer needed.  There will be a shrinking demand  for

their skills.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, since 1992, the manufacturing share of

employment in Singapore has declined from 29% to 21% in 1998.

While  demand  for  higher  skilled  technicians,  engineers,

computer   systems   analysts  and   product   research   and

development   workers  will  still  grow,  the   demand   for

production  and assembly workers is expected to  continue  to

decline.   Our approach to helping these workers is to  equip

them  with  new  skills and help them to re-deploy  to  other

economic sectors, such as service industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other growth sectors which will continue to create jobs

for   our   people   will  include  the   banking,   finance,

communication,   broadcasting  and   information   technology

sectors.  In the IT sector alone, the current pool of  33,000

IT  professionals is expected to grow at about 10% a year for

several more years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prepare for the manpower needs in the high growth

sector,  my  Ministry  is  planning  to  launch  a  Strategic

Manpower  Conversion Programme.  This is a programme  whereby

workers  are encouraged to undergo short "conversion" courses

to acquire new knowledge and skills for careers in the growth

areas.   For a start, my Ministry is working with  NCB  on  a

programme to convert non-IT trained workers for higher  value

added  jobs  in  the growing IT sector.  The scheme  will  be

implemented  early  next year.  We will  use  the  experience

gained from this pilot project in the IT sector and extend it

to  the  other new growth areas so that Singaporeans  can  be

better  equipped  and better prepared to take  on  these  new

jobs.



<br><br><i>Raising skills levels and multi-skilling</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third development is the demand for flexibility,

creativity   and  thinking  skills  and  also   multi-skilled

workers.   Gone  are  the days when a  production  worker  or

production operator focuses on a single task on the  assembly

line.   In a typical hi-tech manufacturing plant, whether  it

is  in  petrochemicals, semiconductors or food manufacturing,

most  of the actual work itself is done by machines, operated

by  a few highly skilled workers. These workers will have  to

conduct quality

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>

inspection and trouble-shooting and even maintenance  of  the

machines that are placed under their care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in traditional jobs such as in the cleaning

industry, healthcare aides, hotel industry with the need  for

a  large  number  of chambermaids and other backroom  support

staff,  there is scope to raise their skills and productivity

by  widening the scope of such jobs through proper  training.

The result is to enhance the image and dignity of these jobs.

This will help us in our effort to re-deploy some workers who

will  be made redundant as the manufacturing industry reduces

its labour requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To motivate workers to undergo upgrading so that they

can  continue to remain employable or be redeployed to  other

sectors,  my  Ministry  is  developing  the  National  Skills

Recognition System (NSRS).  The NSRS is a framework that will

develop  industry  skills standards in the manufacturing  and

service  sectors  and  accord  national  recognition  to  the

training  that meets these standards.  The NSRS  will  enable

mature workers to earn credit for what they have learnt,  and

provide an additional mechanism for employers to assess their

employees'  skills  level.  This system  is  designed  to  be

accessible   to  all  workers,  regardless  of  their   basic

education.   It will provide all workers with the opportunity

for skills certification to a nationally recognized standard.

This will help facilitate the gradual transition of the lower

skilled  segments of our workforce into the knowledge economy

and encourage them to also pursue lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from promoting lifelong learning, training and

retraining,  we  must also constantly examine our  employment

market  to  look for areas that can be improved and  also  to

enhance our resilience and competitiveness.  For instance, we

must  refine our wage system to enable companies to  be  more

responsive  to changing business conditions in good  and  bad

times.   Hence,  employers should quickly adopt  the  monthly

variable  payment (MVP) system.  This system was  recommended

by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>

National  Wages Council in May this year as a means  to  help

companies  to  adapt  to the changing  business  cycle.   The

monthly  variable  payment will in  fact  give  companies  an

additional measure to adjust cost without having to  retrench

workers or resort to more painful wage cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also rationalize some of our employees'

benefit  system,  such  as  the  introduction  of  a   co-pay

principle for medical care.  This was in fact recommended  by

a Tripartite Committee nearly three years ago but progress in

implementation  has been fairly slow.  On the  contrary,  the

civil service has already implemented this system since 1994,

and  has  made very good progress with it.  The question  is:

can  we afford further delays in implementing a measure which

will  result  in  better allocation of health  care  benefits

across  the  board  and  also ensure that  our  employers  or

companies  do  not  bear an unfair share  of  providing  such

medical benefits to their employees?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the sacred cow of retrenchment benefits.

A  ceiling  of  25  years  service was  introduced  when  the

retirement age was raised to 62 years last year.  However, as

I  mentioned earlier, the pace of change will cause companies

to restructure and reorganise much more frequently in future.

Companies  will  have  to down-size  when  the  market  turns

against  them  and  when they develop  new  products  or  new

services,  they can then grow again.  So company  sizes  will

change.    There   will   be   frequent   restructuring   and

reorganisation.  If our retrenchment benefits  are  perceived

by  investors to be too generous and a hindrance to corporate

restructuring,  we  may  lose  our  attractiveness  to   such

investors.   Can  we  afford to pass  up  such  opportunities

because  we want to preserve the present system of protecting

our  workers  from  unexpected retrenchment?   Or  should  we

recall, go back to first principle that retrenchment benefits

were  meant  to  help workers to tide over the period  during

which they are unemployed and looking for a new job?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all very sensitive issues with tremendous

impact on the state of our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>

industrial  relations.  But we must start  to  discuss  these

issues and build up a tripartite consensus on how we can make

progress.   We have already started to do so with  regard  to

another  issue concerning union representation for executives

in  a  company.   In  the  years ahead,  we  must  also  find

equitable  and  mutually agreeable solutions to  these  other

issues so that they will not hinder the effort to create jobs

for our people.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new millennium will present many new opportunities

to  Singapore.  These are opportunities which we  must  seize

and ride on to bring us into the next phase of growth.  If we

are ill prepared, we will miss out on these opportunities and

slide  down on the competitive ladder.  This will mean higher

unemployment  rate.   We  will  have  to  live  with   higher

unemployment  rate.   There will be  insufficient  and  lower

value-added jobs for our people who will end up earning lower

wages and have to put up with lower standard of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transition to the new economy involves every

individual.   It  is not confined to only the  engineers  and

those  who  are  highly educated.  Rather,  it  requires  the

commitment,  determination and effort of all Singaporeans  at

every  level of the workforce.  It requires our people to  be

willing  to  learn,  to  try new things,  to  be  innovative.

Whether  professionals  or production workers,  employers  or

employees, the key to our ability to earn good living in  the

future will rest on our ability to acquire new knowledge  and

skills  and to use these to add value to the economic effort.

Individuals  can choose to be overwhelmed by the changes  and

languish by the side, or take a proactive role to prepare for

the future and ride on its opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government will provide the overall framework,

the  people and the private sector have to take the  lead  in

seizing the growth and learning opportunities.  Employers and

workers must be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>

agile, flexible and open to various possibilities in this fast

moving knowledge-based economy.  The Manpower 21 strategy and

programmes  represent a blueprint or a  road  map.   Workers,

employers and the Government must travel along this road hand-in-hand  so  that  we  can  arrive  together  at  our  common

destination.   The road is not straight nor  smooth.   It  is

winding, runs uphill with many obstacles along the  way.   We

must  help each other to navigate the climb and overcome  the

hazards  on the way.  Government, working with the employers,

will  invest,  subsidize, motivate and encourage  workers  to

upgrade  their skills.  Singaporeans must also make  personal

commitment  to  make  full  use  of  these  opportunities  to

upgrade.   Every  worker must adopt the  "lifelong  learning"

credo  and  make  continuing effort  to  ensure  his  or  her

employability.  I urge all employers and workers to  join  us

in this exciting and rewarding journey to transform ourselves

into a globally competitive workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have spoken and given suggestions and

made  many good comments on the M21 report.  I do not propose

to  go  into the details and respond to individual  comments,

but  let me assure all the hon. Members that my Ministry will

study  and  consider  their suggestions and  comments  as  we

implement  the recommendations of the Manpower  21  Committee

report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the President's Address is a very comprehensive

statement  of the Government's policy.  Apart from  reviewing

our progress over the last 30 years, it has also outlined the

target for us in the 21st century.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.02 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the recent financial crisis, we are now in a more

stable   position.   However,  we  will  face  more   intense

competition  in future.  In order to build our  nation  in  a

better way and to make our economy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>

more  vibrant,  we  have  to  make  full  use  of  our  human

resources.  We have to let our people give full play to their

potential,  and  we want our people to work  in  a  concerted

effort  to  contribute towards our nation  building  efforts.

The  President  also  emphasised that we  have  to  pay  more

attention  to our aging population.  Allow me to  raise  some

recommendations on these issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations has designated 1999 as the year for

the   aged.   That  is  evidence  of  how  the  international

community has attached great importance to the problems of an

aging population.  Singapore is one of the nations facing the

most  serious problems of an aging population.  By  the  year

2030, out of four Singaporeans, one will be above the age  of

60, that is, about 25%.  The Government has already set up  a

Committee  to  look  into this problem,  with  the  terms  of

reference  of looking after the senior citizens and  to  make

adequate  preparations  for  our  future  needs.    In   this

connection, I would like to speak on three aspects which  the

senior citizens are most concerned with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, health. We should provide some facilities

for  our  senior  citizens to have  easy  access  to  regular

medical  check-ups.    In order that  they  may  be  healthy,

physically and mentally, I think they should undergo  regular

medical  check-ups.  This is very important.   Prevention  is

better  than  cure.  We would like to thank the Minister  for

Health,  Mr  Lim  Hng Kiang who, in reply to  Dr  Lily  Neo's

request, announced that his Ministry has plans for our senior

citizens  to  be examined regularly.  We have  about  300,000

senior  citizens in Singapore.  If all these  300,000  senior

citizens were to go to the Singapore General Hospital  for  a

medical  check-up, then I am sure the hospital will  be  very

crowded and very busy, and these old people will have problem

getting there too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make it easier for the senior citizens, I

think  the community and  grassroots organisations  can  also

help  in this aspect.  Maybe regular check-ups for the senior

citizens can be conducted in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>

community  centres,  say, routine checks on  eyesight,  blood

sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol, etc.  On the one hand,

this will be easier for the senior citizens and, on the other

hand,  this  will  enable  the  grassroots  organisations  to

participate in this very meaningful job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the check-up, there should be systematic

documentation on the health situation of the senior citizens.

In  fact,  many  senior citizens normally  forget  about  the

results  and they do not take the necessary action to prevent

the  diseases.   The  Ministry of  Health  should  publish  a

medical  check-up  record booklet,  so  that  when  a  senior

citizen goes for his check-up, the doctors or nurses will  be

able to record his state of health there, and this will serve

as  a  very useful future reference for the doctors when they

follow up with this senior citizen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in Bukit Gombak, we have started to conduct

regular  medical check-ups for our senior citizens.  We  have

also published a booklet to record the results of the medical

examination of the senior citizens.  This was launched by the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health,  Mr  Chan

Soo  Sen.  He was impressed by this record booklet  and  said

that it was a very good idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, in schools, every pupil has a health booklet

to  record  his  or her state of health.   I  hope  that  the

Minister  for  Health  would consider  publishing  a  similar

health  booklet  for the senior citizens, so that  they  will

have a better understanding of their health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, providing concessions for senior citizens on

public transportation.  In Singapore, concession is given  to

our  senior  citizens for commuting on our  public  transport

system.  However, this concession is restricted to only  off-peak  hours.   Recently Lianhe Zaobao conducted a  survey  on

this matter, and about 90% of those who were interviewed felt

that  when  the bus companies give concessions to the  senior

citizens, there should not be a restriction on the time  they

can  travel.   But the bus companies did not agree  with  the

finding because they felt that the senior

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>

citizens  should not compete with the other commuters  during

the  peak hours, and that it will pose some danger to the old

folks.   But  many  people  feel that  this  is  not  a  fair

reasoning.   This matter has, in fact, been argued  for  many

years and there is still no concrete outcome. Very soon,  the

20th  century will come to an end.  We hope that  before  the

end  of the 20th century, there should be a solution to  this

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are serious and sincere in considering this

problem, I think this is a responsibility of every one of us,

whether  it  is a Government department, the private  sector,

grassroots  organisations or the civil groups.   So  long  as

they  are  involved  in this problem of an aging  population,

they  should put in a concerted effort and we should work  in

one heart so that we can have better results.  I feel that we

should deal with this matter in a more objective manner.   At

the  moment,  our  transport system  is  very  comprehensive,

whether  it  is MRT or public buses, they are being  operated

very  smoothly,  and  we  have a very good  public  transport

system.   The commuters are also boarding and alighting  from

the  buses in a very orderly manner.  They have been treating

the  old people in a very courteous manner.  It is not a  big

problem  even if the senior citizens were to board the  buses

during the peak hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many of us retire at 60 nowadays, with our good

medical  and healthcare system, many of our old people  enjoy

very  healthy living.  Look at our new President,  he  is  76

years old and he is still very healthy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the relevant authority should seriously

consider  implementing concession rates for  senior  citizens

even  during the peak hours.  Maybe we should try it for  one

year, and one year later we can have a review and see whether

this concession, without any restricted hours, would pose any

serious problem to us.  If everything is all right, and there

is  no  problem,  we  should continue  to  grant  concessions

throughout  the day and night.  It is a form of  respect  for

the senior

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>

citizens,   and  it  would  also  provide  them   with   more

convenience.  In fact, in Hong Kong, in Europe and the United

States,  this  is  very  common.  The senior  citizens  enjoy

concessions  without  any  restriction.   I  feel  that   the

relevant    authority   should   seriously   consider    this

recommendation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, housing for the senior citizens. Now we have

86%  of Singaporeans living in public housing, that is,  more

than  200,000 senior citizens are living in HDB  flats.   The

thing  that  they  are  more  concerned  with  is  the  lift,

especially for those who live in high-rise buildings.  I feel

that  HDB  has done a great job.  In the new housing estates,

the  lifts stop at every floor.  This is a very good  service

to  the residents, particularly to the senior citizens.   The

Government  has attached great importance to this matter  and

during  the  upgrading  projects,  whether  it  is  a   major

upgrading or an interim upgrading, provision was made so that

the  lifts can stop at every floor.  However, in the  interim

upgrading programme, the HDB has fixed another standard  that

the  lifts  should  be  able to serve at  least  50%  of  the

residents before arrangement would be made for them  to  stop

at every floor.  But if we look at the flats which were built

in  the 1980s or earlier, the design was such that they would

not  be  able to attain this standard.  So we are  unable  to

attain  the  standard set by HDB, and it is not  possible  to

provide this service where the lift can stop at every  floor.

It  would be very difficult for them to go out if there is no

lift,  particularly  for those who are wheelchair-bound.   It

would be a very serious problem for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, when I raised the matter concerning the lifts

for  certain  blocks  of  flats in my constituency  with  the

former  Minister for National Development, Mr Lim Hng  Kiang,

he  told  me  that  since  there were  only  4  storeys,  the

residents   could   just  walk  up  and  down   the   stairs.

Unconvinced,  I showed him some photographs on how  difficult

it  was  for  the old folks to go up and down the  staircase,

especially  when they were sick.  Immediately,  he  suggested

that  I raise this matter in Parliament and he would consider

it.  Now the lifts are being installed in these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>

blocks  of  flats.  Although the installation  is  not  fully

completed,  the  residents are already very happy,  and  they

have asked me to thank the Minister for his good gestures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another issue that I would like to raise concerns

single persons who wish to buy HDB flats.  Yesterday, Dr  Ker

raised this matter about singles buying HDB flats.  I do  not

want  to repeat his points.  We all know that for the singles

to  buy HDB flats, there are a lot of restrictions.  First of

all,  they cannot buy directly from HDB.  Secondly,  even  in

the  open market, they can only buy the 3-room flats and they

are restricted to flats which are outside the city area.  All

these  conditions have made it very difficult for the singles

to buy HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for those affected by the redevelopment plans, they

too  have  problems because under the redevelopment  schemes,

existing  lessees  enjoy a 20% discount  when  they  purchase

their alternative flats from HDB.  But the singles are denied

this  discount.  Sometimes, being single is not really  their

own  wish,  and  it  is beyond their control.   During  their

younger days, some of these singles may have worked very hard

to  support their younger brothers and sisters and when  they

have grown up, they were already too old to get married.   So

they  would have to remain single.  I hope that the  Minister

would  reconsider  this  matter  because  even  singles  have

contributed to our nation building.  Perhaps, we could impose

certain restrictions on them, but I do not think some bending

of the rules would affect the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, I think we should give the singles a fair

deal.  Under the redevelopment schemes, all residents enjoy a

20%  discount.  Perhaps the relevant authority may feel  that

20%  discount is too much, then at least they should be given

a 10% discount.  I think we should give them some concessions

and  be fair to them.  These are the recommendations I  would

like to raise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

support  the motion moved by Mr Davinder Singh to  thank  the

President for his Address to Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has outlined the Government's objectives

for  the  future.   The Addenda detailed the  programmes  the

Ministries  intend to implement to achieve these  objectives.

It  is more than fair to say that in the past 34 years, since

independence, the PAP Government, together with  the  people,

has transformed Singapore into a prosperous and thriving city

state.   We  have  the  best  infrastructure  and  investment

climate that ranks among the most conducive in the world  and

a  diligent workforce that is second to none.  All these have

been   done  under  great  political  stability.   Successive

economic  crises  were overcome through  the  cooperation  of

Government and the people.  We should be justifiably proud of

our achievements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that we need to pose now is: do all these

achievements make us a nation and the people active citizens?

34  years amount to some 1 1/2 generations, a very short time

for  a country.  Nation building is a painstaking effort that

requires  generations  to  go  through  various  trials   and

tribulations  before the people can consider themselves  true

citizens.  When we look around the world today, we cannot but

notice,  at  least by way of negative examples,  that  nation

building is a very difficult business.  Emerging countries in

Africa   and  Latin  America  are  constantly  going  through

political  and  social upheavals.  Even  so-called  developed

countries  in  Europe could not escape from the strifes  that

threatened  to  break  up  the  countries,  indeed  break-ups

occurred  in some of these old countries.  In the region,  we

are  witnessing similar events that have yet to be played  to

completion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, we have to ask ourselves: are we a nation

yet?   One  way to find out is to go through the  baptism  of

fire.   When we are confronted with a deep crisis,  not  just

economic,  we  will  find out whether our  people  will  jell

together and help one another to overcome the difficulties,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>

whether we will die for one another to preserve our homeland.

This  is  a  very painful way which we would  not  wish  upon

ourselves.  Another way is to increase the stakes our  people

have  in  the  country which make it imperative for  them  to

defend with the utmost of their ability.  Yet, another way is

to  nurture a greater sense of belonging to the country where

our  loved  ones and friends all call home and where  we  can

seek comfort and solace in times of need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can provide the hardware to make

Singapore  to  continue  to  survive  and  prosper  in   this

increasingly  competitive world.  Indeed, it has,  judged  by

the  Addenda  that  have  been included  in  the  President's

Address.  But the heartware that makes us true citizens rests

in  ourselves.   We  have  to ask ourselves  whether  we  are

committed  to  Singapore.  If so, how do we  strengthen  this

commitment?  I would suggest that we start at home  with  our

own families.  Close and enduring family ties will ultimately

reflect  themselves  in the society  at  large.   If  we  are

prepared to fight for our own family members, only then  will

we  be  ready  to  do  the same for our  friends  and  fellow

citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 Vision may help us along the way. But

we  ourselves must respond to the initiatives and  strengthen

our  commitment  to  be not just active  but  true  citizens.

Human beings are not machines.  The Government cannot press a

few  buttons and expect the people to turn on and behave just

like robots.  We have to light the fire in our own bellies to

nurture our love for and commitment to our own country.  This

would  take a few more generations.  There is no better  time

to  start  now as we are all poised to take up the challenges

ahead  of  us.   In due course, we hope and  we  will  surely

become one people, one nation, one Singapore.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the

debate  on  the  motion standing in the name of  Mr  Davinder

Singh.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the President's Address, one of the major

challenges  that he identified that is facing us, and  indeed

facing  other  countries, is how to  fit  into  a  globalised

information  and knowledge economy while, at the  same  time,

maintaining  our own identity, values, sense of cohesion  and

nationhood and perhaps, most important of all, our ability to

decide for ourselves our own future.  The changes being  made

to  our education system also reflect this challenge and  the

programmes  that  we  have laid out in the  Addendum  to  the

President's Address show how we propose to face up  to  these

challenges that are coming in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want our students to be world-ready. Yet, we want

them  at the same time to be rooted to Singapore.  How do  we

achieve  this?  In some ways, our language policy is  a  very

good example of how we do this.  We use English to teach  our

students  and that makes them world-ready, ready to  interact

with  the  rest  of  the  world  in  business,  finance   and

technology.   But at the same time, because of our  continued

emphasis  on  the mother tongue, our students  grow  up  well

rooted  in  their own value system, history, culture  and  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be world-ready, we have instituted a number of

programmes.  We are already world class in many  areas.   The

Third  International  Mathematics  and  Science  Study,   for

example,   shows   that  our  students  do   very   well   by

international  comparison in Mathematics  and  Science.   But

that,  in  some  sense, is history.  We must  move  on.   Our

system is very efficient at transferring a set of skills  and

a  certain  body of knowledge into the heads of our  students

giving  them  skills  that they can use  immediately  in  the

economy.   But we must now go beyond this by giving them  the

ability to learn new knowledge throughout their lives and  to

create  new  knowledge.  Hence, to make our  students  world-ready,  we have introduced creative thinking in our  schools,

not  just  as  a  subject, but as a skill to be  learned  and

infused throughout the curriculum in the schools and  in  all

the activities that they do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Loh Meng See's wise words when he says

that we are making a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>

system that is already good better and not to make such major

changes to the system that we risk upsetting something  which

is  already  quite  good.   We  will  build  upon  the  solid

foundations that we have.  And I would like to assure Dr  Tan

Boon  Wan  that, in the process of reforming our system,  the

continued emphasis on excellence will be there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we make our students rooted to Singapore? This

is  also  one  of  the issues that has been  raised  by  many

Members.   It would be a pity if our educational institutions

lost  their  character  entirely  and  our  universities  and

schools   produce   students  who  could   have   come   from

universities  and schools just like in any other  country  in

the  world.  Our universities, polytechnics, ITE and  schools

should  produce students who are world-ready, yet  rooted  in

Singapore  with that something unique about them  that  makes

them  Singaporean.  Hence, we have National Education in  our

schools and we have also introduced the community involvement

programme.   So  we,  in  the  Ministry  of  Education,  will

certainly do our part to help to nurture the active  citizens

that we need for the 21st century, active citizens who have a

well-founded confidence and commitment to Singapore's future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting these two parts together, making our students

world-ready  and yet rooted in Singapore, we have  programmes

for all levels, from pre-school through primary and secondary

to  further  education  and higher education  and  also  into

continuing  education.  Several Members, Mr  Iswaran  and  Mr

Zainul  Abidin, have commented favourably on the Ministry  of

Education  taking a more active role in pre-school education.

This  is  something  that we would do.  We  would  leave  the

operation  of  pre-school centres and  kindergartens  in  the

hands  of private operators and non-profit organisations,  as

is happening today.  I think they are doing a reasonably good

job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Ministry would do is to look at areas of high

impact where we can help to improve the quality of pre-school

education.  We will carry out research and studies.  We  will

look into how we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>

improve   the  curriculum,  teaching  standards  and  teacher

quality.   Dr  Aline Wong, Senior Minister of  State  in  the

Ministry  of Education, is studying this matter and when  she

is ready in the not too distant future, she will have more to

say on how we will progress in this programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing education is another subject that was touched

on  by  a  good many Members.  This is really the next  great

frontier  of  education.  We have gone through  mass  primary

education, mass secondary education and, to some extent, mass

higher education.  In Singapore, something like 85% to 90% of

our  students  have  post-secondary  education  in  the  ITE,

polytechnics or universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next major development in education will be mass

continuing  education.  And here, our polytechnics,  ITE  and

universities  will  certainly  work  with  the  Ministry   of

Manpower  in  the  M21 programme to give this  programme  its

effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, what we are aiming for is a holistic education

in  which  we can achieve the Desired Outcomes of  Education.

We are going into more school autonomy to help to release the

ideas and initiative in our principals and teachers.  We  are

improving   and  repositioning  the  National  Institute   of

Education so that our teachers will be able to have continual

education and upgrading in the NIE so that they will keep  up

and  be able to upgrade themselves, as they progress in their

careers.  Indeed, every teacher is an entrepreneur in his own

classroom  and  we  want to encourage  him  to  exercise  his

initiative to do the best for his students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also raised the question of

streaming.  This is not a new issue.  Streaming is a form  of

mass customisation which is really quite consistent with  the

approach  that  the Ministry is taking towards ability-driven

education.  Streaming has allowed our students to progress at

a pace which they can manage.  If I could give some examples.

In  1980,  before we had streaming, only 58% of a  Primary  1

cohort

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>

sat  for  the "O" levels.  In 1998, this had risen to  81.3%.

But,  more dramatically, in 1980, before streaming, only  24%

of a Primary 1 cohort obtained five "O" level passes or more.

But, by 1998, this had increased by 2 1/2 times to 61.2%.  By

allowing  students  to  progress at a  pace  which  they  are

comfortable with, at a pace which they can manage rather than

forcing the pace, we have actually allowed many more  of  our

students  to  do  much better and to go much further  in  the

education system than they would otherwise have done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So contrary to the view that streaming stigmatises

students  and so forth, streaming has, in fact, allowed  many

more  students to enjoy success.  In some countries like  the

United  Kingdom  and  United States where  streaming  is  not

widely  practised,  they  have  a  dilemma.   They  have  two

choices.  If a person does not pass at a certain level,  they

can  either  retain  him or they do what  is  called  "social

promotion". They promote him to the next level even though he

has  not  passed. And the research shows that those  who  are

retained  become despondent.  They lose interest,  they  have

low self-esteem and they drop out. And those who are socially

promoted   cannot  manage  at  the  next  level.   They   get

despondent, disinterested in their studies, no social esteem,

and  they also drop out.  So in those systems where  they  do

not  practise  streaming, they wring  their  hands  and  say,

"Well,  there is really no solution to the problem."  But  if

we  are  prepared to take an objective look at how  streaming

has actually brought success to our students, then we can see

that streaming really has provided many more avenues for  our

students to progress through the education system and  to  do

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in an ability-driven education, what we do want to

do is to go beyond streaming to see how we can better harness

the  talents  of  our students, be it in the sports  and  the

arts, as Mr Harun Ghani has suggested.  I am not saying  that

we  would go as far as he has suggested in creating a special

academy and school,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>

and  so on.  But in fact, we are going some way towards  that

by  developing NAFA and La Salle as arts institutes.  We  are

trying  to  see  how we can channel students  who  have  such

interests into professional development in these areas  where

they  might pursue a very satisfying career.  But we are also

looking  at  our  schools to see how we can use  the  present

streaming structure and see whether we can allow students who

may  be  stronger in some subjects than in others, to perhaps

take  a combination of subjects at various levels. And  these

kinds  of  experiments we will continue to  try  out  in  the

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the experiments that I am quite prepared to try

out  is to see how we can adjust our "O" and "A" level system

so   that  students  can  make  better  use  of  their  time,

especially  those  who  are clear-cut  going  to  university,

rather than having to be straight-jacketed between these  two

very major examinations within a very short space of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the support and the suggestions from all

the Members who have spoken on education subjects during this

debate,  especially Mr Loh Meng See, Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen  and

others. Education is an enterprise which requires the support

of all - the school, home and community.  My colleagues and I

and  by that, I do not mean just my colleagues in this House,

but  also  some  40,000 teachers, support staff,  professors,

lecturers and so on in our schools and institutions of higher

learning,  appreciate the support that Members of this  House

have  always given to education and our teachers.  And I hope

that  in  the  coming years, we will continue to  enjoy  your

support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Information  and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof)  (In  Malay):

Mr  Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to address  the

House  in  support  of  a motion moved by  my  colleague,  Mr

Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some journalists regarded the Speech by President Nathan

as not having any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>

significant news.  But for me and most of the Members of this

House  who have spoken before me, it is an essential part  of

developing  the Singapore society.  His Speech  has  a  great

meaning  to  all  Singaporeans because  he  is  an  excellent

practitioner in the process of nation building for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to relate my personal experience when he

was the Executive Chairman of the Singapore Press Holdings in

1984.  I was in Cambridge to pursue a fellowship course.  One

evening,  while I was revising my work at the  hostel,  there

was  a knock on the door.  When I opened the door, I saw  him

smiling.   In his hand, there was a plastic bag.   He  sought

permission to enter and when I asked him what was his purpose

in  visiting  me, he told me that there was nothing  special.

He  was  simply in London while on his way home from America.

Mr  Nathan  took  the trouble of coming  alone  by  train  to

Cambridge  just to meet one among hundreds of his staff.   He

wanted to know the welfare of his staff and he advised me  to

study seriously.  After chit-chatting for about an hour,  and

before  he  left,  he gave me six cans of chicken  curry  and

said,  "You must be longing to have halal chicken curry  from

Singapore."  I was dumbfounded.  Beneath his appearance of  a

serious and firm man, he is in fact a caring and kind person,

and  he  is  a person who practises true care for his  fellow

human  beings,  even though to me, a small  man.   Therefore,

when  he  was  speaking  about  social  cohesion,  it  has  a

significant meaning because when he addressed it, he  himself

has an unblemished moral integrity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, although yesterday we have heard many

views  and suggestions on how to bring about social cohesion,

I  think this is the main issue as it has the decisive impact

on the success or failure and the survival of Singapore.  The

incident in the Balkans is a lesson to us. Therefore,  please

allow me to talk on this topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore, a multi-racial nation, is

only  about 34 years old.  During this brief period, we  have

worked

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>

hard to bring about a united nation and by learning from  the

experiences   of   other  countries  and  by   managing   and

formulating  our  own  policies.  The  journey  towards  this

destined  end  is  still  long, but despite  that,  our  firm

actions  and  valuable ideas have worked out gradually  since

1965.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, if we were to look back, in fact, we

have  actually achieved many successes in this area. Firstly,

the  severance  of ourselves from our country of  origin  and

also  developing  a  sense of loyalty to Singapore.   I  have

witnessed and felt these changes.  I remember clearly when  I

was  a teenager at the end of 1950s and early 1960s.  At that

time,  when  we entered the house of a Javanese or  a  Bawean

Pondok  or  the  house of a Minang, you will see  the  Garuda

crest with the slogan "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika".  It means unity

in  diversity, which is the symbol of Indonesia, and  it  was

fixed  on the wall.  Some had a portrait of Sukarno  hung  to

the  wall.   I also remember that on 17th August,  as  a  boy

scout  on  duty,  I  found thousands of  Singapore  residents

gathering   at  the  Indonesian  Ambassador's  residence   in

Paterson  Road  until there was a need for  traffic  control.

But during the Konfrontasi, I began to realise the reality of

politics. "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" began to disappear from  the

walls  of  the Malay residences.  Now, more than a generation

has  passed,  when  we enter a living room of  a  Singaporean

Malay,  not only we no longer find it on the wall,  in  fact,

the perception towards "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" has changed  so

much.   The emotional and psychological attachment  to  their

place of origin is fading fast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this process is not only happening among the

Malay  community in Singapore but it is also happening  among

the  Chinese  and Indian as well as the Eurasian communities.

The  Malays,  like the Chinese, Indian and Eurasians  believe

that  they  are the genuine citizens of Singapore.   I  agree

with  what Mr Harun had said that where our legs stand it  is

also  the  place where we support the sky.  Now, 17th  August

for  Indonesia is seen by us as no different as  1st  October

for the day of independence of the People's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>

Republic  of  China  and also the month of  independence  for

India.  We have 9th of August which is very special and  very

meaningful  to us.  For those who were born after  1965,  the

root  of their citizenship is even deeper.  This is our  only

motherland.  This is our country. This is where we  live  and

die.  And this is where we would be protected and this is the

country where we will defend with our blood and life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learn about security and mutual trust in a multi-racial society as early as 1964. My family was the only

Malay  family  in  a Chinese village at Lorong  Sinaran,  now

Novena.   When  there was a racial riot, our  village  chief,

known  as  Ah Teng, had advised our family not to  leave  the

house.   They  went  to the market to buy  us  the  food  and

protected  our family.  We trusted their honesty.  They  have

never  betrayed us.  I think there are many similar incidents

which  have become the foundation for this mutual trust among

us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social cohesion and this harmonious living is no

longer  an  empty  word or hope.  How do we  arrive  at  this

point?   This is a result of physical, economic,  social  and

psychological steps that have been taken by the Government to

nurture  the  feeling of Singaporeans and  to  eliminate  all

impediments.  We have broken down all the racial compartments

through  the resettlement and brought them under one roof  in

public housing.  Our children go to the same school, use  the

same  language.  They went through National Service together.

We  work  together in the same office, we eat from  the  same

hawker  centre, we buy from the same supermarket, participate

in  all activities organised by grassroots organisations  and

participate in the same professional bodies.  The  harmonious

living  of  various communities is a reality  now.   We  have

taken  in fact one step ahead. The housing policy has ensured

that all residents from the condominiums, 5-room, 4-room,  3-room, 2-room flats and also our old residents, share the same

amenities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we are only half-way in our nation

building or what

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>

the Prime Minister called the Singapore tribe, and the end is

still far away. This is because, although we have managed  to

narrow  the gap between the races, the fault lines are  still

there.   We  need  probably one, two or three generations  to

achieve this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following factors may assist us. First, we must

keep the principles of meritocracy in the true sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what we earn from the economic progress is used

to  enhance our shared benefits, and increase our  stakes  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must ensure that there exist a national

resilience  that enables us to repel any destructive  impacts

resulting  from happenings around South East Asia, the  Asian

continent   or   the   world,  which   will   resurface   the

sensitivities of race or religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we should create the culture of trust at all

levels,  and  to  enhance the confidence and loyalty  of  all

Singaporeans, regardless of their ethnicity or religion,  and

we  have to gradually expose them to areas of services  which

are considered as sensitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we must make them understand the history, arts,

culture,  norms  and customs of other races through  specific

additional programmes in schools and our workplace.  In  this

area,  we  should  be  able  to  distinguish  the  mainstream

thoughts and practices among the races from the thoughts  and

practices of the marginal groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of this, the process of

building a Singapore tribe should be enhanced and done  in  a

systematic  way. I would like to propose that  we  set  up  a

policy research body that identifies the common interests and

differences among the races and recommend further appropriate

actions.    This   body  should  comprise  various   relevant

Ministries,  statutory  boards,  representatives   from   the

different  race groups, institutions of higher  learning  and

individuals.  It should be placed under the Prime

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>

Minister's  Office.   I  realise  that  there   is   also   a

Presidential  Council  for Minority  Rights  and  the  Inter-Religious   Organisation,  but  the  roles  of   both   these

organisations are limited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the problems of the elderly in Singapore are so

important   that  it  takes  us  to  form  an  Inter-Ministry

Committee for it, I think the purpose of building a Singapore

tribe  is even more important for us to merit the setting  up

of such a body.  Developing a Singapore tribe is as important

as  the  economic progress of Singapore and, in fact,  it  is

important  for  the survival of Singapore.  We should  revise

the  process  of  this objective and to  fine  tune  all  the

measures  or the policies that we are going to implement,  so

that we can achieve the best success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion of Mr

Davinder Singh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to  join my colleague, Mr Davinder  Singh,  in

thanking  the  President for his Address to  Parliament  last

Monday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has happened since we opened the First Session of

this Parliament.  Compared to our neighbouring countries,  we

have  weathered the crisis much better than they have.   This

is  not  to  say  that  we have not had  our  fair  share  of

problems,  such  as  falling demand and  asset  values,  over

gearing  by  companies  and  businessmen  in  their  personal

capacities leading to cash flow problems, over capacities  in

production facilities leading to retrenchments of workers and

other  cost  cutting  measures.  We are much  more  resilient

because  of the sound financial and economic systems  we  had

painfully put in place over the years.  We also have  a  much

stronger   tripartite  relationship  between   the   workers,

employers  and  the  Government.  Led  by  enlightened  union

leaders,  the  Government  could  implement  a  cost  cutting

package that could minimise job losses and help businesses to

turn around more quickly.  Many of us have taken the goodwill

and cooperation of the unions for granted.  It need not be so

and, in fact, it is not the natural order of things.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>

can  see  this  from  the numerous labour disputes  happening

frequently    world-wide.     Our    harmonious    industrial

relationship  is  a  result of many decades  of  relationship

building between the Government, the employers and the unions

and  workers.  In fact, President Nathan himself spent a  bit

of  time with the unions in the 60s.  And many MPs have  also

spent  a stint in the labour unions as well to help to  build

this tripartite relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In better economic times, the Government and employers

keep their faith and share the good results with the workers.

As  the  economy begins to turn around today, the  Government

and   employers  should  bear  this  in  mind  and  find   an

appropriate   time  to  reciprocate.   The   Government   has

suggested  a  restoration of about 2% of the  employer's  CPF

contribution   early   next  year.   Some   employers   whose

businesses  have  not  recovered yet are naturally  concerned

about the early restoration.  They are afraid that this would

affect  their turn-around.  My own view on this is  that  the

restoration should be a part of the recommended wage increase

for  next year.  Companies that do well should be encouraged,

and  also be given the flexibility to pay more to workers  in

the form of a variable component.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many challenges ahead as we recover. We will

continue  to face more and keener competition, not just  from

low-cost  countries in this region, but even from other  low-cost countries in other continents further away.  We have  to

work  on  improving  relations with  our  neighbours  as  our

economies  are interdependent.  Political problems  with  our

neighbours  can  distract us from our main task  at  hand  of

economic  growth  and  social bonding  of  the  people.   The

Government has identified several areas for us to  focus  on,

to  better compete in an increasingly global world.  I  shall

just touch on two of these in greater depth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is on people development. Given our lack

of  natural  resources,  there  is  no  denying  that  people

development  will be the most important focus for  us  if  we

want  to  stay ahead of the competition.  The Government  has

always regarded

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>

the 10 years of primary and secondary education as the period

to  provide a firm foundation for further education  for  our

children.  I support the initiatives to revise the curriculum

to  encourage  more creativity.  However,  I  feel  that  the

Government  should slowly go one step further, or  backwards,

by  playing  a  bigger role in pre-primary education  of  our

young  children.  Studies have shown that inculcating a  good

foundation  in the languages and mathematics can  start  even

earlier  than  Primary  One.  Children from  richer  families

attend  private nurseries and kindergartens that give them  a

headstart in this area.  The quality of pre-primary education

for  the  masses  varies vastly.  Many young  children  start

Primary One, not on a level playing field, but with differing

exposure and levels of skills, both verbal and analytical.  I

know  the  Government has responded to this issue  before  by

stating  that  it would prefer to leave this  aspect  of  our

children's  education to the private sector.    The  Minister

for Education has also just spoken again on this subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I feel that as our society progresses, and we

can  afford it, I urge the Government to reconsider its  role

in  this stage of foundation building for our children.  I am

pleased to note that the Ministry of Education has decided to

be  more  involved in pre-school education, by  investing  in

curriculum  design and teacher training, conducting  research

and  tightening  regulations.  It is  a  step  in  the  right

direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I notice that many of our teachers in primary

schools   are  not  graduates,  especially  for  the  English

language,  which is the foundation for other  subjects,  even

Mathematics.   Teaching our young children in  school  proper

English  is extremely important.  If they learn to  pronounce

words  wrongly  in their early years, it will  take  an  even

longer time to unlearn them.  Recently, I was looking through

the English work of my son.  He was asked to give the meaning

of  "revive".   So  he wrote, "resuscitate"  and  was  marked

wrong.  He did not understand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>

why, neither did I when he asked me.  The teacher wanted  the

words  "bring  back to consciousness".  How can we  encourage

creativity if our teachers are so rigid in the way they mark?

The  word  "resuscitate" may be a bigger word than  "revive",

but it certainly is not wrong.  I do not mean to run down non-graduate  teachers in the primary schools.  Some non-graduate

teachers  I know of are very good too.  I know that it  would

be too expensive and probably impossible to have all graduate

teachers  in  the  early primary schools  for  our  children.

Perhaps the Ministry may want to consider having one  or  two

senior subject teachers in each standard or school as a point

of  reference for other teachers to refer to in the event  of

ambiguities and as a standard bearer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematics papers today are a test of the children's

English.  Unfortunately, sometimes the problems are so  badly

phrased  that I myself had difficulties trying to  understand

the   problem,  let  alone  the  children.   Today,  we   are

encouraging our civil servants, and everybody else  for  that

matter,  to  write  directly, concisely  and  clearly.   This

should  also  apply  to teachers who set examination  papers.

Teachers  should avoid using double negatives,  for  example,

when  they  set  papers,  and other ambiguous  language  when

setting  mathematics and other questions.  It would help  our

children to be more focused on the subject matter than  worry

about the language and their understanding of the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am delighted that the Government will equip the

schools  with  one  computer for every two  students  in  the

Information Technology Masterplan.  Students, however, do not

just  learn  in  school.   They follow up their  learning  at

home.   Students from better off families will have computers

at  home.   Those  whose parents cannot  afford  it  will  be

handicapped.   I  would like to request that  the  Government

allow the use of Edusave funds of the children to be used for

the  purchase of computers for home use.  I believe that this

use of the Edusave funds will be as important as using it for

the enhancement programmes in the schools.  Some studies have

shown that computers and IT have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>

actually widened the gap between the haves and the have-nots,

because  the  have-nots cannot afford computers and  computer

training to compete in this global age of IT.  We should  try

our  best to narrow this gap and help the poorer families  to

own computers for the benefit of their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT is becoming a big industry, especially in the United

States  of America.  All the new multi-billionaires there  in

the  last  five  years  are in the  IT  industry.   With  the

Internet,  IT  businesses transcend  borders  and  the  world

becomes  our  marketplace.  It is appropriate therefore  that

the  Government should support IT companies in Singapore  and

help  them  to  grow and build a global business.   Hence,  I

commend the Government for setting aside money to nurture and

build   a   critical  mass  of  intellectual   property-based

enterprises in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next subject is regarding the restructuring of the

financial  sector.  I am pleased to note that  the  MAS  will

create  a  more conducive regulatory environment and actively

promote  the financial sector.  In particular, I support  the

five-year  liberalisation  programme  for  domestic   banking

sector  to encourage the development and upgrading  of  local

banks.  I am also happy to note that the Government plans  to

develop  Singapore as a premier insurance  centre.   At  this

point, I would like to declare my interest as a director of a

local  insurance company.  My main concerns are in the  areas

of  ownership of such financial institutions.  Although it is

wise to invite and welcome foreign ownership, whether through

acquisitions  or  mergers, of our financial  institutions,  I

feel   that   we   should  still  require   the   Singaporean

shareholders  to  retain majority control of  such  financial

institutions.   There  is  no doubt that  foreign  ownership,

especially    by    big,   international   and    progressive

institutions, would benefit us, as they bring not only  their

international  networking  and business  clientele  but  also

their  latest financial products and innovations.  I  welcome

their  foreign  talents too, provided there is  a  systematic

process for such foreign talents to transfer their expertise,

skills and knowledge to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>

locals  over a period of time.  However, I believe  that  the

ultimate  majority  control should remain  in  the  hands  of

Singaporeans so that we would have a better control over  our

financial  system.   It  would be a sad  day  indeed  if  all

Singaporeans   end   up   working   for   foreign   financial

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy is a small economy and our biggest

financial institutions are small by world standards.   As  we

all   know,  many  US  Fortune  500  companies  have   market

capitalisations  that  are  larger  than  Singapore's   gross

domestic  product.   It  is therefore  very  easy  for  large

financial  institutions  to  take  control  of  us,  if   our

regulators  allow it.  I would like to ask that  despite  the

liberalisation of the financial sector which I  support,  the

Government  should continue to keep the majority  control  of

Singapore's   financial  institutions   in   the   hands   of

Singaporeans.  The sense and pride of ownership is one of the

social glue that will bind Singaporeans to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch on some issues related to the

Addendum of the Ministry of National Development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that there will be a review of the

Concept Plan to be completed by 2001.  During this review,  I

hope  the  Ministry  will  obtain feedback  and  consult  the

industry  players, members of the public as well as  the  GPC

for National Development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In land scarce Singapore, I fully support the greater

intensified  use of land, whether industrial,  commercial  or

residential.  In fact, in the prime residential areas, I have

always urged the Government to allow the developers to  build

to a much higher density so that more of our people can enjoy

living in prime areas.  In the Concept Plan, when use of land

can  be  increased to a higher plot ratio, there are windfall

profits  to  be  made.  More of such windfall profits  should

accrue to the State than to individuals.  Development charges

should therefore be adjusted accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new downtown will be developed in Marina South. As we

are still in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>

planning  stage, I would encourage the Government to  tap  on

the  expertise of private architects for ideas.  I  urge  the

Government to incorporate more residential developments so as

to bring back more vibrancy and life to the city centre after

working  hours.   There  should be  more  bicycle  lanes  and

pedestrian   walkways  to  make  other  less  pollutive   and

healthier modes of transportation more convenient for  people

working  and living there.  The Government may also  wish  to

consider allowing water-based facilities and activities to be

conducted  in the Marina South waterfront, which Members  can

see  in  Hawaii.  It should be exciting to be able  to  fully

utilise our waterfront not just for commercial use, but  also

recreational.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on the issue once again of the

upgrading  of older private residential housing  estates.   I

have  made  this  call many times and  I  am  glad  that  the

Ministry is planning to look into this object more seriously.

Many  older  private housing estates do not have playgrounds,

parks  or  the LRT in the vicinity.  Many older folks  living

there cannot find the money to pay for the upgrading of their

old  condominium common areas.  Many of them are  retired  or

semi-retired.   I  would  like  to  ask  the  Government   to

reconsider  allowing the use of their CPF, up  to  a  certain

limit,  for  the  payment  of  such  upgrading  costs.    The

reassessment of the new and higher annual values should  also

be  deferred  for  a  few  years so  as  not  to  deter  such

upgrading.  If we do not give private housing estates  enough

incentives, very soon some of these may turn into slums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally, the Government should continue to look into

improving  the  quality lifestyle of our residents.   I  hope

they  can  speed  up  on  the building  of  park  connectors,

walkways  and  bicycle and jogging paths to  make  living  in

Singapore  more  enjoyable.   I  would  like  to  urge   that

playgrounds be built in national parks, including the Botanic

Gardens for people to enjoy and use.  Some parks such as  the

Chinese  and  Japanese Gardens are not well utilised  because

they impose

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>

entrance  fees.   I  would  like to  ask  the  Government  to

consider opening such parks free of charge to all residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, I support the motion standing  in  the

name  of  my  colleague,  Mr Davinder  Singh,  to  thank  the

President for his Address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum to the President's Address, the Ministry

of  Manpower states that it will restore the CPF contribution

as  quickly as possible.  To the workers, this is a piece  of

good news.  The workers have witnessed the rapid recovery  of

the   Singapore  economy  from  the  recession.   During  the

recession, they made sacrifices by resolutely accepting a 10%

reduction in the employers' CPF contribution rate.  Now  that

the  economy has begun to turn around, it is only  fair  that

they be compensated appropriately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will review the long term employers' and

the employees' CPF contribution rate.  There are some rumours

in   the  market  that  eventually  the  employers'  and  the

employees' CPF contribution rate will be set at 15% each way.

Many  union members are asking me whether this is  true.  The

workers  are  very concerned with this matter,  because  this

will affect their savings for retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the MOM's Addendum, it is mentioned that the Ministry

will  refine  the  CPF  system to ensure  that  members  have

adequate  savings  to meet their old age  needs  and  medical

care.   However, there is no mention as to how this could  be

done.  MOM has also stated that they will explore new avenues

for  CPF  members to invest their savings for higher returns.

Everyone  is very happy when they heard this.  Yet there  are

some people who are skeptical as to whether their investments

could  also cause some CPF members to lose part of their  CPF

savings.  Has the Government set up any sort of mechanism  or

system to safeguard the interest of the members when they are

investing their CPF savings?  How do we encourage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>

the  self-employed people to save beyond  Medisave to  better

meet their old age needs?  How do we encourage CPF members to

plan   early  for  adequate  financial  security  for   their

retirement?  Everyone, particularly the workers,  would  like

to  know how much money is considered adequate.  MOM has  not

given us details on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To realise the Singapore 21 Vision, the concerted effort

of  each  and every Singaporean is needed, that  is  to  say,

every  Singaporean should selflessly contribute  his  or  her

best.    Equally  important,  those  in  power,  the  Cabinet

Ministers,  should have the patience and take the trouble  to

explain to the people of Singapore what the intentions of the

policy  are.  Why should certain things be done in a  certain

way  and  by  so doing what benefit would they bring  to  the

people?   So  long  as  the Government  and  the  people  can

continue  to  have this tacit understanding, I  believe  that

Singapore's future is bright and promising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and

Minister  for  Health (Mr Chan Soo Sen)  (In  Mandarin):   Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity

to  speak in support of the motion in the name of Mr Davinder

Singh  to  thank  the  President for his  Address.   I  fully

support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his policy Speech, the President outlined our vision

and  listed  the tasks ahead for us.  To me,  this  is  truly

thought-provoking.  He reminded me of three  Chinese  sayings

about "ku", or hardship:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) chi de ku zhong ku, fang wei ren shang ren (

),

meaning you must be able to endure utmost hardship before you

can be above the others;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) tong gan gong ku ( ), meaning as true

friends  and partners we should share in each other's comfort

and hardship; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) ku jin gan lai ( ), meaning after

enduring hardship, happiness will eventually come.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 Vision is something worthy of all our

people  to  fight  and strive for.  In a sense,  we  have  no

choice  but to strive for it.  This is because we are  facing

very  intense competition. We are like a boat sailing against

the  current.  We must forge ahead or else we will be  driven

back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to succeed, we must have strong fighting

spirit.   Success will not be plain sailing.  There  will  be

hardship to endure.  The three sayings I quoted above are not

only  the trilogy for us to realise our Singapore 21  Vision,

but  they are also the rondo for the long-term endeavours  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to go for the knowledge-based economy. On the

one  hand, we have to work hard.  On the other hand, we  also

have to constantly upgrade ourselves.  So we have to keep  on

learning  and  keep on working hard.  This is  tough  -  real

hardship indeed!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to upgrade ourselves to become a world class

economy, we have to look beyond our own country and  take  in

the  whole  world in view.  We have to strike friendship  and

deal  with  customers  and partners with  different  cultural

backgrounds,   and  to  operate  in  unfamiliar   environment

overseas.  That is also hardship!  I can testify, as  I  have

personally experienced it!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will inevitably encounter frustrations and even

failures. But we have to uphold the spirit of "failure is the

mother  of  success", draw experience from our  failures  and

never say die!  We have to inspire our people to build up the

courage to face failures and anticipate failures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of the story of "The King and the

Spider"  which I read in primary school.  Once upon  a  time,

when  Scotland was at war with England, the King of  Scotland

lost  six  battles  successively against  England.   He  took

shelter at a broken house.  There, he saw a spider making its

web.   When the web was half way through, the wind  blew  and

the  web  was broken.  The spider tried again, but  the  same

thing  happened.   It kept on trying and  trying,  until  the

sixth time, yet it failed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>

again.  The  king  who was taking shelter there  said,  "Poor

spider, you are like me.  I have also lost six battles.  I do

not  think  I should try again."  But the tiny little  spider

refused to give up, and on the seventh time, it succeeded  in

completing its web. The king jumped up in joy and  called  up

all  his  subordinates to prepare for a new  battle.   As  it

turned  out, he won!  This story tells us how we should  face

our failures.  I asked my children whether they have read the

fable.  Both of them said no.  We should create opportunities

for  children to read this kind of story.  If we are used  to

always live in peace and comfort, afraid of losing, afraid of

dying, afraid of uncertainty, afraid of failure, we will have

no  fighting spirit to face the challenge of our future.   We

must  always  aim to move forward.  We must have the  courage

and determination to be creative, to innovate and to find new

ways  and solutions to our problems.  Only then can  we  find

the  new  Promised Land.  So we must be able  to  suffer  the

greatest of hardship, to be up and coming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the other hand, we need not suffer the hardship

in  silence or suffer it alone.  In a traditional society, we

have  happiness to share, we have hardship to share as  well.

So  long  as we have strong family, it will give us strength.

We also have friends to rely on, and the community can remain

cohesive, then all of us will be able to suffer the  hardship

as well as share the happiness together.  In this process, we

will be able to give one another the much needed support,  so

that  in our failure we get sympathy, we get the support from

our  friends,  and  remain  strong  and  unbroken.   When  we

succeed,  we  have also encouragement from  our  friends  and

people to share our happiness and joy.  This makes life rich,

meaningful,  and  interesting.  When  everyone  is  ready  to

suffer  with us and enjoy together, we will be able  to  find

courage  to risk and face failures.  We will then be upright,

strong,  principled, and courageous.  We could then claim  to

have  the  spirit of a world-class nation and  a  world-class

citizen.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after all these struggles, and after all the

hardships,  we  will  succeed.  We  will  reach  the  end  of

hardship  and  taste  the  sweetness  of  success.   This  is

something  that  we  should treasure.  So  we  completed  the

trilogy.   However, we must also remember that we should  not

indulge  in and drown ourselves in sweetness.  We should  not

be arrogant and complacent.  We must remember that we have to

continue to look for, face, and overcome new challenges.  And

in  the struggles and facing the challenges, we will set  new

targets, new goals and new objectives, so that we go  through

the  same  process  of  hardship  again  to  achieve  further

success.   We  will  go back to the first step  of  hardship,

share  that  with  our  community, and then  achieve  success

again.   Hence  the  trilogy gets played  again,  and  again.

Isn't this our rondo?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you may find it gloomy to listen to so much of

hardship  and woes.  But then this was exactly the experience

of  Singapore  65.   In  1965,  we  became  independent.   We

suffered  much  hardship,  much  more  than  now.   But   our

forefathers,  led by our first generation leaders,  all  sang

this  trilogy  of  hardship, and  built  up  a  peaceful  and

prosperous  Singapore for our enjoyment.  Now,  in  1999,  we

placed  emphasis  on  the  Singapore  21  vision.   Like  our

forefathers,  we want to create opportunities  for  our  next

generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see Singapore 21 as a continuation and extension

of  Singapore 65.  We are now much stronger than we  were  in

1965.  So if we could do it in 1965, why can we not do it  in

the year 2000?  We have gone through the trilogy of hardship.

We  are  now entering the next trilogy in our rondo.   Having

sung the first trilogy, we should be more confident about the

second.  So let us get on with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is the great inspiration that we can

derive  from the President's Address.  This is the  challenge

that the President's Address has outlined for us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion standing in the name

of Mr Davinder Singh.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our progress in the past 40 years has laid a firm

foundation for our future development and we will continue to

build  on this foundation and to march into the next  century

in   order   to   meet  the  challenges  brought   about   by

globalisation  and  the  knowledge-based  economy.   However,

while we develop the knowledge-based economy and move towards

being  a globalised cosmopolitan, we should also enhance  the

bonding between the people to build up a caring society. This

is  very  important.   The President  pointed  out  that  the

cohesion  among  the  people  of  Singapore  should  not   be

diminished  just  because of globalisation, particularly  the

gap  between  the  successful and the less successful.   They

should  have  the  ideology to look  after  one  another  and

support one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also made special mention, and I quote,

"Those  who  do  well succeed not simply  through  their  own

efforts,  but  because Singapore society has given  them  the

opportunities to get ahead.  They have an obligation to serve

their  fellow  Singaporeans.   On  their  part,  Singaporeans

should  cheer  for those among us who do well, and  not  envy

them."  I fully agree with the President on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, this is because behind every

successful person, there is always a group of people  who  is

working silently to assist him, and to support him.  As such,

successful  Singaporeans have the moral obligation  to  serve

other  compatriots,  and  to  pay  back  to  society.   Every

successful Singaporean should  start by helping those who are

working  under  them  and the people  around  him,  and  then

extend  his help to the weaker ones in our society.  In  this

way, there will be more great people like Tan Kah Kee and Lee

Kong  Chian,  people  who  are  well  respected  by  all   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past decade, the Government has left no stone

unturned in supporting charitable work and continuously urged

the  successful  Singaporeans to  help  those  who  are  less

successful.    The   Government  has  also   recognised   the

contributions made by the successful people.  This can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>

be  seen by the number of National Day Awards given to  these

people every year.  However, I feel that this recognition  is

still confined to a mere formality only.  We really have  not

recognised  or  built  up a climate that  enables  people  to

respect  these  successful people and support them,  so  that

these  successful people can become the role  model  for  the

young  people to emulate.  I find that the young  people  are

quite  different from the older generation in their  thinking

and in their behaviour.  They are affected by the environment

of a highly commercialized society and the tough competitions

they  are  facing.  They are materialistic, self-centred  and

very kiasu.   Deep in their hearts, they lack the respect and

admiration  for the successful ones.  They do  not  have  the

humility  and modesty to learn from others.  On the contrary,

they  are  full of envy and jealousy, and they express  their

jealousy   in  various  ways  and  this  causes  a   lot   of

embarrassment and disappointment to the successful ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we can guide these people to respect the

successful  ones  through school education, social  education

and  the media, so that more respect could be accorded to the

successful  people.   These  may help  to  change  the  kiasu

mentality of the people and enhance the bonding of the people

in  order  that  the  successful ones can  be  encouraged  to

contribute  more to the less fortunate people.  At  the  same

time,  we should allow those who are less successful to learn

from  the  successful people, to learn from their hard  work.

This  will be more meaningful.  I believe the Government  can

strike  a  balance  between  the  successful  and  the   less

successful people.  Here let me quote an article by the well-known writer You Jin  appearing in the Lianhe Zaobao.  In the

article, she wrote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To do good and expect nothing in return is an inherent

cultivation  and  virtue. Showing gratitude  and  willing  to

reward  a  good  deed is a kind of moral obligation.  If  the

receiver  of  the  benefit has the means in  future  to  help

another person in the same spirit, then this is bringing  the

virtue to higher ground."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, President Nathan also spoke about the

importance  of attracting foreign talents.  He  said,  and  I

quote:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without an infusion of foreign talent to give us that

extra boost, Singapore will not be in the front ranks among

many cities in Asia."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree and support this view of the President.

What I want to point out is that the foreign talents we are

attracting should be those who are able to give us that extra

boost to enable us to have breakthroughs in the fields of

economy, science and technology, culture and the arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, during my meet-the-people-sessions, I observe

that some foreigners who are applying for permanent residence

status and citizenship are not exactly "talents". They do not

have  a  university degree or possess the skills  or  talents

which are needed by Singapore.  They are farmers and ordinary

workers.   Yet, they are granted permanent residence  status.

I  am  puzzled!    The  Government should  set  up  stringent

benchmarks  and  clear criteria when they admit  the  foreign

talents,  so  that there will not be discrepancies  when  the

civil servants carry out their instructions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also said, "Post crisis, we are in a

stronger  position.   But we can expect fiercer  competition,

and  more  daunting challenges."  Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  I

would  like  to point out that we have already weathered  the

regional economic crisis.  However, except for those who were

retrenched and some businessmen, shop-owners and hawkers  who

were  hit by the crisis, many Singaporeans merely had   their

CPF  contributions  cut and were not really  hurt.   This  is

possibly   due   to   the  Government's  prompt   action   in

implementing the second $10.5 billion package of cost-cutting

measures.  It enabled the economy of Singapore to avoid  more

severe   beating,  and  helped  the  economy  to   stabilise.

Therefore, we should inculcate the idea among our people that

we  must have a capable government to lead us through  crises

like  this.   I find that many Singaporeans actually  believe

that  it  is  a natural order of things for Singapore  to  go

through  this economic crisis unscathed.  I do not  deny  the

fact that the developing trend of the world economy,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>

the  Asia-Pacific  economy and the South  East  Asia  economy

since  the  beginning  of this year have  certain  effect  on

Singapore's  economic recovery.   However,  if  not  for  the

Government's  timely intervention by implementing  the  cost-cutting  package  measures  in the  shortest  possible  time,

Singapore's  economy will be like some of  the  countries  in

South East Asia , and unable to get out of recession in  such

a short time.

Therefore, if we can keep on explaining to our people how  we

have tackled our economic crises such as those in 1965, 1976,

1985  and 1998, it would help to make our people realise  the

importance  of having a good government.  I feel that  it  is

very  important to make the people of Singapore realise   the

vulnerability  of Singapore and the need to  constantly  work

hard  and  maintain the spirit of fighting for  survival  and

prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also mentioned that the Government will

revamp its education system so as to prepare our citizens for

the  knowledge-based economy.  The Ministry of Education will

adopt the necessary measures to cater for the different needs

of each and every child according to his learning aptitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I fully support the new

educational measures and reform and to adopt a more  creative

approach to education so that students can have more  avenues

to  develop  their talents and achieve success  in  different

areas.   We have to also address the problems of parents  who

have  this kiasu mentality.  They force-feed  their  children

even  before they have started attending school, putting them

through very heavy scheduled ballet class, piano lesson,  art

class, swimming lesson, performing class, recitation of  Tang

poems,  etc.   The  poor children have lost  their  childhood

innocence,  and are being pressurised until near  suffocation

even at a very tender age.  Although children can absorb  all

kinds  of knowledge, there is a limit to it.  We should  also

pay  attention to their character formation.  We  should  not

force-feed them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem I would like to raise is the problem

raised by the Prime Minister at the National Day Rally.   The

issue is on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>

the  use of Singlish.  This is a common social phenomenon and

it  is  a  common  way  of communication among  the  ordinary

citizens. Although it is not good to use adulterated English,

it is, after all, a by-product of our multi-racial and multi-lingual  society.    It  was only when I  realise  that  some

Singaporeans who speak pure English and not Singlish are also

not able to speak standard English and write standard English

that I begin to understand how very important it was for  the

Prime  Minister  to  raise this issue  of  speaking  standard

English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that I am a Chinese-educated MP. I am

unable  to speak standard English.  Yet, I reject the use  of

adulterated  English,  just as I do  not  agree  with  people

speaking  adulterated  Mandarin.  During  my  business  trips

overseas,   whenever  I  hear our Singaporeans  speaking  the

Singapore-style  of Mandarin, I would try  my  best  to  stop

them.   Whether they are speaking English, Mandarin or Malay,

the  foreigners just cannot understand what they are talking.

The  adulterated languages of Singapore are generated because

of  the  multi-racial  environment.   Most  Singaporeans  can

understand this type of language, but the foreigners do not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote you an example. When I was in China, I

actually  heard  a Singaporean speaking, "My  brother  kahwin

liao."    All Singaporeans present could understand  what  he

was  talking  about.   But in China, England  or  the  United

States, I am sure the people there would have no clue at  all

as  to  what  he  was  talking  about.     Therefore,  it  is

important for the Government to promote the correct usage  in

English, in Malay, in Mandarin.  I think it is very important

to  our efforts to enhance our capability and then to promote

a  knowledge-based economy.  We should not resort to the  use

of  sub-standard language, whether it is Singlish or  various

forms of  Mandarin.  Because of our environmental limits, our

Mandarin  may not be as good as that of the others,  and  our

standard  of  Chinese is lower than others.   This  does  not

amount to giving us the right to use and promote sub-standard

Chinese and Mandarin.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>

Likewise,  our standard of written and spoken English  cannot

be  compared  to  that of the United Kingdom and  the  United

States  of America.  This does not mean to say that we cannot

write   grammatically  correct  English  and  speak  standard

English.   In the promotion of the use of standard languages,

besides the efforts of the school teachers, the press and the

various media also play very important roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to tell you the real-life joke

concerning  another Singaporean who speaks pure English.    I

would  like to declare my interest  as a publisher. In August

this  year, I came across this real-life incident.   A  pure-English speaking Singaporean and a number of journalists from

the  English  language newspaper criticised  a  certain  book

compiled  by  an English author and alleged that  there  were

"full  of  grammatical  mistakes" in  the  book.   They  even

captioned the article as: "50 language bloopers" (The  Sunday

Times,  1st  August 1999).  As a reader, my first  impression

would  be  that the report and criticism by this pure-English

speaking  Singaporean and the journalists  from  the  English

language newspaper, because my standard of English is not  as

high  as  theirs,  must be correct.  I  am  sure  many,  many

Singaporeans must have believed that the newspaper report was

accurate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, upon consultation with this English author

himself,  I  realise  that  the  criticism  by  the   English

newspaper  on the grammar taught in this book was  not  quite

correct.   This  illustrates  the  point  that  the  English-speaking   Singaporeans   can   sometimes   regard    correct

grammatical usage as being wrong usage, and treat some  wrong

usage  as  correct,  and then launch an  attack  openly.    A

reader  wrote  to   the  Consumers Association  of  Singapore

(CASE) and complained about wrong  grammar being used in  the

book.   She   doubted  the identity of the author,  and  even

telephoned  the  publishers  to send  a  punitive  expedition

against them.  What I do not understand is why is it that she

herself   could   not  differentiate  between   the   correct

grammatical  usage and the wrong usage, yet  she  behaved  as

though she

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>

was having justice on her side.  Why can they not be like the

Lianhe  Zaobao  in hiring a panel or a high-quality  language

specialist to authenticate the English used in their reports.

So  from  this incident, I learn the importance of the  Prime

Minister's insistence of speaking standard English.  If we do

not  turn this around and correct the mistake, then we  would

be  criticised by the foreigners that the standard of English

here is very poor and it would be difficult for Singapore  to

make  it to the list of globalised international cosmopolitan

cities.   Just as this English author was telling me, he  was

surprised  that  the  standard of English  in  Singapore  has

dropped  so dramatically over the last few years.   There  is

nothing I could say about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Singaporeans have very good

linguistic  abilities.   Many  Singaporeans  can  speak  many

languages.    However,   they   are   generalists   and   not

specialists.  They are not proficient in any of the languages

-  neither here nor there.  The Prime Minister's  emphasis on

the use of standard English is not only very timely, but only

serves  as  a  warning  to our bilingual educational  system.

Apart  from emphasising the use of correct English, we should

have  a better use of standard language in the media, in  the

television, radio and the newspapers.  The television and the

radio  stations should introduce some high quality programmes

so as to enhance the language standard of our audiences.  The

Government departments

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>

and  some companies should also conduct some language classes

to  help  their staff to improve their language standard.   I

feel  that  our bilingual system is a good one and we  should

yield  good  results  which would enable  us  to  accept  the

challenges of the new century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.
