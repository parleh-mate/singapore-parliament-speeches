<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

AAA 1004*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Tay Boon Too, Ang Nam Piau, L. P. Rodrigo, P. Govindaswamy, Sia Khoon Seong, N. Govindasamy and Ho Kah Leong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make some comments on the

restructure of the education system,  to  which  a

remarkable  amount  of publicity  has  been  given

during this Budget season - but outside the House.

In  the debate on the Minister of Finance's Budget

statement,  I  did  remark  adversely  on  certain

statements about restructure, but these statements

were  really  marginal to the statement  of  basic

principle.  For  example,  I  disagreed  that  the

changes in the past 15 years had been minor and  I

also   felt  that  there  could  have  been   more

consultation  with teachers and  teachers'  bodies

over the definition of policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said this, where the basic principles

germane   to   restructure  are  concerned,   such

principles have been stated in a manner that makes

the  restructure  look like the  answer  to  every

teacher's   prayer.  Behold,  Mr   Speaker,   Sir,

schooling  should  be made a more  meaningful  and

enjoyable  experience;  continual  assessment   of

academic  performance shall ensure  that  children

are  brought  through  their schooling  with  full

appreciation   of   their   abilities   or   their

limitations.  By implication the very  intelligent

would not find schooling a boring experience,  and

slow  developers would receive due  consideration.

The  promise  is made that every student  who  has

completed  primary  education will  be  channelled

into  some  form  of  post-primary  education   or

training.  Thus  by providing alternative  avenues

for  different  aptitudes, our resources  will  be

optimally utilised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent seminar on the restructure of the

education  system, suggestions  were  sought  from

participants  who were principals  from  all  over

Singapore   regarding  how  to   achieve   certain

outcomes that were envisaged as following upon the

aim   to   make  schooling  more  meaningful   and

enjoyable   and   the  aim  to  ensure   continual

assessment  of academic performance. Now  this  is

the  real  nub  of the restructure intention:  the

determination  to  achieve this intention  and  to

implement  vigorously and steadily what  has  been

conceived  of  as  a good plan.  Views  have  been

sought  over aspects of implementation. Now  these

views  have  been  forthcoming, and  in  terms  of

stress   on   certain  lines   of   action,   some

recommendations  standing out quite  clearly.  For

example,    children   should   have    pre-school

experience  through kindergarten; learning  should

be  through activities and experience that  appeal

to the children's interest and imagination, as for

instance, excursions, projects, effective  use  of

apparatus  and aids, the application of a  variety

of  methods  and techniques; resort to educational

hardware,  necessitating of course the  production

of corresponding soft ware, group teaching, multi-level  teaching and close monitoring  of  progress

through     personal     observation,     informal

questioning, written assignments, stage by  stage,

unit by unit. Above all, classroom size should  be

reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has come out with a

classic  education proposal. In  soliciting  views

over  implementation  they have  received  classic

educational answers. Teachers are looking  forward

to participating in this thrilling development. My

observation  has  been  that  most  teachers  have

stretched themselves to the limit in their work in

schools.  I am speaking here particularly  of  the

primary  schools  where the  new  policy  will  be

initiated.  Without the organisation  of  manpower

and  resources to help the teachers, this proposal

that has been presented with such a bang will  end

in a whimper. More manpower is required,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



more    training    facilities   and    retraining

facilities. And certainly the production of  first

class   supervisors  in  the  shape   of   capable

education  development officers  who  will  really

advise  on development and not perpetuate the  old

inspectors  role.  All these are  needed.  In  the

conclusion  to the official November statement  on

the restructure there was recognition of all these

needs. If the Ministry makes its own response in a

rational, positive, understanding manner, we  need

have  no  fear  about how the teachers  themselves

will respond to the challenge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in recent years the Ministry of

Education  has wielded the big axe in implementing

the  restructuring  of  our education  system  and

introduction   of  new  teaching   methods.   Such

measures  are not only necessary but also welcome.

This  is  because, unlike other fields,  education

cannot  remain  as it has always been.  We  cannot

teach new ideas with old methods. Teaching methods

must  be  formulated  to suit  the  needs  of  the

country  and changing circumstances. Only in  this

way  can  we bring forth a generation to meet  the

needs  of  the changing times in our country.  But

the  new  education  system now  being  vigorously

implemented  should also cater for  the  objective

need  for  adequate  school  buildings  and  other

facilities, in addition to good quality  teachers.

Only in this way can we achieve maximum results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, small schools in the rural areas have very

little space. Their simple buildings are very  old

and  dilapidated, and there is  a  total  lack  of

facilities.  In such circumstances, we  can  apply

the  saying  which goes, "You may  have  the  best

cook,   but   he  cannot  cook  without   adequate

ingredients."  I,  therefore, suggest  that  small

schools  in  the rural areas should be amalgamated

into larger schools.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education should treat all

schools alike and give the best possible financial

aid to all the amalga



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



mated  schools. It is only through an amalgamation

of  the small schools that we can ensure a certain

standard  of  facilities and school buildings  for

the  rural areas. It will then be in keeping  with

the implementation of the new education system. In

this way, every child in Singapore will be able to

enjoy  the  opportunity of  a  good  education  in

better equipped surroundings and school buildings



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to

bring  up  another matter, and that is in relation

to  the  announcement of results of secondary  and

higher   secondary  school  examinations  in   the

newspapers.  The  results of  the  Primary  School

Leaving Examination are not normally published  in

the  newspapers. Notwithstanding this, cases  have

been  known where unsuccessful PSLE students  have

left their homes or their families. The results of

Secondary   IV  and  Pre-U  or  HSC  examinations,

however,  are  announced in the newspapers.  As  a

result   of   such   public   announcement,   some

unsuccessful   candidates   would    develop    an

inferiority  complex  by not  seeing  their  names

together with their classmates' in the newspapers.

They  feel that they are put in a very poor light,

and  are more or less put to public shame,  so  to

speak.  In  such circumstances, those unsuccessful

candidates  who  do  not have a  strong  sense  of

morale  would simply lose face and would  even  do

very    foolish   things,   unpleasant   or   even

unfortunate. This is regrettable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore suggest that we cease the

publication  of examination results.  The  results

can  only  be  made known to all  the  candidates,

including those from the Adult Education Board, by

the   school  authorities  or  the  AEB.   Private

candidates  can  be  directly  notified  of  their

results  through  the  post  by  the  Ministry  of

Education.  There is, therefore, no apparent  need

for  the  results  of  these  examinations  to  be

published   in   the  newspapers,   because   such

announcement  may  cause an  unnecessary  blow  to

unsuccessful candidates,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



at   least   psychologically.  I  would  therefore

suggest   to   the  Ministry  of  Education   that

henceforth   results  of  the   secondary   school

examinations  should  not  be  published  in   the

newspapers.  This practice should be abolished.  I

would,  however, concede that the  publication  of

the  results  of  very  outstanding  students  may

continue,  because it will then give encouragement

to our students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to touch on the

question  of Chinese stream Secondary IV  students

entering pre-U classes. In the case of the Chinese

schools,  those  who  desire  to  continue   their

studies  in the upper secondary classes will  only

be allowed to join the classes after their results

are  known,  so as to assess whether they  possess

the minimum standard of qualification specified by

the Ministry of Education. So students wishing  to

join upper secondary classes have to wait for  two

to   three  months.  And  this  year  because  the

Secondary IV results were announced only in March,

our  poor  students had to wait  for  nearly  four

months  before they can enter the upper  secondary

classes to further their studies. We concede  that

it takes considerable time to mark the examination

papers.  But we must not forget that at  the  same

time  Secondary IV students in the English  stream

are allowed to join the upper secondary classes on

the  strength  of  the results of the  preliminary

examinations conducted by the schools.  And  after

the  official announcement of their results,  they

may  either  continue if their  results  meet  the

entry  requirements specified by the  Ministry  of

Education  or  drop out if they do not  meet  such

requirements. Since this is allowed in the English

stream, I wonder why it cannot be allowed  in  the

Chinese stream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has always been saying that

all  the  four  streams of education  are  treated

equally. So how does one explain this discrepancy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment moved by the Member

for Katong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, education is the foundation for nation

building. In recent years,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



our  education  policy  has  laid  stress  on  the

importance  of mathematics, science and technology

and   bi-lingualism  in  order  to  help  in   the

promotion of nation building. But in doing so, the

inculcation  of  character  building,  moral   and

ethical   concepts  in  the  students   has   been

neglected  by  the Ministry of Education.  We  all

know that there is the subject called "Ethics"  or

"Civics"  taught in many schools  but  it  is  not

considered   as   a   subject   for   examination.

Therefore, the students do not pay much  attention

to  this subject and the teachers themselves  lack

interest  in  teaching it. In fact, some  of  them

even   use  the  Ethics  period  to  teach   other

subjects.  As  a  result, the inculcation  of  the

concept  of moral virtues of the students has  not

been effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not profit in adapting education to

meet  social  development and national  needs.  We

should not do it at the expense of inculcating the

ethical  concept  and character  building  in  the

students.  If  a  person is brought  up  to  be  a

specialist  or  a  professor, but  is  lacking  in

morals, character or ethical concept, then of what

use is he to our society? So we should not try  to

educate  our students into becoming robots without

a sense of morality and responsibility to society.

Therefore, moral education is very important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore hope that the Minister will pay

attention to this very important matter  and  make

adjustments,  if necessary, to include  ethics  or

civics as one of the examination subjects, so that

we  can  bring  up a generation of  students  with

moral character and imbued with a sense of loyalty

and  patriotism. Only then can the future  of  our

country be assured.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as expected the Ministry of

Education has attracted a large number of speakers

in  this Budget debate. The reason is that in  the

last analysis education decides the performance of

the nation. A creditable performance of the nation

depends on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



collective courage, determination, ability and the

social  morality  of  the  people.  Thus  if   the

education of the State ensures that every  citizen

develops  with these potentials, then collectively

the nation should perform successfully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the education system has been

restructured again, and this time we hope for some

appreciable   period,  I   wish   to   make   some

observations on the restructuring as announced and

the implications arising from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, Sir, the problem of sufficient

classes  and  teachers comes to mind.  Though  the

majority   of  primary  school  pupils   will   be

completing  the primary education in  seven  years

(as  that  will  be the normal course  of  primary

education), the Minister has stated that about 40%

of   primary  school  pupils  will  be  completing

primary education in six years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as the Minister has announced, there will

be  in operation two sets of upper primary classes

in  the  primary  schools. Now, if  you  take  the

hypothetical case of a school having  two  Primary

III   classes   at  the  outset,  and   if   after

assessment, eight pupils from the first class  and

15 pupils from the second class, making 23 in all,

are   found   suitable  for  six  years'   primary

education  and  the remaining 27 pupils  from  the

first  class and 20 pupils from the second  class,

making  47  in all, are found suitable  for  seven

years' primary education, then for Primary IV, you

will,  have one class of 23 pupils for six  years'

primary education and two classes for seven years'

primary  education  comprising  one  class  of  35

pupils  and another of 12 pupils (that is, if  you

apply  the ratio of 35 pupils to a class). If  the

position  rests  there, it means  that  after  the

assessment one additional class is created and one

additional teacher is required. If adjustments are

made,  it  must  mean  transfers  of  pupils   and

teachers  for  that  year. How  has  the  Ministry

planned    to   resolve   these   problems?    And

incidentally, Sir, thinking aloud,  what  will  be

the  stand  of  the Singapore Teachers'  Union  on

these problems? But the important thing is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



that parents must be satisfied that the results of

the  assessment  must not be manipulated  for  the

purpose  of  administrative  expediency   at   the

expense  of  the  true  academic  ability  of  the

pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been announced that the decision of

whether a pupil should take six or seven years  to

complete his primary education will be based on  a

"continual    assessment    of    his     academic

performance".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should think that the assessment itself should

be based on certain standard forms and criteria of

evaluating the academic performance of the  pupil.

If not, the disparities in the evaluations between

different  schools applying individualistic  forms

and criteria will not achieve a fair assessment of

the  pupils'  performances.  Have  the  forms  and

criteria of assessment been worked out? If not,  I

imagine  they  will be worked out soon.  And  when

they are worked out, can they be applied fairly to

assess the pupil's academic performance in Primary

I  in  1973  and  Primary II  in  1974  when  this

continual  assessment was then  not  contemplated?

How   and   to   what  extent  will  the   pupil's

performance  in the second language in  the  first

three years be decisive in determining whether the

pupil does primary education in six years or seven

years?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been announced that normal primary

education  will  be  seven  years  and  that   the

majority  of  primary pupils will  complete  their

education  in  seven years. But it has  also  been

announced,  as  I have pointed out  earlier,  that

about  40%  of  primary pupils will  complete  the

primary  education in six years.  This  cannot  be

regarded as an exception. And although it has been

announced  that  corrective reassessment  will  be

made  at  the end of Primary IV, parents generally

will  regard the assessment at the end of  Primary

III  as crucial since they still see promise of  a

better future for their children through the  OCE,

the HSC and beyond.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents will regard the assessment at the end of

Primary III as a more or less



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



conclusive   determination  of  their   children's

future,  that is, whether they are blue collar  or

white  collar workers. This being so, they  expect

the  more  able  and experienced  teachers  to  be

assigned to teach in Primary Is, IIs and IIIs. Nor

should these teachers be transferred before  three

years  at least. I am sure that no relief teachers

will be assigned to these classes in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the PSLE and beyond, the Minister has

stated that the PSLE will be a grading exercise to

channel  pupils into different forms of  secondary

education and training. Apart from the "0" and "A"

levels  in  the academic, technical and commercial

streams,  there  will  be  a  variety  of  courses

combining   general   education   with   technical

training  or  apprenticeship  scheme  plan  for  a

career  in the industrial, commercial and  service

sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has announced that the restructured

system  at  the  secondary level will  operate  in

1979.  He has also announced that the restructured

process  will begin with Primary III  pupils  this

year  and the 1975 batch of Primary IV pupils will

continue but making only one other attempt for the

PSLE. Thus in three years commencing in 1976 these

primary  pupils will be graded at the end of  1978

for the restructured system at the secondary level

in  1979.  So  at the end of 1978  there  will  be

grading  of  PSLE  pupils to decide  whether  they

should do courses leading to the GCE or HSC or any

of   the  other  courses  for  a  career  in   the

industrial,  commercial and service sectors.  Such

grading  must  be based on revised  upper  primary

curriculum to operate in 1976, that is, next year.

Can  the  Minister at this stage give  an  outline

description  of the other courses? When  will  the

curriculum  for operation in 1976  be  ready  this

year and be made public?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised these queries in order that the

public  can  grasp  the system  fully,  since  the

matter  of children's education is always a matter

of utmost concern to parents.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Education Ministry is a very

interesting  Ministry  as  far  as  Singapore   is

concerned. It seems to be undergoing changes every

so  often that the result is chaos, confusion  and

puzzlement to everyone. Even those in the Ministry

are  confused as to what they are supposed to  do.

Worse, in schools the policy changes so often that

principals and staff do not know exactly  what  is

really  required. What is the future of  education

in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask whether these changes or restructuring

are really necessary. Can we not implement them in

stages   and  with  great  patience?  The   policy

directives from the Education Ministry are  issued

so  rapidly  that  before  one  directive  can  be

carried  out effectively a new one is  issued.  We

seem  to  make  use of the present  generation  of

students  and teachers as guinea pigs.  I  do  not

know  whether this restructuring is  a  wise  move

because  the  changes have been so rapid  that  we

will  not  be  able to see the results  until  the

students leave the secondary schools. And by  that

time  probably they will not know what  hell  they

have  gone  through. Let us be a bit more  patient

and give it a little more thought. I am not saying

that the changes are bad. I am not saying that the

policies  are  bad. The policy of bilingualism  is

extremely  good.  It is necessary for  Singapore's

survival.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



Carry  on  by all means, but do so in stages.  The

Ministry  should  not  just issue  directives  and

instruct  the principals to put them into practice

overnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that there are 125 vacancies for

English teachers in primary schools and 215 in the

secondary schools in the English stream as at  1st

March, 1975. This gives a figure of 340, which,  I

must  say, is very high. To make matters worse,  I

notice there were 301 resignations within a period

of  14  months. What is being done to  fill  these

vacancies?  340  vacancies  are  being  filled  by

relief  teachers,  some of  whom  come  today  and

disappear tomorrow. They are not teachers  in  the

real  sense  of the word. They are merely  filling

the  gap. How can we have a good education  system

if  340  vacancies are filled by relief  teachers?

This is a very sad state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the Institute of Education, formerly

known  as the Teachers' Training College, used  to

recruit  teachers  by  the  hundreds  and  produce

teachers by the hundreds too. Unfortunately, after

the TTC was renamed the Institute of Education, it

has    become   another   white   elephant.   Many

accommodation units in the former College  are  as

good   as   haunted.  Many  teachers   have   been

transferred or opted out. There are a few of  them

left.  To make matters worse, students who  intend

to  take up teaching as a profession have to  pay.

Now,  give us the answer in one breath who  really

wants  to  become a teacher today,  with  all  the

headaches  and pressure of work? The stresses  and

strains  are not really worth the money  they  get

for their training. Even the courses organised  by

the Institute of Education have to be paid for  by

the teachers. No wonder we have 340 vacancies! 301

resignations  had  taken place  in  the  last  two

years. What has been done to recruit more teachers

to  fill  the vacancies? 340 vacancies  means  340

teachers less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I at this stage ask what is the purpose of

the  Education Fund? A lot of money  is  collected

from  the foreign students studying in schools  or

colleges in Singapore. If these funds are used



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



for the good of the Singapore citizens, then I say

the  fund has its purpose. Unfortunately I do  not

understand  why a large sum of money is  collected

from  students who study in private or  commercial

schools.  These  private schools are  not  in  the

least  subsidised. Yet any student  who  wants  to

gain  entry into these private schools has to  pay

to  the  Education Fund before he  is  allowed  to

continue  his  studies. I feel this  is  ethically

wrong. We do not subsidise private schools. Why do

we collect money from students who are studying in

private schools? If it is the case with Government

schools, it is understandable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that some school children are

given  fund  raising cards for  donations  to  the

school fund just before the school holidays.  They

are  instructed  to collect as much  as  possible.

When  the  school reopens these cards  are  handed

back  to the teachers. Some children who have  not

collected the targeted amount are given  back  the

cards and instructed to continue to collect up  to

the  required amount. I wonder why these  students

are  asked  to  collect up to a  certain  expected

amount.  This  might  induce the  children  to  do

something irregular for fear of being harassed  by

the teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point let me ask why GCE "A" level in

Commerce course is not allowed to be conducted  in

private  schools. This course is only  done  in  a

Government  school.  There  are  certain   schools

capable  of conducting such a course, and  I  feel

that  some of them may produce better results than

the Government schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, on the subject of courses, let me

also  ask why is a restriction imposed on teachers

who  wish to do a course on their own? To give  an

example, if a teacher in the academic stream wants

to  do  a technical course, permission is refused.

The  result is that the teacher is frustrated. Why

must  we restrict teachers who are keen to improve

themselves  and  who will be  of  benefit  to  our

education system later on?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how far has the posting of teachers and'

students nearest their homes been carried  out?  I

still  notice that a great number of teachers  and

students are put in~ schools quite a distance away

from  their homes. Can the Minister look into  the

matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will I would like to know when results

of  the recent teachers exercise be known? I  hope

greater  number  of  them will  be,  thus  causing

lesser dissatisfaction.

Teachers  are  very  important  in  education   of

children. Their importance is next to the parents.

If  the  teachers not properly educated, they  not

produce  good  students. If the re  well  educated

they will be of benefit to the students.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the sixth under this

subhead  I am somewhat at a disadvantage  for  the

simple  reason that whatever I want to  been  very

eloquently  and put across by hon. Members  spoken

before me. But I feel nonetheless say something on

this restructured education scheme because it  has

aroused considerable interest both from within and

is House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that, of all the changes in the

educational  policy  that have  taken  place  past

decade  or  so,  the  recent have  been  the  most

sensible  they are oriented towards the well-being

and  interest; unlike previous changes which  were

tailored  the political, social, economic manpower

objectives. The recent are not geared to meet such

objectives but more to cater to the well-the child

in school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two features of these changes demonstrate this.

One  is  that  schooling has been extended  to  11

years in both primary and secondary levels instead

of 10 years. In fact, all of us in this House were

brought up under the 11-year education system.  It

was only a decade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



or  so  ago that the 11-year education system  was

reduced  to 10 years, and I suspect that  at  that

time  the  reason for the reduction of one  year's

schooling  was  purely  economic:  the  Government

wanted  to save money. I could see no other reason

for the reduction of schooling from 11 to 10 years

except  this economic reason. And the  price  paid

for  that  reduction was that  children  were  put

under  heavier  pressure to cope  with  a  certain

amount of knowledge to be acquired both in primary

and secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members will know, in recent years because of

economic    and   political   developments,    new

requirements  have  come into  the  picture.  More

objectives  are pumped into the education  system,

and  more  knowledge for the children to  acquire.

Even  under the old system, where there  had  been

many subjects for children to learn, 11 years were

considered  a  desirable period for completion  of

the  primary  and secondary education;  what  more

then  if  they have got more to learn now?  It  is

only  logical  to conclude that a  10-year  period

would  not  be  a desirable period.  That  is  the

reason  why in the past few years there have  been

complaints  from  parents particularly  about  the

pressure put on their children in the schools.  So

an extension of another year helps to relieve that

pressure. This feature in itself demonstrates that

this is for the good of the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second feature of the recent restructured

education scheme is the removal of the Primary  VI

entrance   examination  (PSLE)  as  a   means   to

determine  whether  a  child could  continue  with

secondary education. I think many of us have heard

of  complaints and are quite aware of this problem

of  examination phobia, where everything is geared

towards  examination. A child is measured  by  the

examination  results.  The  system   is   a   very

imperfect one. A child is condemned for life if he

fails  his  Primary VI entrance  examination.  Any

teacher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



will  know  that passing or failing this  entrance

examination   is   no   foolproof   criterion   in

determining   whether  a  child  is   capable   of

continuing  his  education or not.  Not  only  was

there  anxiety on the part of parents and children

over  this  entrance examination in  the  previous

system  which caused a lot of cramming of  studies

and  private tuition but it also made schooling  a

very  unpleasant experience for the  children.  By

removing this requirement, education should become

an interesting experience in school. Therefore, we

have  removed  a feature which condemns  a  child,

rightly  or wrongly, by denying him an opportunity

to  continue  with  his  education  after  primary

school  if  he  fails  his  primary  six  entrance

examination.  With  this  restructured   education

system  an  examination is  no  longer  needed  to

determine  whether a child should  or  should  not

proceed  to  secondary school.  I  think  this  is

extremely  desirable and in the interests  of  the

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There exists a prejudice against blue-collar work

and a preference for white-collar work. The result

is  that  certain  prejudices are created  against

certain types of jobs. Recent developments in  our

country  as an independent nation, where  we  have

developed into a modern society, have given us the

opportunity to reflect that no matter what sort of

job  a  person performs he has a role to play  and

there  is  an  importance to it,  irrespective  of

whether it is a white-collar or a blue-collar job.

Everybody  has  a  role  to  play.  We  must  have

doctors,  lawyers,  clerks, teachers,  blue-collar

workers,  etc.  We must encourage parents  not  to

show   any  prejudice  against  certain  jobs   in

preference for others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this restructured system, which caters for

the  children's future secondary education in  the

aptitude  they  are most suited  for,  either  for

academically-inclined  subjects  leading  to   the

university,   or   technically-inclined   subjects

leading to polytechnic, or craft-inclined subjects

leading to vocational training, we will ultimately

have a well balanced all round development of  our

manpower  resources  in  terms  of  the  different

strata



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



in  our whole manpower requirements. We will  have

skilled  and trained people in all strata  of  our

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from all these desirable features, one

can  hardly  find  fault with  the  rationale  and

objective behind these changes. So it must be  the

concern of everybody - Ministry officials, Members

of  Parliament, members of the public, parents and

teachers  -  to give all their support  to  ensure

that these objectives are attained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, express my reservation at this

juncture  as to whether the Ministry of  Education

is  able  to  gear itself to meet these challenges

ahead. Judging from past experience, I think  they

have  not  got a commendable record  in  terms  of

performance to give us the kind of confidence. But

we  must not give up hope simply because too  much

is  at stake. Perhaps we give them a chance and we

will do what we can to see how we can help them to

achieve this objective. So if I appear to be  very

much  in  favour of these changes,  that  has  got

nothing  to do with the fact that I like the  very

charming smile of the Education Minister. They are

certainly very desirable objectives which  all  of

us must assist to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Katong has brought up some

very    interesting   points   as   regards    the

requirements and demands of teachers, training and

retraining  facilities, etc. I  therefore  do  not

wish  to  repeat what he has said, except  to  say

that I completely agree with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those remarks, Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

think  I  have  had my say although it  was  quite

difficult  for  me  not to repeat  certain  points

which have already been raised by other Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, after seeing the list of six speakers ahead

of  me, and practically all of them touched on the

restructured education system, I thought  I  would

ask  you  to appeal to the Minister once again  to

answer the questions raised first, before I speak.

But  having heard the hon. Member for Moulmein who

so ably assisted the Minister in the first half of

the debate, I would carry on with some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



other  issues, not necessarily on the restructured

education system. I think my mind has been put  at

ease   in  respect  of  certain  matters  on   the

restructured education system, not by the Minister

as yet but by the hon. Member for Moulmein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not going to touch on the restructured

education system. My intention is to talk  on  our

education policy in respect of the teaching of the

second  language  in our schools  and  the  relief

teachers, which point has somewhat been tackled by

the  hon. Member for Anson. There is a great  deal

of dissatisfaction amongst parents and teachers in

respect  of  the teaching of Tamil  and  Malay  as

second languages in our schools. The complaint  is

that there are many English schools and integrated

primary  schools where Malay and Tamil pupils  are

grouped   together  permanently  in   one   class,

irrespective of educational achievements. This  is

just  to  make it convenient to teach  the  second

language and also to ease administrative problems.

It  is  claimed  that  many schools  perhaps  have

grouped  their  pupils according to  their  second

language   choice  in  order  to  facilitate   the

arrangement  of  time-tables. No consideration  at

all  is given to their second language ability nor

their first language performance.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been informed that all Tamil and Malay

pupils  in the Selegie Integrated Primary  School,

Telok  Kurau Primary School and Whitley  Secondary

School have been put in one class permanently  for

this  year.  Is it also true that in  the  Selegie

Integrated  Primary School, one class of  English-medium pupils are all Indians? Will not the system

of  segregation work contrary to the  Government's

policy  of maintaining a multiracial character  in

the  schools?  Will  not  this  defeat  the  whole

meaning and spirit of the school's pledge and  the

Government's effort to bring about a  mingling  of

all  races  in the school classrooms  as  well  as

school playing fields?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been pointed out that the teaching of

Tamil  in  many mission primary schools  has  been

dropped completely. If pupils in mission primary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



schools   offered  to  take  Tamil  as  a   second

language, what provisions are being made?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better known old and well established secondary

schools like Gan Eng Seng School, Beatty Secondary

School  and  Bartley Secondary School, which  were

centres   for  teaching  of  Tamil  as  a   second

language, have been closed down. These centres,  I

have been told, were the oldest in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, there are many teachers who have

attained the required qualifications in Tamil  and

Malay  to be recruited as Tamil and Malay Language

teachers, and yet English-medium teachers who have

obtained  a credit or a distinction in the  second

language  have been asked to teach Malay or  Tamil

as a second language. Why is this being done?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that the Institute of Education has

stopped   training   Malay  and   Tamil   Language

teachers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as early as 1969, six years ago, I objected

to  the  employment  of  relief  teachers  by  the

Ministry  of Education. In Hansard [Vol. 28,  col.

639],  I queried the necessity of employing  large

numbers  of daily-rated relief teachers  for  long

periods.  In answer to the many questions  raised,

among  other  things, the Minister for  Education,

who  was then the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for Education, replied as follows. Let me

quote him [Vol. 28, col. 937]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The work of the relief teachers is under constant

review by the principals who make reports on their

performances.'



<br><br>This  was in 1969. Sir, again in 1971, on the same

question of relief teachers [Vol. 30, col. 539], I

asked the then Minister of State, now the Minister

for Education, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.what concrete steps are being taken to do

away  with  the  method  of employing  unqualified

relief  teachers to man our schools in such  large

numbers.?.



<br><br>He answered and I quote him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`..we cannot do away entirely with relief

teachers.  .  .  , they are employed  in  a  great

variety of situations such as maternity leave  and

so on. The pure vacancies will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



filled  when graduates come out from the Teachers'

Training College.'



<br><br>In  answer  to queries raised by other Members  of

this  House, on the same topics, he also  told  us

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.the programme of training of relief teachers

will  be  carried  out under the whole  review  of

teacher training.'



<br><br>When  the  Member for Moulmein asked to  introduce

part-time  training  as  a  way  to  minimise  the

problem  of  having  to employ  large  numbers  of

relief  teachers to meet the shortages of teachers

in schools, he again affirmed that he was carrying

out  an  overall review of teacher training.  Sir,

that  was  1969 and 1971. This is 1975.  What  has

happened?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th March, in answer to questions raised in

Parliament,     the    Parliamentary     Secretary

(Education)  told us that 383 relief teachers  are

employed to fill the regular vacancies in addition

to  175  relief teachers employed to  fill  casual

vacancies arising from regular teachers being away

on  various forms of leave. In other words, 175 of

them are relief teachers in respect of people  who

are  away  from  their jobs and 383  of  them  are

filling  pure vacancies, the pure vacancies  which

the Minister promised to fill as early as 1971.  I

am   just   wondering  if  there  are  any   other

professions  in the world where they have  such  a

situation.  Sir,  can  you imagine  our  hospitals

manned  by  unqualified relief  nurses  dispensing

medicine and giving injections. Worse still,  Sir,

can   you   imagine  unqualified   relief   nurses

assisting  you  in an operating theatre.  Sir,  if

unqualified people dispense medicine we call  them

quacks.  If unqualified people tried to  interpret

laws  we call them "lawyer burok". What do we call

unqualified teachers trying to teach?  Perhaps  we

have  got to think of a suitable nomenclature.  If

we   allow  this  situation  to  continue  in  the

Ministry of Education, I am sure the Minister  for

Health - fortunately for us he is not here  -  may

also  introduce  such  a  system  to  relieve  the

shortage of staff in the hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of Education, there are more than

10,000 teachers. There certainly would be a number

of teachers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



on   various   forms  of  leave  at   all   times.

Apparently, at the moment, 175 of them are away on

one  form of leave or the other. To relieve  them,

what  we need is a pool of qualified teachers  who

can  be utilised to do relief work instead of  the

present  system  of appointing unqualified  relief

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When can we expect our children to be taught by

qualified  people  and not by  unqualified  relief

teachers who come and go as they please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I first explain that

as  one of the office-bearers in a teachers' union

I  am  naturally  more concerned with  educational

problems. Although I am placed last on the list of

speakers in regard lo this item, I would now  like

to  discuss  in  general some of  our  educational

problems.  As  far as I can, I  will  try  not  to

repeat what has been raised by my colleagues.  The

first  problem  is  the restructuring  of  primary

school  education. First of all, may I express  my

support  of  the  concept that  in  any  education

system  the  content of education in  one  set  of

conditions  may  not  suit  a  different  set   of

conditions. For this reason not only do I  support

the  restructuring of primary education but I also

fully  praise the bold move taken by the Minister.

However, to be successful any restructuring  of  a

system  must be preceded by detailed and  thorough

planning.  What is most important is to understand

thoroughly the old problems and shortcomings,  the

likely  problems that will be encountered  in  the

new  system and the likely solutions. Sir, the new

system will undoubtedly stimulate greater interest

among   students  at  different  levels  so   that

schooling  will not be regarded as a burden.  This

is   good  because  our  society  being  practical

attaches great importance to examination results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the theory of education is impressive,

parents  do not view it this way. In the past  the

results  of  the PSLE affected the  reputation  of

parents, schools and also the students. But now we

are going to conduct an exercise among Primary III

students to determine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



whether  they  should  do another  three  or  four

years.  Will  this  not cause the  burden  of  the

students to be advanced earlier?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now actively promoting bilingualism. But

according  to  the  circular  on  Primary   School

restructuring,  those who are not well  versed  in

two  languages are allowed to have reduced periods

for  the second language. However, when they  take

the  PSLE they are still required to sit  for  the

second  language  in  the same examination.  Thus,

some problems will arise. First, how do we measure

the  term "well versed"? Second, can those who are

less  well  versed be made more  well  versed?  If

these  students  have to sit for the  same  second

language paper in the PSLE, then do we expect them

to  do  well in the examination if they are  given

less  time? Moreover, if they do well in the other

papers too and carry on their studies in secondary

schools, vocational or technical institutes,  will

they  not have to use the second language as well?

There  is  an  obvious inconsistency  here.  If  a

student  is not proficient in the second language,

remedial  measures  should be taken  as  early  as

possible.   According   to   linguistic   experts,

children learn languages faster than adults. Since

we want to promote bilingualism, our policy should

be  thorough and not biased. And very soon, at the

end  of the year, the assessment will be made  for

the  first batch of Primary III students. Have all

the  schools  been  notified of the  criteria  for

assessment? If I am not mistaken, the first  batch

of  July intake will complete their Primary III in

June this year. Will they also be affected by this

new education policy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem I would like to discuss is the

transfer  of  teachers in charge of the  uniformed

groups.  The policy of extra-curricular activities

initiated  by the Ministry of Education  has  been

well supported by all schools, as can be witnessed

by  the  good  support and turn-out at  the  Youth

Festivals.  Certain changes will be  made  to  the

Youth  Festival  programme  this  year;  its  main

objective is to reduce the burden on the  schools.

Many teachers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



students welcome this move. They can heave a  sigh

of  relief now because their lessons will  not  be

unduly  affected as there have been far  too  many

extra  curricular  activities.  However,  recently

certain  officers  responsible for  the  uniformed

groups  have  asked teachers in  charge  of  these

groups  at  the  second or third  week  after  the

opening  of  the  school term to  go  for  in-camp

training  for  two or three weeks. Some  of  those

teachers   who   go  for  in-camp   training   are

substituted by relief teachers but others are not.

By  the time the relief teachers report for  duty,

the   teachers  are  due  to  return  from   their

training.   In  fact,  the  commandants   of   the

uniformed  groups should realise that calling  the

teachers   away  from  their  normal  duties   for

training   will  affect  both  the  teachers   and

students.  These officers should be familiar  with

the  school terms, the administrative problems  of

the schools, and should not regard school hours as

holidays, or pay attention only to their own work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints that some

teachers who are in charge of uniformed groups  as

well  as school administration have been asked  to

go  to  another  school at short  notice  to  take

charge  of  uniformed groups there.  I  think  due

attention  should be paid to the fact  that  these

teachers  are more urgently required to carry  out

the  administrative duties in their  own  schools.

But I understand that some of the commandants have

given   warnings   to  these  teachers   regarding

transfers  that if they do not follow instructions

then  they will be removed. I do not know  whether

these officers realise that teachers are first and

foremost  teachers. These teachers participate  in

uniformed group activities only because of  extra-curricular activities. They should not be regarded

first  and  foremost  as  teachers  in  charge  of

uniformed  groups  or part-time  teachers.  Extra-curricular activities are not their full-time job.

One  must realise that teachers in charge of these

groups  have to do more work and spend more  time,

and there is no extra benefit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



Unnecessary restrictions and warnings are uncalled

for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the third question. Recently some

schools  have  received  certain  instruments  and

equipment  as  presents from Intraco  through  the

Ministry of Education. According to them  some  of

the  gifts are somewhat outdated and do not  serve

much  purpose. I do not know whether  or  not  the

allocation or distribution of these items has been

based  on  the  requisitions applied  for  by  the

schools. If so, it would be better to allot  funds

to the schools to acquire their own instruments.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth problem I would like to touch upon is

in  regard to the welfare o, retired teachers.  By

the  keen  efforts  of the teachers'  unions,  the

authorities concerned have allowed members of  the

family  of  a  teacher to similarly enjoy  medical

benefits.  But when he retires, he must  surrender

all medical benefits cards. Thus he and his family

will  not  be  able  to  enjoy  any  more  medical

benefits. According to medical science, the  older

a  person gets, the more likely he will get  sick.

The body is just like a machine, which breaks down

more  often as it gets older. Therefore, when  the

teacher  retires, he needs more medical care.  But

instead  we are depriving him of medical  benefits

at the time when he is also going to lose his job.

This  "double-barrelled" attack  will  affect  him

drastically. However, I am glad to note  that  the

Ministry  of  Finance  is granting  higher  earned

income tax relief to those who continue employment

above  55 years of age. This is good and it  is  a

practical  move  that expresses  the  Government's

care  for  the  aged, it is a virtue  to  pay  due

respect to the old. But people who are old have  a

greater  need for medical attention. I  hope  that

the  Minister  and the department  concerned  will

seriously  consider  granting  continued   medical

benefits to teachers who retire because they  have

sacrificed  their whole life for the education  of

our children and now is the time that they deserve

some warmth from the society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth problem that I would like to touch upon

is  the question of allowance for principals. Sir,

all  of  us realise school principals have a  very

great responsibility. Their workload is very heavy

and  they have to tackle many problems, both great

and  small.  In the past, they had the consolation

of  a post allowance which was used to offset  the

entertainment expenses which they could not  avoid

in  the  course  of their duties.  However,  as  a

result of the revision of salary scales, the  post

allowance   of   principals   was   abolished.   I

understand  that  the  Ministry  of  Education  is

finding   it  more  difficult  nowadays   to   get

principals.  Even in the Ministry of  Education  a

survey  was carried out inviting applications  for

the  post of principal, but the response has  been

very  poor.  Therefore I hope  the  Minister  will

consider   restoring   the   post   allowance   to

principals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, your time is up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, can I have one more minute?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You can always come back to it after the Minister

has replied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I am not an education expert as previous hon.

Members  who  spoke. But may I  humbly  seek  your

approval   to   make  a  few   comments   on   the

restructuring of the education system. I  am  sure

that   the  Hon.  Minister  is  well  aware   that

streaming   children  in  schools   according   to

estimated  ability is damaging to the  educational

interests  of children categorised as  less  able,

and   irrelevant   to   the  interest   of   those

categorised as more able. In effect, the  practice

of    streaming    tends   to   reinforce    other

discriminatory  aspects of the educational  system

to  the  disadvantage of many children from manual

workers' homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructuring of the education system will

also  pose  problems. As I see it, there  will  be

problems for the teachers and principals who  will

have added responsibilities and added burdens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



in making assessments to stream children after the

completion of Primary III. Will these teachers and

principals  be  able to make correct  assessments?

They will need to be trained to ensure that proper

assessments  are made. Then again  these  teachers

and principals will be conscience-pricked if wrong

assessments are made. This, I believe, is a  grave

responsibility to shoulder teachers and principals

with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are problems that parents would be

faced with. Even if parents are told over and over

again  the  dire  consequences  of  pushing  their

children too hard, the restructuring will catalyse

an  even greater pushing, much to the detriment of

the  children.  Parents believe  they  know  their

children's  capabilities too well  and  too  often

demand  too much from them. This could damage  not

only children who are less able but also those who

are more able.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private tuition will also be introduced into

homes  to  children as early as  when  they  first

start schooling. This will, of course, unduly fray

the pockets of some parents and prohibit those who

cannot  afford giving their children  private  tui

tion.  The  pace  of  the rat race  has  now  been

increased  and  the  flag-off  advanced  by   this

restructuring proposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, as a simple-minded parent with school-going

children, I have often felt rather confused  about

the   direction  of  our  education  system,   and

listening to my learned colleagues here  today,  I

must   profess  that  I  am  becoming  even   more

confused.  I do not know anything about education,

least of all education policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is not so much a question of whether a

policy  is right or a policy is wrong. As  far  as

policies  are  concerned, I am quite  prepared  to

leave  it  in the very capable hands of  our  Hon.

Minister.  But  I think it is more a  question  of

implementation  and we should look  into  it  more

closely.  Many  of our policies have  started  off

with a big bang. It sounds good on paper and it is

very difficult for a layman to quarrel whether  it

is good or bad.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the restructuring of our primary

education, which instead of six years we now  have

seven  years,  I am just wondering what  is  wrong

with six years. We have all gone through six years

of  primary education, and during our time we  did

not  even have kindergarten experience. So we  can

say  that today the primary education is  not  six

but  eight years, if we count the two years  spent

in kindergarten. In fact, we are now going to have

nine  years' primary education. Anyway, as I said,

I am not going to quarrel with that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem really is implementation. How do

we go about it, and is the policy formulated being

understood  both by the officers in  the  Ministry

and   the  teachers  themselves?  In  fact,   many

teachers  have told me that they are  so  confused

with all the chopping and changing. I do not blame

them.  I  think this is really a matter  which  we

should  look  into very closely. We can  argue  on

policy  with a great number of learned  colleagues

here, who are all professional teachers. We can go

on  and  on arguing as to who is right and who  is

wrong.  Well, the test of the pudding  is  in  the

eating. It is too early to say. So I think it is a

waste of time and waste of breath. I can only urge

the  Hon.  Minister,  as a  parent:  "Please,  for

goodness sake, whatever you are going to do,  look

into  it very closely." And in its implementation,

has he got the manpower, and whether the staff and

teachers understand what is going on?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I like to be down to earth about this

matter.  As  I  say, I do not know anything  about

education. But this is causing general frustration

among   parents.  I  must  give  credit   to   our

youngsters  as many of them do not suffer  nervous

breakdowns.  I  have seen many  cases  of  parents

suffering  from  examination  jitters.  Each  time

there is a change of syllabus, or a change in  the

policy, it is the parents who suffer. Poor thing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have said enough, and thank you

for giving me this opportunity to speak.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the few Members who have spoken have covered

a  very  wide spectrum on the issue of  education.

Generally,  the  points raised fall  into  several

categories  and I propose to deal with them  under

these categories - changes in the education system

and restructuring, professional matters concerning

teachers, school management, and others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, on the restructuring of the

education  system, may I compliment those  Members

who  have  spoken for their in-depth knowledge  of

what is being done, in particular, the Member  for

Moulmein  who spoke very eloquently in defence  of

the  changes.  Let mc assure all Members  of  this

House that this proposed change is not an exercise

on paper and it will not, as the Member for Katong

has  said,  start  with a  bang  and  end  with  a

whimper. I agree that superficially there  appears

to  have  been  a  lot  of changes  and  at  times

confusing, as the Member for Jalan Kayu has  said.

All  these  changes  over  the  recent  years  are

actually  the logical development of our education

system  over the last one and a half decades.  Our

education  policy has been spelt out very  clearly

in  our  1959 documents. All these changes are  no

other  than  logical developments of this  policy.

Why  does  there  appear to be more  changes  than

before?  Well, it is because we have been able  to

consolidate  and build up the base  which  enables

these changes to take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the implementation of the

restructuring  of  the education  system,  as  all

Members   know,   the   Ministry   is   in   close

consultation    with    the   teachers'    unions,

professional bodies and those in the  field,  like

principals and teachers, on how best to  implement

it.   For  example,  most  teachers'  unions  have

already set up their own committees to do  an  in-depth  study  of the implications, and  some  have

already made their recommendations to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



Ministry.  Recently, we had a series of  workshops

and  seminars organised by principals with exactly

the  same purpose. It is also the intention of the

Ministry  to  carry  out a  series  of  in-service

courses to prepare the principals and teachers for

the  proper  implementation of  these  changes.  I

agree that many teething problems will be faced on

the  introduction of the new system at the end  of

this  year. Many of these problems, in fact,  have

been  envisaged by the unions and the  principals,

and  recommendations are being made. The  Ministry

is presently studying them and adjustments will be

made where necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with the more specific

issues  of  the  restructuring  of  the  education

system, which have been raised by various Members.

The   Member   for   Paya  Lebar   mentioned   the

difficulties that will be faced by schools with  a

small  enrolment. He suggested that the Government

should  assist the merging of such small  schools,

particularly those in the rural areas. I could not

agree  with him more. In fact, a couple  of  years

ago  the  former Minister of State for  Education,

now  the  Minister  of  State for  Communications,

announced that the Ministry encourages such moves.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever possible, the Ministry will make

available land and financial assistance to  effect

such  a  merger. In fact, merging  of  such  small

schools  will also solve the problem, as cited  by

the Member for Serangoon Gardens, of small schools

having only two classes of students. With a  fair-sized school, this problem will be minimised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various questions have been asked on how

assessment  will  be done. First  of  all,  may  I

reiterate what I have said in public. The Ministry

has  recently done a very detailed analysis of the

last PSLE results. There appears to be a very good

correlation  between  the  predicted  results   by

schools  and the actual PSLE. We are sending  this

assessment to individual schools so as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



to  assist them in making their assessment  as  to

which  students  should  do  the  remaining  upper

primary in either three or four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Serangoon Gardens as well

as  the  Member  for  Potong Pasir  mentioned  the

stigma  on  the three or four-year upper  primary.

Let  me  say  this. Whether a child completes  his

upper  primary  in three years or four  years  has

absolutely  no impact whatsoever on the  secondary

education he will receive. He will have  to  cover

the  same syllabus. He will have to take the  same

Primary Schools Leaving Examination, and the  sort

of   secondary  education  and  training  that  he

receives will depend on his performance then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens also asked about

the  restructuring  of  the secondary  level.  The

Ministry is now finalising the broad framework for

the  secondary level, and this will be sent to the

various  teachers' unions and professional  bodies

for comments. When finalised, it will then be made

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the point about

those   students  who  could  not  be  effectively

bilingual. In my statement in November I did admit

that  those who were genuinely incapable of  being

effectively bilingual would be given less exposure

time. Since then I have given much thought on this

and recently I have made certain clarifications on

that point. First of all, I say that less exposure

time  will  be allowed for those who are genuinely

incapable,  and  I expect the number  to  be  very

small.  They  are  likely to  be  put  in  special

classes.  Perhaps they will not be  given  reduced

exposure  time  as  originally  intended.  And  as

suggested  by the Member for Jurong, they  may  be

given more intensive coaching; hence they have  to

be  put  in  special classes. We have to recognise

the  fact that we have to assist those people  who

cannot be effectively bilingual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standardisation of performance and method of

assessment is one of the topics discussed  at  the

Principals'  seminar, and certain  recommendations

have been made. We are studying the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



recommendations, which are very  similar  to  what

has been put up by the teachers' unions. This will

be  made  known to all the principals and teachers

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The channelling of students into either three or

four years' upper primary education will only take

place  in  December  this year.  Therefore,  those

students who will be going to Primary IV  in  July

this  year  will not be affected by  this  change.

Those  in  Primary 11 now and going on to  Primary

III  in July will be affected in June 1976. I hope

that clarifies the point raised by the Member  for

Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir also raised the

question  that there will be more private tuition.

I  am one who is not in favour of private tuition.

But  I  also  realise  the  parents'  anxiety   to

encourage  their children to take private  tuition

because of the restructuring. At the beginning  of

this  year  the Ministry conducted  a  very  brief

survey on one well established mission school  and

one  typical Government-integrated school  on  the

trend on private tuition last year, and again this

year.  The  survey  is  not  conclusive,  but  the

results indicate that there is no rush for private

tuition  for the Primary III pupils. I cannot  say

also if this is an island-wide phenomenon, as this

survey was conducted only on two typical schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar suggested that we

should  not make public the GCE "O" and "A" levels

results in the press. He has a good point there  -- that it would produce a certain stigma on parents

whose children did not pass. I promise that I will

look  into  this matter to see whether  we  should

really  scrap the publication of these results  in

the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the point of admission to

Pre-U  classes  and the different systems  adopted

for  the  English  and  non-English  streams.  The

position  is  this. Schools in the English  stream

usually   have  their  "O"  level  results   known

sometime at the end of March, while those  in  the

non-English stream



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



have their results known by the end of January. In

the  past  we had a preliminary admission exercise

for the English stream but not for the non-English

stream. This year I am afraid it was a freak  year

-  there was a delay in the non-English stream and

for some strange reason the English stream results

were advanced by two weeks so that the results for

both streams were announced simultaneously. We are

looking   into  the  possibility   of   having   a

preliminary  admission exercise  for  all  streams

when  all  the Pre-U classes are confined  to  the

junior  colleges. When this is done,  I  think  it

would be possible for us to adopt a similar system

for all the streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson raised the question about

the  teaching  of  civics and moral  education.  I

could  not  agree with him more. That  is  a  very

important  aspect of education. This is  not  only

being  taught  in  the subject of  "Education  for

Living" or "Civics", but we try to incorporate  it

in  other subjects as well. The reason why  we  do

not make it an examination subject is that, as  of

now,   our   education  system  is   already   too

examination-orientated. By adding another subject,

we  could make matters worse. They might learn  it

by  heart  without  really  wanting  to  know  why

certain things ought to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised a series of

questions.  Why  do we not extend  the  `A'  level

Commerce  examination  to  private  candidates  as

well?  The  GCE `A' level examination in  Commerce

was  introduced in 1970 as a pilot  project.  Over

the  last five years we have been able to  monitor

its  development, and we are fairly satisfied that

we  can run it quite competently. It will be  open

to  the  private  candidates in the  near  future;

unfortunately not this year but most probably next

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned something about private schools

doing  better  than Government or Government-aided

schools.



I  am afraid I have to dispute that statement. For

example, if you look at the results last year, 57%

of the `A'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



level  candidates from Government and  Government-aided  schools  obtained 2 `A's, 2 `0's  plus  the

General  Paper, whereas only 14% from the  private

colleges  obtained the same grades.  Out  of  this

14%,  only  1% managed to get into the University.

In  other words, although they get the same grade,

they are of a lower quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also enquired about the posting of

students  nearest their homes. It is the intention

of  the  Ministry to post students to  schools  as

near  to their homes as possible. But we have also

to  recognise  that  parents want  to  send  their

children to schools of their own choice. Over  the

last  few  years,  about  95%  of  the  Primary  I

students  have  been able to find  places  in  the

schools of their own choice. Of the remaining  5%,

most  of them were posted to schools within  three

kilometres from their homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah raised a few

questions   regarding  the  teaching   of   second

language.  With 40% of the curriculum  time  being

devoted  to second languages, it will be extremely

difficult to put students taking different  second

languages  in  the same class. It is  not  just  a

question of administrative convenience by  putting

them   in   the  same  class.  In  fact,   it   is

educationally   unwise  to  have   students   with

different  second  languages  in  the  same  class

because  60%  of their time spent in one  language

will create one lot of classmates and 40% of their

time  will  have  a different lot  of  classmates.

Moreover, the mingling-integration does not  begin

really   in  the  classrooms.  Students  arc   not

supposed  to  fool  and  mingle  around   in   the

classrooms.  They are supposed to  mingle  in  the

field  or  in activities where they can  socialise

together.  Therefore,  we should  really  consider

progress in the school as a whole rather  than  by

classes. Principals have been advised to integrate

children taking different second languages as  far

as possible in activities such as extra-curricular

activities,  so as to achieve the objective  which

the Member mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked what happened to the second

languages, especial-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



ly Tamil as a second language in mission schools.

Unfortunately the number of students taking  Tamil

as  a  second language is small. Therefore, it  is

not possible to have a second language Tamil (TL2)

class in every mission school. However, we have  a

centre  for  Tamil as a second language.  Students

from  mission schools are sent to this  centre  to

learn  Tamil as a second language. He  also  asked

why the three established Tamil centres - Bartley,

Beatty  and Gan Eng Seng - were closed down.  With

the  exception of Beatty, both Bartley and Gan Eng

Seng, I believe, were closed more than eight years

ago. It is not the result of a change in policy on

bilingualism  or  of  the recent  changes.  Beatty

Secondary School was changed this year. The reason

is  this:  as  it stands, Beatty Secondary  School

does  not have enough classrooms to cater for  its

own  pupils. In attending these classes those  TL2

pupils had to float from one classroom to another.

This was rather unsatisfactory, and as a result we

moved  the  centre  to a school  where  sufficient

classrooms for TL2 are available for this purpose.



<br><br>4.15 pm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asked a few questions about

the Institute of Education. He wants me to give  a

very simple answer to the question on who wants to

be a teacher? May I assure him that in our present

day   context  teaching  is  still  a  very  noble

profession.  There are many bright young  men  and

women  who aspire to be teachers when they  finish

their   schooling.  During  the   last   admission

exercise carried out a couple of months ago by the

Institute  of  Education  there  were  about   550

applicants   for  the  Certificate  in   Education

course. Due to the staffing position, we have only

been  able to take in about 60. The ratio is about

1  :  10.  Similarly, for the Diploma in Education

course   for  graduates,  there  were  about   450

applicants  for 90 places. The ratio  is  1  :  5.

Despite   what   has  been  said,   the   teaching

profession still has its attractions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member mentioned that there are some

restrictions  on  teachers who wish  to  pursue  a

course  of  study, for example, academic  teachers

studying for a non-academic course. Let me  assure

him that no restriction is imposed by the Ministry

on  teachers who wish to pursue a course of  study

in  his  own  time provided it does not  interfere

with  his work as a teacher. However, if he wishes

to apply for study leave, then the course of study

must  be  relevant  to  the  requirement  of   the

service.   If   a   teacher   chooses   to   study

accountancy,  for example, there  is  great  doubt

whether  he  will return to enrich  the  education

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also inquired about the posting of

teachers  to  schools nearest their homes.  It  is

more  difficult than posting pupils nearest  their

homes for the simple reason that most teachers are

concentrated  in  a few housing estates,  such  as

Marine  Parade, Thomson and Toa Payoh.  There  are

also  many schools in the rural areas where  there

are  no  housing  estates, and  we  have  to  post

teachers  to man these schools. It is not possible

to  accede  to  the request of every  teacher  for

posting to a school nearest his home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the promotion exercise, I am pleased to say

that  only  this  morning I received  confirmation

from  the  Public  Service  Commission  that   the

exercise  has been finalised and the results  will

be announced shortly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Good coincidence!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> The number of teachers promoted will be slightly

more  than the previous year. The Member for Anson

is  most  probably  aware that the  procedure  for

shortlisting this year has somewhat been  modified

after  consultation  with  the  various  teachers'

unions.  As  a result, there will be  less  belly-aching this year. We will continue to improve upon

the  procedure so that there will be less  unhappy

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah asked about the

training of teachers to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



teach  Malay and Tamil as second language  at  the

Institute of Education. We are continuing to train

them  to  teach the language as a second language.

We are now working on a scheme to take in trainees

who do not have the required `A' levels to undergo

a  more  intensive programme of training as  first

language teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised two more questions

on  the conditions of service of teachers. One  is

on  medical benefits for those teachers  who  have

retired. I believe this question was raised by the

Member  for  Paya Lebar in 1973 and it  was  again

raised  by  the Member for Jurong in  1974.  I  am

afraid the reply is still the same. The Member for

Telok   Blangah  may  quote  from  Hansard  again.

Briefly, we have to look at the public service  as

a  whole  and  not on the teachers as an  isolated

incidence.  They  have to be considered  in  toto.

Under  the present circumstances, I am afraid  the

Ministry  has been advised that it is not possible

to  extend free medical benefits to those teachers

who have retired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the question of post

allowance for principals. I believe he raised  the

same  question last year. The reply is  again  the

same.  The  abolition  of post  allowance  in  the

restructured  education system is  the  result  of

very  prolonged negotiations between the  Ministry

of   Education,  Ministry  of  Finance   and   the

teachers'  unions over a period of 18 months.  The

reasons,    the   rationale   and    the    likely

repercussions  have  been gone  through  in  great

detail, and having reached that agreement there is

no  possibility of going back and reintroduce  the

post allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not true to say that there is no

attraction in being a principal. Let us  take  the

last  promotion  exercise - not  the  one  I  just

mentioned  but the one carried out two  years  ago

-principals holding basic grades have  four  times

as much chances to be promoted as teachers have in

their own grades. Generally speaking, and as to be

expected, principals have better chances of  being

promoted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the question of relief teachers,

which was raised by both the Members for Anson and

Telok   Blangah.  The  Member  for  Telok  Blangah

reminded me of the answers I gave when I  was  the

Parliamentary Secretary and Minister of State  for

Education.  I  am afraid I have to give  the  same

reply today - as long as there is maternity leave,

there  will  be relief teachers. But I agree  with

both  Members  that it is not a very  satisfactory

arrangement.  We will try our best to  reduce  the

number  of  relief teachers. At present there  are

over  300  relief teachers for pure  vacancies  as

against 800 when I replied to the Member for Telok

Blangah  in 1969. So there is a reduction of  more

than  50%.  This could, of course, be resolved  in

various ways. Three hundred relief teachers  among

20,000  teachers actually represents 1  1/2%.  One

convenient way is to do it administratively,  that

is,  to increase the size of the class. But  I  do

not  think this is very desirable. I would  rather

that  we  do  it  slowly  and  solve  the  problem

gradually  by training more qualified teachers.  I

hope  it will eventually be solved - not too  long

but  perhaps  within  a few years.  Three  hundred

relief    teachers   as   compared    to    20,000

establishments is not really a large number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On issues relating to the school management, the

Member  for Anson said that there have been  cases

where   students  have  been  forced  to   collect

donations   during  vacation.  Schools   are   not

supposed  to  do  that.  The  principals  are  not

supposed  to  sell lucky draw tickets and  solicit

donations.  In fact, in the past when  such  cases

were  discovered by the Ministry,  the  principals

were  warned. I should be grateful to  the  Member

for  Anson, should he come across such  cases,  to

let me know and we will take appropriate action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong made some reference to the

officers  in the uniformed movement. I agree  with

him  that  it  is  wrong to have in-camp  training

during the school term. I would bring this to  the

attention of the Commandant to see that in  future

this training should not be allowed to disrupt the

teaching process



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



for the benefit of the uniformed movement.  I

agree  with  him that in-camp training  should  be

conducted during vacation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about Intraco's donations

as a matter of general interest. I do not have any

knowledge  of  what  Intraco has  donated  to  the

schools,  but  I believe that most  of  the  items

donated are new. But whether they are suitable  or

not  I  cannot vouch for them. I believe that  the

only  item  which was not new was the 30  odd  re-conditioned buses donated to schools. In  addition

to  that,  Intraco donates a large  sum  of  money

every   now  and  then  to  schools  for   various

projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised some questions on

donations  to the Education Fund. These  donations

are  collected from foreign students and paid into

a fund known as the Education Fund. It is used for

the  benefit  of our students. For example,  every

year a large sum of money is being drawn from this

Fund  to subsidize our students to go overseas  or

to go to the neighbouring countries on educational

tours or for whatever activities the students wish

to  engage in but are short of funds. I am  rather

surprised  that the hon. Member for  Anson  is  so

concerned about foreign students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations are required from foreign students for

a  very  simple  reason. Although  they  study  in

private  schools  we ask for donation  from  them.

Private  schools have been able to attract foreign

students because of the educational infrastructure

built up by this Government at public expense over

the  years,  and  it  cost  millions  of  dollars.

Without Government efforts there would not be this

educational infrastructure and the private schools

would  not  be  able to flourish and attract  that

many foreign students. Why should foreign students

come  to  Singapore and not elsewhere? Because  of

the  efforts  of the Government to build  up  this

infrastructure, I think it is only  fair  that  if

foreign  students  wish to come here  and  benefit

from  our  efforts  they should  make  a  donation

towards  the  Education Fund to be  used  for  the

benefit of our students.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have answered most of the points

raised by hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I would like to clarify two or three points.

The  first  point  is that the Minister  mentioned

that  there are many applications for the post  of

teachers. But may I ask the Minister why there are

300 resignations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about foreign students. I

would  like  to  know  how  this  money  which  is

collected from the foreign students is being used.

I  am  not  objecting  to the collection  of  this

money. The money collected must be utilised for  a

very good purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that we must stop the practice

of  asking students to collect donations  and  the

Minister has promised he would look into  this.  I

hope  that  whatever  the Minister  says  here  is

implemented.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I have to rise

again.  I  am  not satisfied with  the  Minister's

answer,   especially   that   concerning    relief

teachers.  Perhaps it was because  I  raised  this

issue  in  1971  when, according to the  Minister,

there were 800 relief teachers and that the number

is  now  reduced to 300. I can assure the Minister

that  I  will  raise this problem again  in  three

years' time, unless the 300 is reduced to 30.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refuse to accept the Minister's contention that

there will be relief teachers so long as there are

teachers  taking maternity leave. Sir, women  have

been  going  on  maternity  leave  since  time  im

memorial. The problem of relief teachers arose not

decades  ago  but  a  decade  ago  or  even   more

recently. The Minister is aware that quite  a  few

of   us   here   are  practising  teachers.   This

phenomenon of unqualified relief teachers going to

schools  to  teach came about only  six  or  seven

years ago. And in answer to the Member for Anson's

question  as  to who wants to become teachers, he

said  that  lots of people have applied to  become

teachers. A-s I said, we should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



train  them and from this pool of trained teachers

we  can draw the number required to relieve  those

who go on maternity leave or any other leave.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I appreciate some

of  the  answers  given  by  the  Minister  to  my

queries. But when I cited the hypothetical case of

two  classes  in a primary school,  I  was  merely

setting  a hypothetical situation to indicate  how

classes can multiply and teachers can be increased

in number if the system is to be implemented. This

tendency  to  multiply  need  not  necessarily  be

limited to the hypothetical case I have cited.  It

can happen to the case of two or more classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I did not, as the Minister said,

mention  that a child having to do four  years  of

upper  primary education after Primary III  has  a

stigma  attached.  This is where  the  Member  for

Potong   Pasir  stands  alone  in  this   profound

observation. But it did not issue from me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I did raise the query of how forms and

criteria  of assessment will be formulated  and  I

would appreciate a reply from the Minister on this

query.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I also raised the question of how the

performance  of  a  child in the  second  language

under the new system in the three years of Primary

schooling,  that is, Primaries I, II and  III,  is

going  to  he decided in so far as it  relates  to

whether a child will do four years or three  years

of upper primary education after Primary III.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also invite a response from the Minister

to  my  suggestion that relief teachers should  in

future  never be assigned to primary  classes,  at

least  in the first three years in the new system.

Nor  should teachers in the first three  years  of

primary education be transferred. In fact, I see a

merit   if  the  Minister  could  arrange  for   a

situation where the teacher who starts off with  a

class  in  Primary I follows the class through  to

Primary II and to Primary III, because at the  end

of  Primary III that teacher will have a  thorough

knowledge of his or her pupils and will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



better  able  to  make  a  reliable  and  accurate

assessment   of   the  academic   attainment   and

potential of the child.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I just want to refer briefly to a point that

has  been referred to indirectly by the Member for

Jalan  Kayu. From what he said, there seems to  be

one  matter not adequately considered, namely, the

question  of  getting parents  to  understand  the

education  policy better. I hope in  this  respect

the   Ministry,  teachers'  unions  and  teachers'

bodies will collaborate to put the idea across and

get the cooperation of parents.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot promise the

Member for Telok Blangah that if he were to  raise

the same question in three years' time, the number

of  relief teachers will be cut down to 30. But  I

can  promise him that it will not be of  the  same

magnitude as it is today. If he will recall, in my

reply  in  1971  I said that it was our  intention

that  eventually relief teachers would be  trained

teachers, but they would still be relief teachers.

The  intention is that there will  be  a  pool  of

trained  teachers serving as relief  teachers  but

they will remain as relief teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must apologise to the Member for Serangoon

Gardens  if  I  have grouped his queries  together

with the Member for Potong Pasir. My apologies  if

I  have done so. I understand his sentiments.  His

point about the multiplying of classes due to  the

restructured system was well taken. We  are  aware

of  this and this is, in fact, being planned  for.

He  asked  how  the form and standardisation  will

come  about  and also whether the second  language

will affect the question of channelling. As I said

just  now, this is contained in the very  detailed

recommendations of principals and teachers' unions

in a seminar. It is rather a lengthy report but it

will be made public very soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked for my assurance that relief

teachers  will  not be posted to primary  schools,

especially from Primary I through to Primary  III,

if they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



are  untrained  relief teachers, I  can  say  that

perhaps in a few years' time this will not happen.

But  even now there are only about 100-odd  relief

teachers in the primary schools, out of a total of

15,000  teachers  in the establishment.  I  cannot

agree  with  him more about his idea of  the  same

teacher  following  through  from  Primary  I   to

Primary   III.  In  fact,  we  have  been   urging

principals to try to do that as far as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong has made a very good point

which unfortunately I have missed out in my reply,

and  the Member for Jalan Kayu has also raised it,

that is, we should have an exercise to explain  to

the  general public about the restructured system.

In fact, this is being planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A campaign.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> There will be no campaigns. What we intended to do

have in fact been done now - that is to produce  a

series of films explaining the restructured system

and   also  train  a  large  number  of  education

officers  to  familiarise  themselves  with   this

system. The idea is not to conduct a campaign  but

to  get these specially trained officers to go  to

the  individual schools and invite the parents  to

attend a session so that they can explain the  new

system  and  answer  any queries.  There  will  be

various public forums for this purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Deputy Speaker, Sir, since so many matters have

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1105*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Teong Eng Siong, Sia Khoon Seong and Ho Kah Leong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum to the President's Speech it

is said that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The education system will be restructured by

stages  with the objective of reducing educational

wastage,  improving  teaching  and  learning,  and

increasing the supply of trained manpower.'



<br><br>Under  the direction of the Minister for Education

the  restructuring  of  our education  system  has

already  been  carried out partially.  But  in  my

opinion  there  is  one very important  aspect  of

education  which  concerns  the  future   of   our

country, our social order and the happiness of our

children and our children's children. I feel  that

this particular aspect should also be included  in

the restructuring of our education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, respect for the

teachers was quite evident in Singapore. This  was

because  the teachers were able to show  not  only

kindness  but also able to exercise authority  and

the  students  were also alert.  Under  this  awe-inspiring authority of the teachers lazy  students

had   no  choice  but  work  hard  and  to  behave

properly.  But  today  the  situation  is  totally

different. We have even cases of students  beating

up  teachers, much less giving any respect due  to

the  teachers. Such students are allowed to remain

at  large. Why should it be allowed to deteriorate

to  such  a  stage?  It  is because  some  of  our

education  policy makers believe too much  in  the

laissez faire policy of the West. Teachers do  not

have  the discretion to impose corporal punishment

on  students. If any teacher should dare to do  so

he will face the risk of losing his job. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



a  result, students are at complete liberty to act

as  they please and teachers do not have even  the

discretion  of  limited  corporal  punishment   or

taking limited action against students. That being

so,  it has made the students lose any respect  or

fear for their teachers.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, some spoilt children or even

pampered  students complain to their parents  over

the  slightest admonishment. The parents will then

take  up  the  matter with the  school.  Then  the

officials of the Ministry of Education will pounce

on  the  teachers  on receipt  of  the  complaints

without  any  further detailed investigation  into

the complaints. Under such circumstances, teachers

are  always threatened by parents and the Ministry

of  Education  and they find it very difficult  to

discharge  their duties as teachers,  particularly

control  over  unruly students. So  some  teachers

take the passive attitude of just teaching without

trying  to  control the students- if the  students

want  to go astray, let them go astray; why should

I  care? That is the attitude and so there is lack

of control over students and an absence of respect

for  the teachers. Sir, since the students do  not

have  even the slightest idea that due respect  is

to  be  given to the teachers, how do  you  expect

them  to receive instruction or guidance from  the

teachers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we admit that we can learn from the

West  of  its  advanced  technology  in  order  to

improve   our  standards,  we  should   not   copy

everything  wholesale from the West. For  example,

while materially we have yet to learn the advanced

science  and  technology, educationally  there  is

little  good  to benefit from the West  where  the

children  are  pampered and doted  upon  by  their

parents  to  such excessiveness that the  children

can go their own way. They even become Beatles and

take  to  drugs.  Their education is  basically  a

failure.  So this is the apple cart of  the  West.

Why should we fall into the rut? Sir, if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



we  do not want to degenerate and embark upon  the

path  of  self-destruction, if we really  want  to

save  our future generations from the ills of  the

West  and to uphold our oriental cultural virtues,

then  as a teacher myself, I would like to suggest

to  the  Minister for Education that  he  restores

erstwhile good methods of teaching and controlling

the   students   and  allows  the   teachers   the

discretion  to impose limited corporal  punishment

as  and  when  necessary and then to  report  such

punishment  to  the  parents and  the  principals.

Perhaps,  such  discretion could  be  experimented

over a period before we conduct a review on it. In

fact,   according  to  history  and  my   personal

experience as a school teacher over twenty  years,

I  have  not  heard of any case  about  a  teacher

beating up a student to death, not even since  the

days of Adam and Eve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read in the English newspaper this morning

about a teacher beating up a student who had to be

sent to the hospital for treatment. I believe that

it  is  because the Ministry of Education has  not

given  the  discretion to the teachers  to  impose

limited corporal punishment. So since teachers are

not  allowed  to  carry a cane in class  and  when

students  misbehave, some teachers may lose  their

head  and give a tight slap with their bare hands,

thereby    resulting   in   the   student    being

hospitalised.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, your time is up. Mr Teong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this amendment, I would like to ask the

Minister  two  questions. One, would the  Minister

consider building an auditorium for the Naval Base

Secondary  School? According to my  understanding,

this school has more than 2,000 students. It is  a

school   of   considerable  size,  but   what   is

surprising is that it has no school hall  at  all.

This  is  very  regrettable.  We  know  that   the

Ministry  of  Education  is  promoting  extramural

activities and encouraging students to  take  part

in  uniformed  group activities,  such  as  school

band, dancing, singing,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



choir,  and  so  on. In this way,  the  extramural

activities  of the students can be enriched.  But,

unfortunately, the Naval Base Secondary School has

no  school  hall.  The  teachers  responsible  for

dancing  and singing are not able to conduct  such

activities   in  a  proper  place.  It   is   also

impossible for the school to hold any performances

or  shows  in the school itself. I would therefore

like to ask whether the Minister has any plans  to

build  a  school hail for the Naval Base Secondary

School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is that I have heard some remarks

from  teachers  and  members  of  the  public  and

parents to the effect that something is wrong with

our  secondary schools. To be more specific,  Sir,

it  has  been  noticed that many secondary  school

students  are sporting long hair. This is  a  very

bad  impression. Some teachers themselves are  not

behaving   in  the  proper  manner.  Some   female

teachers  like to wear very colourful or thin  and

revealing  dresses.  In  the  case  of  some  male

teachers,  they attire themselves in mod  fashion.

These  teachers are not setting a good example  to

the  students. I would therefore like to  ask  the

Minister  concerned to consider the suggestion  of

requiring the teachers in secondary schools to put

on   uniforms.  Since  doctors  and  nurses   wear

uniforms  why  not  make teachers  wear  uniforms?

Uniforms will not only be pleasant to look at  but

they  also  give  a  dignified appearance  to  the

teaching profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point is that in the Polytechnic

there  are students who keep long hair. They  even

attend   classes  in  slippers.  What  manner   of

behaviour  is this? I would like the  Minister  to

immediately look into this matter and  take  steps

to rectify this situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on Teachers' Day last year, the

Minister for Education announced that his Ministry

was planning a staff development scheme to provide

teachers  with  opportunities  for  academic   and

professional   advancement.  According   to   him,

initially, courses leading to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



advanced  stage  of the Certificate  of  Education

would  be conducted by the Institute of Education.

At a later stage there would be courses leading to

the  Bacheior of Education degree. These  courses

would be open to serving teachers with HSC or  GCE

`A'  level. My question to the Minister  is:  have

the  plans  been finalised and, if so,  when  will

these courses be run? I wish also to find out from

the  Minister  whether he will consider  extending

these courses to serving teachers without the  HSC

or the GCE `A' level.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Member for

Paya  Lebar  when  he  made  the  request  to  the

Minister for Education to restore to teachers  the

discretion to impose corporal punishment, that  is

to  say,  "to return the cane to the teachers."  I

feel  that the students are getting more and  more

difficult  to  control,  and  discipline  in   the

schools  is on the decline from day to day.  As  a

result,  we  have  more and  more  delinquents  in

Singapore.  Juvenile delinquency is mounting  from

year  to year and the committee which looked  into

this  matter  has also recommended  that  teachers

should  be given the discretion to impose corporal

punishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Education will certainly

turn  round and say that if we give the cane  back

to  the  teachers, some of them will  abuse  their

power and discretion to use the cane. In that case

if  we give only limited authority to the teachers

to  impose  corporal punishment as the Member  for

Paya  Lebar suggested, for example to use the cane

on  the  palms or buttocks, then a lot of problems

of discipline can be solved. Of course, we realise

that  at the present moment principals and  senior

assistants  are  authorised  to  impose   corporal

punishment.  But  from  what  I  understand,  most

principals  and  senior teachers avoid  exercising

such  authority because they know that in imposing

any  corporal punishment they are required to  put

up  a lengthy report to the Ministry of Education.

So to save all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



that  trouble of putting up a long-winded  report,

they  avoid taking this action and the  matter  is

put in abeyance.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the question of whether or not

teachers should be given the discretion to  impose

corporal  punishment is a matter to  be  seriously

considered.  If  the Ministry of Education  cannot

come  to  any  decision, perhaps  we  can  hold  a

referendum among the teachers to decide. I believe

that  if  a  referendum is held,  we  will  get  a

definite answer from the teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to endorse respect for the

teachers,  the Ministry has been very generous  in

holding  a Teachers' Day every year. The  teachers

are very grateful for this gesture. Unfortunately,

Teachers' Day falls on the 1st September of  every

year,  which  happens  to  be  during  the  school

vacation.  Perhaps the Ministry of  Education  had

deliberately  chosen this day to fall  within  the

school  vacation. I do not really know. But  as  a

result   of   this   coincidence   or   deliberate

arrangement,  teachers  do  not  really  enjoy   a

holiday.  So much of the significance of Teachers'

Day  is lost. In order to attach true significance

to  the Day, I would ask the Ministry of Education

to consult the teachers' bodies to fix a different

date for Teachers' Day.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the purpose of education is to inculcate a

sense  of  proper  social  discipline  among   the

students.  I cannot agree more that we should  not

be too indulgent towards our young. I do not think

that  indisciplined students is the direct  result

of  the withdrawal of the cane from teachers. Even

2,000 years ago we had Judas betraying his mentor.

Under  the  present  system  the  regulation   for

corporal  punishment is flexible enough to  enable

the  principal to exercise considerable discretion

to  designate  any  teacher to mete  out  corporal

punishment. I believe the same assurance was given

by  my  predecessor, the present Minister for  the

Environment, two years ago on the same issue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asked about the Naval

Base  Secondary  School. If  I  recall  correctly,

Naval  Base  Secondary  School  was  originally  a

primary school and it has since become a secondary

school.  Therefore, it has only a  small  canteen.

The   Ministry  is,  in  fact,  looking  into  the

possibility  of building a school  hall  for  this

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of long hair, we have certain

regulations which are, in fact, widely observed in

the  civil service. I do not think the problem  is

really  that serious. Sometimes it is  actually  a

question of discretion as to what constitutes long

hair, and what is not. It is not something that is

easily quantifiable. As long as it is tidy and not

too  long,  I  think it should be  all  right.  He

quoted a technical secondary school in particular.

The technical secondary school follows exactly the

same regulations in the civil service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of clarification, Sir,I would like to

correct one point. When I quoted the case of  long

hair,   I   was   referring   to   the   Singapore

Polytechnic. The Minister talked about the problem

of  what is long hair and what is not. I think  we

should  have a standard, and the Minister's  hair-length is a good standard to follow.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, I have mentioned that we have a certain

standard for civil servants, and there are posters

to show what is long hair and what is not, e.g, if

the  hair is allowed to cover the collar  and  the

ears,  it is considered long hair, and so on.  The

Member mentioned the Singapore Polytechnic: we are

trying  gradually  to  impose  certain  rules   in

respect of Polytechnic students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid his proposal for uniforms is not

enforceable. In fact, I hate to see teachers  come

to  classes in uniforms. I am afraid it is  not  a

practical  suggestion and  we  might  get  a  very

sterile service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of clarification, Sir,I disagree with the

Minister's  statement that my  suggestion  is  not

practical. Every school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



has its own uniform for its students. The ratio of

students  to teachers is in the region of  30:  1.

The number of teachers is very small. So it is not

too  difficult if we ask the teachers  to  put  on

their  own  uniforms.  And  if  the  Ministry  can

allocate  funds  for uniforms,  it  will  be  more

welcome.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, there are only 65 Members of Parliament here

and we are supposed to wear white shirts. I do not

see  the Member for Sembawang wearing white shirt.

That answers his problem of uniforms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein raised the question of

stall  development programme. I am pleased to  say

that  we  have  finalised the curriculum  for  the

advanced  Certificate  of  Education  course   and

invitations   will  be  sent  out  to   interested

teachers to apply for such a course. We will  also

be  implementing two other schemes, that  is,  the

Overseas  Scholarship Scheme,  to  send  deserving

staff  with  the necessary qualifications  to  the

United Kingdom to do an undergraduate's course  in

English.  There  is  a  great  shortage  of  these

teachers.  In  addition, recently we  announced  a

sponsorship  scheme  whereby  successful  teachers

would be sent to the local university to pursue an

undergraduate  course.  As  for  the   course   in

Bachelor of Education, we have yet to finalise the

curriculum, and I am afraid it will not be in time

for the coming academic year. It will be ready  by

the next academic year, which will be sometime  in

1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the question of

Teachers' Day. The Teachers' Day was fixed on  the

1st   September  many  years  ago  to  honour  and

remember  this very noble profession. If Teachers'

Day  is to have any meaning at all, it should  not

be changed or altered just because the school term

has  been revised. Teachers' Day has been observed

all  along  at a time when it did not fall  within

the  holidays. I am afraid the Member  for  Jurong

got  it wrong that the Ministry of Education fixed

it so that it coincides with the holidays. With  a

greater  intake  in  July and  the  likelihood  of

introducing two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



GCE  examinations  per year, the  school  term  is

likely  to  be  further changed. Are  we  then  to

change  the  Teachers' Day again if it happens  to

coincide  with  a  holiday? It is  something  very

significant  and we cannot change it just  because

it  happens to fall within the school holidays for

the last few years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered one of my

questions  and that is, will he consider extending

the  courses that I mentioned to serving  teachers

without  the HSC or the GCE `A' level? Because  in

his  announcement it was stated that teachers must

possess those qualifications before they could  be

invited to these courses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, during the initial stage, the answer is no.

Perhaps at a later stage we might consider when we

are able to carry out the scheme smoothly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, earlier on the Minister for Education

mentioned that the discretion of limited  corporal

punishment has been given to principals and senior

teachers.  I  do not know whether  he  realises  a

situation  like  this.  If  there  are  50  or  60

teachers in charge of 1,000 students, is that  not

better than having only one or two senior teachers

to  control  the whole student population  in  the

school?   Of   course,  I  will  answer   in   the

affirmative - it is better to allow all the 50  or

60 teachers to control the students, as the effect

of  their  control will be more  evident.  I  have

already given my reasons for such a situation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> I do not think the Member for Paya Lebar

understood what I have said. I said that under the

existing  regulations,  the  principal   has   the

discretion   to  delegate  whichever  teacher   he

considers   is  suitable  to  mete  out   corporal

punishment.  I  did  not  say  "only  the   senior

teachers". Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



if  the  principal so decides that all 60 teachers

can mete out corporal punishment, so be it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of the Minister's clarification, I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 1105 (The amendment also stood in the names of Messrs L. P. Rodrigo and Ho See Beng).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently a number of mathematics and science

teachers  in  secondary  schools  have  complained

about  the attitude of some specialist inspectors.

In  Chinese  secondary schools  both  science  and

mathematics  are  taught  in  English,   and   the

textbooks  are  also  in  English.  Most  of   the

teachers of such subjects are graduates of Nanyang

University.  Although  the Nanyang  graduates  are

bilingual, they are not very much at home  in  the

use  of  the English language because English  has

been   their  second  language  throughout   their

primary,  secondary and university  education.  So

they are not as proficient in English as they  are

in  Chinese,  which is their first language.  This

deficiency  is  especially  seen  when  they  come

across technical terms and difficult words in  the

teaching of these subjects. Therefore, in order to

make   their  students  understand  better,   they

intermix    their   explanations    in    Chinese.

Unfortunately some specialist inspectors  seem  to

prefer  to assess the proficiency of such teachers

in  the  English language, which is  their  second

language,  instead  of  the  benefits   to   their

students.  These  inspectors  forget  that   these

teachers  came  from the Chinese stream.  So  they

"split  hairs"  over the standard  of  English  of

these teachers. This is very regrettable, Sir, and

I  hope the Minister will seriously look into this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter I wish to raise is the public

statement  by  the  Minister  for  Education  that

Chinese as the second



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



language  in  the  English stream  has  reached  a

higher   standard  than  English  as  the   second

language  in  the Chinese stream. As a  result  of

this statement the school inspectors in charge  of

second language teaching are very worried. So they

visit  all the various Chinese schools,  not  with

the  purpose of advising the teachers how to raise

the standard of English as the second language but

to  tell the teachers, "My superior has pulled  me

up,  so I must pull you up in turn." How can  such

an  attitude  be justified? This is not  a  proper

attitude  for  school  inspectors  to  take.  They

cannot just pull up teachers like that. What  they

should do is to advise the teachers and guide them

as  to  how to improve the standard of English  as

the  second language in Chinese schools, and  thus

achieve the objective of bilingualism. I hope  the

Minister will look into this matter.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, under this subhead I intend to touch on

professional areas of responsibility  relating  to

the  standard  of  teaching  in  the  service  and

problems related to the management of education in

private  schools. One reads of pupils  who  cannot

count correctly, pupils who cannot speak correctly

and  pupils  who cannot spell correctly,  and  one

gets distressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the tacit claim that the Institute of

Education   produces  well   trained,   able   and

committed  teachers. But it appears  that  pupils'

performance  capacities  keep  falling.  Are   our

pupils becoming increasingly unteachable? Or  have

the  well  trained,  able and  committed  teachers

become  untrained, unable and uncommitted teachers

after  a few years in the teaching service and  in

the  profession?  If  so, then  there  is  in  the

service  and profession a factor or factors  which

are  dissipating the teachers' expertise and their

commitment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these factors? For one, is it the

overwhelming  number  of  women  teachers  in  the

schools?  This is not to imply that women teachers

are  inferior teachers, but I have heard  it  said

that they find it difficult to ensure a disciplin-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



ed  class in which only effective teaching can  be

achieved. Is it because school heads are unable to

be  as  effective  as they should  in  maintaining

standards  or  is  it because of  factors  in  the

education service relating to promotion prospects?

Or  is  it  a malaise, an inertia that is settling

upon  the teachers eventuating in a commitment  to

opt  out of a commitment to teach? And if  so,  we

still have to know why this is happening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is pointless to rationalise that

the  quality of teaching is satisfactory,  that  a

few  teachers have deteriorated in their standard,

these  being  a  fraction of the large  number  of

teachers  and  that, generally, all is  well.  The

disturbing  factor in the logic of  poor  teachers

and  substandard teaching is that the pupil, being

the  product of the teaching of his teachers, will

when  he  himself becomes a teacher, be a  teacher

with  that much less to give, despite the training

he   will  have  received  in  the  institute   of

Education.  Thus it appears that if the  situation

is  not  corrected,  there is  a  process  towards

inferior  human  resource  -  something  which  we

cannot  afford.  Sir,  I am  not  particularly  in

search of sources to lay blame on. I am expressing

an anxiety which I hope will invite the Minister's

greater attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to touch on the role of the

school head in primary schools. This has been  the

subject  of  much articulation in the past  and  I

think  all  sources  that matter  agree  that  the

school head should devote a sizable portion of his

time to classroom performance in order to maintain

and  raise  the general standard of teaching,  and

therefore  the  standard  of  education   in   the

country.  Although there is agreement on  that  in

the  Ministry,  there  is hardly  any  appreciable

improvement in the opportunity of the school  head

to  worry about matters relating to education.  He

is  burdened  with  administrative  work  and  any

amount  of injunction to the school head to  raise

the  standard  of teaching in his school  will  be

futile  in  the  face  of numerous  administrative

responsibilities  which  heads  are  required   to

perform.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the school head in all this

administration work, he has one clerical assistant

who is not authorised to sign on his behalf. As  a

result,  much  that can be done  in  the  area  of

educational  development is  not  undertaken  with

emphasis.  `This  includes the  implementation  of

syllabus, choice of textbooks, guidance to project

work,   supervision  of  staff,   supervision   of

discipline of the school arid setting the role and

leadership of the school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this problem, Sir, has the

administration   explored  the   feasibility   and

desirability  of reverting to the  system  of  one

head  for  one  school  session?  In  the  present

situation, the application of this change will not

cause  additional  money  as  the  appointment  of

school  heads is not a salary appointment as  such

today but an assignment of office. In addition, or

alternatively,    school   accounts    or    other

administrative matters may be centralised  in  the

Ministry, thus relieving school heads to attend to

performance  in the classroom. This responsibility

may  then be properly supervised by inspectors  of

schools  who  are now termed Education Development

Officers  and  who thereby would at least  and  at

last   be   doing   a  job  which   befits   their

designation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho See Beng is not here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar

mentioned   that   in   Chinese   schools    since

mathematics and science are taught in English  the

school inspector, or advisor as lie is called now,

appears  to  pay more attention to  the  teacher's

pronunciation of English rather than  on  content.

In  fact,  he drew my attention to this problem  a

few  months  ago  to two specific  cases.  I  have

looked  into  these two specific cases  where  the

adverse  comment  is  really  on  the  method   of

teaching - the teacher's approach and technique  - rather than the command of the second language.



I think in the assessment of a teacher's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



performance,  it is how well lie  can  impart  his

knowledge which is of overriding importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a prevailing occurrence

where   an   inspector  of   school   hammered   a

mathematics and science teacher because he  cannot

pronounce the terms properly or the school advisor

scolded teachers for not doing well. I agree  with

the  Member  that  the job of the  advisor  is  to

advise  and  he is not supposed to scold.  If  the

Member is aware of such cases, please let me  know

and perhaps I could advise the advisor to advise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens referred to the

so-called falling standard of pupils' performance.

I  think this is a world-wide problem. Is it  true

that the pupils' performance is falling, or is  it

because  the  demands  of the  modern  times  have

increased? I would like to refer the Member  to  a

report  published recently in the  United  Kingdom

called  the Bullock Report on Reading. It  studied

whether the standard of English has gone down. Has

it  actually  gone  down? No, the  demand  on  the

standard  of English has gone up. I think  we  are

facing  the  same  problem here.  The  demands  on

school  leavers have gone up. I do not  think  the

standard   of   education  has   gone   down.   In

particular, I do not think the quality of teachers

has  gone down. Academic-wise, in the past we used

to take in trainees with `0' levels. Now we insist

on `A' levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are conducting in-service courses throughout

the  year  for  serving teachers to upgrade  their

skills.   From  the  overwhelming  response   from

teachers  to  attend these in-service  courses,  I

have no doubt whatsoever of the dedication of  our

teachers  who  are highly motivated  to  excel  in

their work. There may be a few odd birds who  join

the service because there are no other jobs.



But  out of an establishment of 20,000 teachers  I

am  quite satisfied that the majority of them  are

as dedicated as we expect them to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member mentioned about the administrative

burden on principals in primary schools. I for one

am greatly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



in  favour  of  relieving the  principals  of  any

administrative burden. But unfortunately there  is

a  certain amount of administrative work which  he

has to do. In fact, the Ministry was quite keen on

that  and  a  request was made to  the  Management

Services Department, in the Ministry of Finance to

do a study on how best this could be done. We were

proposing,  for  example,  to  have  an  Executive

Officer    attached   to   a   secondary   school.

Unfortunately,  after  some  detailed  study   the

Management  Services Department came  out  with  a

negative answer. They said that it did not warrant

the  posting  of an Executive Officer  to  such  a

school  but they recommended the reduction of  the

size  of  the school and that in a school  with  a

large enrolment additional clerks could be posted.

Therefore,  when the school building programme  is

completed we should be able to considerably reduce

the school size and the administrative work of the

principal will be reduced accordingly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 3020.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first place, I would like to

congratulate   my  colleague,  the  Minister   for

Education,  on  his appointment as Vice-Chancellor

of  the  Nanyang  University.  As  the  Government

statement said, the Nanyang University must  catch

up with its development into a university of equal

standing with the University of Singapore, and the

appointment of the Education Minister as the Vice-Chancellor is the first step in this direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the establishment of the Nanyang University

was  to  solve the problem of further studies  for

students  of  the various language streams.  Since

its   establishment  the  Nanyang  University  has

weathered   many  a  storm.  All   along   Nanyang

University  has suffered from antenatal deficiency

and post-natal maladjustment. With the appointment

of  the Education Minister as the Vice-Chancellor,

there  will  be  no doubt that Nanyang  University

will  develop rapidly into a university  of  equal

standing with the University of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must stress that there is also no doubt

about   the   academic  achievements  of   Nanyang

University  graduates. The  only  disadvantage  is

that  they  are  not as proficient in  English  as

those  purely  English educated graduates  of  the

University of Singapore. Nanyang University should

emphasise  upon  their students a greater  use  of

English, which is their second language, so as  to

better   equip  them  for  their  jobs.   However,

irrespective of the language stream, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



must emphasise on the fostering of bilingualism in

order  to  fulfil  our national policy  of  nation

building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Government statement said that Nanyang

University  campus  extends  to  500  acres.   The

development potential of this campus has not  been

fully exploited to meet the national requirements.

Sir,  we  know that the new Vice-Chancellor  is  a

learned engineer with a Ph.D degree. When he takes

over  in  his new appointment he will be  able  to

assess the situation and develop the potentials of

the massive campus of Nanyang University according

to  its  topography, bordering  the  sea  and  the

Jurong  Industrial Town, the largest in Singapore.

He  will  also  be  able  to  introduce  practical

subjects and courses in order to meet our national

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next step towards equalising the status

of Nanyang University with University of Singapore

is  that  the service conditions of the  staff  of

both  the  Nanyang  University and  University  of

Singapore  should be the same, particularly  those

in  regard  to  fringe benefits. According  to  my

understanding,   staff  of   the   University   of

Singapore can apply for low-interest housing loans

whereas  those in Nanyang University do not  enjoy

this   good  privilege.  I  hope  the  new   Vice-Chancellor  will  look into this  matter  when  he

assumes   duty,  so  that  the  staff  of  Nanyang

University  may similarly enjoy the benefit  of  a

housing loan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the year before last I asked the Minister

concerned whether a day would be set aside to mark

Youth Day. The Parliamentary Secretary replied  on

behalf  of  the  Minister that he  would  take  my

suggestion into consideration. Sir, after a  lapse

of  two  years I think a decision would have  been

reached  on  this  matter. Can  the  Parliamentary

Secretary concerned therefore enlighten this House

as  to whether a day will be set aside during  the

school term to mark Youth Day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not possible for the

Ministry  of  Education to have a Youth  Day.  The

term  "youth", according to world-wide  definition

and   the   definition  used   by   the   People's

Association,  covers all persons  within  the  age

group of 18 to 30 years. As such the term does not

apply to our students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Member for Jurong may be pleased to

know  that  the Ministry is considering  declaring

the  Monday following the official opening of  the

Singapore  Youth  Festival  a  holiday   for   all

schools. The Member for Jurong and the rest of the

House  may also wish to know that, in view of  the

problems   of  traffic  congestion  and  transport

difficulties, the official opening ceremony of the

Youth Festival will, as from this year, be held on

a Sunday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation given by the

Parliamentary Secretary, I beg leave  to  withdraw

my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (c) of  subhead AAA 8306.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Jurong is proud to have a vocational

institute, namely the Jurong Vocational Institute,

and  its precincts. By virtue of its proximity  to

the Jurong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



industrial  town, the JVI has been able  to  train

skilled  personnel to meet the  exact  demands  of

industries.   Thus,   the  Institute   helps   the

advancement  of industries in Jurong in  no  small

measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I was told and I have seen for myself

the defects in the building of the Institute, as a

result  of  the  piling work carried  out  in  its

vicinity  in  recent years. The major defects  are

deep  cracks on the walls, and ceilings and sunken

floors.  Due  to the sinking ground  the  drainage

system has been totally destroyed. Water flows  in

directions where it should not flow. Water remains

stagnant  here  and there. I understand  that  the

Institute has requested the Ministry to make  good

all the defects. But so far the major defects have

still  not  been repaired. I do not know  what  is

holding  back  the repair work. Can  the  Minister

enlighten this House as to when all these  defects

will be repaired?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as this subject happens to be my

area   of   interest,  I  have   to   deprive   my

Parliamentary   Secretary  of  the   pleasure   of

replying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong Vocational Institute was built on

reclaimed  land  which consists of  a  very  thick

layer   of   peats.  The  design  of  the   Jurong

Vocational  Institute is such that the  loads  are

transferred from beams to the columns  on  to  the

pile  which go to the hard layer below the  peats.

All  the  floors are suspended floors so that  the

loads  from  the  machines and  human  beings  are

transferred to the floor beam which in turn go  on

to  the piles. On the other hand, such areas  like

the  apron  and  passage  way  which  are  not  of

critical importance are not constructed that  way.

They are built directly on the filled ground. As a

result   of   the  consolidation  of  the   peats,

settlement  takes place and the apron  settles  in

relation to the pile, and therefore we have  these

cracks. I believe, the PWD had already taken these

factors   into  consideration  in  their   design.

Therefore, there is no structural danger  in  this

building.  Ad hoc repairs have been made.  We  are

now  considering  what to do  when  the  final  or

rather the bulk of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



the consolidation of the peats has taken place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are here to vote for an appropriation of

$1.5  million for the relocation of schools. While

on  the one hand we are in need of schools in  the

housing  estates,  on the other  hand  we  have  a

surplus  of schools in the old housing estates.  I

do  not  blame the officials concerned  for  their

shortsightedness as the movement of population  is

sometimes unpredictable. The point I want to  make

is that why can we not design and build schools in

such a way that it is feasible for them to be used

as  primary schools at one stage and as  secondary

schools at a later stage?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Sir, it is not possible to convert a primary

school  directly  into  a  secondary  school.  If,

however, a primary school has to be converted into

a   secondary   school,  certain  facilities   not

provided for in the primary school will have to be

introduced. For example, workshops have got to  be

built,  science laboratories have got to be built,

and  there will be a need for a separate  assembly

hall and, of course, bigger desks and chairs.  The

Ministry is currently looking into a number of new

designs  for  both primary and secondary  schools.

The  Member for Jurong may be pleased to know that

the  designs  so  far considered  have  a  certain

degree of flexibility in them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clean Air Act, 1971, has been in operation

for   three  years  now.  It  has  proved  to   be

effective.   Thus,  many  industrial   and   trade

premises   which  used  to  cause  excessive   air

pollution have now been brought under surveillance

and  control.  The  air  pollution  Situation   in

Singapore has not deteriorated although  many  new

factories  have been established in the  last  few

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a number of minor inadequacies have been

detected  in the course of implementation  of  the

Act.  The  Clean  Air (Amendment)  Bill  seeks  to

rectify this situation so as to provide for better

control  of  air pollution and for more  effective

enforcement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, construction sites often give rise to

localised   air  pollution  resulting  in   public

complaints, if activities such as the operation of

a  concrete  mixing plant and the open burning  of

used  construction materials are carried out. Such

activities have to be controlled. This Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>





will   bring   construction   sites   within   the

definition  of "industrial or trade  premises"  so

that  the Clean Air Act, 1971, will also apply  to

these sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In older industrial and trade premises, air

pollution  is often caused by the use of  obsolete

and  inefficient methods of operation and process.

To  solve this, the occupiers of such premises may

be  required  to  change or alter the  methods  of

operation or process to those involving  less  air

pollution.  In  other cases, the Director  of  Air

Pollution  Control may require  the  occupiers  to

dismantle  or disconnect any industrial  plant  or

equipment  which  are  found  to  cause  excessive

pollution.  The  Bill  will extend  the  scope  of

requirements  which  the Director  may  impose  to

include those just mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the passing of the Prohibition on the Use

of  Open Fires Order, 1973, the incidence of  open

burning  in  Singapore has decreased tremendously.

This has helped to reduce low level air pollution.

However,  in the enforcement, there has been  some

difficulty  in proving the charge of open  burning

within  industrial and trade premises, as such  an

act  is  usually committed by the occupier of  the

premises  when  the enforcement officers  are  not

around. To overcome this, the relevant section  in

the  Clean Air Act will be amended by including  a

presumptive clause making the occupier responsible

for  the offence if open burning were to be  found

in his premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many occupiers of existing industrial and

trade  premises have installed or plan to  install

air  pollution control equipment, there  are  some

recalcitrants  who prefer to pay  the  fines  when

brought  to  court  rather  than  take  corrective

measures. Sir, this is not desirable in the  long-term.  Therefore, it is necessary to  empower  the

Magistrate's Court or District Court to impose the

maximum  penalty or punishment for offences  under

the  Clean  Air Act and Regulations, if the  fines

were to be a sufficient deterrent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in seeking these amendments I would like to

assure  that  a  balanced  approach,  taking  into

consideration not only the wider interests of  the

community but also the specific interests of other

sectors, will continue to prevail as had been done

in the implementation of the Clean Air Act, 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the short Bill now before this House is

primarily   designed  to   ensure,   as   far   as

practicable, that electors who have changed  their

addresses do not go back to the electoral division

according to their former addresses to cast  their

votes in an election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the names of electors appear in the

registers  of electors according to the  addresses

shown  in  their identity cards even though  these

addresses  may  have ceased to exist,  e.g, as  a

result   of  clearance  for  urban  renewal.   The

amendment  proposed in clause 2 of the  Bill  will

empower the Registration Officer to omit from  the

registers  of  electors the names of  all  persons

whose  addresses  he has reason  to  believe  have

ceased  to  exist. This will ensure that  electors

voting  at  an election for a particular electoral

division are the residents of that division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also empower the Minister to direct

the  Registration Officer to update the  registers

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



electors,   whenever   necessary.   At    present,

registers  of  electors  which  are  prepared   in

respect  of  electoral divisions consequent  on  a

change  of electoral boundaries cannot be  revised

except  after  a General Election. Lapse  of  time

between  the  certification of such registers  and

Polling  Day may make such registers incomplete  - it is estimated that there are about 10,000 people

changing  their  addresses monthly.  The  updating

will   also   enable  newly  qualified   electors,

averaging 50,000 each year, to be included in  the

register of electors.

<div align="center"><b>WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact the

Workmen's  Compensation Act, 1971 (Cap. 130).  The

spirit  of  the  1971 Act has  been  retained  and

reinforced by a number of innovations which I will

dwell upon in greater detail later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any workmen's compensation scheme must

provide  for expeditious and adequate  payment  of

compensation. But the procedure laid down  in  the 1971  Act  has  been  found to be  time-consuming,

causing long and unnecessary delays in the payment

of   compensation.  Under  the   1971   Act,   the

Commissioner for Labour will assess the amount  of

compensation payable and this assessment  is  then

sent  to the parties concerned. Since the Act does

not  provide for a time limit for the employer  to

either  object  to the assessment or  to  pay  the

compensation, a great number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



employers  have  in the past deliberately  ignored

the   notice  of  assessment.  It  is  only  after

repeated reminders that we get a response from the

employer.  The employer may further delay  payment

of  compensation by disputing either the extent of

his liability to pay compensation or the extent of

dependency of the claimants on the earnings of the

deceased  worker. Under the Act, full compensation

is  payable only if there has been full dependency

and  proportionate  payment if  there  is  partial

dependency.  In either of the cases  that  I  have

just  mentioned, an inquiry has to be held by  the

Commissioner  for Labour which is  often  a  long-drawn  affair. If no agreement is reached  at  the

conclusion  of  the inquiry, then the  dispute  is

referred  to  the  Arbitrator. More  time  elapses

before the disputed case is finally settled by the

Arbitrator.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in cases where there is no dispute over the

assessed  quantum  and degree of  dependency,  the

claimants cannot be compensated immediately  until

a  Memorandum of Agreement has been signed by both

parties.  Here  again,  the  employer  can   delay

payment by not completing the Agreement. To  crown

it  all, the Act requires that a waiting period of

seven  days  be observed before the Memorandum  of

Agreement can be registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the House will agree that

this long delay is not only undesirable in that it

works  to  the detriment of the injured worker  or

his dependants but wholly unnecessary. My Ministry

has   therefore  decided  to  replace  the   time-consuming   procedures  with  a  new   system   of

administration  and  enforcement   providing   for

expeditious  payment  of  workmen's  compensation.

Also in the new Bill dependency will no longer  be

a  bone  of  contention. The assessed compensation

will  be  paid in full regardless of  whether  the

dependency is full or partial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has also found that the

provision  for  insurance coverage for  employer's

liability  is unsatisfactory. Under the  1971  Act

the insurer is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



required  to pay directly to the Commissioner  for

Labour the assessed compensation on behalf of  the

employer.  My  Ministry has found  that  insurance

companies also often delayed payments, or in  some

cases  even  refused  to pay,  on  the  ground  of

alleged breach of insurance policies taken out  by

the  employers. The House might like to know  that

in one case an insurance company took eight months

to  investigate before informing the  Ministry  of

its  refusal to pay on grounds that the policy was

under-declared.  This Bill also  seeks  to  remedy

this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the House is fully aware of the rise in the

cost of living over the last few years as a result

largely  of  inflation originating from  overseas.

The  level of compensation payable under the  1971

Act  is, however, not proportionate to the  margin

of  increase  in  the  cost of  living  today.  My

Ministry, therefore, has taken the opportunity  to

increase the quantum of workmen's compensation  in

the new Bill to a more realistic level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increased use of different types of

chemicals,  resins and other irritating substances

in  modem  production processes and the prevailing

high  noise  levels  in industries  like  textile,

shipbuilding    and    ship-repairing,    building

construction  and  metal container  manufacturing,

the  Ministry finds it necessary to add industrial

dermatitis and noise-induced deafness to the  list

of  diseases  for which workmen's compensation  is

payable. The listing of these two diseases besides

forming  part of our continuing efforts to improve

the  health and welfare of workers is also a  step

forward  in  bringing our legislation more  up-to-date   and  in  line  with  present  day   working

environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also taken the opportunity in the

new Bill to provide for the establishment of a new

Workers'  Fund. The objectives of  the  Fund  are,

inter alia, to finance rehabilitation schemes  for

injured  workers  so  that  they  can  return   to

productive  labour and to finance  other  projects

for the general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



advancement   of  the  welfare   of   workers   in

Singapore.  The  establishment of this  Fund  will

underline the importance we in our Republic attach

to  the role workers play in our national economic

development.  It  is  my hope  that,  once  it  is

established, firms and other organisations will be

forthcoming with their donations which will  enjoy

exemption from income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Workmen's Compensation Act merely

compensates  but can never remove the  sorrow  and

anguish   suffered   by  the  bereaved   families.

Important  and necessary as workmen's compensation

is,   my  Ministry  is  more  concerned  with  the

prevention   of  industrial  accidents.   As   our

Republic   develops  rapidly  towards   a   higher

industrial  and technological base, the  injection

of   more   sophisticated   machineries   in   the

manufacturing sector is unavoidable.  Consequently

the  methods  of production and material  handling

have also undergone revolutionary changes. Most of

the  industrial accidents occurred under these new

working  environments and exposures to machineries

hitherto  unfamiliar  to  our  new  generation  of

workers.  In 1970, the total number of  industrial

and  occupational accidents was 9,682. This figure

gradually climbed to the peak of 13,094  in  1973,

registering  an increase of 35%. During  the  same

period,  the amount of compensation paid out  also

recorded  an increase of 287.5% from $1.6  million

to  nearly $6.2 million. In 1974 the total  number

of accidents registered was 12,639, representing a

decline  of  455 cases or 3.5% over  the  previous

year.  However,  the number of  actual  fatalities

registered an increase of six cases or  3.8%  over

the  previous year's figure of 160. The amount  of

compensation  paid  out as at  December  1974  was

$5,834,000  not including outstanding claims.  The

final  figure for the year, therefore, might  well

match  that of 1973. It can be seen that  although

the  overall number of accidents dropped  by  3.5%

the  amount  of compensation paid remained  almost

the same because there were more severe injury and

fatal  cases.  As human resources  constitute  our

only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



natural resources, a special responsibility  rests

on  employers  to  maintain  a  safe  and  healthy

working  environment  and  to  ensure  that  their

workforce observe all the safety regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a legislation intended to

prevent  accidents  or  to  offer  remedy  to  the

problems   of   safety  and  health   regulations.

Separate  legislation, principally  the  Factories

Act  and  its subsidiary regulations,  will  cover

this  particular aspect. There should be no  doubt

now in the minds of everyone that nobody gains  in

an   industrial  or  occupational  accident.   The

employer loses manhours and productivity, throwing

production  line off-gear and upsetting production

schedule;   the   insurance   company   loses   in

compensation,  but  most  important  of  all,  the

worker  loses  his  life and his  family  loses  a

breadwinner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increase in the quantum of compensation

under this new Bill should not be looked upon as a

punitive measure but rather an attempt to strike a

reasonable  balance  between  the  needs  of   the

victims  and their families and what the  industry

can bear. The House may be interested to know that

the  contractors' organisations  and  the  General

Insurance  Association, under the guidance  of  my

Ministry's Building Construction Safety and Health

Committee,  are  now exploring the possibility  of

working  out a new incentive-orientated  insurance

rebates  scheme. I hope that this will be extended

to all other employers as there is more reason now

to  have  this  incentive scheme in  view  of  the

increase in the quantum of compensation.  The  net

result can only be savings all round. As there are

extensive  amendments and in view  of  the  Bill's

importance, it is proposed to commit the Bill to a

Select  Committee of Parliament so that  views  of

all interested parties can be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main provisions of this Amendment Bill

are  detailed in the explanatory statement to this

Bill.  Let me now elaborate on some of the salient

features of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision establishes the Workers' Fund in

clause 6 and pro-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



vides  that  where  a  deceased  workman  has  no

dependant, compensation is nevertheless payable to

the Workers' Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7, which is to be read with the Third

Schedule,  provides for increased compensation  to

an   injured  workman.  The  maximum  compensation

payable  in  fatal  cases  has  been  raised  from

$21,600  to  $35,000  and in permanent  incapacity

cases   from  $28,800  to  $45,000.  In  temporary

incapacity cases, from one-third wages paid  half-monthly to full wages for 14 days if there  is  no

hospitalisation  and 60 days where hospitalisation

is involved. To ensure that the injured worker and

his  dependants will in fact obtain the  increased

quantum  of compensation, the multiplying  factors

for   computing   compensation  have   also   been

increased.  For  fatal cases, it  is  108  months'

earnings  in the ease of a workman below 40  years

of  age;  84  months' earnings in the  case  of  a

workman who is 40 years of age and above but below

50  years of age; 72 months' earnings in the  case

of a workman who is 50 years of age and above. For

permanent  incapacity cases,  it  is  144  months'

earnings in the case of a workman who is below  40

years of age; 120 months' earnings in the case  of

a  workman  who is 40 years of age and  above  but

below 50 years of age; 96 months' earnings in  the

case  of  a  workman who is 50 years  of  age  and

above. The percentages of loss of earnings used to

calculate  compensation  in  permanent  incapacity

cases involving traumatic injuries have also  been

revised upwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important feature of the Bill is the

elimination of time-consuming procedures  and  the

introduction of a new system of administration and

enforcement providing for expeditious  payment  of

workmen's compensation. This is achieved by clause

24  of  the Bill. Under this clause, the employer,

unless  he has grounds for objection, is  required

to  deposit the assessed sum of compensation  with

the  Commissioner for Labour within 21 days of the

service  of  the  notice  of  assessment.  If  the

employer fails to do so, an interest of 1�% per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



month  will be levied on the late payment.  If  he

disputes the assessment, in accordance with clause

25  he  must state in writing the grounds  of  his

objection  to the Commissioner within 14  days  of

the  service  of  the notice. Where  the  employer

disputes  liability, under clause 25 of the  Bill,

the  Commissioner is vested with the powers of the

Arbitrator  to hold a hearing and make  the  final

decision  on the case. There can be no  appeal  to

the   High   Court  under  clause  28   unless   a

substantial question of law is involved and  where

the amount of dispute is not less than $1,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 makes payment of compensation even more

expeditious in that it enables proceedings  to  be

brought directly against an insurer who has issued

a policy of insurance covering an employer against

liability for workmen's compensation. Insurers can

no  longer  dispute  liability  to  pay  workmen's

compensation purely on ground of alleged breach of

insurance  policies as under  clause  35  (1)  (k)

regulations  will be made for the  prohibition  of

conditions and exceptions in policies of insurance

issued  or  renewed for the purpose  of  workmen's

compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, noise is the symphony of

the  machine age and a permanent part of our life.

As   such,  it  should  be  controlled   like   an

orchestra. With that note, Sir, I rise in  support

of the Workmen's Compensation Bill standing in the

name of the Minister for Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to specially congratulate the Honourable

Minister  for his wisdom and foresight to  include

noise-induced deafness as one of the  occupational

diseases  listed  in the Second  Schedule  of  the

Bill.   This,   in  my  view,  is  an  appropriate

complement of section 58



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



(Part VII) of the Factories Act (No. 6 of 1973)

which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where in any factory persons are employed in any

process  involving exposure to excessive noise  or

vibration which may constitute a danger  to  their

health effective means shall as far as practicable

be  provided  for the reduction of such  noise  or

vibration'.



<br><br>I  think,  Sir, the time is opportune  to  include

basic    requirements   on   noise   control    in

occupational safety and health legislation.  There

may  be  authoritative codes of practice on  noise

control,  but  their influence,  sad  to  say,  is

unlikely  to  have  a  sufficiently  rapid  effect

unless underpinned by legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise pollution, like air and water pollution, is

largely a consequence of the man-made environment,

the   result  of  the  application  of  technology

without  first considering fully the  impact  upon

people.  To the extent that it is manmade,  it  is

not likely to go away, but will undoubtedly become

more  serious  unless  effective  strategies   are

developed for its control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this Bill and the

enactment of the Factories Act of 1973, Singapore,

like  many  other industrialised and  high-density

urban societies, is beginning to join battle  with

noise.  It is very encouraging to see that we  are

joining  battle  before the  problem  reaches  the

proportions  of a crisis. We are in  a  relatively

early  stage  of noise pollution and  any  control

imposed now is therefore very timely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most technically well developed countries

exhibit, or have exhibited for a number of  years,

a   degree  of  concern  towards  the  problem  of

environmental noise. In the past decade or so,  an

increasing  number of countries  have  transformed

their  concern  into  concrete action,  developing

specific methods for controlling the problem to  a

sensible level. Of the arsenal of weapons at their

disposal, most of them have chosen the legislative

process as their prime method of control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial noise has recently become a live issue

in  the  field  of compensation. For instance,  in

Britain  in 1971 an action for damages was brought

by one F. R. Berry against his employers, Stone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



Manganese & Marine Ltd., for their alleged failure

to  provide adequate protection against  excessive

noise  in a chipping workshop. As a result of  his

work,  Berry's hearing deteriorated  gravely.  The

judgment was that the employers were negligent  in

failing  to supply ear-muffs to him when he  first

started   in  the  industry.  The  plaintiff   was

accordingly awarded �1,250. In this respect,  Sir,

I am glad to note that the amount of compensation,

as  detailed  under  the  Third  Schedule  of  the

Workmen's  Compensation Bill, in the  case  of  an

injury causing the loss of hearing of one ear is

30%  of  the  compensation which would  have  been

payable in the case of permanent total incapacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few countries provide stiff penalties for

non-compliance  with the law. Certainly  penalties

do  not seem to be framed in terms of criminal and

civil punishments; rather fines are levied on  the

offender. Perhaps the stiffest penalties are to be

found  in  the USA where non-compliance  with  the

requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health

Act  can  result  in  fines up to  US$10,000  and,

indeed, in the worst case, in the possible  forced

closing  down  of a plant. And, if  the  plant  in

question  falls  under  the  Walsh-Healey   Public

Contracts  Act,  the Company in  question  may  be

denied the right to bid on US Government contracts

for a period of up to three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some exceptions. Sir, countries that are

now tackling the problem of noise-induced deafness

define a noise criterion equivalent to 90dB (A) as

a  standard which must be met over the course of a

working day if undue risk of damage to hearing  is

to  be  avoided. A notable exception is  the  USSR

which  defines  a - noise criterion equivalent  to

85dB  (A).  And, a still more remarkable exception

is France which, in a decree of April 1969, stated

that  a  noise  level of 80dB (A)  should  not  be

exceeded in all factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is generally made, too, for the

effects of impulsive noise. Here, the various laws

existing  today  tend to differ considerably,  but

this, however, is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



indication  of  the  less than adequate  state  of

knowledge  in  this  area. In another  action  for

damages, in Great Britain, for example, a  certain

W.   Derby   was  awarded  �27,000   against   his

employers,  Short Brothers & Harland, for  causing

his  instantaneous deafness. A  weapon  was  being

fired  which  deafened the man instantly.  It  was

stated   that  if  there  had  not  been   a   10%

contributory negligence, the plaintiff would  have

been  awarded  �30,000. The same accident  in  the

Australian  Capital Territory would have  entitled

the  plaintiff to a maximum claim of A$9,450 while

in  Queensland  (Australia), he would,  under  the

Queensland Workers' Compensation Act, be awarded a

meagre A$5,330.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also my opinion that the measurement

of  the hearing levels of each employee likely  to

be  exposed to excessive noise forms an  essential

part  of  a  hearing conservation  programme,  and

should  be practised by all `noisy' industries  in

Singapore. These tests should be carried out by  a

medical practitioner who is able to interpret  the

results  in conjunction with a medical history  of

each   individual   and  a   knowledge   of   that

individual's work environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audiometric tests should be made at the

commencement    of   the   hearing    conservation

programme,  repeated  in  three  months  from  the

commencement, and thence every six  months  for  a

period  of  two  to three years depending  on  the

noise environment, and then annually. In this way,

the  success  of the programme can be measured  by

demonstrating that no further loss of  hearing  is

occurring  in any exposed workman. These  periodic

tests  also detect the occasional employee who  is

more susceptible to noise than the average person,

or   the  employee  who  is  receiving  inadequate

protection due to poor-fitting ear plugs or muffs,

or failing to use the protection supplied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tests should also be made on each new employee

as part of a engagement examination at the time of

engagement. Pre-existing ear disease or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



deafness  may  make it desirable to  place  a  new

employee in a less noisy environment for  his  own

sake.  Replacement examination  and  testing  also

provides  opportunity to educate the new  employee

in  the  hazards  associated with excessive  noise

exposure and to provide him with ear protectors if

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of personal hearing protective

equipment,   I   wish  to  stress  to   industries

contemplating using them that they be used only as

a  last resort, when there is no apparent feasible

means   of   controlling   industrial   noise   by

engineering or administrative processes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When introducing personal hearing protection

devices,  it  is  important to  ensure  that  both

management and employees have a full and  thorough

understanding of the aims of and the need for  the

programme. If hasty decisions are made or  if  the

programme   is  presented  to  employees   without

adequately  preparing them for participation,  co-operation   is  difficult  to  achieve.   My   own

observations,  Sir, have shown  that  insufficient

efforts, on the part of the employers, to  educate

employees    have,   in   the   past,    led    to

misunderstanding  of  the  employer's  motive  and

objectives,  to  discontent and  to  the  eventual

rejection  of  the protection. My message  to  the

employers is: they are under a duty to take  steps

by  propaganda and persuasion to see that  hearing

protection equipment is used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of safety and health

legislation is to safeguard life and limb  and  to

promote health. But the mere enactment of words on

the  statute  book will by no means  achieve  this

result.  In the final analysis, everything depends

on  the  actions  of the individual  people  -both

management and employees. Major reliance  must  be

placed  upon  line  managers  or  supervisors   to

control the day-to-day performance of the work. It

is  essential, therefore, that members of the line

management are able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



understand  their legal duties and act upon  them.

Safety   officers  and  specialists,   Sir,   have

important roles to play, but they cannot be  ever-present.

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill now before this House seeks to

amend  the  Broadcasting  and  Television  Act  by

adding a new subsection to section 3 of the Act to

provide  that the Government and any  employee  of

the Government shall not be liable for any loss or

damage  sustained by a person as a  result  of  an

error,  omission  or inaccuracy in  any  broadcast

matter transmitted under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news bulletins broadcast by TV and Radio are

based,  in part, on news supplied by international

news  agencies, such as Reuters. UPI and  ASP.  In

the  agreement between the Broadcasting Department

and  the news agency for the supply of news, there

is  a  clause,  which  is  standard  in  all  such

Agreements, that although the news agency will  do

its  utmost  to  ensure the  accuracy  and  prompt

delivery  of  its news service, it will,  however,

not  be  liable  for any loss  or  damage  to  the

Broadcasting Department as a result of any  error,

omission  or  inaccuracy on the part of  the  news

agency.   This   leaves  the  Government   in   an

unsatisfactory position as there is  no  provision

in  the  Broadcasting and Television Act to exempt

the  Government  and its employees from  liability

for  any  loss or damage arising from  any  error,

omission  or inaccuracy in its broadcasts  of  the

news supplied by the agency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlikely that the news agency will not

honour  its Agreement to provide accurate,  prompt

and   uninterrupted  news  service.  Nevertheless,

there is always the possibility of error, omission

or  inaccuracy in the news supplied  by  the  news

agency  caused  by  the fault of  their  servants,

agents or others. Should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



there be any error, omission or inaccuracy in RTS'

broadcasts,  as a result of any fault or  omission

on  the  part  of the news agency, the  Government

would have no protection against claims brought by

the   public,  since  the  Government   would   be

precluded from obtaining indemnity from  the  news

agency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new subsection (2) introduced by clause 2 of

this  Bill is to guard against such claims brought

against the Government by the public. It will give

the  Government the same protection  as  the  news

agency   seeks   by   its   Agreement   with   the

Broadcasting Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill, 1975, was

introduced  in  Parliament on 25th February  1975.

The  Bill,  now before the House, seeks to  repeal

and  re-enact section 93, subsection (2),  of  the

Women's Charter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter was enacted in 1961 and since

its coming into operation a number of difficulties

in its application have arisen making it necessary

for  it to be reviewed in relation to the changing

social and economic situation in Singapore and the

need to strengthen the family unit in our society.

Amendments are also necessary to ensure  that  the

legislation is socially



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



relevant and effective in enhancing the status and

promoting the welfare of women and families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967, an Act was passed to amend the Women's

Charter.  One  of the main purposes  was  to  make

clear that non-Muslim customary marriages will  be

brought  within  the ambit of the Charter  and  be

solemnised  in  accordance with its provisions.  A

new  section  was  inserted in the  Charter  which

provides  that  a  marriage  which  is  solemnised

without  a  certificate for marriage or a  licence

authorising  the  marriage from the  Registrar  of

Marriages  or  the Minister, as the case  may  be,

shall be void.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention of the Government to

prevent  customary marriages from taking place.  A

person  before  going through a Chinese  customary

marriage should comply with the provisions of  the

Charter  relating  to capacity,  minimum  age  and

consent.  A certificate for marriage or a  licence

under  the  provisions  of  the  Charter  must  be

obtained. Once a person has obtained a certificate

for  marriage or a licence, he is free to have his

marriage  solemnised in accordance with  the  law,

religion, customs or usage of the parties  or  any

of  the  parties to the marriage by an  authorised

person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family is the basic social institution. The

way  families are started through marriage and the

stability of family life have far-reaching  social

consequences  in  any  society.  The   Government,

therefore, takes a serious view of the contracting

of "marriages" which are void. Since the beginning

of  1974, action has been taken against those  who

are   found  to  have  contracted  void  marriages

contrary  to  the  requirements  of  the   Women's

Charter. An educational and publicity campaign has

also  been conducted to make it known that  it  is

the obtaining of a certificate or a licence before

a   customary   marriage  is  solemnised   by   an

authorised person and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



the  solemnisation of a marriage by the  Registrar

that gives a marriage legal validity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1973, a grace period was given to

couples   who  had  contracted  invalid  customary

marriages  to  have  their  "marriages"   properly

solemnised at the Registry of Marriages. A  record

number  of  11,479 couples responded. Many  people

contract   void  marriages  by  contravening   the

provisions of the Women's Charter. A void marriage

is  no  marriage at all. It is regarded  as  never

having  taken  place.  By virtue  of  section  93,

subsection (2), of the Women's Charter, the  child

of  a void "marriage" is deemed to be a legitimate

child  of  his  or  her  parents,  and  under  our

citizenship laws, if any one of his or her parents

is  a  Singapore  citizen, he or  she  is  also  a

Singapore   citizen.  The  child   born   out   of

cohabitation or out of wedlock is not a  Singapore

citizen  unless his or her mother is  a  Singapore

citizen.  Since a void marriage is no marriage  in

law,  the child of a void marriage should  acquire

Singapore  citizenship on the  same  basis  as  an

illegitimate  child. It is not  desirable  that  a

child  whose parents knowingly contracted  a  void

marriage  should qualify for Singapore citizenship

more  easily than an illegitimate child. So, under

the  new provision, if a man and a woman marry and

they  both know that their marriage is not a valid

one,   their  children  will  be  deemed   to   be

illegitimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change is particularly necessary in our

social  situation as there are work permit holders

who  are  required  to seek the  approval  of  the

Commissioner for Employment before they contract a

marriage  with  a  Singapore  citizen.  Some  work

permit  holders are circumventing this requirement

by  contracting customary marriages  in  Singapore

knowing  full well that such marriages  contracted

on  or  after 2nd June, 1967, are void. Under  the

existing  law,  the  children born  of  such  void

marriages  are  deemed legitimate  and  they  will

acquire Singapore citizenship on the same basis as

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



legitimate child acquires Singapore citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marriage can be void for a number of reasons,

such as when one partner is underage or is already

married.   Under   the  proposed  amendment,   the

children of such marriages would be deemed  to  be

legitimate, because under the new provision,  both

or  either  of  the  parents may  have  reasonably

believed that the marriage was valid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the other amendment to the Women's

Charter introduced in this Bill. A new section 168

will  be  added to the Women's Charter to make  it

clear  that  the  customary  marriages  contracted

before  2nd June, 1967, will continue to be valid,

so  long as they do not contravene section 4 or 10

of  the Women's Charter in force at that time.  In

some cases, the High Court declared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



such marriages null and void. The decision of the

High Court on these cases will remain unchanged

despite this new provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
