<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the Minister

for  Finance whether the Government has any plan to re-site the sawmills in the Kampong Kembangan Constituency

in an area for the sawmill industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Kampong

Kembangan may be pleased to know that so far about  100

acres  of swamp land at Kranji have been reclaimed  and

will be developed to provide sites for sawmills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will appreciate that it is necessary to

relocate  some of our sawmills in Singapore  which,  at

present,  occupy  strategic  sites  in  the  city   and

suburban   areas.   While   sawmilling   is   providing

employment for quite a number of people, the land  that

they   now  occupy  in  the  heart  of  the  city   and

surrounding  areas  can be better  used.  The  Economic

Development  Board,  together  with  the  Housing   and

Development Board, will give priority to sawmills which

have  to  be  relocated to make way for urban  renewal,

housing  and industrial projects. To date, the Economic

Development  Board has received about  70  applications

for  sawmills for sites at Kranji. The first 100  acres

so  far reclaimed will be able to accommodate about  25

sawmills.  It is the Government's intention  to  locate

all sawmills at Kranji so that better amenities for the

sawmill  industry  can be provided. The  allocation  of

land  will begin as soon as the site at Kranji has been

serviced with electricity and water.

<div align="center"><b>RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL BY CAUSEWAY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the House and

all  people of goodwill will share our regrets and deep

disappointment that today the Causeway  has  failed  to

bridge the gulf between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The

Causeway has seen historical moments since it was built

42 years ago. There was a brief period of a month or so

when  the  Causeway  was blown up during  the  war  and

traffic between the mainland and Singapore ceased,  but

this  was  a physical damage which was quickly repaired

so  that communication by road and rail between the two

territories was resumed. Now for the second time in its

history   the   Causeway's   economic   and   strategic

importance  is  once  more brought  to  the  fore.  The

political  separation  of Singapore  and  Malaysia  has

today  reached  a  climax in the  announcement  by  the

Malaysian  Minister for Home Affairs of the  intentions

of  the Malaysian Government to impose restrictions  on

the   entry   of   Singapore  citizens   into   Malaya,

particularly  restrictions on those who travel  by  the

Causeway. There are on the average 20,000 persons a day

who  move across the Causeway from Singapore to  Malaya

and about the same number of persons travel from Johore

into  Singapore. The number of persons who will  suffer

any  inconvenience caused by the proposed  restrictions

is  therefore  not small, but I am sure that  Singapore

citizens  are  patient and they will no doubt  bear  up

with  it. I had hoped that any decisions on immigration

control at the Causeway



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



would  have  received  first the consideration  of  the

joint  Singapore/Malaysian  Immigration  Committee,  so

that the problem can be considered from all angles, but

it  was  unfortunate indeed that a  decision  has  been

taken  unilaterally by the Malaysian  Government.  Soon

after the break of Singapore from Malaysia on the  23rd

August,  1965,  I wrote to the Malaysian  Minister  for

Home  Affairs  suggesting that the two Governments  co-ordinate  policies  on immigration,  particularly  with

regard  to  travel across the Causeway.  The  Malaysian

Deputy Prime Minister replied on 16th September,  1965,

agreeing  to  the  proposal  and  suggested  that   the

immigration  officials  of the two  Governments  should

meet  to examine the problem. This meeting of officials

was  held  on  11th  October, 1965. The  Malaysian  and

Singapore sides were led by their respective  Heads  of

Immigration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting agreed that it was desirable that the

existing  free movement across the Causeway  should  be

maintained.  There should be a co-ordinated  policy  of

immigration control between the two territories. It was

also  agreed that the present practice of common  visas

for  Malaysia and Singapore should continue, i.e, visas

for  Malaysia  will  be valid for Singapore  and  vice-versa, except where special conditions are applied.  It

was  also agreed that in order to preserve the existing

free  movement  across the Causeway,  both  Governments

would  issue Exemption Orders to provide for  entry  of

persons  from  the States of Malaya into Singapore  and

vice-versa without a permit or a pass.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Exemption Orders, provision would be made to

prohibit   undesirables  from  either  territory   from

entering the other territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machinery by which Malaysia could exercise

immigration  control  at the Causeway  was,  therefore,

already  in  existence, and if there were persons  whom

the   Malaysian   Government   considered   undesirable

elements,  or persona non-grata, or who were  held  to

have  subversive  intentions, these could  have  easily

been  stopped by the Singapore immigration  authorities

or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  Police from travelling into Malaya  via  the

Causeway. It has, therefore, come as a surprise  to  us

that this official machinery was brushed aside, and the

facility offered by Singapore Immigration to assist has

been ignored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the many Singapore citizens who travel across

the Causeway to Johore Bahru to patronise Johore satay,

mee  stalls and other establishments more esoteric, for

those who take weekends off to Mersing and Kota Tinggi,

and  for international tourists who wish to see the odd

pineapple   or  rubber  plantation  in  Johore,   these

restrictions  certainly  must  make  them  think  twice

whether  it will be worth their while to endure custom,

immigration and police checks, in order that  they  can

pursue  the  little pleasures which nearby  Johore  may

offer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is too serious a matter for us to

treat  as  a game of ping-pong. It will be childish  to

answer  every Malaysian ping with a pong. The Singapore

Government  will  not retaliate by requiring  Malaysian

citizens in Singapore to report at police stations.  We

do  not  consider  Malaysian citizens  as  aliens  even

though  legally  they  are  distinguished  from  us  by

citizenship and, in any case, even aliens in  Singapore

do  not  have to report at police stations. It is  only

criminal law supervisees who are required to report  at

police  stations  in Singapore. We do  not  think  that

anyone  who has intentions to subvert Singapore  or  to

jeopardise the internal security of the State will want

to  report himself at a police station and announce his

intentions to the sergeant-in-charge. We do  not  treat

Malaysian  citizens in Singapore either as  undesirable

aliens,  subversives or criminals. Malaysians  who  are

visitors or residents in Singapore are not required  to

report at our police stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August the 9th, the day of Singapore's separation

from  Malaysia  last  year, I had  announced  that  the

Singapore end of the Causeway would always be  open  to

Malaysians. We do not intend to impose any restrictions

unless  and  until  the Malaysian Government  initiated

them,  because  we  consider  the  people  across   the

Causeway our fellow brethren.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



It  is with sorrow indeed that we hear of the Malaysian

Government's intention to impose a border pass or  visa

requirement for visitors from Singapore in six  months'

time. I do not know whether the consequences of such  a

policy  have  been carefully studied,  what  impact  it

would create in the minds of those who, for business or

other  reasons, travel very regularly between Singapore

and Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether this scheme of immigration

control  is  to  be a permanent feature. Meanwhile,  we

have  to be patient and hope that it is not so. On  the

other  hand, if such immigration restrictions become  a

permanent  feature of Malaysian policy, then  obviously

Singapore  must  re-examine  the  position.  Until  the

picture becomes clearer, we intend to keep our  end  of

the Causeway open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had hoped that the assurance which I had given on the

night of Friday, the 15th of April, that Singapore will

not  be used as an instrument to injure Malaysia  would

have been accepted in good faith. It has come to us  as

a  great disappointment indeed that, in spite of  this,

such a precipitate step has been taken by the Malaysian

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat that recognition of a country's

independence  is  a unilateral act,  but  it  does  not

necessarily  follow  that  there  will  be   diplomatic

representation  simply because of recognition.  In  any

case,  according to a Straits Times report  on  Friday,

the  15th of April, 1966, despatched from Bangkok by  a

special  correspondent, an Indonesian official  who  is

very  close  to Lieut.-Gen. Suharto and Dr Adam  Malik

has  described  the  question  of  re-establishing   an

Indonesian   mission  in  Singapore  as  of   secondary

importance.   The  Indonesian  official   was   further

reported  to  have said that Indonesia  had  diplomatic

relations  with  many  countries  where  they  had   no

diplomatic missions. We assure the Malaysian Government

that  the question of Indonesia setting up a diplomatic

mission  in Singapore will not be decided except  after

discussion with the Malaysian Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one denies that our experience in the last war is

that  Malaya is indefensible without Singapore, and  so

also  Singapore  is indefensible without  Malaya,  i.e.

Malaysia  today. It is common sense that  it  would  be

folly  for  Singapore to permit itself to  be  used  to

confront  Malaysia. I would like to  reiterate  to  the

people of Malaysia and the Malaysian Government that we

will  not  allow  Singapore to be used  as  a  base  by

anybody  to  threaten the security of Malaysia.  It  is

indeed  a pity that the Malaysian Government has  taken

this  precipitate  action by imposing  Causeway  travel

restrictions   in  anticipation  of  what   it   thinks

Singapore  may  do.  It  is  our  hope  that  our  good

intentions  towards  the people  of  Malaysia  and  the

Malaysian Government will be clear by our acceptance of

the invitation by the Malaysian Government to attend  a

meeting  on  mutual defence interests and economic  co-operation  between the officials of the two Governments

which will be held on May the 9th.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr Speaker, I wish to ask questions on the Ministerial

statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. But I would like to remind Members

that  they  may  only  ask questions  strictly  on  the

statement.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to ask

four   questions   on  the  Deputy   Prime   Minister's

statement.   The  first  is:  until  today   have   the

Indonesians   made  official  contact   regarding   its

intention  to  recognise Singapore as a  sovereign  and

independent Republic?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Just a minute. Let us take it question

by question, shall we? Dr Toh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> We have not received any official

contact from the Government of Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Since Indonesia announced

its intention to recognise Singapore, have official  or

unofficial negotiations between Indonesia and Singapore

been started?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> There has been no consultation, in

the  sense that the Member means, between the Singapore

Government and the Malaysian Government. I, of  course,

would  like  to  remind the House that insofar  as  the

right  of  Singapore to establish diplomatic  relations

with  foreign countries is concerned, this is  entirely

within  our  own province, and therefore  consultations

are  not  really  necessary. But where such  diplomatic

relations may impinge on the defence interests  of  the

two  countries,  it is natural that discussions  should

take place.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Has the Malaysian

Government informed us officially regarding its  action

to   impose  travel  restrictions  on  the  people   of

Singapore at the Causeway?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Minister for Foreign Affairs

tells   me  that  he  has  not  received  any  official

notification  from the Government of  Malaysia  of  the

police checks and other immigration restrictions  which

they propose to impose at their end of the Causeway.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): What steps will be taken by

the  Singapore Government to alleviate the difficulties

experienced by the people of Singapore when they  cross

the Causeway?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is, of course, within the

province  of the Malaysian Government to erect whatever

barriers  they  wish at their end of the  Causeway  and

impose any checks that they think are desirable, and we

cannot interfere. Naturally we ourselves would like  to

alleviate any difficulties which Singapore citizens may

face  when they cross over the Causeway, and I have  no

doubt  that when the Minister for Foreign Affairs  duly

receives   an   Official  Note   from   the   Malaysian

Government, he will take steps to ask for clarification

on  what  checks will be required of Singapore citizens

and how such checks and restrictions can be alleviated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  the  recommendation   of   Mr

President to introduce the Timber Export Industry Board

(Incorporation)  Bill.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg  to

introduce  a  Bill intituled, "An Act to establish  the

Timber  Export  Industry  Board  for  the  purpose   of

regulating and improving the timber export industry and

to provide for matters connected therewith."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.

<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, I lay upon

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, Sir. The typed copies are with

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to set up a statutory board to control

and  improve the timber export industry. Sawmilling  is

one  of  the oldest industries established in Singapore

and  at  present  provides employment  for  some  2,500

persons  engaged in a total of 78 sawmills. Apart  from

direct employment in the sawmills, the export of timber

provides  a  livelihood for many other persons  in  the

timber  export  trade, transport industry  and  at  the

docks.  In  1964,  export of timber amounted  to  $44.3

million  and  was the fifth largest single export.  For

1965,  exports increased to $48.7 million and  advanced

from the fifth to the fourth position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the progress shown, the timber export industry

is  not  without  its  many difficulties.  One  of  its

problems  is that of part-time exporters and mala  fide

traders who indulge in unscrupulous practices and whose

only interest is in quick profits without any regard to

the  prestige and long-term interests of the  Singapore

timber industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also complaints from overseas importers

arising  from non-fulfilment of contracts due  to  time

lapse, delay in shipment, disputes regarding quality of

timber  supplied  and  disruption of  overseas  markets

caused by unrealistic quotations by part-time exporters

without any regard for local costs of production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timber industry associations and the Government

authorities in both Singapore and the States of  Malaya

recognised  these common problems and a  Working  Party

formed  to  consider  the matter  has  recommended  the

establishment  of a Pan-Malayan Timber Export  Industry

Board under parallel legislation in both territories to

control and promote our timber export industry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore and the States of Malaya sell timber to

the  same  markets and a good part of the log  supplies

for our sawmills come from the States of Malaya, it  is

clear that close co-operation between Singapore and the

States of Malaya is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Timber Export Industry Board which this Bill seeks

to  set  up is based on similar principles adopted  for

the  Malayan  Rubber Export Registration Board  set  up

under   the   Rubber  Shipping  and   Packing   Control

Ordinance, and the Malayan Pineapple Industry Board set

up   under   the  Pineapple  Industry  Ordinance.   The

essential features of these Boards are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) they are set up under parallel legislation in

Singapore and in the States of Malaya;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) each Board has a chairman who is jointly

appointed   by   both   territories,   and   with

representatives  of  both  Governments  and   the

trade associations concerned as members; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) they have powers to regulate the trade concerned

and  to  impose  fees or cesses to provide  funds

for expenses of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Boards are not only good examples of economic co-operation between the two Governments but also of

common  effort and understanding between the Government

and the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from provisions for the setting up of the Board

and  rules  for  conduct  of  its  meetings,  the  Bill

provides for the regulation of export of timber by  the

following    two    types   of   export    registration

certificates:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An ordinary export registration certificate to be

issued  to a person who has exported not less  than 1,500  cubic  tons of timber during  the  preceding

year  and not less than 3,600 cubic tons of  timber

during  the  three  years  preceding  the  year  of

application; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A temporary export registration certificate to be

issued  to  a  person who has  been  assured  of  a

supply



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



of,  or  of producing not less than, 500 cubic  tons

of   timber.   A   holder  of  a  temporary   export

registration  certificate will  have  to  furnish  a

bank  guarantee for the due performance of  contract

between the holder and the overseas buyer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is given the discretion in clause 16 to

cancel, refuse to issue or renew an export registration

certificate  and persons aggrieved by the  decision  of

the  Board  will be allowed to appeal to a Tribunal  of

Appeal consisting of a Chairman and two members  to  be

appointed  jointly by the President and  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill provides for a levy of cesses on

the  exportation of timber to meet the expenses of  the

Board  which are estimated at $160,000 per  annum.  But

for  the  first year of operation, until the Board  has

collected  sufficient  funds from  cesses,  expenditure

will  be  met from an overdraft of a maximum of $50,000

to   be  jointly  guaranteed  by  the  Governments   of

Singapore and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

present  Bill  is  an example of parallel  legislation.

Representatives  of both Governments of  Singapore  and

Malaysia  considered and agreed on a draft  Bill.  This

Bill is therefore identical in substance to the Malayan

Timber Export Industry Board (Incorporation) Act, 1966,

passed  by  the  Malaysian Parliament in  January  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>CINEMATOGRAPH FILM HIRE DUTY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to Malaysia the Cinematograph Film Hire

Duty  Ordinance,  1959, regulated the business  of  the

hiring  and renting of cinematograph films and provided

for the imposition of film-hire duty on the renting  of

films  and  the  control of charges of admission  to  a

cinema,  theatre or other places, where such films  are

exhibited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1965, when Singapore was still part of

Malaysia,  this Ordinance was repealed by the Malaysian

Cinematograph Film Hire Duty Act, 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Singapore is no longer part of Malaysia but

is  a sovereign nation, it is necessary to re-enact the

provisions  of the former Ordinance, with such  changes

of  phraseology  and terminology as  are  necessary  to

accord with the independent status of the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, opportunity has been taken,

wherever possible, to amend the provisions of  the  old

law, where experience and improvements so require.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, provision is made in sub-clause (7) of

clause 4 to require claims to be made in respect of any

money  overpaid,  short-paid or  erroneously  refunded,

within  the  period of one year after such  payment  or

refund,  instead  of  six months as  is  presently  the

requirement,  as  this  would be administratively  more

satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 15 and 22 contain minor changes of

phraseology    and    procedure   for    administrative

convenience. In particular, paragraph (b) of clause  22

(2)  now provides specific power to make rules for  the

imposition of penalties in case of non-compliance  with

the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 provides for the Cinematograph Film Hire

Duty  Act,  1965,  of Malaysia to  cease  to  apply  to

Singapore as from Singapore Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since introducing this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, it has

been considered unnecessary to provide specifically for

the  exemption  of  locally-made  films  in  the  Bill.

Accordingly, references to locally-made films  will  be

removed by amendments in Committee stage, of which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



notice has been given by me on 16th April, 1966. These

amendments are set out in Notice Paper No. 25, and I

shall move them in Committee in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Air Navigation Ordinance (Cap. 109) is

obsolete  and inadequate for present-day needs  in  the

field  of civil aviation. The Bill repeals the Colonial

Air Navigation Order, 1949, and the Civil Aviation Act,

1949, as well as certain sections of the Air Navigation

Ordinance,  1952, of Malaysia, which were  extended  to

Singapore after Malaysia Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will provide the necessary legislation for

the  control and regulation of air navigation  as  laid

down  at  the  International Civil Aviation  Conference

held in Chicago in 1944. The ninety-six



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



Articles of the Chicago Convention relate to privileges

and restrictions of all Contracting States. The

Convention provides for the adoption of international

standards and recommended practices relating to air

navigation, such as the installation of navigation

facilities and the reduction of customs and immigration

formalities to facilitate air transport. The enactment

of this Ordinance is also a preliminary to our

application for membership of the International Civil

Aviation Organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the formation of Malaysia, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Singapore  Audit Ordinance, 1959, ceased to  apply  and

the  Audit Ordinance, 1957, of Malaysia became  law  in

Singapore. The main purpose of this Bill is to re-enact

the  former  Audit Ordinance, 1959, of  Singapore  with

textual changes and changes of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



terminology taking account of Singapore's status as  an

independent Sovereign Republic and to provide that  the

Audit Ordinance, 1957, of Malaysia shall cease to apply

to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only amendments of some substance are contained

in  clauses  3, 4, 6 and 9. Clauses 3 and 4  have  been

amplified to state more clearly the provisions for  the

appointment,  tenure of officers, and  the  powers  and

duties of the Director of Audit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 makes it clear that the responsibility of

the   Director  of  Audit  is  to  ascertain  that  all

reasonable  steps  have been taken to safeguard  public

money, and to comply with the requirements of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 provides that where statements are submitted

to  the  Director  of Audit, he need  not  examine  and

report  on these forthwith, and that where the Director

of Audit is satisfied that the accounts of a public or

statutory authority show the true state of affairs,  he

need  not  submit a report if he gives  an  unqualified

certificate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clauses, together with the provisions of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill proposes two

significant changes in the law of bankruptcy, and these

proposals are contained in clauses 12 and 24. The other

amendments  and  modifications are  made  necessary  by

recent constitutional changes, and the opportunity  has

also  been  taken to make other long-awaited amendments

to  fill in some gaps in the law relating to bankruptcy

and to put right lapses in drafting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 20 propose to omit the references to

Her  Majesty's dominions in sections 14 and 104 of  the

Bankruptcy  Ordinance.  They  will  also  clarify   the

position  by  providing  for  the  annulment   of   the

adjudication  after  the rescission  of  the  receiving

order  and  by  empowering the  Court  to  rescind  the

receiving order when it annuls the adjudication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 7 propose, by deleting the provisos to

sections  17  (10)  and  31 (6) ,  to  give  the  Deputy

Registrar  of  the High Court the same  powers  as  the

Registrar in the holding of the public examinations  of

debtors and the examinations of other persons known  or

suspected  to  have  in their possession  any  property

belonging to the debtor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now the creditors in a second bankruptcy are

not  entitled  to receive anything out of a  bankrupt's

estate  until  the bankrupt has obtained his  discharge

from  his first bankruptcy. The law in this regard  was

altered  in England in 1913, and in 1959 the Federation

of Malaya adopted the English law as regards the rights

of  the  Official Assignee under different bankruptcies

of the same debtor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 proposes to adopt the modern law in this

regard. It is proposed that, in future, where there are

two  bankruptcies  the undistributed  property  of  the

bankrupt will vest in the Official Assignee on  account

of  the  second bankruptcy and become divisible amongst

the  creditors of the second bankruptcy.  The  Official

Assignee, as trustee of the first bankruptcy, shall  be

deemed  to  be  a creditor of the second bankruptcy  in

respect  of  any  unsatisfied  balance  of  the   debts

provable  in the first bankruptcy. In this  way,  every

creditor of a bankrupt will be able to obtain dividends

from the property of a bankrupt, no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



matter whether he is a creditor of the first or of  the

subsequent  bankruptcies. The proposed  amendment  will

have retrospective effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 proposes to give power to the Official

Assignee  to  make  an  allowance  to  members   of   a

bankrupt's   family   for  their  support   after   the

bankrupt's  death  and  also  to  defray  his   funeral

expenses.  The trustees in bankruptcy in  England  have

had   these  powers  for  many  years  now  under   the

Bankruptcy Rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 16 and 17 are introduced to simplify the

procedure  relating  to  investments  of  excess  funds

standing  to  the  credit  of  the  Bankruptcy  Estates

Account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed in clause 24 to alter the law relating

to  married  women  and to make  them  subject  to  the

Bankruptcy  Ordinance in all respects as if  they  were

single.  At  present,  a  married  woman  may  be  made

bankrupt  only  if  it is shown that she  has  separate

property.  The law was altered in England  by  the  Law

Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act, 1935, which

assimilated to the general law the position of  married

women  in  relation to bankruptcy.  In  the  States  of

Malaya  married  women became subject  to  the  law  of

bankruptcy since 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 makes provision for unclaimed dividends to

be  credited  to the Consolidated Fund if  they  remain

unclaimed for seven years. If any claim is made to  any

part  of the unclaimed dividends so transferred to  the

Consolidated  Fund,  the claimant  shall  be  paid  the

amount   due  to  him,  without  interest,   from   the

Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bankruptcy (Statutory Discharge) Ordinance, 1948,

was  enacted to discharge under certain conditions  the

pre-war bankruptcies. This Ordinance has ceased to have

effect and clause 30 proposes to repeal it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequential amendments contained in clauses 3

(c) , 8 (a) , 9, 10, 11, 13, 18, 19, 25 and 29, are those

made    necessary   by   recent   constitutional    and

administrative changes in Singapore.

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to make the amendments rendered

necessary   by  the  constitutional  changes  affecting

Singapore and its ceasing to be a part of Malaysia. The

opportunity has also been taken to make some amendments

to  the  Ordinance. The definition of "child"  for  the

purpose  of payment of compensation on death  has  been

extended  to include illegitimate and adopted children,

so  that where, for example, both the parents have been

killed in a motor-car accident, damages can be obtained

for the benefit of such children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found that the provisions of the new

sections 12A and 17A sought to be introduced by clauses

5  and 7 of the Bill respectively are, however, already

to be found in our law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision relating to the award of interest on

debts  and damages is to be found in section 8  of  the

Civil  Law  Ordinance,  and  that  relating  to  moneys

payable under a policy of life assurance in section  73

of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Ordinance. So I

shall   be   moving  an  amendment,  Sir,   with   your

permission, to delete these clauses in Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been referred to the Singapore Bar

Committee and has been approved by them.

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government considers that the penalties

provided for offences under the Corrosive and Explosive

Substances and Offensive Weapons Act of Malaysia, which

is  the  law  currently applicable  to  Singapore,  are

inadequate to serve as a positive deterrent to criminal

acts by social delinquents and disloyal elements in the

country.  Sir,  it  is the duty of  the  Government  to

protect the people as a whole from acts of violence  by

a few criminals and disaffected persons. This Bill is a

step  towards  achieving this. Some  of  the  penalties

provided  for  in  the Bill have been  taken  from  the

Corrosive   Substances  Ordinance,  1955,   which   was

applicable to Singapore before Malaysia and  which  has

now  been  repealed. Where the provisions for penalties

contained  in the former Singapore Ordinance have  been

considered  to  be inadequate, enhanced penalties  have

been included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to enhance the penalty for carrying or

being   in   possession  of  corrosive   or   explosive

substances from three years' imprisonment and  whipping

to  ten  years'  imprisonment and caning.  The  present

penalty  for using any corrosive substance or offensive

weapon  for the purpose of causing hurt and for causing

by  corrosive substance an explosion which is likely to

cause  hurt  is a maximum of seven years'  imprisonment

and whipping. Clause 4 amends this to life imprisonment

and caning. In clause 5 is included an amendment to the

penalty provided for carrying or being in possession in

a  public  road or place any offensive weapon otherwise

than with lawful authority from two years' imprisonment

to  three  years'  imprisonment and  caning.  Clause  6

amends  the  punishment  for  manufacturing,  being  in

possession of, carrying or lending weapons  such  as  a

flick  knife,  a gravity knife, a whip,  a  motor-cycle

chain,  a  knuckle  duster and a metal  pipe  from  two

years'  imprisonment  and a fine  of  $2,000  to  three

years'  imprisonment and a fine of $3,000. The  maximum

penalty for a second or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



subsequent  offence of this nature  is  increased  from

three years' to seven years' imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes the formal amendments necessitated by

the  constitutional changes. Sections 306 to 308 of the

Criminal Procedure Code which deal with the reservation

of  points  of  law by the subordinate Courts  for  the

consideration of the High Court and which were  deleted

on  Singapore becoming a part of Malaysia have been re-enacted.  (Clause 43). The opportunity  has  also  been

taken to make a few amendments of substance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some doubt as to the extent of the

jurisdiction of the Criminal District Court as set  out

in  sections  8 and 10 of the Criminal Procedure  Code.

Section  8 gives the Criminal District Court  power  to

hear offences other than those punishable with death or

imprisonment for life, if the Public Prosecutor applies

to  such  Court  to try such offence  and  the  accused

consents.  Unfortunately this  power,  which  has  been

found very useful, appears to be cut down by section 10

which prevents a District Court from trying any offence

punishable with imprisonment for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



term exceeding seven years. It is proposed to make  the

provision  clear by making the provisions of section  8

prevail  over those of section 10 of the Code.  (Clause

5).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code imposes a

restriction on the powers of the High Court  to  impose

sentences  where  the accused is charged  with  several

offences.  This has been found undesirable in  practice

and  it is proposed to remove this restriction. (Clause

6).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 121 imposes a restriction on the admission of

statements  by  accused  persons  and  at  present  the

conditions  have  to  be strictly  complied  with.  The

position in England is that the Judges' Rules  are  not

construed   restrictively  but  the   Courts   have   a

discretion to admit a statement even if the  Rules  are

not  formally and strictly observed, provided the Court

is  satisfied that the statement is a voluntary one. It

is  proposed to give this discretion to the  Courts  in

Singapore under clause 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference to preliminary inquiries in the case of

trials by a Judge without a jury is removed, as it  has

been held by the Federal Court that it is not necessary

to  have preliminary inquiries in such cases. Fung  Yin

Ching v. P.P. (1965) 1 M.L.J. 49 (Clause 26).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restriction on the number of names of jurors to

be drawn by the Registrar is removed. Where there is  a

large number of accused persons, as in the Pulau Senang

case,  it  is necessary to summon more than 16  special

jurors or 30 common jurors. (Clause 34).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made for the admissibility of reports by

medical,  scientific and other experts,  without  their

being  called  to  give evidence,  unless  the  accused

requires  them  to  be called. This  will  prevent  the

present  great wastage of the time of medical  officers

in the courts, under clause 54.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been referred to the Singapore Bar

Committee, the District Judge and First Magistrate  and

the Commissioner of Police, and is supported by all  of

them.

<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to spend some time

reviewing  the  work of the Economic Development  Board

since  its inception to the end of 1965. Largely  as  a

result  of the Board's efforts, a total of 151  pioneer

certificates have been issued to 144 firms.  Of  these,

95  pioneer firms have gone into production and another

19   have  their  factories  under  various  stages  of

construction.  The proposed subscribed capital  of  all

the  144  pioneer firms adds up to $266  million,  more

than half of which has been paid up. At full production

these pioneer firms are estimated to produce some  $869

million  worth  of goods per year and  contribute  some

$237 million worth to our national income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual output of the 95 pioneer firms in

production had already reached $318 million in 1965 and

these  firms  contributed $79 million to  our  national

income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the end of 1965, the pioneer firms in

production  employed 10,500 workers.  It  is  estimated

that  when these firms reach full production, they will

employ 21,650 workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board also subscribed to the

capital of industries and made loans to industries. The

total   amount   committed  to  12  firms   in   equity

participation is $122,175,000, of which more than  half

has been disbursed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



The Board approved loans to 37 firms amounting

to   $58,937,000,   of  which  $36,673,000   has   been

disbursed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at December 1965, the Board has acquired, or

committed   to  acquire,  6,618  acres  of   land   for

industrial  development. Of these 6,122  acres  are  in

Jurong  and  the  rest  distributed  in  eight  smaller

industrial estates in various parts of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Jurong Industrial Estate, a total of 964 flats

were  allocated by December 1965, and a primary school,

a  post  office,  two  commercial  banks,  two  private

clinics,  five provision shops and a community  centre,

were opened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major projects which have been completed more

recently,  include the first deep-water  berth  at  the

Jurong  wharves  and  the railway  linking  the  Jurong

Industrial Estate to Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board also established the

necessary  machinery to help producers  overcome  their

production   and   sales  difficulties.   Through   the

Industrial  Research  Unit, Light Industries  Services,

the  Product and Design Centre, the Board has developed

a very cordial relationship with industrialists who now

look to the Board as a trusted consultant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have only mentioned some of the more tangible

results  of  the  efforts of the  Economic  Development

Board,  but  this is sufficient to show that  much  has

been  done.  More remains to be done and can  be  done.

Experience  has shown that the scope of  activities  of

the  Economic Development Board is very much restricted

by  the  existing Economic Development Board Ordinance,

No.  21  of 1961. For instance, there have been various

enquiries received by the Board as to whether the Board

could participate in the promotion or encouragement  of

tourist  enterprises,  such as participation  in  hotel

building projects, and other tourist attractions. There

have  also been enquiries as to whether the Board would

participate  in transportation projects,  such  as  the

provision  of  shipping facilities for both  cargo  and

passengers. These and many other activities  cannot  be

performed  by  the  Board under the present  Ordinance.

This set-back



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



has,  therefore,  to  be  remedied  by  suitable

amendments to the existing Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2 of the Economic Development Board

(Amendment)  Bill  is designed to  remedy  the  present

situation  by  re-defining "industrial enterprises"  to

give  the  Board powers to participate, inter alia,  in

tourist  ventures, aircraft repairs, the working  of  a

mine  or  quarry,  off-shore fisheries,  transportation

ventures, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken, Sir, to incorporate other

provisions which would improve the functioning  of  the

Board. The Deputy Chairman when he acts in the capacity

of  Acting  Chairman is given all  the  powers  of  the

Chairman. Persons holding $10,000, or one-tenth of  the

nominal  value of the issued share capital of companies

which  have  contracts  with the  Economic  Development

Board,  are  made ineligible to become Board  officers.

Provision  is  also  made for the  establishment  of  a

pension  or  provident  funds  scheme.  The  Board   is

empowered to appoint committees and delegate powers  to

such  committees. The Board is given  wider  powers  to

raise  loans,  overdrafts and obtain credit  facilities

from  suppliers so that it need not depend entirely  on

Government  for loan funds. The Board is  empowered  to

provide and maintain bungalows and scholarships to  the

Board's  staff, compensation for the Board's staff  who

are  injured  on  official duty and other  arrangements

which  are extended by other statutory bodies to  their

employees.  Finally, Sir, the Board  is  exempted  from

attestation  formalities which are  stipulated  in  the

Registry of Deeds and the Lands Titles Ordinances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I would say that the Economic

Development Board (Amendment) Bill has been drafted  on

the experience of past performance and with the view to

meeting the challenge ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the formation of Malaysia, the Singapore Financial

Procedure   Ordinance,  1959,  ceased  to   apply   and

Financial Procedure Ordinance, 1957, of Malaysia became

operative in Singapore. The main purpose of the Bill is

to  seek  to  re-enact the provisions of the  Financial

Procedure  Ordinance, 1959, of Singapore  with  textual

changes  and changes of terminology taking  account  of

Singapore's status as an independent Sovereign Republic

and  to provide that the Financial Procedure Ordinance,

1957, of Malaysia shall cease to apply to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to include

amendments  considered  desirable  in  the   light   of

experience gained since 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important variation from the Financial

Procedure  Ordinance,  1959,  of  Singapore  is  a  new

provision  in section 7 (3) (d) enabling the Government

to  invest  moneys in the securities of, or  guaranteed

by,   any   government   or   international   financial

institutions such as the World Bank, the International



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



Monetary  Fund, the  International  Bank  for

Reconstruction   and   Development,   etc.   Previously

investments  were limited to the Sterling  bloc  unless

authority was obtained by resolution of the Legislative

Assembly (Parliament). The flexibility to invest  in  a

wider  range of securities would enable the  Government

to  take  advantage  of  fields  of  investments  where

returns are higher as well as maintain reserves in hard

currency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the transitional provisions under section 26,

authority is sought to validate the sums of $42,522,019

and  $650,000 which were approved by resolution of  the

Legislative  Assembly in 1959 and 1960 by deeming  them

to have been approved by resolution of Parliament under

section 9 of this Act. The earlier approvals were valid

under  Singapore's Financial Procedure Ordinance, 1959,

but   were  not  covered  by  the  Financial  Procedure

Ordinance,  1957, of Malaysia and the intention  is  to

regularise  the  position so as to put  it  beyond  any

doubt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 (5) and section 13 (2) of the Singapore

Financial  Procedure  Ordinance,  1959,  provided   for

warrants issued in any financial year to lapse  at  the

close   of  that  year.  This  results  in  unnecessary

administrative inconvenience and it is felt that  there

is  no special reason why a warrant issued should lapse

at  the end of the financial year. These sections  have

therefore  been  deleted. Adequate safeguards  will  be

made in the Financial Regulations to prevent abuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision for the powers to surcharge an officer for

failure  or  negligence in carrying out  his  financial

responsibilities to be brought within  the  purview  of

the  appropriate  Service Commission  when  a  case  is

referred  by  the  Minister  is  also  provided   under

sections  20 to 23, as disciplinary control  of  public

officers is involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less important amendments include section 7 (4) which

provides for interest from investments under the  terms

of  any  Trust to be paid to the credit of  such  Trust

Account or as the Minister may otherwise direct.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to replace the existing

Fisheries  Ordinance which was enacted as far  back  as

1909, more than half a century ago. With the passage of

time, the Fisheries Ordinance has become antiquated and

is no longer adequate to deal with present-day problems

of  fishermen or to serve the purpose of developing  an

up-to-date and modern fishing industry in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fisheries Bill will rectify many shortcomings in

the   Fisheries   Ordinance.  Whereas   the   Fisheries

Ordinance  provides mainly for the control of  in-shore

fisheries,   the  Fisheries  Bill  provides   for   the

regulation  and  control  of  off-shore  and   deep-sea

fisheries.  It is the Government's aim to promote  off-shore and deep-sea fisheries in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also provide, inter alia, for the

distribution  of  fish, the use  of  certain  areas  as

fishing  ports  or harbours, the methods of  processing

fish,   the  manning  of  fishing  vessels,   and   the

conditions of employment of fishing crew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that the Bill is comprehensive and

has  provisions covering all important aspects relating

to the fishing industry which are necessary to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



put  it  on  a modern footing. To carry out effectively

the  provisions  of  this Bill  and  to  encourage  the

development of the fishing industry in Singapore, a new

fishing  port and a central wholesale fish  market  are

being  constructed at Jurong. Both the port and  market

are  expected  to be in operation by the  end  of  this

year.  At  the  same  time, the Ministry  of  Law  and

National  Development will set up a Fisheries  Training

Centre to train fishermen in modern methods of fishing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to introduce into Singapore the

provisions   of   the   English   Inheritance   (Family

Provision)  Act,  1938. As this Bill  will  change  the

existing  law and will affect the right of a person  to

will  away his property as he likes, it is proposed  to

refer   it   to  a  Select  Committee,  so  that   full

consideration can be given to its provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former English law did provide for family

provision in giving the wife a right to dower by virtue

of  which, if the wife survived her husband, she became

entitled  to an estate for life in a third of  all  her

husband's freeholds of which he had been seised at  any

time  during  the marriage. As this right of  the  wife

attached even though the husband



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



alienated the land, it gave rise to a great  deal

of practical inconvenience and was eventually abolished

by the Dower Act of 1833. After that, there was nothing

to  stop a man (or a woman with respect to her separate

property)  from  devising  and  bequeathing  his  whole

estate to charity or to a complete stranger and leaving

his  widow  and children penniless. It was  to  prevent

this   evil  that  in  1938  the  Inheritance   (Family

Provision) Act was enacted. That Act did not cast  upon

the  testator  any  positive duty  to  make  reasonable

provision   for  his  dependants,  for  it   would   be

impossible  to  enforce  any such  obligation,  but  it

provided that if he fails to do so, the Court may order

such  reasonable provision as it thinks fit to be  made

of the estate to his dependants, as defined in the Act.

The  Act  was further amended in 1952 to extend  it  to

cases of intestacy, as it was felt that the general law

of  intestacy might leave a child inadequately provided

for. The provisions relating to family provision appear

to  have  worked well in England and it is proposed  to

introduce them into Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim law contains provisions to safeguard the

position  of widows and children in cases of  intestacy

and  there is already existing provision in section  41

of  the Muslims Ordinance, 1957, to enable the Court to

vary  the  will of a Muslim testator to make  provision

for  his heirs. It is therefore not proposed to  extend

the legislation to Muslims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been considered by the Singapore Bar

Committee and has been agreed to by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Limitation Ordinance,

1959,  to  reduce the period of limitation for  damages

for  personal  injuries from six years to three  years.

This will bring the law in line with the law in England

where the period of limitation was fixed at three years

by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions) Act, 1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the amendment will be that in general

actions  for  personal injuries, arising, for  example,

from  motor-car  accidents, may only be brought  within

three years of the accident. It is desirable that  such

actions  should be heard as soon as possible after  the

accident,  as, if the action is instituted, say,  after

four or five years, it would be difficult for witnesses

to  testify  about  the accident  with  any  degree  of

accuracy.   The   Act   will  therefore   prevent   the

institution  of stale proceedings. Police investigation

papers  are  normally destroyed by the  Police  two  or

three  years  after  an accident  and  if  actions  are

brought after that, police witnesses will be unable  to

refresh their memories from statements or plans made by

them soon after the accident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is felt that the reduction of the limitation

period to three years would cause no hardship to  third

parties.  Injuries  caused by motor accidents  normally

become  obvious immediately after the accident and  the

wide   publicity  given  to  proceedings  relating   to

accidents  in  the local Press and the availability  of

lawyers  make it possible for any third party  to  take

advice and action within a reasonably short time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been referred to the Singapore Bar

Committee and they support its provisions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prevention of Corruption Ordinance, 1960, certain

amendments  to  which  have  become  necessary,  itself

replaced the 1937 Ordinance with the same title and the

Evidence  (Special  Provisions)  Ordinance  enacted  in

1946. The Bill seeks, first, to make certain changes in

terminology  in keeping with Singapore's  status  as  a

sovereign   Republic  with  her   own   President   and

Parliament. These are effected by clauses 2,  3,  6,  7

and 8 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 4 of the

Ordinance in order to bring the Director and all  other

officers of the Corrupt Practices Investigation  Bureau

within  the  meaning of "public servant" as defined  in

the Penal Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 offers a more succinct phrasing of the

present  section  5 of the Ordinance,  while  clause  9

seeks  to  do  the  same  for section  12  (b)  of  the

Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 extends to the Director and any Assistant

Director of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau

the powers of arrest and investigation, conferred by

the existing section 15 only upon the Bureau's senior

special investigators and special investigators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill will enable officers of the

Bureau to exercise all or any of the special powers in

relation to police investigations into seizable

offences, if any seizable offence under any written law

should be disclosed in the course of an investigation

under the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance. By such

amendment of section 16 of the Ordinance, sections 16A

and 16B will become redundant and it is proposed in

clause 12 to repeal them.



The purpose of clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill is to

define more specifically in section 17 of the Ordinance

the extent of the special powers of investigation which

the Public Prosecutor may confer on the Director, or an

Assistant Director of the Corrupt Practices

Investigation Bureau, or any police officer of or above

the rank of Assistant Superintendent for the more

effective investigation of corrupt practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 15 to 18 extend to the Director and any

Assistant Director certain powers of investigation,

search, etc., provided under sections 18, 20, 24 and 25

of the Ordinance for special investigators of the

Bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 seeks to amend section 26 of the Ordinance in

order to provide that the abettor of an offence of

corruption shall on conviction be liable to be punished

with the punishment provided for the offence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By clause 20 will be enacted two new sections which

will make attempts to commit, or conspiracy to commit,

any offence under the Ordinance punishable as for the

offence itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 introduces a new section under which a

citizen of Singapore committing an offence under the

Ordinance outside Singapore will be dealt with in

respect of such offence as if he had committed it in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  are  doubtless aware that  the  present

Edition  of  the  Laws of Singapore was published  more

than  ten  years ago, and that during this period  far-reaching  constitutional  changes  have  taken   place,

ending  with the separation of Singapore from  Malaysia

in August last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even had this last event not occurred with the

attendant modifications in the law occasioned  thereby,

it would have been nonetheless necessary to bring out a

Revised  Edition of the Laws as soon as  possible.  But

this factor, taken in conjunction with the fact that we

have  had  numerous amending Ordinances since the  last

Edition  of the Laws was published a decade  ago  which

need  to  be  fused  into  their  respective  principal

Ordinances, makes the preparation and publication of  a

Revised Edition of the Laws a matter of some urgency if

we  are  to  have a handy manual of laws  consolidated,

modified,  amended,  and brought up  to  date  so  that

"looking up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



the  law"  is not the frustrating, tiresome  and  often

difficult process that it now is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the earliest days when Singapore was part of

the   Straits   Settlements,  there   have   been   six

consolidations  or  revisions  of  the  laws  affecting

Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) First was published a revision in two volumes of

the  Acts and Ordinances of the Legislative Council

of  the  Straits Settlements from 1st April,  1867,

to 1st June, 1886.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The second revision embraced the Acts and

Ordinances  of  the  Legislative  Council  of   the

Straits  Settlements from 1st April, 1867,  to  7th

March, 1898.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Next was the Revision of 1920; this Revision

which  was  prepared under the Law Revision  Ordinance,

1910,   was   published  in  1920  and  contained   the

Ordinances amended up to 31st December, 1919.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The succeeding Edition of the Laws of the Straits

Settlements  was  published in 1926 and  contained  the

laws in force on 31st December, 1925.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The 1936 Edition which followed was prepared under

the  authority of the Revised Edition of  the  Laws

Ordinance,   1935,  and  contained  the  Ordinances

amended to 31st December, 1935.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Finally, we have the present 1955 Edition of the

Laws  in eight volumes with Annual Supplements for  the

years 1956 to 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, then, was the position with regard to

legislation  in  Singapore immediately before  Malaysia

Day,  at  which time the law could be ascertained  with

the   exercise   of   reasonable  diligence.   However,

consequent  partly  on  the multitudinous  Modification

Orders issued principally in Kuala Lumpur during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



the  period Singapore was part of Malaysia, and  partly

because  of the various amending Ordinances  that  have

been enacted in Singapore over the last ten years,  our

laws  are not as readily ascertainable as we would like

them  to  be,  and  it is therefore my  hope  that  the

Attorney-General's  Chambers and the  Ministry  of  Law

will make it possible to render the perusal of any part

of our Statute Book a painless one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will recall that section 13 of the Republic

of  Singapore  Independence Act, 1965, provides,  inter

alia, that the President may, by order made at any time

during  the period of three years after the  Act  comes

into force, make such modifications in any written  law

as  appear to be necessary or expedient as a result  of

the  passing  of  the  Act and of the  independence  of

Singapore  upon separation from Malaysia.  Pursuant  to

this  provision, modification orders, prepared  by  the

Attorney-General, have been published. With a  view  to

facilitating a reading of the laws modified during  the

Malaysian period and also in consequence of orders made

under the Republic of Singapore Independence Act, 1965,

it  is  proposed to publish reprints of laws, embodying

all  amendments  and modifications whatsoever  made  to

them  during  the last ten years, and several  reprints

have  already  been published. The Interpretation  Act,

1965,  at  section 38 provides the necessary  authority

for  the issue of reprints of our laws, and these  will

form  part of the next Revised Edition of the  Laws  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the contents of the Revised Edition of

the  Laws  Bill,  it will be seen that it  follows  the

general  design  of  the Revised Edition  of  the  Laws

Ordinance   at  Chapter  1  of  our  present   Edition.

Provision is made in the Bill for the appointment of  a

Law Revision Commission. The purpose of this Commission

must  not  be  misunderstood; its function  is  not  to

revise  legislation in the sense of improving  it  with

the   object  of  effecting  any  changes   which   the

Commission,   or   the  public  making  representations

through the Commission, might consider desirable;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



nor  is  it the function of the Commission to introduce

legislative  measures  or  concepts  of  advantage   to

Singapore.  Rather, its purpose is solely  to  issue  a

revised   edition  of  all  principal  and   subsidiary

legislation,   faithfully   incorporating    all    the

amendments  and modifications that have been  made  and

published   to   date,  either  by  way  of   statutory

enactments or Modification Orders. The President is  to

appoint the Law Revision Commission comprising, as  Law

Commissioners,  the  Attorney-General  and  such  other

person  as may be appointed by the President to prepare

and  publish  a Revised Edition of Acts and  a  Revised

Edition  of  Subsidiary Legislation.  The  Commission's

work  is  purely  technical and is clearly  defined  at

clause  4 of the Bill. What the Commission is empowered

to   do   in  the  process  of  revision  is  carefully

circumscribed; the Commission is charged with the  task

of  making the law, as it stands, readable, but it  has

no  authority  to  indulge  in  the  luxury  of  making

innovations to the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal feature of the Bill and the manner in

which it departs from previous enactments of this  kind

is  that  the Revised Edition of Acts and of Subsidiary

Legislation  may  be  prepared and  published,  at  the

Commissioners'  discretion, volume by  volume,  in  any

sequence  and at such times as they may deem expedient.

Instead,  therefore, of the usual tedious  interval  of

several years before the Revised Edition as a whole  is

published,  volumes will appear one  after  another  as

rapidly as possible, each volume coming into force from

such date as the President may determine. While, in the

case  of  the previous Edition, it took four years  for

the  preparation and publication of the  whole  Revised

Edition, it is hoped to print the first volume  of  the

new Edition shortly and to make available the remaining

volumes,  one by one, to the Bench, the Bar, Government

officers, the public and all those who need to refer to

our laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that upon the completion of any

volume  of the Revised Edition of Acts or of Subsidiary

Legislation,  the Commissioners shall transmit  a  copy

thereof  to  the  President who may specify,  by  order

published  in  the  Gazette,  the  date  on  which  the

completed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



volume  shall come into force, and from that  date  the

laws  in question will become part of the Statute  Book

of Singapore. It is provided that after the publication

of   that  order,  the  volume  in  question  shall  be

published and presented to Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Revised Edition of the Laws

Bill,  when enacted, will be the instrument which  will

render   possible  the  consolidation,  collation   and

codification of the laws of Singapore so that  the  law

on  any  particular subject can be  read  as  a  clear,

connected  and complete entity and so that  good  order

and  certitude  will be brought into our Statute  Books

where  chaos  once existed, and legislative  untidiness

transmuted  into coherent neatness. Law without  tears,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, is what this Bill in brief  aims  to

achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to subsection (1) of

section  4  of  the Nature Reserves Ordinance  (Chapter

235), resolves that paragraph 5 of the Schedule to  the

said Ordinance be deleted and the following substituted

therefor:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All that piece of land situate in Mukim No. V,

Pandan  in  the  Island of Singapore, known  as  Pandan

Forest  Reserve, comprised in Lot 136-15, Mukim No.  V,

Pandan,  and estimated to contain an area of 356a.  0r.

00p.,  the  boundary  of  which  is  more  particularly

delineated and edged pink on Certified Plan  No.  12924

filed in the Office of the Chief Surveyor, Singapore.".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the development of the Jurong Industrial Complex,

it  has been necessary to utilise the land on the  west

bank  of Sungei Jurong south of West Coast Road,  which

forms part of the Pandan Nature Reserve, as set out  in

paragraph  5  of  the Schedule to the  Nature  Reserves

Ordinance (Chapter 235). This land comprising about 186

acres is required for the creation of wharves and other

facilities to provide access to the river and open sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will therefore be necessary to amend paragraph 5

of  the  Schedule to excise this area from  the  Pandan

Nature Reserve. After this excision there will still be

a balance of 356 acres in the Pandan Nature Reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>REGISTRATION FOR THE ISSUE OF NEW IDENTITY CARDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

National Registration Act, 1965, comes into operation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



on  the  5th  May, 1966. We welcome the  issue  of  new

plastic  Identity Cards because it will regularise  the

anomalies. From what the Minister has earlier stated, I

understand  that the new Identity Cards shall  be  used

not only as an Identity Card, but also serve as a Birth

Certificate and Citizenship Certificate. This is really

very convenient to the public. But with only about  two

weeks  to  go, the public are anxious and worried  over

many  things.  They are anticipating many  difficulties

because   not  everyone  has  got  all  the   necessary

documents   to   the  requirement  of   the   Act   and

regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utmost important but confusing problem is the

names  of  the  applicants. Sir, this matter  has  been

raised  by  many hon. Members in this House. There  are

Birth  Certificates without names. And there are  cases

where  the  name in the Birth Certificate differs  from

that on the present Identity Card. Apart from the wrong

names,  there  are very many persons  whose  names  are

wrongly  spelt,  either  in the Birth  Certificates  or

Identity Cards or both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, first I take the case of persons having

unnamed Birth Certificates, or no Birth Certificates at

all.  Quite  a  number of our voters  come  under  this

category.  When  the  new plastic  Identity  Cards  are

issued,  I do not know what the position will be  of  a

person  whose  name  appears in the  present  Electoral

Register but who does not possess any Birth Certificate

or   Citizenship  Certificate,  but  only  a  Singapore

Identity  Card.  Such persons have  voted  in  so  many

elections  in the past. Therefore, the fact  that  they

have  voted  in  so  many  elections  in  the  past  as

Singapore  citizens and are in possession of  Singapore

Identity  Cards issued in the earlier years  should  be

sufficient  proof  to enable them  to  obtain  the  new

plastic Identity Card for citizens. Many members of the

public  are  anxious  to  get  the  assurance  of   the

Government on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, persons whose names are

wrongly  spelt in their Birth Certificate  or  Identity

Card or both. I quote a typical example.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote here an Indian name. AMMANI AMMAL when

pronounced  sounds like EMILY AMMAL or HOW MANY  AMMAL.

When the informant who goes to register the birth is an

illiterate,  and the officer who registers  is  a  non-Tamil, AMMANI will sound like EMILY or HOW MANY, and  I

would  not be surprised if he writes the name as  EMILY

or  HOW  MANY. So, Sir, numerous examples can be quoted

for  such cases. And again, a person may have his  name

wrongly  spelt in the documents he has, as in the  case

quoted by me just now, or a person may wish to have his

name  spelt in a slightly different way, or he may even

wish  to  have the name abbreviated. You  can  take  my

name, for instance. My full name is VISVALINGAM son  of

SUPPIAH. I spell it V-I-S-V-A-L-I-NG-A-M. But there may

be  people who like to spell it as VISUVALINGAM with an

addition of the letter 'U'. Or I may like to shorten it

to  S. V. LINGAM. So, Sir, such changes and corrections

in   spelling  should  be  allowed  during   this   re-registration.  And  to do this, I  think  the  Minister

should issue directives that when an applicant requests

for such reasonable changes or corrections in the name,

and  if the Registration Officer is satisfied that  the

applicant's  name  has  been  wrongly  spelt   in   the

documents  produced,  the  Registration  Officer  shall

issue the new plastic Identity Card with the name spelt

as  desired by the applicant. In case of any doubt, the

Registration  Officer can always refer  the  matter  to

Headquarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the difficulties in wrong names and wrong

spellings  could  be  overcome to some  extent  if  the

Minister will staff the different Registration Centres,

as  far  as possible, with persons who know the various

official languages, i.e. Malay, Chinese, and Tamil. For

example, more Chinese-speaking officers to be  sent  to

the  Chinatown  area, Malay-speaking  officers  to  the

Geylang  area, Tamil-speaking officers to the Serangoon

area,  etc. This will be easier to the public and  will

speed up the re-registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one more point. I know the particulars of the

applicant in the card to be issued will be in  English.

Will the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



Minister consider writing the names of Malays,  Chinese

and  Tamils in their respective languages also, so that

even if a mistake is made in the English spelling,  the

name written in the other languages will be a guide?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of difficulty about adopted children

also.  It is common in Singapore for Indians or  Malays

to  adopt  Chinese  children or vice  versa.  When  the

parents  have  legal  adoption  papers,  there  is   no

difficulty.  But, Sir, not all the adopted parents  are

so   wise   and   legal-minded  as   to   foresee   the

difficulties. So there are many people who do not  have

any  sort of documents to prove their adoption. In such

cases,  the  new Identity Cards should be issued  under

the adopted names and races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there should be cross-reference

between  the new and old Identity Cards. When  the  new

Identity  Cards are issued, I do not know  whether  the

number  and the date of issue of the old, that  is  the

present  Identity  Card, will  be  quoted  in  the  new

Identity  Card.  If  provision  is  not  made  for  the

inclusion  of the number and date of issue of  the  old

Identity  Card in the new Identity Card, there  may  be

difficulties to prove the length of residence.  Sir,  I

do  not wish to elaborate on this but hope the Minister

will consider this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the applicant has to give the Registration

Officer  certain  particulars  regarding  himself.  And

among  them  are his race and language. In my  opinion,

these two should have relationship. For example, in  my

case, my language is Tamil; and naturally it follows my

race is also Tamil, rather than Indian which may not be

altogether wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, is the change of address and

occupation. When a person changes his address, I  think

he  will  be  given  a separate card  showing  the  new

address.  What  happens  when  a  person  changes   his

occupation? Will he be issued with an additional  card,

or will it be necessary for him to replace his Identity

Card, which would mean he has to pay a fee of $5? Can I

have the Minister's clarification on this?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing, I would like to speak on reporting the

loss   of   an  Identity  Card  and  applying   for   a

replacement.  Sir,  section  10  (1)  of  the  National

Registration  Act,  1965, says  that  a  person  should

report  to  the nearest Registration Office  about  the

loss  and  apply for a replacement. It was the practice

to  report the loss of an Identity Card to the  nearest

police  station. But since 1962, I understand, that  is

not so. The person has to go all the way from whichever

corner  he may live to Headquarters to make the  report

of loss and then again to collect the replacement. This

puts the public to a lot of inconvenience. When the Act

comes  into  force, I do not know whether  Registration

Offices would be set up at various places. If not so, I

would request the Minister to consider using the police

stations for this purpose, so that the public  may  not

go to Headquarters more than once. What I mean is, when

an Identity Card is lost, the holder reports the matter

to  the  nearest  police station, and  also  gives  his

application  for  a  replacement  there.   Later   when

everything is ready, Headquarters informs the applicant

and  he  goes  and  collects it from Headquarters.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, this will save a lot of trouble  for  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I understand sections 15 and 16 of the

National     Registration    Regulations,    Subsidiary

Legislation  Supplement No. 25, page  148,  section  15

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'15. Any person who has obtained his identity card or

replacement  thereof  before  attaining  the   age   of

seventeen  years shall re-register within a  period  not

exceeding  five  years  from  the  date  of  his  first

registration.'



<br><br>And section 16 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'16. Any person of the age of seventeen years and

above  who  has  obtained  his  identity  card   or   a

replacement  thereof shall register  within  the  tenth

year from the date of his last preceding registration.'



<br><br>Sir, a person affected by the two sections will have to

register three times. I presume this is re-registration

which  is an obligation under the Act, and will not  be

treated  as a replacement for the collection  of  fees,

which  according  to  the schedule  is  $5.  Could  the

Minister kindly give his assurance on this?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the difficulties faced by the public

in   this   re-registration,  the   officers   of   the

Registration   Centres   will   also   have    numerous

difficulties. They will be facing all sorts of  people.

But  whatever their difficulties may be,  I  hope  they

will be patient in dealing with people, especially  the

uneducated, and treat them with courtesy. I  urge  them

not  to  lose  their  patience when  dealing  with  the

public.  I am sure thus they will get full co-operation

from our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Singaporeans would be much grateful to

the Minister and Government if wider publicity is given

over  the  Radio, Television, and the Press  about  the

procedure  of re-registration. They should be  informed

clearly  and in detail as to the documents they  should

bring,  such as Birth Certificates, old Identity Cards,

Statutory  Declarations,  adoption  papers,  passports,

etc.  It  would  be better if the non-English  educated

persons  could  have their names and addresses  written

correctly  by  their friends on a piece  of  paper  and

produce it to the Registration Officers so that the re-registration work could proceed smoothly.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If no other Member wishes to speak on

this particular subject, I will call on the Minister to

reply. Mr Jek.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, in my speech on the Second Reading of the

National  Registration Bill on 22nd December,  1965,  I

explained  how  the re-registration of  the  population

will  be  carried out. I also made a statement in  this

House   on  30th  December,  1965,  on  Unnamed   Birth

Certificates to allay anxiety over a provision  in  the

National   Registration  Act.  In  that  statement,   I

announced  Government's policy in regard to documentary

evidence  required  to establish Singapore  citizenship

status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then a lot of publicity has been given in the

Press, over the radio and on television on the national

registration exercise. Recently a talk has been given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Commissioner  for National  Registration  over

television  outlining  in  detail  the  procedures  for

registration,  the documents that are  required  to  be

produced at the time of registration. Further, meetings

have been held with principals of schools to brief them

on  this  exercise. Before the commencement of the  re-registration exercise on 5th May, 1966, more  publicity

will  be given. I propose to convene a meeting  of  all

the  Citizens'  Consultative Committees  to  call  upon

their help in the re-registration work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my previous speech on this subject I have stated

that  the new system of re-registration will give  each

Singapore resident a number which will be used for  all

purposes in the future. The new citizen identity  card,

which  is  pink  in colour, apart from its  own  serial

number,  will  bear the birth register  number  or  the

Singapore citizenship certificate number of the holder.

Therefore, once a person has been issued with a citizen

identity   card,   he  will  have  no   difficulty   in

establishing his citizenship status in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has raised the

question  of  names being wrongly spelt either  in  the

birth certificates or in the present identity cards.  I

wish  to  assure the Member that in the re-registration

exercise,  this matter will be rectified once  and  for

all. Any mistakes in the spelling of the names will  be

given  sympathetic  consideration  and  if  these   are

genuine  errors,  they  will be rectified  in  the  new

identity cards. In the case of an illiterate applicant,

it  is  suggested that his friend should assist him  by

writing out the correct spelling of his name on a  slip

of  paper  which  he should bring at the  time  of  re-registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also raised the question of

persons   who   have  voted  but  could   not   produce

documentary  evidence to prove that they are  Singapore

citizens.  The  House may be aware that  the  Electoral

Roll has been compiled from the records of the existing

identity  cards. Where the persons' place of  birth  is

shown  as  Singapore on such records, their  names  are

automatically put on the Electoral Roll when they  come

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



age.  As Members are aware, in the initial registration

of  the  population  in  1948 for  identity  cards,  no

documentary proof whatsoever was required to show their

place  of birth. In this exercise, however, it  is  the

intention  of Government to rectify once  and  for  all

mistakes   that  have  been  made  in  the  past.   The

Government  is  prepared  to  consider  sympathetically

those  who  claim to be born in Singapore but  with  no

documentary  proof and have voted during the  last  few

elections.  Such  cases  will be  considered  on  their

individual merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the information of the House, a

total  of  over 500 temporary and permanent staff  have

been   recruited  for  the  re-registration   exercise.

Consideration  has been taken of the  multi-racial  and

multi-lingual  structure  of our  population,  and  the

staff  have  been recruited on that basis.  The  points

raised  by  the  hon. Member that more Chinese-speaking

officers should be sent to Chinatown, or Malay-speaking

officers   to   the  Geylang  area,  or  Tamil-speaking

officers to the Serangoon area have all been taken care

of.  However, it is not feasible to write the names  in

Malay  or Chinese or Tamil in addition to the names  in

English  on  the  identity cards.  All  names  will  be

written  in Roman alphabets on the identity  cards.  In

the  case of Chinese, their names in Chinese characters

will be taken down in their application forms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> The Minister has just said that he will

consider  the  writing  of Chinese  characters  in  the

application forms. I do not know whether it will be too

much if I ask him whether he will consider writing  the

names  in  romanised Malay and Tamil in the application

forms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I have already said that the names

will  be  written  in Roman alphabets.  So  it  is  not

necessary  to write the names again in romanised  Malay

or  romanised  Tamil because it will  be  in  the  same

alphabets.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I think the Minister did not understand

what  I  said.  I  understand that the  names  will  be

written  in English on the identity cards. But  as  the

Minister said, for the Chinese, Chinese characters will

appear  in the application forms. That is why  I  asked

him  whether it would be too much if he would  consider

putting  a  Malay  name  in  romanised  Malay  on   the

application form, or Tamil on the application form.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member means written in the

Tamil  language.  Let us get the point  quite  clear  -

written in the Tamil language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Written in the Tamil language.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, now you know what the hon.

Member wants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> That will be considered. I think

that  can be accepted if the hon. Member means to  have

both  the  romanised  names  and  Tamil  names  on  the

application  forms. In the case of Malays, their  names

will  already  be in romanised form.  So  there  is  no

necessity to put down their names again in Jawi on  the

application forms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point. Where a Chinese is adopted by a non-Chinese family and where no adoption papers have been

taken out, consideration will be given to entering  the

adopted name on the identity card.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the hon. Member, the new

identity  card  will  show the number  of  the  present

identity  card and the date of its original  issue.  In

addition,  the race and dialect group of the  applicant

will   be  entered  on  the  identity  card,  such   as

Chinese/Hokkien  or Chinese/Cantonese or  Indian/Tamil,

etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The occupation of the holder will not be shown on the

new identity card, but if he changes his occupation, he

need   only   inform  the  Commissioner  for   National

Registration either in person or by post. Further,  the

new  plastic laminated identity card provides a  pocket

for the insertion of a change of address slip. Where  a

person  changes his address, he will report  either  to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



nearest  police station, post office or a  registration

centre to notify his change of address. He will fill  a

very  simple form and will be given at the same time  a

change of address slip which will be inserted into  the

pocket  provided for in the identity card. There  will,

therefore,  be no necessity for a holder of  a  plastic

laminated  identity card to change his card  completely

when  he changes his residence. There will be no charge

whatsoever for effecting the change of address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration will be given in the future to

establishing   permanent   or  temporary   registration

centres  to deal with identity card matters,  including

reports  of lost cards. In fact, the new Department  of

National  Registration  will have  mobile  registration

teams  which  will visit certain centres all  over  the

island at fixed regular intervals. Details of this will

be announced at a later date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the hon. Member, any person

who is required to re-register under the provisions  of

Regulations  15  and  16  of the National  Registration

Regulations, 1966, will only have to pay a nominal  fee

of  50 cents in the case of a citizen identity card and

one dollar in the case of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



non-citizen identity card. Replacements required  under

Regulations  15  and 16 are treated as  re-registration

and not as replacements for lost or defaced cards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure this House that the re-registration

of  the  population has been so planned that as  little

inconvenience  as  possible is caused  to  the  general

public.  Over the last one month, the staff  have  been

undergoing vigorous training to carry out this exercise

in  an  efficient and courteous manner.  In  return,  I

would ask the public to give their fullest co-operation

by  bringing along the required documentary  proofs  of

their citizenship as well as by answering questions put

to  them  by the interviewing officers. By helping  the

Government  in  this  manner,  they  will  be   helping

themselves. As I have said previously, the new  citizen

plastic laminated identity card will in the future be a

passport   to  social  amenities,  such  as  education,

housing, health and employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.
