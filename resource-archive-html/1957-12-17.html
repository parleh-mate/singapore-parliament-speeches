<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee of

Supply [2nd Allotted Day]:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question (16th December,

1957) proposed to Head 11 in the First Schedule of the

Bill,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allotted for Head 11 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 4 therein."-[Mr

R. Jumabhoy].



<br><br>10.02 a.m.



<div align="center"><b>FIRST SCHEDULE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on

this question of defence services, I think we must take

a  very  realistic  view of the whole  matter.  In  our

London  talks,  we  agreed that  defence  and  external

affairs,  excepting  for trade and cultural  relations,

should  be left to Britain. Therefore, Sir, defence  is

not  within  our  province. We  do  realise  that,  for

purposes   of  internal  security,  we  require   armed

support,  but  to expend a total of $13,926,370,  which

forms  5  per cent of our total revenue, is,  I  think,

unrealistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard that the Government is going to hand

over the Navy to the Federation of Malaya. If it is  to

be  handed over in the near future, I do not see why we

should  expend such a large sum as $5 million  odd  for

its  development.  Perhaps it may  be  said  that  this

expenditure   is  recurrent  but  I  think   that   all

development, anything requiring more money to bring the

Navy up to a greater standard, should be stopped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said during the Second Reading of the

Appropriation Bill that it is not a fighting navy  that

we want but a merchant navy. It is not fighting men who

would be required to protect Singapore, but men of  the

merchant marine, people who would be able to help us in

supplying service to the world and developing  our  own

shipping lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this age, it is ridiculous to develop a navy.

Today the world has developed weapons of war to such  a

high  standard  that  it  is  impossible  for  a  navy,

consisting  of  so many minesweepers  and  probably  no

destroyers, to go against big



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3084</b></font><br><br>



powers.  What  we  depend on for our  safety  would  be

collective security. We will have to depend on friendly

nations,  on being friendly to everybody,  and  on  the

justice of the world to keep this island safe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is expenditure on the army. This

comes  up  to $3 million odd with another $2.8  million

making  it  $5 million odd again. I would say  that  we

require  a regiment or two to assist our police  but  I

would suggest that the money expended in this direction

should  not just be spent in maintaining fighting  men,

but  in  teaching a trade to the youths who are out  of

school  and are unemployed. They should join the  armed

forces,  just as the British army does, and when  these

servicemen come out, they are skilled tradesmen. If the

army  is run on this basis, we will not be wasting  our

army; we will be using the army as a sort of school  to

help  our  young people be useful to society when  they

come out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this matter, I think that voluntary services

should  be  encouraged,  and that  any  money  expended

should  only be a bare minimum to maintain the fighting

forces, the rest being devoted to ways of training  the

young servicemen of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the air force, there is nothing much to talk

about. We have spent a lot of money on it but have only

produced  a  few people holding private licences.  Here

again,  we  should  look forward  not  to  producing  a

fighting  force, but a force of young  people  able  to

help  us  man our own air lines should we require  them

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can take a line from the big nations, Sir,

especially Britain. In time of war, when we  do  really

require armed forces, we usually find that there is  an

insufficiency  of personnel in the regular  forces.  In

such cases, those in the merchant navy can be asked  to

serve the country in transportation, shipping and other

work,  and  those  in the commercial air  lines  to  do

likewise. If we develop our armed forces in this way, I

think it will help Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would probably wonder about the fact

that  we have no airline, merchant navy and so on.  The

point is that we must start somewhere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3085</b></font><br><br>



If  we have the personnel, then it would be possible to

see these things take shape. At least those who want to

start shipping lines or air lines would be able to find

skilled men to operate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that this defence expenditure, which

forms  about 5 per cent of our total revenue, is a  bit

unrealistic.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

want  to lay further stress in addition to what I  said

yesterday. Britain has taken upon itself the defence of

the  Colony. The Hongkong naval base is being abolished

and  Britain  is definitely going to retain  the  naval

base here. Therefore I must stress that our workers  in

that  area  should not fear at all about  unemployment.

What  they  have  to see is that the  climate  will  be

favourable for the base to remain here, that it is  not

removed somewhere else. Well, that is politics;  it  is

left to their votes to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked about the present advancing age of sputniks

and missiles. Singapore is a small place and can in  no

case  defend itself. I will quote three examples. Korea

was attacked or there was trouble there. There was also

trouble  in  Indo-China;  and  Egypt  was  attacked  by

Britain  and France. What happened? The United  Nations

came  to  their  help  and  brought  peace.  Such   big

countries have to depend on other nations to put things

right  if they are attacked. How big is Singapore after

all?  Should  we  then  spend so  much  money  on  such

services?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is needed, I stress again, are internal security

forces  to help the police, and a strong marine  police

with  speed-boats to prevent smuggling  of  contraband.

This  is  very essential but it does not mean  that  we

should spend millions on the capital and other cost  of

a Royal Malayan Navy. I shall come to it later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do need to train pilots, and an auxiliary air

force  may be maintained on a limited scale. The Flying

Club  could  be  helped. But it is very unnecessary  to

keep these at the expense of the taxpayer. Besides,  we

may  be  supporting imperial designs, letting our  boys

become  fodder  for  some imperial  design.  We  should

prevent that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3086</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the expenditure on defence services

represents,  as  the  hon. Member for  Serangoon  says,

about  5  per  cent of the total expenditure  including

that  on development. By almost any standard, I suggest

that  this is a low proportion and is not, as the  hon.

Member says, unrealistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the attitude that in this age of sputniks, we on

a small island like Singapore should drop all plans for

defence,  would appear to be a negative one. There  are

still  conventional  forms of warfare  and  aggression.

True, Sir, Singapore does not maintain defence services

to attack anyone, but we do need these services to have

our  own  local  forces  and build  them  up  for  good

reasons, especially to safeguard internal security,  to

help  the  police in the maintenance of law  and  order

should the necessity arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also submit, Sir, that if Singapore looks

forward  to  merger with the Federation of  Malaya,  it

would reasonably be expected to contribute towards  the

common  defence.  Defence forces  cannot  be  built  up

overnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the Royal Malayan Navy, the Pan-Malayan background of the building up of this force by

Singapore was ably given by Sir William Goode  when  he

was  Chief Secretary in last year's Assembly debate  on

the  1957 Estimates. I would refer the hon. Members for

Telok  Ayer and Serangoon to columns 862 to 866 of  the

Official  Report, Volume 2, No. 12, of  21st  November,

1956.  The  future of the R.M.N., Sir, is  still  under

discussion  with the Federation, and I am sure  Members

will   not   expect  me  to  give  too  much   detailed

information about it, when these negotiations are still

being carried on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members said that external defence is a matter

for  the  British Government. In the case of the  navy,

strategic defence would certainly be a matter  for  the

United Kingdom Government, but we would surely have  to

see  to  our  own inshore defences, to keep our  waters

clear, because Singapore is a port. The navy would have

a  peacetime role also to maintain. The R.M.N. also has

Emergency duties to perform; and one of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3087</b></font><br><br>



the  lighter roles which it has recently played is, for

instance, to convey citizenship registration  teams  to

Christmas  Island.  The R.M.N. has  a  peacetime  role.

Whatever  the  outcome  of the  negotiations  with  the

Federation, we would require to have some ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the armed forces, that is the regular

Battalion  and  the  other  military  forces,  I  think

Members will agree that the expenditure on them is  not

at  all  large,  if  we  take  into  consideration  the

necessity - which  this Assembly has approved - of  raising

an  infantry Battalion and providing also for  a  part-time   battalion  of  the  Singapore  military   forces

supported  by  ancillary units. The  role  which  these

Singapore  military forces can play in  supporting  the

police   in   internal  security  is   certainly   very

important,  and  I  think  any  expenditure   in   that

direction is justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was the Member for Telok Ayer who

mentioned about the army, sea and air cadet corps. With

more than half of the population of Singapore under  21

years of age, it cannot be doubted that money spent  on

these  cadet  corps, which are really a form  of  youth

movement and extra-mural activity in schools, is  money

well  spent. Although the corps are provided for  under

the  head  "Defence", the emphasis is more on corporate

discipline,  comradeship  and  self-reliance  than   on

purely-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Of explanation, Sir



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Hon. the Chief Secretary has not

given way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> - military matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the Malayan Auxiliary Air Force,

the  policy  is to shift the emphasis from  the  flying

side to the fighter control unit, which has a real part

to  play in the defence of Malaya as a whole, it  being

their  job  to  man  radar  reporting  stations  in  an

emergency. We hope that the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3088</b></font><br><br>



section of the M.A.A.F. will one day be part of a  pan-Malayan  air  force.  As Members  perhaps  are  already

aware, the Federation is developing a regular air force

and  we  hope that one day our section of the Singapore

M.A.A.F. will contribute to that air force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other items under Head 11, Defence Services, were not

raised,  and  I presume that these have  met  with  the

approval  of Members. I would say that we wish  nothing

but  peace  to  all but we must have  local  forces  to

safeguard our internal security and support the  police

in  maintaining law and order within our borders which,

by  virtue  of the fact that we are an island,  include

large tracts of sea.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I never said that

we should prevent our youths being trained as cadets on

a  voluntary basis. I was hitting at the expenditure on

the Royal Malayan Navy costing $5,082,000, as appearing

on  page 98 of the Estimates, and the arguments put  by

the  Hon. the  Chief  Secretary are  very,  very  lame

indeed.  To  help in the registration  of  citizens  on

Christmas  Island - how many citizens are there  on  that

island?  Could  lie  not manage by chartering  a  small

boat? Do you want $5 million to spend on that?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please address the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Then, Sir, the argument was, 'Oh, we

have  to  think about our neighbour.' Well, what  about

thinking about our own taxpayers? Have we not to  think

about  those  who  have to foot the bill?  I  know  the

Government is incapable of taking things into  its  own

hands  and  that it is just following a policy  already

laid down by the Colonial Office.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, such a cold day and at such an early time, yet the

debate is already getting heated up!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Malayan Navy was brought into force years

and  years ago, as explained last year, as part of  the

defence  strategy for the whole of Malaya-Singapore  to

put up a navy, the Federation of Malaya an army. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3089</b></font><br><br>



navy has been with us and I am sure it is not suggested

that it should be scrapped.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Scrap it!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Ah, not so simple! That is what

we are trying to do and what we hope to achieve is that

the  navy  could  be transferred to the  Federation  of

Malaya. There have been negotiations between us and the

Federation  as  to  when and how this  navy  should  be

transferred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the attack on the defence services has come

from  the  Liberal-Socialist Party. We have one  Member

who  criticised us violently and said that there should

be  no defence services, whereas we have the leader  of

that  Party saying, 'Let us tackle the subject  in  its

right   perspective.'  He  would  like  to   see   more

regiments; he would like to see an army but not a navy.

But he went to the extern of saying that the 5 per cent

of  the  total  revenue of Singapore  to  be  spent  on

defence  services  is  much too much  and  out  of  all

proportion when we face the facts. But he did urge that

there should be more regiments. At the present time, we

only have one battalion. A second battalion is awaiting

the result of the transfer of the Royal Malayan Navy to

the  Federation. If we are going to have more than  one

battalion,  I would like the hon. Member to  take  note

that the 5 per cent criticised by him may be 7 per cent

in due course!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I think I would like one or

two  points  of clarification. We have an  army  and  a

navy,  to  be built up from the revenues of  Singapore.

How  much control have we got over this navy and  army?

If  I  understand it rightly, they should be under  the

control  of  the  British Commander-in-Chief.  We  have

heard  that the army and the navy have rendered  useful

service, at ceremonies and so on. I am sure we  do  not

deny  the  Chief Minister the opportunity of inspecting

the navy and army - these are more pleasant jobs. But the

real  role  of  the army, as I said, is  assisting  our

police for purposes of internal security, and if  there

is  such a need to do so, would it be under the command

of the Chief Minister or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3090</b></font><br><br>



British  C-in-C? That is what I would like to be  clear

about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On expenditure, I would say that if we have just

sufficient  armed  forces  to  assist  the  police   on

internal  security, we need not spend so much money.  I

would  like  the Chief Minister to understand  that  my

view, as far as the Royal Malayan Navy is concerned, is

to  stop  everything that will incur more  expenditure.

Wait  for the day you hand over the whole thing to  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the navy, as I understand, may be performing

one  or  two duties but we would very much like to  see

one  or  two  of  our ships stationed  within  our  own

territorial waters so that when neighbours  come  along

with  gunboats and pinch our boats, then our navy could

stand  up  with their water-pistols and say, "Here,  we

have a water-pistol against your cannon."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would very much like to see some realistic work

done  if we think about building up an army, air force,

radar network and so on. If we do not expend enough  to

have  a  big fighter force and a big army, then we  may

only  be  able to plot the places where the bombs  will

fall and not be in a position to stop them falling.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this work is very good, very well explained and

so  on, but I think every cent that we put up on  these

defence  services  means a cent  saved  by  the  United

Kingdom.  I  would  like the Government  to  know  that

defence  is still in the hands of Britain. The less  we

spend on it, the more the U.K. will have to spend;  the

more we spend on it, the more the U.K. will be able  to

direct our own army, navy and so-called air force.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a little

knowledge  is  indeed a dangerous  thing.  The  defence

forces  of  Singapore  are  controlled  by  the   local

Government.  It is only for the purpose  of  discipline

that they come under the British Commander-in-Chief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that if we have local defence

forces  of that nature, the Chief Minister can  have  a

pleasant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3091</b></font><br><br>



job  inspecting them. I consider that it is not only  a

pleasant job but a proud moment of my life when  I  can

inspect local people answering the call and standing up

saying,  "This  is our country. We are here  to  defend

it!" Those would be the proudest moments of my life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member says that defence is still in the hands of

the  United Kingdom Government. It is external  defence

and  not  internal security. It has been  explained  to

hon.   Members  that  our  local  defence  forces   are

primarily for internal security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I am sure the hon. Member is not

suggesting  that  we  should be content  with  our  new

Constitution   and  rest  content   with   just   self-government. How are we going to demand independence  if

we do not start building defence forces of our own? How

are  we  going to seek a merger with the Federation  of

Malaya  when the Federation has defence forces  of  its

own  and  we  have  nothing to contribute  towards  the

common defence?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Just a word in edgewise, Sir, and that is

that perhaps the hon. Member for Serangoon forgets that

if we do not have detachments of the local forces, then

the  Liberal-Socialists in the City Council  cannot  be

sure  of getting a march-past for the President to take

the  salute, which is none of the functions of the City

Council  Or perhaps they are not interested because  in

any case they do not hope to capture the City Council?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I would like a point of

clarification. If we want to merge with the  Federation

of Malaya, we do not have to go in with our guns at the

ready; we go in with a friendly attitude. There  is  no

need   to  have  an  army  in  order  to  capture   the

Federation. In fact if the Federation feels like it, it

could send in an army and we would be finished. We  can

contribute towards the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to be independent, I think, as the Chief

Minister has realised long



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3092</b></font><br><br>



ago,  it  can  only  be  through  a  merger  with   the

Federation. If the Federation has all the forces ready,

there is no need for us to build up forces ourselves in

order  to  merge with it. Whilst we are not yet  merged

with  the Federation, Britain will have to protect  us.

It  is  its duty, it has agreed to take on our external

defence.  When we are independent and join up with  the

Federation, our whole revenue can then be added to that

of the Federation, which has already been developing an

army, navy and air force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of local youths, I do not want what I

have  said to be twisted. We want our local men  to  be

useful and I said right at the outset this morning that

we  should  convert all these forces into  institutions

producing useful people instead of just fighting men.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, as one of the Independent Members, I wonder at the

debate  this morning on the defence services. The  Hon.

the  Chief  Minister has said that we must  have  local

defence  forces of our own; why then are we negotiating

to  surrender our Royal Malayan Navy to the  Federation

of  Malaya?  We  are now spending 5  per  cent  of  our

expenditure per year on these forces. We know  that  in

time to come we will be an independent country like the

Federation or Indonesia. We must therefore have our own

defence  forces now, just as a precaution  against  any

attack. Sir, the point is this, that we should have our

own  Singapore  Regiment and other defence  forces;  we

cannot surrender our navy to the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that training of the recruits has

gone  on  for  quite a long time. If we  surrender  the

navy,  all  its personnel may become unemployed  unless

they  will be allowed to cross the Causeway and  become

Federation citizens. If not, we should not transfer the

navy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter which we must think of before we

decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3093</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I  move my amendment I would like some  information from the Hon. the Chief Secretary. A provision  of

$5,500 was made for lockers this year, for the purchase

of  lockers. Now we are asked to provide another $2,750

to purchase lockers for next year. I would like to know

whether  there  is  an  increase  in  the  strength  of

personnel,  how  many lockers were purchased  for  what

number  of  ratings,  and  how  many  lockers  will  be

purchased next year out of the $2,750.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, this subhead provides $2,750 for

lockers  in  which volunteers keep their  clothing  and

valuables.  The  Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer  Reserve

originally  in 1956 asked for $12,000 for the  purpose.

This  sum  was reduced in the 1957 Estimates to  $5,500

and  the  provision  of $2,750 in  the  1958  Estimates

represents  the balance of the sum required to  provide

lockers for some 650 ratings. The lockers are likely to

be  made  of wood and metal. The Member for Queenstown

would  probably  like  to  know - or  he  probably  knows

already - that volunteers mostly come straight from their

offices  to,  and  change in, the ships.  That  is  the

reason  why  we would like to get this sum to  complete

the provision of lockers for 650 ratings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the

Hon. the  Chief Secretary has not answered  my  point,

which  is  whether the strength of ratings has  so  far

been  increased. He has not answered that. I also asked

for the number of lockers purchased this year. What  he

said  is  that the sum is required to purchase  lockers

for 650 ratings. Is that the full strength of the navy,

or are there extra men?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than delay the debate, I think I will move my

amendment  to  reduce the figure. I now formally  move,

Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head II be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 66 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is this, Sir, that although a sum of

$12,000  was asked for in 1956, the Government  thought

fit  to  reduce it to $5,500. If the Government at  the

time thought that it should be reduced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3094</b></font><br><br>



and the reduced sum was quite adequate for 1957, there

should not be any reason why a further $2,750 should be

voted for lockers next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Chief Secretary said

$12,000  was required and $2,750 is needed to  complete

the  amount. I wonder at the mathematics of  the  Chief

Secretary, that $5,500 plus $2,750

can make $12,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, I said that this was the balance

that we require to complete providing lockers for

volunteers in the M.R.N.V.R. You will notice in the

Estimates also, Sir, there are a few new deckhands, and

probably there has been an increase also in the number

of ratings, which has now reached a maximum of 650.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $13,926,370 for Head 11 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3094</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 12-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 12 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead I therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the Government has, as I will

outline, turned a blind eye to film censorship,  or  is

sheer  lazy  in  this matter. The law  that  Government

applies    is   a   British   Military   Administration

Proclamation; and up to now it has not been revised. Do

we  want  to carry on with a law fixed by proclamation?

Today  we  have  an elected government  and  we  should

remove all these old laws made at the whim and fancy of

single  individuals. Government should  look  into  the

matter,  repeal the B.M.A. Proclamation and introduce  a

new Bill in the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One peculiar thing about that B.M.A. Proclamation is

that  it seems to give - and Government seems to  uphold

it - protection to British films. There is a quota of 10

per  cent for British films. A cinema can show whatever

films  it likes but 10 per cent of them must be British

films.  We in Singapore think that protection  of  this

kind  should be done away with, and that whoever  wants

to  sell  or exhibit films here should compete  on  the

basis of merit and not on favouritism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3095</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bringing up this matter, too, because the law

does not even allow the 10 per cent to be included  for

our  own  industry. I thought that this  matter  should

have been brought up by the Labour Front but as I am  a

Singaporean, and want to protect local industries, I am

voicing  this  for the local people. We  have  our  own

local  film  industry  producing  Malay  pictures   and

probably  others in the vernacular. Since we  have  our

local  industry coming up, with so many people aspiring

to  be "stars" (at least for Singapore, if not for East

Asia), what protection is Government giving to it?  Are

we  going  to  fix a quota for it, as  we  protect  the

British  industry?  Or  are we going  to  allow  it  to

compete   with  foreign  producers  and  allow  foreign

exchange to be taken out of this country? If Government

is  serious about promoting anything local,  it  should

consider  very seriously ways and means of helping  the

local industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I want to voice my opinion about the

quality  of  many of the imported films, from  whatever

source.  Many  of them are of very low standard  and  I

would  urge the film censor to be a bit more free  with

the  scissors,  to cut out items which  may  teach  the

young  people  of  Singapore to be  more  efficient  in

crime,  to steal and rob, or to murder, and also  items

showing  the other side of life which is more  Western,

showing  customs  and  people in  the  West  exhibiting

themselves in a way that would be abominable  according

to Eastern standards. And if the film censor's scissors

are  a  bit  freer,  I  think we  can  have  a  cleaner

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  should like to be able to help the hon. Member

for Serangoon by giving him the exact date on which the

Legislature  of  the  Colony,  the  local  Legislature,

enacted  the  Film Censorship Ordinance.  It  was  some

years ago.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member

for Serangoon speaks of a 10 per cent quota for British

films and, according to my notes, said that this 10 per

cent  is to be included for our local industry. English

is indeed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3096</b></font><br><br>



a  difficult language and I am finding great difficulty

in  understanding what that means. Does he mean the  10

per  cent  to  be  included in the local  industry,  or

really  that  films made locally should be included  in

the 10 per cent British quota?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir,

10  per cent of films shown have to be British, 90  per

cent  anything  else.  If you show  a  locally-produced

film,  that  film is not included in that 10  per  cent

British  quota but outside it. I mean that 10 per  cent

is  for British films and nothing else, and I am asking

what sort of protection our local films will get.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I now

understand  what  he  meant  although  I  found   great

difficulty  in  doing so from his original  speech.  In

regard to this 10 per cent British quota, I would  give

the hon. Member the assurance that the Government would

look into this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the

last point which the hon. Member for Serangoon made, on

the  question  of  the film censor using  the  scissors

more, this question was also raised in the debate  last

year  on  the Estimates. It was then pointed  out  that

film  censorship  is a somewhat difficult  subject  but

that the censors are doing the best they can. I am sure

that  whatever  remarks were made last year  have  been

taken  note  of  and not lost on those responsible  for

taking  the  difficult decisions as to which  films  to

allow  in  and how far it is possible to make  cuts  in

them without doing any damage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, speaking in support

of  the  hon.  Member for Serangoon regarding  the  low

standard of the pictures shown here, I would comment on

the  peculiar  way films are censored in  Singapore.  I

have  noticed on many occasions that a film  banned  in

Singapore  is,  in  a  matter of a few  weeks,  heavily

advertised and shown in Johore. I think this is due  to

lack  of co-ordination between the censors here and  in

the Federation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3097</b></font><br><br>



Malaya. One censor thinks that a film should be  banned

whereas the other thinks that it should be shown in the

interests  of  the public. I cannot  see,  Sir,  why  a

picture  should be banned in Singapore when it  can  be

seen easily in Johore. The distance between Johore  and

Singapore is only a matter of 17 miles, and anyone  can

drive his car to Johore and see the banned picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that there should be more co-ordination between the two censors, that if a film is

banned  in  Singapore it should be banned in Johore  as

well.  I  would not mind if it goes right up  to  Kuala

Lumpur or Penang, because there is a great distance  to

Kuala  Lumpur  and Penang, but what is  the  difference

between  Singapore and Johore, that is until such  time

as  the  Prime Minister of the Federation introduces  a

causeway block? Until such a block is introduced, there

is freedom of movement between Johore and Singapore. So

I think that the people of Singapore do feel that it is

funny  for a picture to be banned in Singapore  but  be

shown in Johore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for

Queenstown  has completely misunderstood the  position.

There  is  one Board of Film Censors for both Singapore

and the Federation of Malaya comprised of a Chairman, a

Chinese  member, a Malay member and an  Indian  member,

together with an assistant censor. What the Member  has

not  appreciated  is that there are two  Committees  of

Appeal,  one  for  Singapore  and  the  other  for  the

Federation.  Appeals from a decision of the  censor  to

the  Singapore Committee are in respect of films to  be

shown  here  in  Singapore,  whereas  appeals  in   the

Federation  go to the Federation Committee  of  Appeal.

There  are two different Committees of Appeal but  only

one Censor, against whose decision people can appeal to

the relevant Committee of Appeal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it from

the  Chief  Secretary that there is  a  Board  of  Film

Censors  comprising representatives from the Federation

and Singapore. In the case



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3098</b></font><br><br>



of  appeals,  there  are separate  Committees  for  the

Federation  and Singapore. The Film Censors  Board  has

representatives of the two states and is more or less a

pan-Malayan  department; I see  that  of  the  vote  of

$209,930,  part is recoverable from the Federation.  As

it  is more or less a pan-Malayan Board, when films are

shown  to  it  and  not to the Appeals  Committees,  it

should take into consideration whether a film should or

should  not be shown in Johore, rather than allow  that

film to go straight to the Film Appeals Committee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member

for  Queenstown  fails  to  understand  the  point  put

forward by the Hon. the Chief Secretary. Any film  that

is  banned  by the Board of Film Censors is subject  to

appeal to an Appeals Committee, and there are two  such

appeals  committees, one for Singapore and one for  the

Federation.  Surely  it  is  not  suggested  that   the

Singapore Appeals Committee should have control in  the

Federation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the

funniest   things  I  have  ever  heard  is   how   the

Governments have co-operation and co-ordination in  the

matter  of  reviewing films only the first time.  After

that, you have two Appeals Committees. If you can  have

co-ordination  and co-operation in the first  instance,

how  is it that you cannot have it in the second,  i.e.

in  the  matter of appeals? I fail to see it. What  has

the Singapore Government been doing? This is one of the

funniest bits of information I have ever heard - you  can

co-operate  in  one instance but cannot in  another.  I

would like very much to have an explanation on that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the ignorance of the hon.

Member  is providing me with some pleasant moments.  In

regard  to the Board of Film Censors, it is Pan Malayan

just  for  the sake of administrative feasibility.  All

films  are  imported into Singapore for the  censor  to

view  here,  instead of being censored  here  and  then

being  sent  to  the Federation to be  censored  again,

which will cost the exhibitor double charges.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3099</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Why do you worry?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And in regard to the Appeals

Committee,   we  operate  under  our  law   while   the

Federation  operates its own; it has  its  own  Appeals

Committee, we have ours. This is not a question of  co-operation; it is the operation of respective laws.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on

this most interesting topic of film censorship, I think

it  is  high  time for our Film Censor to restrict  the

screening of certain undesirable films. Much blame  for

our delinquents, gangsters, smugglers and all sorts  of

vices  can  be thrown on those films, especially  those

from Hollywood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, I wish to suggest that we should

restrict  the importation of certain quality of  United

States   films  through  the  control  of  our  foreign

exchange, thus saving our hard earned American dollars.

Secondly, we should form a special committee consisting

of educationalists to serve as a consulting body to the

Board  of  Film Censors. I have always had the  fullest

respect for its present members and I have no doubt  of

their integrity and ability but I still feel that  more

civic-minded  people should take a keener  interest  in

the censorship of films. A special committee serving as

a  consulting body to the Film Censor could advise  and

give guidance as to the types of films we should import

and allow to show here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that I have read the report

of  the Board of Film Censors. It seems that we have to

censor  more  films. Incidentally, I  happen  to  be  a

member  of the Film Appeal Committee and I am only  too

pleased  to  serve  on  such a  committee,  as  I  have

suggested. The Film Appeal Committee does not even  sit

once  a month and usually we have nothing to do at all.

Therefore.  I  appeal to the Board of Film  Censors  to

give  the  Film Appeal Committee more work  to  do;  in

other  words,  to censor more films and  let  the  film

companies  to appeal more. I hope that this  suggestion

will be fully considered by Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3100</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

whether  the hon. Member is speaking for the exhibitors

of  films.  He suggests that the Board of Film  Censors

should  ban  more films so that they can go before  the

Film Appeal Committee for either approval or rejection.

Surely, the hon. Member knows the psychology of things.

A  picture that is banned and is released later by  the

Appeal  Committee, irrespective of what type of picture

it is, is going to be box office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I expected a

more  constructive  answer  from  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  but he picked on a small point of mine  which

he misunderstood. I say that that because in the report

of  the 1956 Film Censors which is in a pamphlet  form,

there is a column which states that they feel that they

have  not  passed a big number of films for the  Appeal

Committee to consider. My wish is that the Film  Censor

should send more films to the Film Appeal Committee  to

consider.  It  does  not  mean  that  the  Film  Appeal

Committee will over-rule the decisions of the Board  of

Film Censors in every case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, to a certain

extent,  I support the last speaker. I think  that  the

censorship  of  pictures on gangsterism  must  be  done

strictly.  I feel very strongly that gangsterism  which

exists  in  Singapore is largely due  to  the  pictures

exhibited  here showing how it is done in  America  and

elsewhere,  and the sooner the censors ban  such  films

the better for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 14 -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I formally move

the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper

under this head,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3101</b></font><br><br>



That  the sum to be allotted for Head 14 be reduced  by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, I have chosen this amendment today to

initiate a discussion. Now, Sir, only yesterday I  said

that  we  are  maintaining  a  white  elephant  in  the

Broadcasting Department and that the department instead

of  producing revenue is a liability to Singapore. This

is  another  department, Sir, which costs  us  $908,440

annually, and there is a revenue of $2,700.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, for a small place like Singapore with a

population of less than I million people, do we require

the Department of Information Services to the extent of

costing  the taxpayers $900,000 annually? I think  that

this  sum  could  be greatly reduced. I said  yesterday

that  many  Ministers of different  countries  do  pass

through  Singapore  to  the  Federation  which  is   an

independent  territory and what they  generally  do  is

taking  pictures  and publicising them  with  which  we

should not be very much concerned. Information could be

imparted through the Broadcasting Department. I do  not

say  that the Department of Information Services should

be  scrapped. What I say is that the expenditure should

be greatly reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing, Sir, is that this department used to

serve  as a sort of post office for the United  Kingdom

on  its propaganda work. Like any other government,  we

do  not mind if the United Kingdom does spread its  own

information in this territory (especially when it is  a

colony  under  it) but it should be  done  by  its  own

department  as what any other Commonwealth  country  is

doing  and  the local taxpayer should not be  taxed  to

provide  a sort of post office for it. I think  that  a

Member  of  this Assembly drew attention to  this  last

year.  I  do  not know whether this is still happening,

but  if it is still happening it should be stopped. The

expenses of the department as a whole should be reduced

and  Singapore taxpayers should not suffer to the  tune

of nearly $1 million for this department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

my  motion  which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3102</b></font><br><br>



follows that of the Member for  Telok Ayer requires the Governor's recommendation or consent. As  I  have  neither the Governor's recommendation  nor consent, I shall take advantage of the motion moved  by the Member for Telok Ayer to make some remarks not only

on  the  Information Services as a  whole  but  on  the

upgrading of the post of the Director from Grade  F  to

Grade E. It is common knowledge that this is one of the

posts  recommended to be Malayanised. It seems that  no

suitable  applicant came forward and  for  no  apparent

reason  the  grade for this particular  post  has  been

pushed up from F to E.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we know that the Government has in the past

been  rigging up the establishments in any way it finds

convenient,  but  surely there must be  some  sense  of

decorum with which these things are done. It should not

appear  that  either  the  officer  concerned   was   a

favourite with some powerful man in the Government,  or

had  applied  pressure by threatening to  withdraw  his

services,  or some such disreputable method of  getting

what he wanted. There is no reason at all why this post

should  have  been  upgraded and we strenuously  oppose

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree, however, with the Member for Telok

Ayer  that the Information Services is not an important

department  of  the  state.  With  the  newspapers   in

Singapore all controlled by either wealthy combines  or

wealthy individuals, it is of the utmost importance, if

the  Government is to get its point of view across,  to

see  that it has a machine that can make sure that  its

point  of  view  is presented vividly and  clearly.  My

criticism  is  that a lot of this money  is  not  being

utilised  to its maximum, partly because the  personnel

in  the department are not effective enough, and partly

because  many  of them do not understand  the  need  of

pressing a point home vividly and constantly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of illustration, everybody knows that the

Catholics are against the grant for family planning and

every Member in this Assembly who has taken a stand  or

voted  for family planning has been showered by a  mass

of  literature. Twenty chops on one pamphlet,  personal

letters from some dear old friend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3103</b></font><br><br>



who  feels  very strongly that alt this is against  the

health  and  comfort  of  human  beings,  and  so   on.

Personally, I am immune to this sort of practice but  I

am  quite sure that there must be many other people who

somehow yield from their original position as a  result

of  this  constant  pressure. Now the  stuff  that  the

Information  Services  has  been  pushing  out  showing

pictures of Governors, Ministers opening - they  used  to

open  petrol kiosks, I do not know what they open these

days - schools, dance-halls or cinemas is not  the  stuff

that will excite the imagination of the people. That is

the  sort  of  stuff that makes people  angry.  It  has

reached  the point now where my two kids at  home  have

great  fun  when  the  postman  arrives  every  morning

because  they know by now that this is for  them.  They

can  make paper boats, paper aeroplanes and paper  hats

out of it because it has reached a point where you have

developed  an immunity and say, "All that  is  rubbish.

Don't  waste  my time." There must be some people  with

some imagination and with some drive to put these ideas

over.



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, with $250 million at its disposal every

year, if the Government cannot get across to the people

the  few good things that are done, then God help them.

We  the  P.A.P. have  not got a  press  apart  from  a

fortnightly. We do not own any newspapers,  nor  do  we

have  any  friendly proprietors. We only have the  mass

meeting  and  the  occasional radio broadcast  when  we

coerce  the Government into giving in. But we  can  get

our  ideas  over because we are prepared constantly  to

press the ideas until they get over to the people. This

year  we fought several issues and got across the  fact

that the constitution was not a mistake, at the cost of

the  former  Member for Cairnhill (Mr D. S. Marshall).

We  got  other ideas over and we are getting a  lot  of

ideas over in this coming election itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and its leadership cannot just squat

on  their  haunches and expect George  Thomson  or  Roy

Ferroa  or Pereira to go and build its prestige and  to

put its ideas over. These are your



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3104</b></font><br><br>



instruments;  you have got to drive them, sharpen  them

if you will, throw away the blunt ones and buy new ones

if  you  must.  If we were the Government,  this  is  a

department which will receive top priority. You may  do

all  the  good things in the world, but if  the  people

believe  that  you did not do them, you have  lost  the

battle. The Government, not itself alone perhaps not of

its  own  free  volition- passed  the  Shop  Assistants

Employment  Ordinance  to  the  benefit  of  the   shop

assistants.  But  by manipulation of  human  minds  and

public  opinion,  the public say, "Ah, useless  chaps.

They  were coerced into passing it. Anyway, it  is  not

being  enforced." Why is the Information  Services  not

putting  this idea across: "These are your  rights.  We

the  Labour Front Government fought for them. We  shall

see  that they are enforced. We shall prevent you  from

being  exploited  and  oppressed."  But  no, they  put

pictures in circles with all the little squiggles  that

used  to  accompany the old colonial  programmes  about

Governors  inspecting the troops, Ministers wanting  to

put  a gate over a dam and suddenly finding it has  all

gone  wrong. If the Government wants to win the  battle

of  the  minds, it has got to be three times as  active

and ten times more imaginative.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the

remarks  made by the Member for Tanjong Pagar, I  would

first  of all like to refer to the grading of the  post

of the Director. The original Grade F was put in at the

time when the head of the Information Services was  the

Public   Relations  Officer.  But  now  with  the   new

structure    of    the   Information   Services,    the

responsibilities attached to this post are more. If  we

look   at   the  salary  grades  of  other   hands   of

departments, we will find that they are all in Grade E.

With the new responsibilities and the reorganisation of

the  department,  it  is  thought  necessary  that  the

correct grading for this post would be Grade E. That is

the explanation, Sir, for upgrading the post from F  to E.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion made by the Member for

Telok  Ayer  (Mr R. Jumabhoy), that he  considers  the

Information Services a white elephant in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3105</b></font><br><br>



the   same  way  as  he  thought  of  the  Broadcasting

Department,  I completely disagree with  him  in  this,

Sir, I  do not think for a moment that this department

is  a liability and I think that the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  has very clearly defended the existence  of  the

Information  Services and the active work which  it  is

doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the year 1958, the Government can assure the

people  and  the  Members  in  this  House  that   this

department  will  be  very, very  active.  It  is  only

recently that we have had a big increase in the  stat?.

We  have  a  research section now and we  also  have  a

centralised translation bureau. Now, all these officers

are  going to carry out the jobs entrusted to them  and

the  Information Services will be very active in  1958.

Hitherto,  we  have  been handicapped  because  of  the

shortage  of staff but all the defects will be remedied

in  the  year  1958. Sir, I agree with the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar that there is room for more improvement.

We  have  in the past published very many pamphlets  in

connection  with  the  various  Ordinances   that   are

approved  by  the Assembly. We had the Shop  Assistants

Employment Ordinance, the Labour Ordinance and  various

other   Ordinances  and  we  have  published  pamphlets

regarding them for the information of the people. These

pamphlets  were  produced  in  the  various  vernacular

languages in the hope that more people would understand

these  Ordinances more clearly. Sir, in the year  1958,

we  will  also  see  the  expansion  of  various  other

activities  in  view of the decision of multilingualism

in  the  City Council and in the Legislative  Assembly,

and  we are quite capable, with the existing staff,  to

deal with all the matters which come within the purview

of  this department. We can assure this House that more

active efforts will be taken by this department in  the

year 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather glad

that the Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary  has

given  an  assurance to this House that this department

will improve next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the explanation regarding the upgrading of this

appointment  from  Grade F to Grade  E  is  very,  very

unsatisfactory.  I  cannot see much difference  in  the

duties of the old Public Relations Officer and the  new

Director   of   Information   Services.   The   present

functions, from what I can see, are exactly the same as

those   of  the  old  Public  Relations  Officer.   The

responsibilities are the same and the work is the same.

So  why  then  should  there be  an  upgrading  in  the

appointment of the Director?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the upgrading, Sir, I do understand that

the period of the present holder of the appointment  is

being  extended  for  another two years.  There  is  no

reason given for this extension. It appears to me  that

there is no local Asian officer who is able to take  up

this appointment. If that is so, Sir, then what is  the

Government doing? Has the Government thought of placing

an  understudy,  someone to learn the  work,  so  that,

after  the  two-year  period when the  present  officer

retires, there is some local officer who can take  over

his  job  at once, rather than to leave it at  that?  I

refer to my Question on this subject as to whether  the

appointment   of  the  Assistant  Director   would   be

advertised and the answer given to me by the  Hon. the

Chief  Secretary was, "No." Now, if we  have  no  local

Asian  officer to take over the appointment as Director

of  Information  Services, why then, Sir,  can  we  not

advertise the appointment of a local man for  the  post

of Assistant Director so that, when he is appointed, he

will be able to be an understudy to the Director with a

view to taking over the latter's appointment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of pamphlets, I do appreciate that

the  Government  publishes in the vernacular  languages

for the information of the public, but what is lacking,

Sir,  is  the  question  of  films  in  the  vernacular

languages. Now, this department is supposed  to  screen

films of educational value to the public. Every time  I

see  a  film  of the department, it is in English.  How

much can one expect the man-in-the-street to understand

English films? Why not produce more vernacular films so

that the public would be able to understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3107</b></font><br><br>



such  films rather than have them all in English? Still

on  this  question of films, I have also been  to  many

community centres and attended the screening  of  films

and,  at  almost every centre, I see the same films.  I

believe  that these films are quite a number  of  years

old. Can the Government not produce more films for  the

benefit  of  the public? Let us produce some  new  ones

rather  than the old, old ones again. What  benefit  or

educational value would anyone get if he sees the  same

film day in and day out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the question of posters of this

department, I wonder whether this department is  acting

as  an  agent of the Federation of Malaya. I find  that

out  of ten posters on pillar boxes in Singapore, seven

are  Federation posters. You can only find three  which

are  really Singapore posters. Why are we acting as  an

agent  to  publicise the activities of the  Federation?

How  much  is the Federation paying us to do this  job?

This department is paid by the Singapore Government and

it should publicise the activities of Singapore instead

of the activities of the Federation. As one Member said

last  year,  and I think the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

again   reminded  the  House,  pictures  are  published

showing  a  Minister opening a petrol pump, a  Minister

doing  this,  or a Minister doing that. Of what  public

benefit  to  the  people would it be  to  know  that  a

Minister  is  doing  this or that?  Let  us  have  some

pictures  of  educational value,  and  let  us  have  a

department  giving a real information  service  to  the

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Like Ministers going to Japan!



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, with regard to the Director's post, we

have  kept  strictly  to  the  recommendations  of  the

Malayanisation Commission and this post was advertised.

It was found that there was no local candidate suitable

to  fill  this post and, as a result, the term  of  the

office  of the Director has been extended. It is  wrong

to  say, Sir, that we have no Asian as a deputy to  the

Director. We have an Assistant Director who is an Asian

and if only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3108</b></font><br><br>



the hon. Member (Mr Lee Choon Eng) took the trouble of

seeing me or writing to me, I would have furnished  him

with the necessary information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of vernacular films was brought up by

the  Member  for Queenstown. Last year, of course,  we

had  no  vote  for making films. Now, we have  provided

some  funds  and we will see what improvements  we  can

make  during  1958 with regard to producing  vernacular

films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of posters, I do not know what the

hon. Member (Mr Lee Choon Eng) is driving at, Sir.  We

do  not  think  that we have acted as  agents  for  the

Federation.  It  is wrong to say that. The  Information

Services Department exhibits posters not only those  of

Singapore but those of the Federation too and I do  not

think  that  it  is  right to call us  agents  for  the

Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Seven posters out of ten!



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I think it is right and proper that we do

fix  a few posters of the Federation so that the people

of  Singapore may be able to know what is taking  place

in the Federation. I think it is a very healthy sign.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, I replied to the Member for

Queenstown  last time concerning the post of  Assistant

Director  of  Information  Services  that  it  was   an

administrative post and is filled by an officer of  the

administrative service. The Assistant Minister  to  the

Chief  Secretary  has pointed out that  the  Director's

post  was  advertised  but  that  we  had  no  suitable

candidates as a result of that advertisement.  I  would

suggest,  Sir,  that  perhaps one of  the  failures  to

attract  suitable local officers to  the  post  in  its

present  grading  is  that the present  salary  is  not

adequate.  I  understand that no  local  journalist  of

quality  would accept appointment of this post  in  its

present  grading. I would like to dispel any suggestion

that  the new grading is in any way intended to upgrade

the  present incumbent because of the renewal,  of  the

contract  of  the  present officer.  As  the  Assistant

Minister to the Chief Secretary said, his contract  has

been   extended  for  a  further  two  years   on   the

recommendation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3109</b></font><br><br>



the Public Service Commission because we could not find

a  suitable officer. I wish to stress, Sir, that it has

nothing to do with the present incumbent. We feel-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He should get more!



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b>-that the present salary attached to

the  post - which,  as I just pointed out,  is  not  even

attractive  to  local journalists of quality - should  be

upgraded  and the more so because of the new  structure

and wider responsibilities as a result of the expansion

of  the  staff of this department. I think that if  the

Member for Queenstown will read the Estimates properly,

he will see that this department is being expanded to a

very  great extent and we hope next year that  it  will

try  to accomplish, for instance, as much of the wishes

and  suggestions  of the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar  as

possible,  but I would like again, Sir, to repeat  that

the  upgrading of the post has nothing to do  with  the

present  incumbent.  We feel that the  post  should  be

upgraded because of its wider responsibilities and  the

expansion of the staff and also to bring it up  to  the

same  grading  of the various heads of departments  who

are also of Grade E status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The second amendment* standing in the

name   of   Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew  needs  the  Governor's

recommendation or consent to be signified. There  being

no signification, we pass on to the next.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The following is Mr Lee Kuan Yew's amendment:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 14 be reduced

by $600 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 14 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (18) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the remarks column of item (18), it says,

"Title  changed  from  Press Officer."  It  leaves  the

reader to deduce from looking at the figures that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3110</b></font><br><br>



Information Officer (Press) has also been promoted  and

got a bump up in the salary and that it is not just the

title  that has been changed. If we look at item  (20),

Sir,  "Press  Officers, two. . . New posts;  Conference

Secretary. . . Abolished against creation of  one  post

of  Press  Officer  shown under item  (20),"  what  has

happened  is  that  this Conference  Secretary  becomes

Information  Officer (Press) and he gets  a  tremendous

boost  in  salary. His post of Conference Secretary  is

abolished  and two Press Officers are created.  Whether

they  will be filled or not nobody knows but to justify

the "bump up", two Press Officers are put in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we all know that the would-be incumbent is

a  man who wanted to get up to this particular point in

the  hierarchy and failed when the Staff  Side  in  the

Whitley Council objected strenuously to the grading  of

that post. Now, by this circuitous route he is going to

get there. Sir, we do not mind giving more people, more

money all the time but there must be some principle  by

which  a  man's job is evaluated and by which  a  man's

suitability for a job is measured. From the examples  I

cited   yesterday  and  this  morning,  one   has   the

uncomfortable  feeling  that all  this  is  just  kawan

kawan:  "You  my  friend, I bump you  up;  you  not  my

friend,  you stay put." That is not the way  to  run  a

government  service. That is not the way  to  keep  the

bureaucracy efficient, contented and happy.  Some  time

or  other - unless  of  course they  put  this  Order  in

Council through, and nobody can do anything about these

things - the whole of the Government service will  have

to  receive a really good pruning. Something has to  be

done to put everybody in his place and the right man in

the  right job and to make everybody more efficient  so

that   the  whole  administrative  bureaucracy  becomes

alive, and a vibrant machine, not the sluggish, matter-of-fact, unimaginative and habitual bureaucracy that it

is at present.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3111</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, the hon. Member is misinformed



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Always misinformed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> There is only a slight increase in the

salary  as  a  result of the change in the  title  from

Press  Officer, but the salary scale has  not  changed.

Sir,  this  change in the title is as a result  of  the

reorganisation of the Information Services and this new

title  has  now  been  changed to  Information  Officer

(Press) which is in the higher executive salary scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the two Press Officers, we now have one

Press Officer under item (20). Sir, at the moment, this

officer  is over-worked. We intend to recruit one  more

officer to be attached to various Ministries so that he

can  put over information about Government's activities

to  the  public. This officer also attends the  monthly

meetings  of  the  Rural District Committee  and  takes

notes  of  the proceedings which he then gives  to  the

Press.  He  also attends the various meetings organised

by  the  Information Services; he is also in charge  of

editing and publishing the Rural News. We find that one

officer  is  inadequate to do this work. Therefore,  we

intend  to have one additional Press Officer. I do  not

think,  Sir, that we have made any drastic  change.  We

have  not gone beyond what we actually need and I think

that  the  salary  scale  of  the  Information  Officer

(Press)   is   justified  and   that   the   additional

appointment of a Press Officer is also justified.  This

is a very straightforward issue, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my next motion is

in respect of Head 14, item (47), and I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 14 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (47) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not moved this motion in order to condemn

the creation of this post. All I would like to do is to

initiate  a  debate on this particular  point,  namely,

what  is  the job of this Information Officer (Civics)?

What is the scope of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3112</b></font><br><br>



his duties? What are the aims that the Government hopes

to achieve by the creation of this post?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, civics covers a multitude of uninteresting

things  like  what is the vote, how you vote,  why  you

vote,  what does the Rural Board do, what does  it  not

do,   why  you  should  condemn  your  Member  of   the

Legislative Assembly, why you should praise your  local

Liberal-Socialist  Party  opponent,  why   you   should

condemn  the Governor, and so on, But we would like  to

have  a clear line of demarcation of the duties of  the

officer,  whether civics goes over into  the  field  of

politics.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I welcome this question because ever

since we started civic courses in Singapore, very  many

people have not understood the real intentions of  such

courses. There is still some misapprehension and  I  am

indeed  very glad that the hon. Member has  brought  up

this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the duties of the civics organiser and his staff

are  to  organise civic courses and film shows.  He  is

also  in  charge  of  the public  address  system,  the

maintenance  of  community  listening  sets   and   the

interpretation of speeches in the rural areas. Sir, the

project  of civic courses was first approved last  year

and   $14,040  was  voted  to  provide  for  meals  and

transport.  It was agreed that this officer  in  charge

should  be  seconded  on an experimental  basis.  These

courses,  Sir, have proved very successful so  much  so

that  the post of Information Officer (Civics) has been

created  and two new public address units are  proposed

as  a  permanent  feature. The justification  for  this

expansion  is  the  increase of the electorate  in  the

number  of  vernacular-speaking people. Moreover,  with

the  establishment of the rural District  Councils,  it

will  be important to establish a link with the  people

of  the  rural areas, and it is proposed that one  unit

would  work full time in each rural district  area  and

two  units  would be for use in the city area  and  for

general purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, we have had quite a number of civic

courses  attended by farmers, factory workers, teachers

and  people from all walks of life and they  have  been

given the opportunity of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3113</b></font><br><br>



understand  how Government works and  a  first-hand

knowledge  of  the  Government  machinery.  The  people

generally welcome the civic courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the part played by the civic

organiser  and  his staff in connection with  politics,

they  and  the  whole of the Information Services  will

not,  as  a matter of policy and principle, indulge  in

any party politics. They are not in the rural areas  or

in  any  part of the city to champion the cause of  any

political  party and they are given strict instructions

as  to how they should interpret the various Government

policies  to  the  people.  In  all  their  activities,

translations and interpretations of these things,  they

have  adhered to this principle. It may be argued  that

some  of  the interpretations may not be quite accurate

but  we have from time to time increased the efficiency

of the translators and interpreters and we are now in a

position to say that the interpretations going  out  to

the people are really accurate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do feel, Sir, that with the encouragement that

Members  of the Assembly give to the civic courses,  we

will  be  able to make considerable progress  in  these

civic  courses and ultimately we hope that more  people

will  be informed of how the Government is run and  how

they  should  make use of the Government machinery  for

their own benefits.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir. I rise to say

that  I  welcome the creation of new posts in  what  is

called the Field Division. Last year, I recollect  that

I  spoke  on this same subject of Information  Services

and  I  asked that the Government should fully  utilise

all  the facilities they possess not only to inform the

people  but at the same time to educate them.  We  must

acknowledge  the  significant  work  performed  by  the

Information Services since it took over from the Public

Relations  Office. There have been great  improvements,

one of them being the introduction of civic courses  as

pointed out by the Hon. the Assistant Minister  to  the

Chief Secretary, but I wonder whether the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3114</b></font><br><br>



is  prepared to enlarge the activities not only of  the

civic courses -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I would like to remind hon.

Members  that the time fixed for the disposal  of  this

particular item is five minutes past twelve and  it  is

just  now  twelve  minutes to twelve and  if  the  hon.

Member  will  confine his remarks more  to  the  civics

section, then perhaps we will get on a little faster.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,I

will confine myself to that. I welcome the creation  of

these  new  posts but I wish to suggest that additional

work  should be undertaken. I wonder whether the  Field

Division can undertake the responsibility of organising

more  public forums, especially political forums before

or  after  any important Bill has been debated  in  the

Assembly. I feel that elected Assemblymen should not be

the only persons to debate the state of affairs of this

country  but that every member of the public should  be

encouraged  to take a keener interest in the  state  of

affairs  of  this country on public forums as  well  as

political  forums  to  debate  any  important  Bill  or

measure  before  or after it has been debated  in  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Government has boasted

about  the  industrialisation of this country  but  how

much  work  has been done in the form of propaganda  by

the   Information  Services?  Like  the   question   of

fisheries, we take a keen interest in it but  how  many

pamphlets  have been published on the subject  and  how

much  information has been given to the public  on  the

subject of industrialisation, and so on?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

embarking  on  a debate on the general  policy  of  the

whole  department.  He will have  the  opportunity  for

that, if there is time, when I propose the question  on

the main head. I must remind the hon. Member that there

are two more amendments to be debated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you, Sir.I just have two

things  to suggest. The new Field Division should:  (1)

undertake



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3115</b></font><br><br>



the responsibility of sponsoring public forums and

(2) propagandise the importance of industrialisation in

this  country and the maintenance of law and order  for

the stability of this country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Just to make myself clear on one

point,  I think the Hon. the Assistant Minister to  the

Chief  Secretary  did not differentiate  between  party

political  leanings and political leanings.  The  whole

purpose  of these civic courses is to explain  why  the

democratic  system is good and why we want to  make  it

work. That is politics. But what we must avoid is party

politics: that this party is more suitable or more able

to  make the system work better than the other. That is

a matter for competing political parties to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as no politics in civics. The

whole  basis  of  our  society at  the  moment  is  the

democratic  system and you have to tell the people  why

this  system  is  to their advantage and  will  improve

conditions  for  them.  Why it  is  that  one  vote  at

election  time  can  bring  about  a  change   in   the

leadership and policy of a government. Why it is,  that

with    other    forms    of    government - totalitarian

governments - the leadership perpetuates itself,  whether

it  be  the Fascist type of government where a dictator

appoints   his  successor  or  the  central  democratic

variety  where  one party perpetuates itself,  and  not

even  a  revolution, as in Hungary, can remove it  from

power. These are political matters. They have got to be

put  across to the people forcibly and vividly. What  I

wanted was an assurance from the Assistant Minister  to

the  Chief Secretary on this question of political bias

between  competing  democratic parties.  That  must  be

avoided: the fact, for instance, the Labour Front is  a

modest,  moderate and mildly socialist  Party,  whereas

the  P.A.P. according to some quarters is an extremist,

immoderate  Party. That sort of thing must be  abjured.

But the idea of the democratic system as a system which

is  suitable  and  can be worked provided  there  is  a

leadership  and  a vigilant electorate must  be  pushed

vigorously. That is what I intended to convey.

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> My reference to politics was in fact to

party  leaning but, of course, hon. Members  are  aware

that  the  Information Services Department  takes  part

from time to time in exhibitions to show the people how

a  democratic system functions: for example, we will be

having an exhibition very soon in the Victoria Memorial

Hall. Those aspects of politics are undertaken but as I

said,  earlier,  Sir,  there  is  no  leaning  to   any

particular party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I beg to withdraw this

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 14 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 8 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this motion, I seek more information

regarding  subhead  8,  item (2) - Film  Production - where

there  is allotted $30,000 required, according  to  the

footnote  (iii)  at the bottom of page  109,  "to  film

particular events for newsreel and television".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary, a

few  moments ago, has contradicted this by saying  that

he will see what can be done under this head to provide

the  Queenstown  community centre and  other  community

centres  with more entertainment. I only wish to  point

this  out  that  the tourist film entitled  "Singapore,

Lion  City", which runs for about 16 to 18 minutes  and

was   produced  by  the  Government  last  year,   cost

approximately  $24,000.  That was  the  production  and

negative  cost of this film without the supply  of  any

positive  prints  for exhibition round  the  world.  In

other  words, $30,000 is not going to get you very  far

as  far  as  film  production  is  concerned,  and  the

production  of  newsreels.  If  Singapore  is   to   be

advertised  to  the world or if the  Government  is  to

advertise  its achievements to Singapore, you  are  not

going  to  do very much in 20 minutes or 25 minutes  of

film.  This  seems to me to be neither here nor  there.

Either you should allocate more money or you should not

allocate any at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3117</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, it is important that films should

be  made  in  1958.  The film, for instance,  which  we

showed on Singapore's social welfare services was  made

in  1955 and it shows the plans for the Kandang  Kerbau

maternity  hospital, the extension to which  have  been

completed  now for many months. We wish to  bring  such

films  up  to date. We would like to make a film  about

the  new education policy approved by the Assembly.  We

would  like  to  produce newsreel films  of  events  of

public  interest  which  may subsequently  be  utilised

either  by  international  newsreel  companies  or   by

overseas  T.V. services.  For  this  reason,   it   is

imperative, Sir, that funds should be available for the

Information Services to undertake this film  production

and  we hope to produce some better newsreels depicting

events  of  public  interest and advertising  Singapore

overseas,



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the principle of

making  these films and I wonder whether the  Hon. the

Chief  Secretary has any idea of what  he  can  produce

with $30,000. My submission is that very little can  be

done with that sort of sum. If you are going to do  the

thing  properly,  you  will need  a  very  much  larger

allocation. If you are just going to play with $30,000,

you will get nowhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, we feel that with this amount, we

can produce quite a number of newsreels and other films

in  connection with the activities in Singapore, but  I

am very glad to note that the Member for Tanglin is all

in favour of providing more money for this project, and

I  would like to take this opportunity to say,  on  the

strength  of his support, that if we require  any  more

money, we will come for an A.S.V.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 14 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 12 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again I seek information. There is now a grant

of   $300,000   for   tourist  promotion   under   Head

30-Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3118</b></font><br><br>



Commerce  and Industry. Why has this amount of  $20,000

been  left under this head and not been transferred  to

Head  30?  Are we going to have two Ministries  running

the  tourist  industry with the Director of Information

Services  going  in  one  direction  and  the   Tourist

Advisory  Committee,  acting  under  the  Minister  for

Commerce and Industry, in another?



<br><br>12.00 noon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, it may appear anomalous that this

should appear in my department's vote when $300,000 has

already  been  voted to the Department of Commerce  and

Industry for tourist promotion, but this $300,000, Sir,

will not be made available immediately in the new year.

We  have to wait for the appointment of the Director of

Tourism   and  meanwhile  there  are  commitments   for

advertisements, tourist leaflets and propaganda  and  I

can  give the assurance that as soon as the expenditure

is  drawn on the $300,000, the remaining vote with this

department will be frozen.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that does not still

explain why tourist promotion is to be conducted by two

Ministries. There may be need for advertisement in  the

early  part  of the year but I see no reason  why  this

should  still remain under the portfolio of  the  Chief

Secretary. It seems to me to be somewhat anomalous. Nor

do  I understand why the sum of $300,000 allotted under

Head  30  cannot be touched until a Director of Tourism

exists.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, when I made a statement on

tourist promotion, I mentioned that the sum of $300,000

will  be allocated for tourist promotion work but  that

the  money will be available only when the Director  of

Tourism has been appointed. Now that, Sir, is necessary

because until the Director of Tourism is appointed, you

cannot  have  co-ordinated  action  in  the  field   of

promotion of tourist work and it is only after you have

the  Director  appointed that you can have co-ordinated

action  in the field of propaganda and other facilities

and  services offered to tourists, and so  on.  In  the

meanwhile,  Sir, in order that tourist  promotion  work

should  not stop until the Director is recruited,  this

sum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3119</b></font><br><br>



is provided, and this sum, though it is allocated under

the  Department of Information Services vote, could  be

utilised  by  my  Ministry  for  the  carrying  out  of

propaganda  work.  The Tourist Advisory  Committee  now

feels  a  bit  frustrated because they  say  that  they

cannot  do  anything until the Director  is  appointed.

This  sum  will then be available for that  purpose  so

that  they  can go ahead with the propaganda, leaflets,

and so on, and when the Director is appointed, they can

have access to the main vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the obvious moral is to

appoint  your Director of Tourism. I would  remind  the

House  that  the announcement made by the Minister  for

Commerce and Industry was in June of this year. He  has

had six months in which to make this appointment.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I do not remember the month, Sir,

but   it  was  a  few  months  ago  that  I  made   the

announcement. It is not an easy matter to get an expert

from overseas. At the moment, I can tell the House that

the  Tourist  Advisory Committee have scanned  all  the

applications that have come in and have written back to

a  few applicants asking for further information before

they  recommend a name for appointment.  It  is  no  use

appointing  a man without first finding out whether  he

is  capable,  what experience he has, and  so  on,  and

therefore it takes a bit of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $908,440 for Head 14 stand part of

the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, time is running

short and I will try to go fast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to raise this point again. The

Government failed to answer me whether they support  my

suggestion that with the creation of new posts  in  the

Field  Division, the Information Services could sponsor

public  forums in any public centre for purposes  of  a

public  debate before or after the carrying out of  any

important policy by the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3120</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the public should be well informed that the

Government   is   prepared  to  accept  the   All-Party

agreement  in  this House that we must merge  with  the

Federation of Malaya politically and economically.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I do not think that the Government can

meet the suggestion of the hon. Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I do not think that it is a good practice

to   have   a   public  forum  before  or   after   the

implementation of Government policies sponsored by  the

Information Services because the job of the Information

Services  of course, is, to pass on to the  people  the

facts  of the policies accepted by Government  and  any

discussion  about  the  rights  and  wrongs  of   these

policies  should be debated in voluntary  organisations

which are not lacking in Singapore. I am sure that  the

hon. Member is aware of a very large number of debating

societies  now existing in Singapore and various  other

voluntary  organisations which are  usually  sponsoring

these public forums.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $908,440 for Head 14 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3120</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 15 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 15 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, Singapore seems to be going backward in

the  matter  of  security. Everybody in the  street  is

asking,  "Is  it safe?" We find that this  question  of

security is not only confined to people who have  money

but also to the ordinary folks in the streets. You read

many reports in the papers about the increase in crime.

Every  day,  you find that there are robbery  and  gang

fights  and it seems that it is quite unsafe for people

who  are  not armed to move about anywhere.  A  child's

necklace  may be pinched and a woman may be robbed.  We

find  that  with  the people who have money,  there  is

kidnapping going on; their problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3121</b></font><br><br>



has  become  so serious that one important organisation

held  a meeting and expressed dissatisfaction with  the

inertness of Government in providing security  for  the

people. All these seem to point out that something must

be done or something that should have been done has not

been done by the Government. We want an explanation  on

this. We want to have a Singapore safe for everybody to

live  in,  rich  and  poor alike. We  want  to  have  a

Singapore  in which you can have your strolls  anywhere

you like without being troubled by anybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that the time is very short - only half an

hour  is  allotted for this head - and I will run quickly

over  the other points. In Singapore, gambling is rife.

I  have  heard that the gambling suppression department

is abolished and its personnel transferred elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I understand that the Government

cannot  do  anything about gambling  on  the  character

basis. I want to have clarification on that. Is  it  or

is  it  not  true?  This  is an evil  which  should  be

eradicated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point, Sir, is that I would like the

Government  to  say what it is doing in the  matter  of

helping  the young people of Singapore. Today you  have

gang  fights in Tanjong Pagar, Boon Teck Road and  many

other places. You find gang fights everywhere involving

young  people.  I know that this is due mainly  to  the

fault  of  the Government in not providing useful  work

for   these   young  people  who  have  been   rendered

unemployed. What is Government's policy on this matter?

When can we help these young people so that we may have

less trouble and more useful citizens brought up?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much

has  been said about anti-corruption and corruption  in

this  country. How can we stamp out corruption when  we

have here an item called the C.P.I.B. which stands  for

Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bureau is entirely staffed by police officers. It

is  entirely wrong that this Bureau should  be  run  or

supervised by senior police officers. Why I say this is

that  because  it  has come to my notice  when  I  have

myself  forwarded  many complaints to this  department.

What  have they done? They have investigated  into  the

affairs, made reports and they have submitted  them  to

the Attorney-General. Nothing further has been done and

the  reason is that junior police officers went to make

investigations. How can you blame these  junior  police

officers?  Can they make investigations  and  bring  up

charges  against the senior police officers  or  senior

officials  of  the Government? They dare  not  do  that

because  they  are junior officers and some  have  only

been  appointed  for a few months in  that  department.

They would be transferred or kicked out from the police

force  at  any time if they were to offend  any  senior

official. Why can we not have an independent body  with

executive  powers? Give it such powers and I  am  quite

sure  that even members of the public will come forward

with  information. Take, for instance, the question  of

the  rice stockpile. I put forward some information but

what   has   been   done?  If  the  Corrupt   Practices

Investigation  Bureau  were to  make  an  investigation

regarding   the  stockpile,  there  is  evidence   that

corruption  is existing but what has happened  so  far?

Comparing with past records, there has been no increase

in  arrests;  only  the small fry  like  office  peons,

constables  who  are lowly paid were nabbed,  but  what

about the big fry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I understand that a recommendation has been

forwarded   to  the  Attorney-General  to   amend   the

Prevention  of Corruption Ordinance. What has  happened

to  the report? Why has no action been taken? It  is  a

shame  that  this is happening in an elected Government

in  Singapore  today. We must show our firm  stand,  We

must eliminate and kill corruption in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very unhappy to learn that even police

officers and detectives are at the beck and call of the

secret societies in Singapore. There are secret



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3123</b></font><br><br>



societies,  yes.  These secret societies  are  actually

being  backed by detectives who have been in a  certain

department for many years. You can see that most of the

detectives   themselves  are  former   secret   society

gangsters.  A  detective who once belonged  to  the  18

Group will naturally make arrests of or give trouble to

the rival groups.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Which is the rival group.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> It may be Gang 24 or 08; there are

so many other gangs. This should be stopped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Police Training School is sending

out  probationary inspectors who are young  and  green.

They  rely on the information of the detectives so much

so  that they are all entirely in the power or  in  the

hands  of  these same detectives. Why can we  not  stop

this thing? There has been an increase in the number of

gang  fights, kidnapping cases and street-fights.  What

has the Government done? It is no use talking about law

and  order. You can see every night 11 and 12-year  old

schoolboys,  wearing the Tony Curtis hairstyle  and  T-shirts  and  trousers, being taken in by the detectives

who do not like their faces, under section 12(1) of the

Secret  Societies Ordinance which is non-bailable.  Why

can we not arrest those confirmed or hardcore criminals

instead  of  putting young fellows in a police  station

and  sending  them to the C.I.D. the next  morning  for

screening  and  releasing  them  after  24   hours   of

detention, after lingering in the police station lockup

for 24 hours-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Police station.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> - in a police station? Just imagine

this!  This  is  no good. Why can we  not  take  action

against  the  real criminals? Why must  we  help  these

detectives or police officers to make money? We must be

firm.  We  want  a  first-class police  force  in  this

country.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps it is an appropriate

time to suspend. It is a quarter past twelve.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3124</b></font><br><br>

therein.-(Mr Lim Choon Mong).



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. P. Shanks:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the most

dangerous  things in Singapore today  is  an  insidious

tendency   to   pass  on  and  multiply   irresponsible

allegations  of corruption. If, instead of  passing  on

what  he  is  told  to the police  or  to  the  Corrupt

Practices  Investigation Bureau, the  hon.  Member  for

Tiong  Bahru  or  any  other  citizen  will  take   his

informant  or  his  informant's informant  along,  then

perhaps  there  will  emerge  some  evidence,  and   on

evidence the police will and do act. But gossip hearsay

and rumour - that lying jade - are worse than useless. One

sometimes  sees  three little figures grouped  together

which, between them, profess to "see, hear and speak no

evil". Perhaps one day man may learn from monkeys. But,

seriously,   whether  it  is  corruption,  gangsterism,

robbery  or any other crime or wrong-doing, it is  only

on  evidence  that one should act, and, before  acting.

may  I  suggest  that  a critical appraisal  is  highly

desirable? The police do investigate rumours  and  when

what  appears to be information is given by  apparently

responsible   persons - Members   of   this   House   and

others - the   police  investigate.  But   sometimes   it

transpires,  as I know well from papers  I  have  seen,

that the information is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3125</b></font><br><br>



rumour  and  I  have known occasions  when  a  critical

appraisal of a rumour resulted in the person  who  gave

the  information realising that he was  merely  wasting

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criticism of the Corrupt Practices Investigation

Bureau   has   been  that  the  junior   officers   are

transferred if they offend their seniors. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  that  is  not  so. I have, in the  course  of  my

duties,  had  a  good  deal  to  do  with  the  Corrupt

Practices  Investigation Bureau. I have  seen  some  of

their successes and I have seen many of their failures,

or what are judged to be failures. Not always were they

placid  about  it.  I  am satisfied  that  the  present

arrangement,  whereby the Bureau is kept separate  from

the  main  police  force  and  whereby  its  staff  are

specially  chosen  from  the resources  of  the  police

force, works well. There is no danger in that Bureau of

a  junior officer failing in his duty because  what  he

has to enquire into concerns some senior officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, thank God, only on evidence that we administer

the  criminal  law  of this colony, and  if  that  were

remembered, it would help. Whether the hon. Member  for

Tiong  Bahru has ever seen a gang fight, I do not know,

but  I  do not recall his having given evidence. It  is

people  who  are  able to give evidence  in  court  who

should go and report to the police, and if those people

will report to the police, then the police will produce

the results that the critics are asking for. It is very

easy  to  criticise, but it is not always easy  to  get

results, and if the people who are capable of producing

those results will come forward, then the present  wave

of  gangsterism will cease. Corruption and  gangsterism

go  together.  Loose  talk about  either  is  extremely

dangerous. Only evidence is valid. There is  no  cause,

in  my opinion, to interfere with the estimates of  the

police  so  far  as the Corrupt Practices Investigation

Bureau is affected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my hon. colleague has

taken out of my mouth some of the words which I wish to

say in connection with the Corrupt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3126</b></font><br><br>



Practices Investigation Bureau and with the question of

evidence and information to be given to the police.  In

the  circumstances, I would only like to reiterate what

I said last Friday, Sir, that the word of the police in

combating  crime  and  gangsterism  can  be  much  more

effective  if  they  receive an increasing  measure  of

support, information and co-operation from the  public.

The  Government is also giving active consideration  to

other measures to meet the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to refute a statement made by the

Member for Serangoon when he said that the Gambling Sub-branch  has closed down. It is still functioning,  Sir,

and working as hard as ever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also deny the sweeping allegation that police

officers  and detectives are at the beck  and  call  of

secret societies. If the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru is

aware of such individual cases, perhaps he would let me

or the Commissioner of Police have the information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say, in reply to the Member for

Tiong Bahru, that the police do not lock up persons  of

tender age who have been detained for questioning. None

of  the boys of such tender age - I think the Member  for

Tiong Bahru did mention some boys of 11 or 12 years  of

age - if they are detained, are locked up. They are  only

brought  to  the  station if  they  are  seen  to  have

committed an offence or if they are found apparently to

be  in need of care and attention, and they are left in

the  charge  of a police officer in the police  station

until  their  parents have been traced or they  can  be

lodged in the Social Welfare Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Hon.

the  Chief Secretary has misunderstood me when he  says

that  teenagers have been locked up in police stations.

I  said  the  police  made use of  section  12  of  the

Ordinance  to arrest these young people and  they  were

detained  in  the police station. But there  have  been

cases  where children from the age of 18 and above  had

been  detained in the police station for 24 hours.  The

next morning these people were brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3127</b></font><br><br>



to  the  C.I.D. for screening, and I wish to point  out

that  most of them were innocent. Many of them had been

brutally assaulted by the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore the Hon. the Chief Secretary says that he

wants  co-operation from members of the  public.  How?

There  are  many instances where members of the  public

went  to see the police about certain things that  were

happening in their area. These same people were  called

up  by  the  police  again  and  again  and  they  were

questioned  and questioned and questioned. If  that  is

the  treatment meted out to such informants,  who  will

come  forward  to  give evidence, particularly  in  the

courts?  unless Government is prepared  to  set  up  an

independent  body  which will collect information  from

members  of  the public, then no one will come  forward

with  information they have. For example there are gang

fights  all over the city. You have read in the papers,

Sir,  that so many people have witnessed these  fights,

and yet when the police come out to investigate, no one

steps  forward to give evidence. Why? Because  they  do

not  have faith in the police. As I earlier said today,

Sir,  unless we have an Anti-Corruption Bureau  managed

and  staffed  by  an independent body  of  people  with

executive   powers,  no  member  of  the  public   will

voluntarily and gladly step forward to give evidence so

that steps can be taken to stamp out such practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the police force there are certain senior police

officers.  Their subordinates profess  to  have  senior

officers in the police department as godfathers.  These

people,  in  turn,  protect the gangsters,  the  secret

societies  and other criminals because they  know  some

one  is behind them. That is why they are so brave.  If

we  have  an  independent Anti-Corruption Bureau  which

will  take steps to stamp out such misdeeds, then I  am

sure  members of the public will come forward not  only

in hundreds but in thousands to give evidence.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, I totally deny that the people have

been  brutally  assaulted by the police in  the  police

stations. I would also like to ask the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3128</b></font><br><br>



Tiong  Bahru whether he thinks that youths of  over  18

years of age can be termed children of tender age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Lee

Kuan Yew:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 15 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (48) of subhead I therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr Lee Kuan Yew's absence, the amendment was not

proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Time is running short, Sir, and

with the permission of the House, I should like to take

my three amendments together - i.e., amendment (iii):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 15 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (53) of subhead 1 therein;



<br><br>amendment (iv):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 15 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (54) of subhead 1 therein;



<br><br>and amendment (v):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 15 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 35 therein.



<br><br>All  these  three amendments refer to  testers  in  the

police force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (53) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Testers, two [$600]



<br><br>and item (54) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testers, twelve [$445-15A-550].



<br><br>I  find there is an increase of two testers compared to

last  year's  estimate and not only that, I  also  find

that   the  salary  scale  for  the  testers  is   also

increased.  The maximum salary of the testers  in  last

year's  estimate  was $500. This year  the  maximum  is

increased  to $550. Sir, the difference in the  maximum

salary between a senior tester and a tester is only $50

this year, whereas last year it was $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a tester or a senior tester is chosen for his

integrity   before   he  is  appointed,   because   the

appointment  is  open to corruption  and  bribery,  and

unless a man of high integrity is appointed, he will be

open to corruption and be tempted to accept bribery. If

a  tester is not adequately paid, or if a senior tester

is  not  fully paid, definitely he will find  ways  and

means of accepting bribery. A gap of $50 in the maximum

salary between a senior tester



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3129</b></font><br><br>



and  a tester is really, may I say, irrelevant because,

as  the senior tester, he will experience heart-burning

to see that his junior receives only $50 less than what

he  actually receives at the maximum. How would we like

to  have a junior man who has just come up to a certain

stage  where  his salary is only a few dollars  less - in

this case it is a difference of $50'?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the question of temporary testers, we are

going  to  have 12. I wonder how many applications  for

driving  licences are outstanding so  far?  The  reason

given for recruiting these 12 temporary testers is that

they  are  "Required to clear a backlog of applications

for  driving tests." I said last year that the  present

system  of dealing with applications for driving  tests

was  most unsatisfactory. I suggested a system  whereby

such  tests could be carried out at a much faster  rate

than  with the present system. But during all these  12

months,  Government  has  not  taken  the  trouble   to

consider my suggestion to improve the present system of

testing. Now we have a backlog and we are committed  to

another  $82,800  by  having to  recruit  12  temporary

testers. It is just a waste of money. If Government had

taken  my  suggestion  into consideration,  this  money

would have been saved.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is "That the sum to be

allotted  for Head 15 be reduced by $10 in  respect  of

item  (53) of subhead 1 therein." Discussion may  range

over the next two amendments, i.e. amendments (iv)  and

(v). The Chief Secretary has half a minute to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since you say I have

half  a minute, I would like to point out that the  two

new posts of testers have been provided for the testing

of  drivers of public service vehicles which from  1958

onwards  will be the responsibility of the  police  and

not  the  City  Council. The 12 temporary  testers  are

appointed   on  similar  salaries  to  those   of   the

established staff and provision is made for an increase

of  six temporary testers. They are meant to cope  with

the  waiting  list  of applicants  desirous  of  taking

driving tests, and they run into thousands. Sir.  These

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3130</b></font><br><br>



include  those  who have not had a test and  those  who

have  failed  in a previous test and who wish  to  take

another  one.  The  very  heavy traffic  congestion  on

Singapore  roads  makes  it imperative  that  the  high

standard of testing will not be dropped irrespective of

the percentage of failures.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $25,909,380 for Head 15 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3130</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 16 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 16 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 13 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this subhead I find that we are asked to provide

$44,000  for  "Miscellaneous Fittings  for  Machinery".

Sir, the word "Miscellaneous" is such a vague term that

we do not know what in fact it means.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The notice of amendment is in

respect  of  subhead  13  of  Head  16,  which  is  for

"Miscellaneous Fittings for Machinery - $5,000".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. Yes, it is

$5,000 and not $44,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the word "Miscellaneous" is a wide and vague

term  and  unless details are given, I  wonder  how  we

could  be  asked  to approve a vote of $5,000  for  the

purchase   of  miscellaneous  fittings  for  machinery.

Unless  the  Financial Secretary can qualify  the  word

"Miscellaneous", I think it is rather serious to pass a

block  vote. I call it a block vote in this case rather

than an actual individual vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, certain of the

printing  machines  in the Government  Printing  Office

were purchased at a time when the automatic spacing  of

type  was impossible and the spacing of every line  had

to  be  done  by  hand. Equipment is now  available  to

enable the spacing to be done automatically,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3131</b></font><br><br>



and one of the main machines in the Printing Department

has  not  yet  been converted by the addition  of  this

equipment. This fitting of automatic spacing  equipment

will  very considerably increase the speed of  printing

operation and will enable this machine to increase  its

output considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again at that time no equipment was available in the

Printing  Office for the automatic typesetting  of  the

French  language,  or  indeed  of  any  language  which

involves  the  printing of accents above  the  letters.

Equipment is available now to add to existing machinery

which   would  enable  this  operation   to   be   done

automatically.  The  Member  for  Queens-town  will  be

wondering why we want to have automatic typesetting  in

the  French language. The reason is that the Government

Printer is being called upon to produce printed  matter

in   French,  as  a  result  of  certain  international

conferences  which  are  held  from  time  to  time  in

Singapore,  for example, U.N.E.S.C.O..  W.H.O. and  so

forth. These proceedings are reported in French as well

as in English. It is therefore desirable that automatic

setting in French should be possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown will also see that in the

Estimates  this  subhead  has  against  it  the  remark

"Subject  to  Treasury sanction",  and  the  Government

Printer  will  therefore  be required  to  satisfy  the

Treasury  that any proposed purchase of equipment  will

be of an economical nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 16 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 19 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in subhead 19 we are asked to provide 73

typewriters at a cost of $28,110. I wonder if the Chief

Secretary  can  tell us what has happened  to  the  old

typewriters.  The  explanation given  at  the  footnote

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Replacement of typewriters for the following

departments:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Education

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Social Welfare

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Malayan Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3132</b></font><br><br>



If   typewriters   are   required   for   these   three

departments, why has not a vote been put into their own

Ministry  rather than in the Printing Office? What  has

the   Printing  Office  got  to  do  with  these  three

departments?   If   individual   departments    require

typewriters - and I am sure they have typewriters now - why

do  they  want  more typewriters then? Is the  Printing

Office  functioning as a central supply  pool  for  the

three departments concerned?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to refer

the  Member for Queenstown to the explanation given  in

page  448  of  the  Estimates in connection  with  this

subhead. The explanation given there is quite clear.  I

do not know whether the Member for Queenstown has seen

it or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is too much for him!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,841,960 for Head 16 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3132</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 17 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 17 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 12 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footnote to this item says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Increase required for emergency stocks."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now no reason was given in last year's estimate that we

should carry emergency stocks. I wonder why this  year,

particularly  where  rations are concerned,  we  should

carry emergency stocks. Is there an emergency on? Or is

there  a war on that the Prison Department should carry

emergency  stocks as reserve in case they will  not  be

able  to purchase rations anywhere? If not, why  should

we  have to vote another $5,000 extra compared to  last

year's estimate for emergency stocks?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an increase of $5,000

is  asked  for rations in order that the Superintendent

may purchase a reserve of iron rations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3133</b></font><br><br>



At  the  present time rations are brought daily to  the

prison and, in the event of any emergency, such as, for

example, transport strikes, there would be no  food  in

the prison. The amount asked for would be sufficient to

supply  approximately 48 hours' rations for the  normal

inmate  population and would ensure that the  prisoners

would not go short of food in an emergency.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, would it be in order if I were

to  ask  the  Chief Secretary what type of rations  are

supplied  to  political  prisoners  and  what  is   the

treatment they receive?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rations for

detainees  are  considerably  better  than  those   for

convicted  prisoners. For convicted  persons  I  cannot

give offhand the details of their rations. In addition,

the  detainees are allowed to purchase food through the

Superintendent,  or they can get additional  food  from

their  relatives.  This privilege is  not  extended  to

ordinary  convicted  persons. Perhaps  the  Member  for

Telok Ayer already knows that there are seven types  of

diet  in  the  prison - Chinese,  Malay,  Tamil,  Brahim,

Pathan, European and detainees' diet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> The Chief Secretary says that he

anticipates  a  transport strike and that  is  why  the

provision  of $5,000 is required to purchase  emergency

rations.  Is  it the Government's policy to  anticipate

strikes  all  the  time?  If  so,  why  only  on   this

particular item of rations, and not on others?  If  the

Government  does anticipate strikes of this  nature  or

that nature, then let it provide emergency rations  for

all items rather than one particular item only?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 17 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 52 therein.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3134</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 52 (1) concerns City Services. Last year I

criticised  very  strongly  the  extravagance  of   the

Government  in  the  matter  of  city  services.  These

services, I understand, are for electricity consumed by

this  department.  What I see now  is  an  increase  of

$23,000  a year for electrical consumption. This  works

out  roughly at slightly less than $2,000 a  month.  Is

the  department  going to consume  slightly  less  than

$2,000  of  electricity a month, which works out  again

roughly at 10,000 units? In most other departments they

do  not  require so much electricity under the head  of

City  Services, and I have not attacked any  of  those,

but  I  wish to draw attention to this particular  case

because  it  is  too  big  an  increase.  Normally  the

increases range between $3,000 and $5,000 or $1,000 and

$2,000.  But  in this particular case, it  is  $23,000.

This  is  rather a substantial figure. It is no  wonder

that  we  have the Budget Estimates showing  a  deficit

every year!



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the demand for city

services  certainly  does not  cover  only  electricity

services. There are also other city services.  However,

in  connection with city services of electricity,  Sir,

modernisation  has been carried out this  year  in  the

laundry  and carpentry shops at Changi Prison  and  new

and  more efficient machinery has been installed,  with

the  result that there has been an increase  in  output

and  an  increase in the amount of electricity required

for  the operation of this machinery. The laundry  shop

at  Changi  Prison  undertakes laundering  for  Kandang

Kerbau  and  Tan Tock Seng Hospitals and for government

bungalows  at Changi, in addition to the laundering  of

uniforms of the prison staff. May I also refer  to  the

next  amendment of the Member for Queenstown  which  I

think is related-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 17 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 73 therein?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Item (2) of subhead 73 also refers to

laundries,  Sir.  The  prison  laundry  undertakes  the

laundering of all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3135</b></font><br><br>



hospital  linen, with the exception of staff  uniforms,

and  the  uniforms of all government  staff,  with  the

exception  of  the  police.  It  also  undertakes   the

laundering of Government House linen. In fact, Sir, the

revenue  derived  by  the Prison Department  from  this

laundering aspect of the prison industry, in so far  as

government services are concerned, amounts to, I think,

more than $200,000 a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Chief

Secretary  has  already dealt with my  next  amendment,

that is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 17 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 73 therein.



<br><br>may I have the permission of the House to withdraw it?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No permission is required if the hon.

Member does not move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $3,524,450 for Head 17 stand part of

the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

discuss  the  policy of this head of Prisons.  We  have

just  heard our Hon. the Chief Secretary say that  they

have  seven types of food for the prisoners.  I  wonder

whether  they  allow  Chinese  prisoners  to  choose  a

European diet. I have been approached by a prisoner,  a

Chinese. He suffered from a certain stomach ailment and

he  asked me to approach the prison authorities to  see

if  they would allow him to have a European diet,  They

said   however,  that  unless  he  had   the   doctor's

recommendation,  his  request would  be  rejected.  The

doctor  refused to consider his request and said,  "No,

you  are  a Chinese, so you must take Chinese food."  I

wish to raise this question, Sir, because I learn there

are  different  rates of expenditure  for  the  various

diets.  Since the Government supply different kinds  of

food,  I wish to know whether they will consider having

the  same rate of expenditure for them all. At  present

European food costs more than any other food.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3136</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish to touch on the treatment of

political  banishers. I understand that they have  been

treated as criminals and are given convicts' food. Also

they  have to mix with the convicts and they are always

bullied  by  them.  I  wish the  Chief  Secretary  will

investigate their cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to touch upon is the Opium

Treatment Centre. If the Government are of the  opinion

that  this  Centre  has produced wonderful  results  by

effecting many cures, cannot they separate it from  the

Prison  Authority  and  make it  an  independent  body?

Because the Opium Treatment Centre is under the control

of  the  Prison  Authority, many opium addicts  do  not

volunteer  to get admitted into it to undergo  a  cure.

They feel a certain stigma is attached to the fact that

they  are inmates of this Centre, and people will  say,

"Oh,  you  are  a prisoner" Many hon. Members  made  an

inspection of the Opium Treatment Centre about  a  year

ago  and I am sure most of them were impressed with the

way it is run and the results achieved by it. Therefore

I  wish  to put forward two suggestions: one, that  the

Government  consider separating the  Centre  from  tile

Prisons  Authority; two, this centre be open to members

of  the  public, even though they are not convicted  of

opium smoking, to receive free treatment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, with regard to the first point

raised  by the Member for Changi, the present procedure

is that, if a Chinese prisoner is to state a preference

for  a  European diet, an officer of the Social Welfare

Department  is  sent  to the prisoner's  house  to  see

whether he does, in fact, take European food; and if he

does, he will get European food. But if he does not, he

will  get Chinese food unless, as the Member for Changi

says,  he  is, on medical advice, to be given  European

food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, Sir, I can say straightaway - it

might  satisfy  the  Member for  Changi - that  political

banishers do get the same sort of food as detainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Opium Treatment Centre, Sir, this

serves  a  very  useful purpose and  there  is  general

agreement, which is supported by the World Health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3137</b></font><br><br>



Organisation,  the Narcotics Commission of  the  United

Nations,  visiting  justices  and  other  distinguished

visitors,  that this centre does serve  a  very  useful

purpose and the success which it has achieved would  be

a justification for its continued existence. Government

is  now  giving  active consideration to  the  question

whether  it  should continue in existence  for  another

year or whether it is to become a permanent department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  the matter of food, prisoners should be allowed  to

ask  for any food they like. I am a Chinese but I  like

food with plenty of chillies in it!



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just a point of

information. The banishers at present detained  in  the

Outram  Road  Prison  complain  that  they  receive   a

different type of food from the detainees and  now  the

Chief  Secretary  confirms that they receive  the  same

type.  Will  you  please help me to  investigate  their

cases?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is asking the Speaker

to  get  into  prison? The hon. Member  was  using  the

second  person. I just remarked that the Speaker  would

like to keep away from prison!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment I am trying to get some

information  from  the  Chief  Secretary.  I  find   an

increase  of $9,500 has been provided for printing  and

stationery, and the reason given is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Increase required to cover tuition fees for five

officers studying languages."



<br><br>Sir,  for  just  five officers studying languages,  you

require another $9,500 for stationery alone.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the lighting must be

ineffective in that part of the Assembly where the hon.

Member  is  sitting. What I see is note  (iii)  reading

"increase  estimated from 1956/57 expenditure."  Am  I

right?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> You are right, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I tender my apologies again, Sir.

I  will  not  blame  the lighting. I  should  blame  my

spectacles - it  is  bifocal.  Sir,  the  note  says  the

increase  is  estimated from 1956/57 expenditure.  Even

then,  I  say  that $9,500 is too big an  increase  for

stationery  and  printing alone.  What  I  want  is  an

explanation from the Chief Secretary giving details  of

the printing and stationery required.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the figure covers all

printing  done  for  the Statistics Department  by  the

Government  Printer and this increase  is  due  to  the

publication  for  the first time in  1957  of  separate

lists   of   trade   statistics  for   Singapore,   and

continuation  of this publication in 1958 will  require

the  increase asked for. It has in fact been  estimated

by the Government Printer himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,567,510 for Head 19 stand part of

the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday

morning the Government had been receiving attack  after

attack  from the Opposition. In this particular case  I

am  going  to offer a bouquet to this Department,  Sir,

especially where the statistics are concerned.  Had  it

not  been for the efficiency of this Department,  I  am

afraid  we  would not be able to have our City  Council

election this month. I believe the Department has  been

working  under  heavy pressure to bring  the  electoral

rolls into being in order that we will be able to  have

the City Council election this month. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3139</b></font><br><br>



if  the  electoral rolls had not been ready, then  the

life  of the City Council would have to be extended.  I

have   already  heard  much  criticism  in  this  House

regarding  the extension of the term of office  of  the

City  Councillors. I am now happy that there is no mole

extension  and  that  the term of office  of  the  City

Councillors  will last only three more  days.  So  good

luck to the City Council!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 25 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b>-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be reduced by

$10,000 in respect of subhead 2 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 8 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr Lee Kuan Yew's absence, the amendments were

not proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 24 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I am not in fact

against  the  vote itself. What I see  now  is  a  very

substantial increase of $336,000 for the Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association. In fact, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3140</b></font><br><br>



think the bigger the increase the better it is, because

we  are trying to eradicate T.B. in Singapore. But what

I  am  most  surprised is this - that the Government  has

anticipated  this  increase in the  vote,  so  it  does

anticipate  that there will be a higher  rate  of  T.B.

cases  next  year. If this is not so, then  why  should

there  be  an  increase in the vote? If the  Government

really  anticipates a higher rate of  T.B. cases  next

year, then what has it done about this disease which is

a  very  dangerous one? Has it done anything to prevent

the spread of this disease, or is it just doing nothing

but anticipating that there will be more cases and more

money therefore is required?



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> The

increased  provision is required because  the  cost  of

treatment    by    the    Singapore   Anti-Tuberculosis

Association  has increased. Hitherto we have  paid  the

Association  $27 per head per month in respect  of  all

acute  cases  and  $9 in respect of all  chronic  cases

treated  by the Association. Representations have  been

made  by  the Association, Sir, to the effect that  the

cost of treatment has gone up and that, in view of  the

advances which have been made in medical science, it is

no   longer  possible  to  differentiate  between   the

treatment for acute cases and the treatment for chronic

cases.  We have therefore budgeted for an allowance  in

1958  of  $30  per  head per month  for  all  patients.

Further  provision has been made for the rehabilitation

of certain T.B. patients by S.A.T.A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakdown in figures, Sir, is that S.A.T.A. will

treat  on  our  behalf  1,400 patients  per  month  and

rehabilitate 50 patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would repeat, Sir, that the increase is

necessitated by an increase in treatment fees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said

earlier,  I  am  not against this vote;  neither  am  I

against  the increase in the provision. What I want  is

information  and  since  an explanation  has  now  been

given,  may  I  have the permission  of  the  House  to

withdraw my amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3141</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be reduced by

$12,700 in respect of subhead 32 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am all in favour of charity. But our procedure

is  laid  down in such a way that in order to  initiate

discussion I have to choose certain items and ask for a

deletion or a reduction in their votes, and I find that

for  my  discussion  this seems to be  the  appropriate

subhead. I understand from you, Sir, that we cannot ask

for  a new grant, according to the procedure laid down.

The  only  thing for a Member of the Assembly therefore

to  do  is  this:  to  voice his feelings  against  the

unfairness  of  Government  in  not  giving  grants  to

certain deserving cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have chosen for discussion subhead

32-Ecclesiastical Grants. I do not know what it  means.

I  think  an  explanation was given last  year,  but  I

forgot what it was all about and I will be happy if the

Hon. the Financial Secretary will kindly explain again

what   is   the  meaning  of  "Ecclesiastical  Grants".

However, even before hearing his explanation,  I  think

it refers to a grant to a particular religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has no acknowledged State religion.

The  people may have their own religion, but the  State

of  Singapore  has  no religion of its  own.  That  was

confirmed  in the last Budget. But I still see  at  the

Cenotaph  services  that many  heads  of  religion  are

called to say prayers. Even at the installation of  our

new  Governor  the other day, prayers were  read  by  a

priest of a certain Christian denomination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know what "Ecclesiastical Grants"

means.  When you are making this grant of $12,700,  why

do  you  not give grants to various other bodies  which

are  more  deserving? Why deny them? You  are  spending

millions  of dollars on defence. You are just  spending

money  on  behalf of one section and not on Singapore's

own  use,  and  that has been passed by the  Government

with  the aid of the Nominated Members and ex-officios.

The Press reports that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3142</b></font><br><br>



every vote is passed. But how? With whose votes? It  is

not the majority of elected Members who have passed it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to my subject - the Chinese Young Men's

Christian  Association. They have asked for  help  from

the  Government but I do not see even a mention of  any

grant to them. Sir, the Chinese form 80 per cent of the

population  of  Singapore. I believe religion  is  very

necessary for every human being. If a body such as  the

Chinese Young Men's Christian Association has spent  so

much  money  to give recreation and to show  the  right

path to youngsters, does it not deserve such help?



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in last years Budget, when we were granting a

dollar  for a dollar towards the building of the  Young

Women's  Christian Association, I raised this point.  I

was  not against it. What I said was "If you are making

grants,  please do the same for other causes which  may

come before you." The Young Men's Christian Association

have  spent  much  money. The opening ceremony  of  the

building  was  performed  by  the  last  Governor,  His

Excellency  Sir  Robert Black. They are  now  short  of

$350,000. A deaf ear has been turned to their  request.

Why?  Sir,  whatever  may  be  said  about  my  present

amendment  to  this vote, it will be passed.  It  is  a

tragic affair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an equally good cause is the Ramakrishna

Mission. I raised this point last year and I understood

the  reply was that consideration would be given. I  do

not  see any grant to them. Sir, I would like to  point

out  that  grants had been given from year to  year  to

this  body.  This was removed by the present  Coalition

Government. Sir, the Ramakrishna Mission is established

to  do  social work without any discrimination of caste

and creed. No grant has been made to them this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another cause, the Sultan Mosque, the

only big mosque of the Muslims in this City. It is also

historical.  The  Sultan Mosque  required  money.  They

approached the Government, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3143</b></font><br><br>



I  do  not think any grant has been given to them. Sir,

to the Muslims, their mosque is very important, just as

the  temple  or church is to others. If  one  cause  is

given  preferential treatment, I do not think we should

tolerate that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about the Young Men's Muslim Association, if

they put up a building, to give a grant of a dollar for

a  dollar.  I have not heard about this project  and  I

have nothing to say at present about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when you are spending, as I have said, so many

millions of dollars on useless projects - I include  also

broadcasting to a certain extent because it should be a

productive project but it is not help should  also  be

given  to  worthwhile causes which  help  to  keep  our

children  on the right path - give them recreation,  keep

their minds occupied, and prevent them from going  into

wrong  hands - and yet Government has turned an  utterly

deaf  ear to their appeals. Therefore, Sir, I move this

amendment, not that I am against this grant but I think

it is not fair that this one particular religion should

be selected for this grant and others are not. I should

like to hear more about what this item means.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The hon. Member for Telok Ayer has raised a

number  of questions. The first question refers to  the

grant  amounting  to  $12,700  which  is  paid  to  St.

Andrew's  Cathedral. Singapore was founded in 1819.  It

may  well  be  that the Colonial Estimates supported  a

chaplain  before 1834, but 1834 is the earliest  record

where  I  can  find  of the appearance  of  a  Colonial

Chaplain on the establishment of the colony. From  that

date  until 1929 the post of Colonial Chaplain remained

on  the colonial establishment. In the early days,  the

Government employed a Chaplain of its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latterly however the Archdeacon of Singapore

officiated  as  Colonial Chaplain. Provision  was  also

made  in  the  estimates for recurrent  expenditure  in

connection with the duties of the Colonial Chaplain.  A

grant  was  also  made towards the Bishopric  Endowment

Fund. In 1930 it was decided to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3144</b></font><br><br>



abolish the post of Colonial Chaplain and to pay to the

St.  Andrew's  Cathedral the sum of  $12,700  of  which

$4,300  was  in  respect  of  a  contribution  to   the

Bishopric Endowment Fund and the balance was in respect

of  the  salary of the Archdeacon. I have given careful

thought to the matter but I confess that I can  see  no

real  reason why the grant should be discontinued  now.

At  the same time, I can see no reason - there may  well

be   reasons,  but  I  can  see  none - why   we   should

discontinue  the present practice of not making  direct

financial     contributions    to    other    religious

organisations  of  which there are  very  many  in  the

colony. It is incorrect to say that we do not give them

assistance. Through the Social Welfare Department  vote

for  assistance to Voluntary Institutions for Children.

we    make   substantial   contributions   to   various

organisations, one of which is the Ramakrishna Mission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Chinese Young Men's Christian

Association,  Sir, we have received an application  for

financial  assistance. They appeared to have  proceeded

with  the  construction of their new  premises  without

ascertaining  what funds were likely  to  be  available

beforehand, and they are now overdrawn to the extent of

$320,000.  Their  application for assistance  is  under

consideration at the present moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Young Women's Christian Association was

mentioned,  Sir,  as  having been the  recipient  of  a

dollar  for  dollar grant last year. The case  of  this

particular  association raised special  problems  which

Government considered to require special consideration.

In the end a grant was made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am aware, no application has been

received  from the Ramakrishna Mission,  nor  from  the

Sultan   Mosque,  nor  from  the  Young  Men's   Muslim

Association for any capital assistance.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Hon. The Financial

Secretary  has  explained  that  the  application   for

financial   assistance  of  the  Chinese  Young   Men's

Christian Association is under consideration. It is now

nearly a year and they have been paying interest  which

could have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3145</b></font><br><br>



very   easily  saved  if  Government  had  given  their

application earlier consideration. I hope that it  will

be  treated  on  the same basis as that  of  the  Young

Women's  Christian  Association and that  the  decision

will be favourable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think not all the applications for grants have

come to the notice of the Financial Secretary. A letter

was  sent to him by the Trustees of the Sultan  Mosque,

and  I received a copy. If the Financial Secretary  has

not  seen  it, I will try and produce a copy  tomorrow.

The letter may have escaped his attention and gone into

a  pigeonhole. I hope, by raising this enquiry, he will

take  action  with his department and have  the  letter

placed before him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Ramakrishna Mission, Sir, if my memory

serves,  I  think  they  have  also  written   to   the

Government  and I have received a copy,  and  I  cannot

understand  why the head of a department does  not  get

the  letters when they are addressed to him.  There  is

something  wrong  with  the  department.  I  hope   the

Financial  Secretary  will  be  able  to  trace   those

letters. If he likes, I will try and produce copies  to

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary spoke about the

Ecclesiastical Grants and that they dated back to  such

and  such a year. We are not at all concerned with  how

long they were dated back. Why should they be continued

if we are not giving the same type of grants to others?

Either  he  stops them or he gives grants to others  on

the same basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask: Are you spending any money yearly on

the  repair of St. Andrew's Cathedral? If so, where  is

the  vote  put down? St. Andrew's Cathedral  is  not  a

public  building  for  public  use,  but  I  understand

definitely that money is being spent on it. If so,  why

has  no money been granted to the Sultan Mosque? It  is

of  equal  importance to others. I do not say that  you

should not spend money on religious organisations,  but

do not discriminate one against the other.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to

the  Ramakrishna Mission, they made an  application  to

the Social Welfare Department for an annual grant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3146</b></font><br><br>



of  $20,000. The Director of Social Welfare has written

to  the  Mission and has asked for further information,

but so far it has not been supplied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be reduced by

$120,000 in respect of subhead 33 therein.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have chosen this subhead because certain

grants have not been made. Sir, Members on this side of

the  House - I  do  not know whether the Government  side

have  received  it - have received  a  letter  signed  by

various   Christian  organisations,  maybe   they   are

Catholic  bodies-that  it is against  their  conscience

that  a grant to the Family Planning Association should

be  made  from the revenue of the Colony of which  they

are  the  taxpayers.  Sir, if I  may  be  permitted  to

mention it, we have received the Seventh Annual  Report

of  the  F.P.A. and  also  a  letter  with  statistics

attached  to  it.  Sir,  in  the  past  I  have  always

abstained from voting on this vexed question of  giving

a  grant  to  the F.P.A. On the one hand, we  have  the

argument  from some organisations that they are  paying

taxes,  and why should their money be spent on  certain

projects  which  are against their religion  and  their

conscience?  And they have approached us  and  told  us

that, as Assemblymen, we should respect their feelings.

Sir,  these organisations definitely state that  it  is

against their faith that artificial means be applied to

prevent birth. Sir, the Muslim religion, too, lays down

that  their followers should not adopt any means  which

are  against  their religion to prevent birth;  but  it

does  lay  down  that  it  is necessary,  in  order  to

safeguard  the life of a woman, to seek medical  advice

and take steps to save.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Family Planning Organisation, there are

many countries where this kind of association is run on

a  voluntary basis without a government grant.  I  have

personally no hard and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3147</b></font><br><br>



fast views about it. I have here a Report of the F.P.A.

dated 31st December, 1956. The grant to be given by the

Government is $120,000 compared to $100,000 last  year.

Sir,  I  see plenty of names on the front page of  this

Report - patrons, vice-patrons and committee members  and

so on. The subscription collected is only $1,118. Their

expenditure  has been $149,000. On the other  hand,  we

gave   $100,000  last  year.  In  other   words,   this

Association is run on a government grant.  If  that  is

so,  I would like to find out why the Government should

not  run  it  themselves. Sir, as I  said,  if  various

bodies are not given grants then they should be given a

grant.  I  wonder why a grant to the F.P.A. should  be

given  at  all.  I want to hear the arguments  on  this

vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is "That the sum to be

allotted for Head 25 be reduced by $120,000 in  respect

of  subhead 33 therein." Hon. Members will have noticed

that  there is a similar amendment in the name  of  Mr

Goh Tong Liang.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I do not want to speak at

length  on the pros and cons of the work of the  Family

Planning  Association, or whether, from  the  religious

viewpoint, the F.P.A. is the right course of  approach.

But  the  Member for Telok Ayer has raised a  point  of

principle - that  taxes paid by certain sections  of  the

people  should not be spent on anything that is against

the  principles of their religion. If we  stretch  that

principle, Sir, we could stretch it to immense  limits.

Muslims   could  object  to  expenditure  incurred   by

Ministers on supplying drinks to their guests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a certain sect called Jains in India. They

walk  barefooted in order not to crush ants. Sir, these

people  could  object  to  the  provision  of  two  dog

shooters   in  the  Veterinary  Department   estimates,

because  that  is wilfully destroying  dogs.  Also,  of

course,  there will be objection to the eradication  of

malaria-breeding mosquitoes because you  kill  millions

of mosquitoes. So I think that is a dangerous principle

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3148</b></font><br><br>



the House to accept. Of course, the other arguments are

matters for Members to consider.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, before the debate on

this subject gets into its full stride, I would like to

announce  that,  as in previous years,  the  Government

side  is  given  a  free vote.  This  is  a  matter  of

conscience.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last

year we spent several hours discussing this subject.  I

hope  Members  will take the opportunity,  between  the

adjournment  in  the  next few minutes  and  tomorrow's

sitting, to look through what was said last year and do

not  try  to  repeat their arguments, because  time  is

valuable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in this large volume

which I have brought in with me from the library of the

Assembly, there is shown the approximate population  in

the  world  from the years 1650 to 1953.  In  1650  the

total world population, as estimated and running to the

nearest million, was 550 million people. However,  that

was  a long time ago. We jump forward to 1900 and  find

the  population  then was 1,600 million,  that  is,  57

years  ago. We jump forward to 1939-39 years  later - and

find the population then was 2,240 million; an increase

of 640 million, which is a very considerable jump in 39

years.  When  we look from 1939 to 1953, a  further  14

years,  the  population then was 2,620  million,  or  a

further  increase of 380 million, more  than  half  the

increase in the previous 39 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that increase has taken place very largely in

Asian  countries.  They  are  of  course  estimates  of

population, because in most of these countries there is

no  sufficient standard for them to say precisely  what

the  population is or was at a particular time  because

they   have   no   civil  service  to  do   a   census.

Nevertheless,  on  the  basis  of  these  figures,  the

population of Asia, excluding the Soviet Union parts of

Asia, was only 905 million in 1900 and has now gone  up

to  1,437 million - an up of over 500 million - which is an

enormous  increase, and a very large lump of the  total

world increase over that period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in present

terms  family planning as it is practised now  has  any

very  significant effect on the total output of babies.

It has perhaps a significant effect on upper and middle

class  families where there are some arguments to  show

that  those  in the car-owning class, from one  car  to

five or six cars, do, in fact, limit their families and

keep the population down - whether by family planning  or

whether  because  they  are too busy  making  money  to

divert themselves in this way, I cannot say. But as far

as  the general mass of the population is concerned,  I

do  not think it is very significant from the point  of

view of population increase at present. What I think is

this: that we must fully accept the principle of family

planning  because  the  time may come  when  techniques

which  are of mass application may be devised and  then

they  can  be  used to stop the terrifying pressure  on

resources which is taking place in the world today  and

which  is shown by the figures I have quoted. For those

reasons,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I do  feel  that  we  must

support this vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully agree

with  the Deputy Speaker that we should not repeat what

was said last year. So we did not have a lengthy speech

from  our schoolmaster, Mr Francis Thomas. But I could

not agree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3150</b></font><br><br>



with  his  argument on the population increase  figure.

One  thing, Sir, - we should be confident of the  future.

This  is  the age of Sputniks. [Interruption.]  We  are

going to conquer space! If I am not mistaken, the Prime

Minister  of  the United Kingdom has said that  we  can

expect to extract power from the sea. We do not have to

rely only on petrol and coal, because now we live in an

age  of  scientific advancement. Therefore I wish  hon.

Members to have confidence in our future-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee

and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I beg to report that the Committee of

Supply have made progress on the Appropriation Bill and

ask leave to sit again tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Tomorrow it will be.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That the Assembly do now adjourn."-[The

Chief Minister].
