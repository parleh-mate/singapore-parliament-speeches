  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Education what is the progress of the establishment of a Singapore International School in Hong Kong and what are the plans to establish
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> such schools in other cities such as Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, London, Beijing and Shanghai where there is sufficient demand for schools for children of Singaporeans working abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore International School in Hong Kong was opened in September 1991 and for the first four years it functioned in temporary premises at Kennedy Town. In August 1995, it moved into its new premises in Aberdeen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September 1995, the enrolment of primary school pupils was 523. Of these, 274 or 52% are Singapore citizens, and 100 or 19% are Singapore permanent residents making a total of 71% Singapore citizens and permanent residents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school offers a Singapore primary school curriculum and prepares pupils for our Primary School Leaving Examination. The school is staffed by 36 teaching staff. Of these, 17 are recruited from Singapore, the rest being Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will consider setting up similar schools in other overseas locations if there is a sufficient number of Singaporean pupils so that such a school is feasible. It will be necessary for the school to recruit many of its teachers from that location as we are short of teachers in Singapore. At present, in locations other than Hong Kong there are insufficient Singaporean pupils to make up the bulk of a school.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where private schools overseas are interested in offering the Singapore curriculum or private organisations are keen to set up private schools based on the Singapore model, they can approach my Ministry or the Singapore Teachers Union for assistance regarding syllabuses, textbooks and other aspects of the Singapore curriculum. My Ministry will also assist parents to facilitate the re-entry of their children into Singapore schools when they return.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson GRC):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister which is the next likely location for the Ministry to consider setting up another international school?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I cannot give a definite answer because we have not decided where to locate the next school yet. As I have said, in all the other locations, there is an insufficient number of pupils and Singaporeans are scattered all over the place. For example, even in China which is a huge area, Singaporeans are in so many locations such as Suzhou, Wuxi and Shandong.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> At present, the international school only caters for primary school curriculum. Would the Ministry also consider extending it to secondary school curriculum because I understand there are many parents whose children are in secondary school and who would like to have this facility?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at present my Ministry has no plans to provide secondary school facilities overseas. There are two main reasons for this. One is the shortage of teachers, which is especially significant in the secondary schools, because of our recent change in the school system. In fact, we have had to recruit more than 100 teachers from Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere to supplement our teacher resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason is that we have built up boarding school facilities in Singapore. There are already two available - one in Raffles Institution and the other in Anglo Chinese School. These are for boys. Another boarding school for girls is being built in Nanyang Girls High School. There are excellent facilities being provided in the boarding schools. There will be supervision by teachers and I think it will be advantageous for the older children to come back to Singapore and be re-immersed into our school system in the boarding school. The boarding schools accept pupils whose parents are working overseas even if the pupils themselves do not study in these schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> The establishment of a Singapore international school is to facilitate re-entry of the students as well as to provide them with a Singapore-based curriculum. Would the Minister elaborate on the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> provision for re-entry of students who have studied abroad into the Singapore school system?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I think parents need not worry about this because my Ministry will assist them as far as possible. It is usually necessary for the pupils to take a test in English Language and Mathematics mainly to assess their level of competence and this is to look after the children's welfare because we do not want to put them in the wrong level. When parents go overseas, they have the advantage of exposing their children to the international situation and putting their children in international schools have its plus points. In certain places they may be worried about the second language. If they go to China, that should not be a concern if they are Chinese because that is the best place for them to get immersion in Chinese. But if there are other places like Indonesia or Brunei where the study of Chinese could be a problem, some parents have got together to organise tuition classes and recruit Chinese teachers, maybe even from China, to provide tuition. My Ministry is flexible in terms of the mother tongue language. If the children have been away for a number of years and they are due to sit for a major examination, eg, PSLE or the 'O' level, and it is quite obvious that they cannot catch up, we will not insist that they must take their mother tongue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of selection of schools, we will have to be fair to them as well as to other Singaporean children so that they compete on a similar basis. For example, if they live near a particular primary school, then they should have priority for re-entry into that school or if they came from a school and had left for a number of years, I think most schools will take them back. But they cannot, because they were away overseas, expect to come back to the good schools. These are all the areas, and if there are further ways where we can facilitate their re-entry, we will be happy to look into them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the Minister said that one of the difficulties for these students overseas is the second language. Perhaps the Ministry can consider facilitating the organisation at some of these centres
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> overseas, not to function as full schools, but to provide courses for second languages; so that when the children come back to Singapore, they can get back to the Singapore system.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Yes, that is a possibility. As I have said, some parents have, in fact, on their own done so. It is not so difficult just to hire a tutor for a number of children, say, 10 children, and if they need assistance from my Ministry we will be happy to consider it.

   <b>CORRECTIVE WORK ORDER</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Number of first offenders)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Acting Minister for the Environment how many first offenders were served with Corrective Work Order since the amendment to the Environmental Public Health Act came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Acting Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for the Environment (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Corrective Work Order (CWO) was introduced in November 1992. Those convicted of a serious littering offence will be liable for CWOs issued by the court, even if they are first-time offenders. A serious littering offence includes littering with a large object, eg, a drink can, a packet of food, a cigarette pack, etc. Minor littering offences, such as littering with cigarette butts, bus tickets, etc. can be compounded with a fine of $150 after the offender attends a counselling session. However, if a person who has committed a minor littering offence is a repeat offender, then he will be liable for CWO.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From November 1992 to now, out of 13,631 littering offenders, 921 or 6.8% were issued with CWOs. Of the number of CWO offenders, 737 were first offenders charged with serious littering offences. The remaining 184 were repeat offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Is the Acting Minister aware that during the Budget debate the then Minister for the Environment reiterated that the purpose of CWO was for recalcitrant offenders. How does he classify "recalcitrant" offenders? For a first time offender, can he say that he is recalcitrant?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, as I have already mentioned just now in my answer, we apply CWOs to persons convicted or charged with a second or more littering offence and also on those persons who have committed serious littering offences. I think that Singaporeans know littering is an offence and there is no excuse for not knowing that littering is an offence. I had learned that in school since I was in my short pants 30 years ago. So I do not think any Singaporean can claim that he does not know that littering is an offence. That being the case, I think there is absolutely no excuse for anyone to litter in Singapore. For those who choose to be socially irresponsible and litter indiscriminately, then they should face the penalty. I do not really understand why Mr Low seems to be taking the side of those who are socially irresponsible.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> While I agree with what the Acting Minister has said that no one should condone littering, I am concerned with the spirit and intention of the Bill passed by Parliament. As I mentioned just now ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, no speeches. Ask your question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> My question is whether the Ministry would consider it fair to issue CWOs to first offenders because the public understands that the CWOs are for recalcitrant offenders. It is a well-known fact that anyone who litters will be fined. But would it not be unfair to the first offenders by issuing them the CWOs?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, as I have explained, repeat offenders are subject to CWO. First-time offenders, who are serious offenders, are also subject to CWO. If there is any doubt about that, I hope that this clarifies it completely.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure why Mr Low seems to be taking the side of those who are socially irresponsible as compared to the overwhelming majority of Singaporeans. Only 921 persons were issued with CWOs since November 1992. There are three million other Singaporeans who are quite socially conscious and civic-minded persons who would want to see a clean and green environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, let us not side-step the issue. Does the Acting Minister agree that, while people who litter should be punished, the understanding of many people is that first-time offenders would be fined instead of being issued with CWOs? Many of them are not aware that if they are first-time offenders they could also be issued with CWOs. I have such a case.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second supplementary question is: how does he classify an offence as serious or minor? And why does he say that a first-time offender who commits a serious offence, eg, throwing a drink can, as mentioned by the Acting Minister, is considered a recalcitrant offender? How does he justify that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I think I have already explained quite clearly when people are subject to CWOs. Serious offences are subject to CWOs. Throwing a can is considered a serious offence. Those who have repeat offences, even though they are minor offences, are also subject to CWOs. Again, Mr Speaker, Sir, I really do not understand why Mr Low seems to be taking the side of those who are not civic-minded.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> First of all, I have no quarrel with people who are punished under the law for littering. I do not want to repeat myself as to why I asked that question. The issue now is on the first offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Low, can you make your point?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> My question is: if a first offender - we are talking about first offender - throws a bus ticket and another person drops two bus tickets, which one of them will be issued with CWO? The act was done at the same time.

  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my public health inspectors will use their discretion. And also if we bring them to court, the court will decide. But I wish to reiterate that there is absolutely no excuse for any Singaporean to claim that he does not know that littering is an offence. As I said, since 30 years ago when I was in my short pants, I knew that littering was an

  <br>
  <br> offence. We teach them in our schools, we teach them in our kindergartens, and to try to make excuses for people who litter from punishment, which I think is well deserved, is really a very strange position for Mr Low to take.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Acting Minister agree that the CWO, as mentioned by the then Minister for the Environment, was for the purpose of punishing recalcitrant offenders? Does he agree with that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already explained quite clearly the circumstances under which CWO will be applied.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Under what circumstances would the Acting Minister consider or presume a first offender as recalcitrant?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> I am not sure how I can explain this better. I have already said that a serious littering offence, even for the first offence, is subject to CWO.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, how does the Ministry of the Environment classify clearly what is a serious offence? Was it published? How do you classify? I think we have got to make it clear to the public so that they can be deterred from committing serious offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> I hardly think that is Mr Low's purpose, Mr Speaker. I think Mr Low is just simply making excuses for people who ought to be appropriately punished when they commit littering offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I have no objection to people being punished for littering. My question is whether it is fair to people who do not know that they will be punished with CWOs under the Act even though they are first offenders. Secondly, would the Acting Minister consider it fair to presume that first offenders are recalcitrant offenders? Is it fair?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think through the efforts of Mr Low and others, the press, and so forth, CWO is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> very well publicised in Singapore. Fines for littering are very well publicised in Singapore. They are even the butt of jokes in other countries about Singapore. So to claim that any Singaporean does not know that he faces penalties if he litters is really quite amazing to me. And all these sound to me like excuses that Mr Low is making for a particular case which he may have of someone who has been socially irresponsible, has littered, and caused a nuisance to the majority of Singaporeans. More than 99% of Singaporeans have not encountered any such difficulties. They are civic-conscious; they want to see their city clean; they want to see their country clean and green. And I do not see why Mr Low keeps on defending them.

  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> --- we should also be fair in administering the legislation in accordance with the spirit it is passed by Parliament? And I do not think the Minister has answered my question on how he presumes a first offender as recalcitrant. Would the Minister like to further clarify and would he like to publish to the press under what circumstances will littering be classified as serious offences, so that Singaporeans are aware that they can be issued with CWO even if they are first offenders?

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a second time." - [Dr Kanwaljit Soin, Nominated Member].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.
  <br>12.53 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in yesterday's debate, it was unanimously agreed that family violence shall never be condoned. Those who engage in acts of beating up family members should be severely punished. This, we are in total agreement. However, it is in the form of legislation between the existing Women's Charter and the Penal Code and the proposed Family Violence Bill that we must decide on which is the best to address this serious social ill. There is a significant difference both in terms of philosophy and procedure between the two. In the Women's Charter and Penal Code, it takes a more humane approach. Every effort is made to mediate and reconciliate the conflicting parties in order to preserve the family unit. The law will only be introduced as a last resort. Whereas in the proposed Bill, the law is to be called upon on the onset of a family conflict. It is confrontational and litigious.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot reconcile the harsh high-handed and detached way of dealing with family conflicts as I feel that family conflict is a very complex and intimate problem that concerns family members who are bound by blood or marriage. Therefore, I wish to highlight a few provisions in the proposed Bill which I found extremely difficult to reconcile with.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the underlying intention of the Bill is to introduce litigation into family conflict at an early stage. It runs contrary to our strong belief that we should endeavour to resolve family conflict as much as possible through tolerance, compromise and respect. We must recognise that family violence is a very complex matter. It involves deep emotional feelings, relationship which takes years to develop and in the case of husband and wife, affection and a very special type of bondage. It is totally
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> different from the case where two persons are involved in a fight because if that happens, it is a simple matter of determining who is the guilty one, prosecute him or her, fine and punish the guilty party, and that is the end of the story. Can we do that for family conflict, given the emotional content and relationships bound by blood or marriage? Will life go on as usual once the so-called guilty one is being apprehended or punished? The answer is obviously no. Because once a conflict happens, family members are compelled to take sides to give evidence, testimonies or as witness in the court. The whole process will tear the family apart and set one against another. There will be a lot of consequential problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am strongly against the introduction of litigation into all forms of family dispute at an early stage. We should stick to our principle of dealing with family problems through counselling, education and, most important of all, promotion of family values. Only in severe cases where hurt or grievous hurt is detected, then the culprit should be apprehended and prosecuted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the introduction of Police to intervene at the onset of any family squabble is likely to make things worse as the possibility of reconciliation would definitely diminish, as both parties would take a confrontational posture and the end result is that the family loses control of the situation and therefore making it difficult for any amicable settlement. This runs contrary to our principle of settling family problems through conciliation, counselling and promotion of family values.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling in the Police should always be a last resort, besides it is unrealistic and impractical to expect the Police to be equipped with the skills and techniques to settle family disputes. One cannot imagine a young policeman confronting two very angry persons will know what to do to calm the disputing party down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the provision of the Bill to allow a third person to report acts of family violence and institute investigation is equally disturbing. This effectively takes control out of the family. The rights of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the family or the individual to self-determination must then be compromised. This will also open up to abuse as the third party can always take advantage of the opportunity to report on any family conflict occurring between friends and neighbours and report them to the Police and therefore create a chain of problems out of malice or spite. Even those who have the best of intention can inadvertently mess things up by doing what they think is a good deed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we must ensure that our old folks, children and spouses are adequately protected, we must also recognise that when people live together in a family unit, there must be the occasional quarrels and fights. The principle has always been to exercise restraint. There is a Chinese saying that best illustrates this precept, that is, " " (Da shi hua xiao, xiao shi hua wu), literally translated, it means to have a big problem turned into a small problem, and a small problem turned into no problem. This should be the best principle to resolve family conflicts. The approach should always be reconciliatory, not confrontational and definitely not militant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, we must distinguish between the two. Family conflict may not necessarily lead to family violence and should be resolved as such. I am sure that the proposed amendment to the Women's Charter would provide a more positive step towards addressing the problem. And in actual family violence cases, I think our Penal Code has adequately provided protection for those victims. We can always propose further amendments to the Women's Charter and to our Penal Code when the need arises in the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, I think the positive thing to do is to promote awareness of the problem of family violence and educate the likely victim to take a more positive stand and seek counselling and protection before the situation deteriorates. Perhaps one of the most serious dilemmas faced by victims of family violence is that they have to weigh the consequence of reporting the aggressor and having the prospect of being left all alone to fend for themselves should the aggressor be convicted and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> jailed, or to leave things as they are. This sense of fear of uncertainty often tilts the balance of the decision on whether to go to the authority or not. Therefore, it is important for us to provide them with the assurance that should they be unfortunate enough to fall victim to family violence, all support will be available to them, be it financial or emotional, by the Government as well as the society so that they will have the confidence and courage to come forward to bring the aggressor to justice. This, I feel, is a more positive step towards addressing the problem instead of introducing more litigation as proposed in the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, consider the proposed Family Violence Bill redundant and, if passed, would serve no additional purpose but may even have a negative effect on creating more broken families and bring more pain and suffering to the family members.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, we had a series of passionate discussions on this subject. It is interesting, but I feel that we have to get down to the ground and look at the issues soberly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, family violence, as I see it, is a tail-end of a family problem because when it gets into a violent stage, that is the end of the problem. It is very complex and difficult to deal with. Nevertheless, I think we should not condone any form of violence within or outside the family, and we should register and deal with this behaviour effectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we examine it, family violence is only a minor issue because I am more concerned about mothers and children who are neglected, and mothers who are not maintained after separation. I think this is a greater problem that needs to be addressed because it represents a large number of people that we should be concerned about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to look at the strategy. We have a problem, that is, domestic violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> How do we deal with it effectively? Do we need a separate legislation for it? Or do we look at the existing legislation and see what we can do immediately to strengthen it and looking at how we can deliver the services more effectively? What we can do to mediate in these problems and help the family to reconcile and come together again and find new meaning to their lives is the issue at hand. Therefore, the question is: do we need a separate legislation to deal with family violence? As I see it, there is no basis for this. Because there is a more urgent need to strengthen and to give more teeth to the existing legislation to deal with domestic problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken to many community groups and leaders and many of them feel that the existing legislation relating to family matters should be strengthened. There are a few reasons that I would like to advance for not supporting a separate legislation to deal with domestic violence. First, the Bill creates a negative label on the parties affected and further drives a relationship problem, ie, a wedge between family members. Second, family violence, in my mind, is a very complex matter and cannot be easily resolved by the provisions in the Bill. Because family relationship is a very personalised and complex matter and you need to encourage the couples to get together to see how these problems could be resolved amicably. Sometimes, the problems cannot be resolved. So what do we do?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite all this, we still need to find ways for family members and spouses who have difficulties in marriage, conflicts, or domestic violence to resolve their problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason that I am not supporting this Bill is that the issues covered by the Bill are not new. Many of these issues are related to marital problems, such as maintenance, abuse and neglect of family members. These could be dealt with under the existing legislation and in this case, the Women's Charter could be amended to tackle present and future family problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will take the necessary effective steps to plug the problems arising from domestic violence. The cases should be referred to appointed family counselling agencies for follow-up. If this can be done and working in concert with the police, then I think we will have a very coordinated approach in dealing with domestic violence in the context of the family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is important is the follow-up support and our capacity to organise a good service delivery system to tackle the problem. More so, we need to find ways in preventing families from getting into this terminal stage of the problem itself. I would like to see that more resources are deployed to support the family enrichment programmes, ie, marriage enrichment and family life education. If we are able to review these areas and deploy more resources for these areas, I think we can reduce the number of families facing such problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I see it, there is no urgency to have another legislation to deal with family problems in a segmented manner. Yesterday, our Parliamentary colleague, NMP Dr Kanwaljit Soin, said that many of these families are quite reluctant to go and seek help because of their background and profile, and she quoted a Chinese saying. Today, I would like to bring to her attention that there is another Chinese saying which says, " " (ya men ba zi kai, wu qian mo jin lai), in short, it means doors are open but you need money to come in.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, we should examine the existing legislation. We have the Women's Charter which deals with domestic issues - family relationship, maintenance and support for children. We should try and see how we can strengthen this. I hope that the Minister will be able to incorporate many of the good points which have been brought up by NMP Dr Kanwaljit Soin. Dr Soin's viewpoints are quite valid and she has suggested many ideas. I hope that her viewpoints which are in the Family Violence Bill can be fully incorporated into the Women's Charter. I do not support that the Family Violence Bill be introduced as a separate Bill, but
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> I would suggest that the Women's Charter incorporate all the viewpoints that have been brought forward.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for Health and Education (Dr Aline K. Wong): Mr Speaker, I support the intention of the Bill which is to curb family violence and to give more protection to the victims. Family violence is a problem that exists throughout the ages and across cultures and societies. I know all of us put a great deal of emphasis on family values, moral education and so on. But the reality is no moral exhortation can eliminate it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries that have domestic violence laws have not seen a fall in cases committed either. The law can only protect the victims, but not solve the root problems that cause domestic violence. We all agree that the victims should be protected and that the abusers should be deterred from repeating the offence and, where they still persist, bring them to justice. So the question is how can this be done without destroying the fragile family relationships.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing the Bill, we have to bear in mind there are two different types of issues involved here. First, what are the specific measures proposed and how effective are these measures? Second, should these measures be incorporated into a single piece of new legislation, or should they be incorporated into existing legislation? Since the Acting Minister for Community Development has already made known how the Women's Charter is going to be changed to give greater protection to victims of domestic violence, I think we should discuss the above questions by comparing the provisions in the Bill with the changes that the Minister said would be effected to the Women's Charter. The details disclosed by the Minister are sufficient already for us to discuss the merits of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first heard about the Family Violence Bill and saw its first draft, I thought it was a pretty good idea to have a piece of legislation to bring all members of the family under one law. However, after I studied the Bill and its successive drafts, I am no longer sure
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> about its various provisions and am in doubt as to the wisdom of having a separate piece of legislation that has such a wide coverage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with protection of the child first. The Bill proposes to extend protection of young persons against domestic abuse by covering children above the age of 16 who are not protected by the Children and Young Persons Act. This appears to be a useful extension. However, it is difficult to view a young person between age 16 and 21 as requiring the kind of legal protection intended by the Bill. Some of these young people may already be working, or are in national service. I should think therefore the extension of coverage under this Bill would, in practice, apply mainly to the disabled child who is especially vulnerable to domestic abuse, including sexual abuse.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sunday Times article on 24th September 1995, entitled "Families do not want to talk about child sexual abuse" mentioned that most child sexual abuse victims were usually girls, and they were usually under the age of 10. This would appear to confirm that the existing legislation is adequate to protect young children. Nevertheless, the newspaper report pointed out that intellectually disabled children were especially at risk. I think, for these children, there is a case for extending protection beyond age 16.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the provision under clause 19 of the Bill for "any persons" to report to an enforcement officer is useful in the case of child sexual abuse, since the family is unlikely to want to report to the police on its own. However, whether these two useful aspects of the Bill can be adopted expeditiously by the existing Children and Young Persons Act, or should they be incorporated in a new piece of legislation dealing exclusively with domestic violence, I think we should leave it to the legal experts to decide. My point is extending the coverage of children by itself is not a sufficient justification for having a separate piece of legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to elderly abuse. The present legislation does not enable the elderly to apply for a Personal Protection
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Order under the Women's Charter even if the elderly concerned are women. The Penal Code protects the elderly against physical abuse. However, it does not appear to protect them against psychological harm or harassment where there is no criminal intimidation. By comparison, the Bill provides for Protection Orders as well as covers harassment. So on these counts, the Bill can extend wider protection to the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, the elderly have to cross several hurdles before protection can be sought. They have to make a police report. They have to take a medical examination and take out a summons against the abuser. These are formidable hurdles for the elderly persons. Apart from these hurdles, we know that most parents are unwilling to report their children to the police. The Bill proposes to make it easier for a third party such as the police to intervene. While this may ensure a quick relief to the victim, my question is: would third party intervention make it more difficult for the parent to be eventually reconciled with his own children, thereby preserving the family unit? How can we strike a careful balance between the ideal of preserving the parent/child relationship with sufficient protection for the weaker members of the family? There is no easy answer to this question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what bothers me besides this nagging question is that this Bill lumps the issue of elderly abuse together with child abuse and spousal abuse under one legislation. I am of the view that these three types of violence should not be lumped together, especially where the elderly are the parents or adopted parents or relatives who have taken care of the family, in much the same way as the parent does. This is because parents gave birth to us, brought us up and provided for us. We must treat them with the utmost respect and provide for them in their old age. This same moral precept underlies the Maintenance of Parents Bill. The parent/child relationship is really on a different moral plane from that of the spousal relationship. While husbands and wives should respect each other as
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> individuals and should care for each other, they can seek divorce if the marriage does not work out. But we can never divorce our parents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel that we should not lump the issue of parental abuse together with spousal violence. Whether the existing Penal Code should make the penalty more severe for parental abuse or whether there should ideally be a separate legislation altogether to deal with parental abuse can be a matter for further discussion. Here, I should add that even where the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter provide for the protection of parents and adoptive parents, the question still remains as to whether we should treat the parents on the same moral plane as spouse, siblings, children and so on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now discuss spousal violence. Available statistics on family violence are very patchy. They come from different sources and these show conflicting trends with regard to child abuse and elderly abuse. The signs appear to be clearer on spousal violence, the greatest majority of which are wife beating. The number of Protection Orders, Expedited Orders and Domestic Exclusion Orders issued by the courts has nearly doubled over the last five years. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that more men are beating up their wives now as compared to five years ago. This definitely has to do with the fact that more women are now willing to come out and make reports and that the police are now more helpful to the victims.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is enough literature as well as field experience to show that wife abuse is the result of a complex web of social, emotional and psychological factors which are often compounded by financial difficulties and such irresponsible behaviour as drinking and gambling. Thus, legislation alone cannot help the victim or the abuser over the long run. There must be enough counselling and support services to help the family break out of the cycle of violence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prominent feature of the Bill is to make investigation by the police mandatory and counselling compulsory.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The question is: do we have enough resources to cope with a sudden surge in demand for investigation and counselling? As the Minister for Home Affairs said yesterday, he is concerned that with a sudden surge in demand for counselling and investigation, a disproportionately large amount of police energy and resources would be absorbed by a relatively small number of cases of family violence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that this Bill is closely modelled on the Domestic Violence Act of Malaysia. There, implementation has been delayed because the necessary machinery has yet to be established. Similarly, countries like Australia which have domestic violence laws took a few years to put in place a machinery of relevant judicial, social and community services before introducing their domestic violence laws. So, why should we rush into passing a law that cannot be implemented effectively straightaway? Furthermore, the effectiveness of counselling depends very much on the stage at which family disputes are subjected to outside intervention. Given our Asian culture, most people prefer not to wash the family's dirty linen in public. While this preference is a good thing as it helps to keep the family intact, by the time a wife reports spousal violence to the police, it is likely that the situation has already deteriorated to such a serious level that third party intervention would be unable to do much for them, just as Dr Vasoo has mentioned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in my mind, an opposite scenario is more likely to take place under the Bill. It is that a family may be locked into a situation where it cannot retrieve itself once a report is made to the police. Police officers who have been handling family disputes under the existing law have found that many women are not willing to press charges against their husbands even where grievous hurt has been committed. This is because many victims do not want to lose a breadwinner or be blamed for breaking up the family, as after all he is the father of her children. Typically, the victims only want the police to deter the abuser and help him to cool down. But under the Bill, a police officer will be required to investigate and prosecute
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> upon receiving a report, unless the abuser goes for voluntary counselling after the occurrence of the first report. Thereafter, prosecution cannot be avoided. Thus, even though the intention of the Bill is to break the cycle of violence at an early stage, it may have the unintended consequence of deterring women from seeking help if they still desire to maintain their family relationship.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewed against the above, a proposed amendment to the Women's Charter is to empower the court to impose additional orders when granting PPOs such as requiring the abuser to attend counselling. This is a more discretionary approach. Counselling will be employed where it is judged to be effective or where there are chances that the marriage can still be saved. I am more for this discretionary approach.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the lack of discretion in the hands of the law enforcement officer is the single most troubling proposal under the Bill. I think this would lead to more problems than it would resolve. Like Mrs Yu-Foo, I also feel uncomfortable with widening the definition of "domestic violence" to include marital rape. Even in some countries where marital rape is recognised in law, it applies only to specific circumstances such as when the couple is already separated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, family relationships are highly emotional personal matters. Hence, they should be treated with the greatest sensitivity. While it is laudable that we should want to extend more protection to victims of abuse, I think in our eagerness we must not make matters worse for the family. It is here that I find the recommendations of the Select Committee on the Maintenance of Parents Bill both sensible and sensitive. The approach taken is conciliatory and, even where mediation fails, a Tribunal will hear the case in chambers. Open litigation is avoided. I would recommend a similar approach to be adopted for domestic violence when the Women's Charter is revised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, do we need a new piece of legislation to extend protection to victims of domestic violence? I would not go so far
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> as to say that, if child abuse can be covered by the Children and Young Persons Act, and if elderly abuse should not be lumped together with spousal violence, then the Family Violence Bill is really about spousal abuse, and mainly about wife abuse, and hence its provisions can very well be accommodated within the Women's Charter. Let us not preclude these two other groups of victims for the moment. Let us still consider the question whether there should be a single piece of legislation to deal with domestic violence, including child abuse and elderly abuse.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a separate law such as the Bill has the advantage of sending a strong signal that our society does not condone family violence. But what I am worried about is that it will send too strong a signal or, worse still, send a wrong signal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just that the Bill may give a wrong impression that domestic violence is a very serious problem in Singapore. It is also that, by highlighting such a problem through having a distinct piece of legislation, we may begin to change the way family members look at their own relationships. It is to the credit of Dr Soin and AWARE that much public discussion of this topic has been generated over the past few months. However, as I observe from the experience of some countries in the West, when the definition of domestic violence is too broad, you may cause the society to become more litigious. And when terms such as "child abuse", "spouse abuse", "psychological abuse", "hurt", "harassment", "marital rape" and so on become common coinage in the media, in people's conversations and in their subconsciousness, people's attitudes towards maintaining the family as a unit will also change. Where the law intervenes or is resorted to too readily, people will be less inclined to solve family problems through reconciliation or take moral responsibility for their own behaviour. In the long run, we may all be the losers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By comparison, the Women's Charter and other legislation are already in place. They can be reviewed to incorporate some
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of the positive features of the Bill. For Dr Soin's information, both Mrs Yu-Foo and myself have found that, at the grassroots, the women frankly do not mind one way or the other, so long as the Government is doing something to extend protection, so long as they know where help can be found when the need arises.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Acting Minister for Community Development would not wait too long before the specific amendments to the Women's Charter are introduced in this House. Some lawyers have suggested that the Women's Charter should be thoroughly reviewed to make it into an all-embracing Family Law. I would recommend that we take one step at a time. Amend the Charter, as the Minister has intended, and include the positive aspects of this Bill on family violence but as soon as possible, and before the proposal for a Family Law is studied thoroughly. I would like to remind the Minister that for a long time, women lawyers and organisations have pointed out the need to improve the present provisions for division of matrimonial assets, enforcement of maintenance orders and related matters. We women cannot wait any longer.

  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Acting Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I sat listening to the debate on this Bill yesterday, I would not blame anyone leaving this Chamber more confused about the differences between police intervention in this Bill and police involvement that complements the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the Nominated Member of Parliament elaborating on the role of the Police, it would appear that what the Bill provides for is similar to what the Ang Mo Kio project hopes to achieve. The Member spoke of police discretion, the benefits of counselling, keeping the family intact, and of healing, not destroying; the very same spirit, intent and philosophy of what MCD and MHA are in fact promoting.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the nub of the matter, Sir, is that there is a difference between the approach provided for in the Family Violence Bill
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and the MCD/MHA approach when it comes to police involvement. Sir, the difference is subtle, but it is fundamental enough to separate the Bill and the amendments to the Charter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I point out the critical differences, let me at the risk of repetition, state my premises yet again to put my stand in proper perspective:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That violence in the family should not be condoned and that society must find ways to protect victims and potential victims from the clutches of such violence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter should be seen in the context of the efforts of the police and the service agencies as piloted in the Ang Mo Kio project. Hence the police is involved, contrary to what the NMP would have the House to believe. The amendments should not be seen in vacuum because it has always been emphasised that family violence should be tackled through legislation as well as the police, service agencies and the community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That family violence is a problem in our society (and indeed in virtually every society, as alluded to by Dr Aline Wong earlier) albeit not an endemic one here as the Member tried to demonstrate with her statistics yesterday.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That it is recognised that the existing legislation and supporting services are indeed inadequate, hence the work of the Inter-Ministry Committee and the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Minister for Home Affairs elaborated on the differences in police approach in the Family Violence Bill and in the Women's Charter amendments. I checked again with the police and the legal authorities yesterday evening and this morning on the import and meaning of the provisions in the Family Violence Bill, especially clauses 13 and 14 as they pertain to police intervention. Clause 13(1) of the Family Violence Bill obliges the police to investigate every case reported. The purpose of a police investigation is to determine if an offence has been committed. Evidence has to be gathered and witnesses have to be interviewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> This could mean going to the home where the violence took place to obtain evidence and talk to other family members involved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what Dr Soin said yesterday, the police has no discretion at the scene, to offer counselling instead of prosecution. The police (Investigation Officer) will have to, after investigation, submit his investigation papers (IPs) to the Public Prosecutor and only he or an officer authorised by him, ie, the Public Prosecutor, can exercise that discretion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Family Violence Bill were to become law, Sir, family violence will not be "like any other offence". This is simply because unlike all current laws including the Penal Code, which give police discretion, whether to initiate investigation, the Family Violence Bill (Clause 13) "requires", I repeat, "requires" the police to investigate every case.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I oppose the passage of the Bill, not for what it seeks to achieve, ie, to enhance protection of victims or potential victims of family violence, but for its approach and tone and for the fact that there is already existing legislation in the Women's Charter to address the same problem and which can be amended to enhance its effectiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes a more direct, mandatory and visible intervention by the police on reports of family violence. It obliges the police to investigate all reports of family violence and gives them the power of arrest without warrant regardless of the credibility of the report, the gravity of the offence and whether it is the first and only occurrence or a repeat offence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, conflict among members of the same family is significantly different from those between strangers, neighbours or even friends. The emotional mechanics that come into play when people linked by blood or marriage inflict physical or psychological pain or damage to one another is extremely complex and sensitive. Family members will still have to contend with their relationship in the aftermath of that conflict. This has been alluded to by Dr Wong earlier too. Do they
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sever their relationship? Do they want to retain their relationship to the status quo ante? Or do they make adjustments just so they remain related, albeit on a different basis? Sir, these are decisions best left to the victims themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers do not have to face these emotional challenges as the perpetrator caught and punished is neither a spouse nor a sibling or one's relatives, or even one's child.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore have to be extremely careful in our handling of and intervention in family violence. Making it mandatory for the police to intervene right from the start, to probe, to question, to record statements, to ascertain guilt and to put all these on police record (because that is what investigation means) could worsen an already brittle relationship between the parties involved, thus making it harder for them to reconcile and for the family to become whole again.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument offered in support of the Bill is that victims are often helpless in the face of family violence and that unl ess the authoritative figure of the police intervenes, the victim can hope for no protection. Battered faces, lacerations on the body, even broken limbs; this is the picture of family violence portrayed every time the subject is raised in talks, forums and discussions. Indeed, Sir, these descriptions were mentioned several times yesterday in Dr Soin's speech and in even greater detail. It was made to appear that this is such a widespread and common face of family violence. It touches the emotions. It was designed to enrage us, to make us want to extract an eye for an eye against the perpetrator.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, without belittling the suffering of these victims and while this may be true in some cases, the reality in most cases is not as gruesome and the victims not as helpless as put. There is a wide range of abuse with various shades of gravity especially now that the definition of family violence has been widened. But the Bill treats them all equally as seizable offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the reported police cases, as mentioned by the Home Affairs Minister yesterday, merely want to place the offence on record and not to proceed beyond that. Some have already, as in the case of spousal violence, contemplated divorce.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just as the Member could quote of specific cases where police intervention would be more desirable and effective, I and the Minister for Home Affairs can likewise cite other cases where intervention results in negative consequences. The story of Madam Ee Seng Mui quoted in yesterday's The New Paper is one such case. Anecdotal evidence such as these can only raise emotions and provide grist for arguments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also quoted extensive statistics yesterday on the number of reported cases of family violence, concluding that the problem is growing worryingly. Sir, as a former statistician, I know how numbers can be crunched to spin a different tale from reality. The Member has not demonstrated conclusively that these numbers indicated an actual increase in incidence of family violence or merely an indication of growing awareness of and knowledge about family violence. If awareness is indeed an ingredient, then the rising number of reports made is testimony to people's acceptance of the PPO as a legal instrument to handle family violence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, victims do not report or pursue their reports precisely because they do not want third party interference. There is a variety of reasons for not wanting this interference - from hoping that matters would clear up and followed by reconciliation; the sense of shame should others know of their disagreements, or wives saying "I still love him despite all this". Who are we, Sir, to butt in when we are unwanted and decide for them what should be done? Who are we to deny them their concerns and hopes, silly or senseless they may seem to us? Do we know better than them to decide what choice they should take in their relationships?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far better, Sir, for us to tell them of the choices and options available to them and to help them make the best of the route that they have chosen.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had had a discussion with the President of the Society Against Family Violence, that very body which works on the ground, quietly and committedly, to develop community resources to tackle the problem of family violence. They know the reality on the ground. They had no hand in drafting the Bill. They are concerned with the overly legalistic approach to solving the problem and the confrontational stance of this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, the Bill is confrontational. It is more heavily weighed towards punishing the perpetrator. The offer of counselling to the abuser may appear to be conciliatory but, in my view, it is more a concession in lieu of prosecution, rather as an after-thought than a principal ingredient of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is because of this orientation that the authors fail to address the operational challenges and lack of community resources when they proposed mandatory counselling and police intervention the way they do. They expect and leave the rest of the community services to pick up the responsibilities after the law has shown its teeth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry and the Ministry of Home Affairs, on the other hand, are mindful of the reality - the resources available, the preparedness of police personnel and the values that our families hold. Hence, we opted for incremental changes in the law and building up community resources and police readiness at the same time to complement these changes. This is the rationale for the Ang Mo Kio project which we hope to develop and refine further. These are the premises for the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry's mission is to strengthen families to make them whole and to heal any rifts or concerns that may threaten the well-being of the family. It is therefore our conviction that every opportunity should be given to the family to heal and mend itself after a conflict. Disagreements, Sir, skirmishes and quarrels are part and parcel of family life. This is a reality we must accept.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is infinitely better for families to want to be counselled and to want to weather these storms rather than being reluctantly made to do so. Hence, the approach that we are taking in tackling the problem of family violence. It is more a total approach, combining the judicious involvement of the police, the professional counselling input of the service agencies and the natural inclination of most families to want to sort out their problems internally before seeking outside help. Serious physical hurt or seizable offences will be punished under the Penal Code with or without the Bill and regardless of whether the Women's Charter is amended or not.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin said yesterday that the Domestic Violence Act of Malaysia which was very similar to the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter had its shortcomings. Her implication did not escape me, Sir. But the truth is something else.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Secretary-General of the Malaysian Ministry responsible for the Act visited my Ministry earlier this year and when I met the Minister in Beijing at the 4th World Conference on Women, they told me that the Act was not yet implemented because of operational problems and because of differences in the State and Federal laws, not due to what the NMP implies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin also implied yesterday that the amendments to the Women's Charter were modelled after the Malaysian Domestic Violence Act 1994 and implying that it had its shortcomings because of the reliance on the PPOs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put the record straight. Earlier this year, Dr Soin submitted her Bill on family violence to CID. Except for the word "Singapore" which substituted the word "Malaysian", the Bill submitted was virtually a replica of the Malaysian Act. Of course, the Bill, as it now stands before the House, contains many modifications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Inter-Ministry Committee looked into the issue of family violence, it looked at not only the Malaysian but other Acts as well. In fact, there are many things we do not agree with in the Malaysian
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> legislation. So let us not talk about who copies what and from where. It serves no purpose.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon yesterday suggested - and I think Dr Vasoo alluded to it, so did Dr Wong - that my Ministry could perhaps look into the widening of the scope of the proposed tribunal in the Maintenance of Parents Bill to include providing conciliation and mediation to family members in family violence cases and to issue PPOs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry is in fact looking into the feasibility of such a widening of responsibility. We will certainly consider this to see how the concept can be developed further.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, undoubtedly there are some provisions in the Bill which have merit. And Dr Soin and the drafters of the Bill ought to be complimented for their effort. I am not averse to incorporating them as amendments to the Women's Charter. But I cannot, in all honesty, give my "assent" to the Second Reading of the Bill and I must say "no" to the Bill. But what I will offer, Sir, is to commit the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter to a Select Committee so that the Nominated Member and other Members of this House, as well as the public, can still propose inclusions to the amendments that would enable the piece of legislation to provide enhanced protection to victims of family violence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us work together to achieve our common objective.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Imram bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Imram bin Mohamed (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I see it, there are two main issues that need to be debated with regard to the proposed Family Violence Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Is there a need to enhance or tighten the present legislation?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is Police intervention desirable for all cases of violence? I shall confine my arguments within this ambit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of family violence is on the increase if we go by the statistics
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> revealed by the Government. The figures show that the number of Protection Orders issued for spousal violence has more than doubled over the last five years, and is heading for a record increase this year. This rising trend in family violence indicates that existing legislation has not been entirely effective in dealing with this problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One weakness of the present legislation is that it is not deterrent enough. The law does not effectively ensure that the perpetrator of a violent offence on a family member will be taken to task. The victim could report to the Police. But unless grievous hurt is evident, it would be difficult for the Police to prosecute under the Penal Code because of difficulties in getting evidence. Witnesses may not want to come forward because of the private nature of the conflict. Further, since they are still living together, the offender could apply pressure on the victim not to proceed with the complaint. The complainant may also not want to proceed with Police action when told of the possible punishment the offender may face.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police statistics revealed that of the 3,625 cases of voluntarily causing hurt involving family members in 1994, about half the complainants did not want to proceed beyond making the initial complaint. The victims could seek to file to the court for legal protection under the Women's Charter. But many see this as an onerous process or are simply intimidated by the courts. As last year's statistics showed, only one of seven complainants sought and was given protection from the courts. Thus, a large number of abusers got away scot-free with little the legislation could do to check their violent streak.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore a need to give more teeth to the law to deal with recalcitrants of family violence. We need to send a clear message. The society does not condone violent behaviour within the family environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have stated that though family violence is on the rise, we should not exaggerate the problem and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> blow it out of proportion. However, we should not treat the problem too lightly either as family violence, if allowed to continue unchecked, would result in a disharmonious relationship in the family. This would lead to a multitude of social problems, like those we are experiencing today and which have been attributed to dysfunctional families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes that Police be empowered to investigate all cases of family violence reported to them. Members have articulated a number of arguments against this, such as the undesirability of Police intrusion into the home, a lack of expertise to handle family disputes, the premature and confrontational nature of Police intervention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, however, that the proposal has many merits too and should be given serious consideration. For a start, it would serve as a strong deterrent to would-be perpetrators of domestic violence. The public too would see the Police as a more acceptable form of intervention than the courts. This is because Neighbourhood Police are seen as friendly, more accessible and can provide more immediate relief. The courts, on the other hand, are viewed as remote or intimidating to a victim in distress. The Police need not intervene prematurely. The Police usually come into the scene when a report is made and the victim has a choice to seek other recourse before going to the Police to seek help. I would agree with Members that Police action would be construed as confrontational if the Police were to merely apprehend and prosecute the abuser. However, under the provisions of the Bill, the Police would offer offenders the option of going for counselling in lieu of a prosecution. This has several merits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is a conciliatory move. Whilst wielding a big stick, the Police will first offer a humane punishment. The stick is only used if the accused is uncooperative.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the abuser is compelled to go for counselling which is probably the best therapy for people who are inclined to hurt their loved ones. It offers a chance for a recalcitrant to be rehabilitated.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it would be an acceptable form of punishment to most complainants who wish only to reconcile and to continue living together with the offender in a harmonious environment. Of course, to achieve effective Police intervention, Police personnel need to be adequately trained in handling family disputes. The Police would need to look into this requirement and our judgement of the merits of the Bill should not be influenced by the lack of such Police personnel at the present time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it positively, since the police station or Neighbourhood Police Post will always be the first stop for victims looking for legal protection, a sufficient number of adequately trained personnel of the Police could play a vital role in mediating a conflict and reducing the initial trauma of the family members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, I however feel that the Family Violence Bill need not necessarily be adopted as a separate code. It could form part of a wider Family Charter which should also incorporate the Women's Charter and perhaps the Maintenance of Parents Bill. The Family Charter is then a one-stop legal tool that spells out the rights of each and every member in the family. It also ties in with the available judiciary channel, that is, the Family Court.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Soin deserves to be commended for her excellent effort in coming up with the Bill. Not only did it provide the impetus but the Bill will, though not perfect in its detailed provisions, provide a good base and contain the necessary ingredients to make it into a good piece of legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the adoption of the Bill and for it to be sent to a Select Committee for refinement and incorporation into the Family Charter.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight the many areas of convergence in this discussion of family violence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, most of us believe in the fundamental principle of the family as the basic unit of society and there is a strong consensus in Singapore that family
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> violence is wrong and should not be condoned. There is also a consensus that existing legislation is inadequate and that additional legislation is needed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is also widespread recognition that family violence is a very complex, emotive and private issue. We all hope when family violence does occur, that there can indeed be reconciliation, mediation, restoration of family unity. There is also agreement that a mediatory, reconciliatory approach to family problems is a preferred alternative and that the first best is for family violence to be resolved within the family with the help of relatives, friends and other support groups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate before us is therefore not whether there should be additional legislation but over the where and the how of such additional provision. In this, Dr Kanwaljit Soin is to be commended for bringing family violence to the forefront of public policy. By taking the initiative to propose a formulation of the necessary legislation in this House, she has enabled us all to focus on what exactly is needed in terms of additional provision. That by itself constitutes significant value-added. We may or may not support the Family Violence Bill per se but the introduction of the Bill has enabled the discussion to progress forward to this point of the second level of debate which is regarding the where and the how.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to give credit to the volunteer organisations who have worked with the Government in the area of violence prevention, such as the Society Against Family Violence, AWARE and SOS in the Women and Family Violence Committee which work together with the CID, and also the Society Against Family Violence in AWARE which has worked with the Government in the Inter-Ministry Work Group. I believe that considerable work has been done already by these, including the establishment of the Ang Mo Kio Pilot Project, and these should be given credit. I believe also that it is the work of many of these volunteers working without remuneration that have also
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> resulted in the formulation of the amendment to the Women's Charter which was done together with the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two specific issues here. The first is regarding whether family violence should be in a separate Bill or whether it should be incorporated in amendments to the Women's Charter. I have no strong views regarding the location of the legislation and I believe that for those who suffer abuse, their first problem is recourse to protection, recourse to some solution rather than what exact legislation there is as to what protection can be given to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matter more therefore are the provisions for violence protection, violence prevention and family rehabilitation. For example, technically speaking, the entire Family Violence Bill could actually be incorporated as an entirety, as an amended section in the Women's Charter rather than a separate Bill per se.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said these, I would like to add that it does seem odd to include family violence for all members of the family, including husbands and elderly parents under the Women's Charter. If this is the course of action of the Government, then I am in favour of the proposal of changing the title from Women's Charter to Family Charter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the provisions against family violence, there are two issues which I would like to address. The first issue is that of a central role given to counselling. I believe that counselling is indeed an important step towards reconciliation, a first step, nevertheless, but a very important step and counselling for the victim, the abuser as well as the other members of the family, for example, children who have witnessed constant abuse of one parent by another is a vital aspect of the rehabilitation process and in as much as abusers are often reluctant to undergo counselling, this needs to be made mandatory. I therefore support the provision for mandatory counselling for the abuser in the Family Violence Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would suggest that not only counselling be made mandatory but
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that treatment of illnesses which could lead to family violence also be made compulsory. For example, there is, at present, no such provision for abusers who become violent because of, say, alcoholism or mental illness, to undergo compulsory treatment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is that of protection for the victim. The objective here is to facilitate protection of the victim in such a manner which is the least disruptive to the family and there are two alternatives before us - the Family Violence Bill which advocates a direct intervention of the police and the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter which make it easier for the victim to obtain a Protection Order from the court.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are pros and cons of those approaches. One strong case for the empowerment of the police is that it does lessen the burden of action on the victim who is already undergoing severe emotional trauma. In this, the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter to make it easier to obtain a Protection Order may perhaps not go far enough in offering immediate protection for the victim. The victim still has to go through a series of procedures in order to apply for the Protection Order. Furthermore, applying for a Protection Order takes time and effort with no guarantee of preservation of privacy. In this, I would like to suggest that, in terms of the amendments of the Women's Charter, if the amendments could go further in taking care of the preservation of privacy for the victim and in taking care of the ease of applying for a Protection Order, then I think that would go a long way towards facilitating protection for the victim.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one major disadvantage of police involvement and that the Minister for Home Affairs has elaborated on yesterday, so I need not go into it. And I believe that this indeed does constitute a major disadvantage of police involvement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding whether police involvement will make things worse for the family, there are two contrasting opinions. On the one hand, Dr Soin's view is that police investigation in a discreet, quiet manner and, if
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> necessary, advocating counselling for the abuser, does in no way interfere with the intactness of the family and is preferable to obtaining a Protection Order from the court. On the other hand, the Government's view is that police involvement could make things worse for the family. Which point of view is more correct? As somebody who is a non-expert in this issue, I would suggest that we pause for a moment, take the time to deliberate carefully on this issue, perhaps in Select Committee, make reference to available research before making a decision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to another major point. Violence prevention is not merely an issue of legislation alone. A holistic approach to violence prevention would include the strengthening of other institutional aspects. I am glad that the Acting Minister for Community Development mentioned this just now in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to highlight two other dimensions which already exist but which should be further developed. The first is the need to provide greater training for front-line professionals who are directly involved in violence prevention, namely, the police and social workers. Family violence is such a complex issue that those who deal with it should be adequately equipped. For example, violence prevention can usefully be part of the curriculum development of the Police Academy. There is also an urgent need for more trained social workers, including from the university, especially if counselling is given a central role in violence prevention. At a broader level, greater understanding in society regarding family violence and violence prevention would be helpful. Public education has a valuable role to play.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second dimension is the need to strengthen the linkages between each component in the violence prevention system to ensure that the system, as a whole, works smoothly and effectively. The Inter-Ministry Work Group is a good start to collaboration between the various Government agencies and voluntary welfare organisations. Further integration of these linkages, such as between the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> police and the voluntary welfare organisations, for example, in the Ang Mo Kio pilot project, would be positively helpful.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the nub of the matter is financing. Needless to say, violence prevention is not a profitable operation. It cannot function on the bottom line basis unlike, say, for example, the MRT. If the Government is serious in preventing family violence, and I believe it is, then it is time that they should commit more resources and funds to violence prevention work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, many of the provisions of the Family Violence Bill have much merit and are worthy of serious consideration. If the view of the Government is that the Family Violence Bill goes too far, I would submit that perhaps the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter do not go far enough. Perhaps, some middle ground could be found, for example, in Select Committee deliberations of the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter. If it is the collective view of experts and practitioners that legislating police intervention is too extreme, why not as an alternative provide for strengthened police intervention by training the police so that the attitude of the police is one of sensitivity, of having enough training, of expertise, in order to deal with cases of family violence. It is my sincere wish that we will very soon see strengthened legislation against family violence. I reiterate that it is the provisions which count, not the location of those provisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the spirit and a number of provisions of the Family Violence Bill.

  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all the Members who have taken the time and trouble to contribute to this debate which is, I think, a very important social issue. I would also like to express my thanks to those who commended me for my efforts in coming out with this Bill. My special appreciation goes to the few lone voices supporting the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I was listening to the response of the Members to the Family Violence Bill, I had the feeling that some of us were not talking on the same wave-length. In spite of quoting official statistics, some of the Members still made the point that we should not overblow the problem. I find that difficult to accept. If there is a problem, there is a problem. By pretending that it is smaller, it is not going to go away. And, here, I would like to refer to the Acting Minister, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, and his reference to statistics. I am afraid that Government has only been keeping statistics for family violence in the year 1994 so there is no way for me to show whether the problem is increasing or not and that was not what I was indicating. All I said is that we had a big problem on our hands and I think the statistics do bear me out on that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next misunderstanding seems to be the very concept of family violence. Some Members referred to it interchangeably as a family dispute and, thus, talked of the problems of settling family disputes. Of course, all of us in this House know how notoriously unrewarding it is to intervene in family disputes. However, family violence is not just a family dispute. It is an abuse of power within a relationship of family trust or dependency. Because it is an abuse of power, nearly always it is the one with more power who inflicts violence on the less powerful.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate this. More husbands abuse their wives than the other way round. It is mothers who abuse their younger children and not the other way round. It is grown-up children who abuse their elderly parents or grandparents and not the other way round. Of course, one could have a dispute between a grown-up child and his grandparent and most of us would be reluctant to intervene to settle who is wrong and who is right. Even the most astute judge will find it difficult. However, if he finds that whatever the apparent dispute, if he finds that the elderly parent or grandparent is being beaten up by the grown-up child, are we still going to insist that as it is only a family dispute, the law should be hesitant
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to intervene, and if the law does intervene, as it has been mentioned under the Penal Code, it is not suitable to intervene?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main aim should be to stop the violence and it is less important whether or not we can settle the dispute. The two parties can continue with whatever disagreement or dispute as long as one does not use violence on the other party. Since family violence is caused by an abuse of power irrespective of other factors, like alcohol and drug dependency which are only aggravating factors, there is still an underlying abuse of power. There has to be a vulnerable member in the relationship who is the victim. It cannot be that, this week, the grandparent beats up the grown-up child and, next week, the grown-up child beats up the grandparent. Whatever the dispute or disagreement, what remains constant is that the grandparent is the one who gets beaten up and the grandparent is the victim. So the victim remains constant. Since a vulnerable member of society is being subjected to violence, I cannot accept the view that society does not have a role, in fact a duty to stop this violence. We will be guilty of an act of commission if we do not respond effectively to the pleas for help of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective existing mechanism which society has to curb violence is the justice system with its arm of law enforcement. By not using this available mechanism effectively and fully, we are in fact condoning family violence by expecting social service agencies and informal avenues to solve the problem, although I am not at all excluding the role of these agencies and avenues. But this should only be in addition to the most important role of legislation and the police. Unless we accept this, the issue of family violence cannot be addressed effectively and adequately.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to turn to some major concerns expressed in this House. One, the fear of the heavy-handed approach of the law. The very purpose of the Family Violence Bill is to eliminate the heavy hand which is now present under the Penal Code and in place of this heavy hand, extend a family sensitive approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> This family-friendly role is the centre piece of the Family Violence Bill. However, unfortunately, this does not seem to have been appreciated enough by Members of this House. The Minister for Home Affairs has said that the Family Violence Bill makes family violence a specific offence in which even first-time abusers could be jailed for acts, such as harassing family members. This is not what the Family Violence Bill sets out to do. Yes, the Family Violence Bill does make family violence a specific offence but it does not jail first-time abusers. That is the whole point of the Bill. It offers counselling instead of prosecution and jail. There is no heavy hand of the police but a family responsive approach.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill should not be characterised as antagonistic towards families and doing more harm than good. I cannot understand this interpretation of the Bill. If there are a few provisions in the Bill which appear to give this interpretation, I am sure that, with legal advice, we could change the interpretation of these provisions. The Minister for Home Affairs said that, under the present law, the police have enough powers to act in domestic violence and cited that the police took prosecution action in some simple hurt cases. I notice that this happened in 14 cases out of 3,625 cases in 1994. The Minister then said that in only seven out of these 14 cases were victims willing to proceed with prosecution. This is precisely the problem that the Family Violence Bill tries to address. The victims do not want the abusers to be jailed but they want the law to intervene in such a way that the beating stops without the abusers going to jail. This expectation of the victims should be anticipated and the police would not be frustrated if they are attuned to the dynamics of abusive relationships and thus alert to the issues of dependency, fear, general haplessness and responsibility for the children, which is what prevents victims from wanting the abusers to go to jail. Thus, this is another point that the Bill makes, ie, the present laws are not appropriate for family violence. Even if the police had enough powers and laws to prosecute offenders, these powers and laws are not suitable for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> family violence cases. And if they are abused, then they will end up in a situation of trying to fit a round plug into a square hole.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is borne out by what the Minister has told us of the frustrations of the police and the waste of resources. If the laws and powers for the police were formulated within the framework of the dynamics of abusive relationships, then there would be no frustrations and no waste of resources. If we are using the wrong instrument to do an operation, obviously the operation will fail.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main concern of the Family Violence Bill has been to take into consideration the complexities of family violence and this legislation is attempting to be responsive to the situation of family violence. Thus, although it makes family violence a specific offence, it does not prosecute the offender initially and very few people have highlighted this. All that has been highlighted is that if an offender commits violence after counselling or refuses to have counselling, then he is prosecuted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we need to compare another scenario. And this scenario is if we look at the Protection Orders which are given to the victims, and especially now that the Acting Minister for Community Development has suggested that powers of arrest be attached in the first instance. Sir, we have a victim who goes to court first and then gets a Protection Order with a power of arrest. The next time she is beaten up, the police are obliged to arrest the offender because the offender has breached the court order, which is a very serious offence. And this time, the police are obliged to prosecute the offender and this time the police do not even have the discretion of offering counselling. So after getting a Protection Order and if the Protection Order is breached, the police have to prosecute the offender and send him to jail.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Family Violence Bill, the victims go to the police. The police do not send the offender to jail in the first instance. They advise counselling. And
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> after that, if another offence occurs, only does prosecution and jail come into the picture. So what is the difference? Eventually, on the second offence, it is exactly the same thing. But for the first time, if we look at it under the Women's Charter amendments, the onus is on the victim. She goes to court and gets the Protection Order. Under the Family Violence Bill, the onus is on the police who give the option to the offender of getting counselling and not hauling him to court. So I still feel that the approach is not as different as it has been made out to seem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fact that has to be highlighted is that in the Family Violence Bill, we are taking into account the wishes of the victim and the need to keep the family intact. But we are ensuring that the offender takes responsibility for his actions and is willing to go for counselling, so that there is a possibility of violence ending in the family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fact that has to be highlighted is that there is resistance in this House to empowering the police to help the victim. This is the main objection to the Bill. The rest of the Bill seems acceptable as the Women's Charter amendments and the Bill are pretty much similar. Many Members have accepted the amendments of the Women's Charter in principle, although we have not seen the actual amendments yet. Thus, the main thrust of the debate is the objection to this part of the Family Violence Bill that gives the police more powers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I find surprising is that although Members of the House are resisting this, the situation is different when seen from the point of view of front-line professionals in family service centres and social work agencies who are dealing with family violence on the ground. They are convinced that there is a definite role for the police and at present, this is not being fulfilled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we resolve this divergent thinking, as put by the hon. Member, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan? I would like to suggest to the two Ministers involved that we ought to look more closely at this difference in approach and try to come
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to a common platform of action. The Minister for Home Affairs has also mentioned these difficulties which the police will face in addressing the problem of family violence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There is a shortage of manpower to deal with all cases of family violence. There are 90-100 police posts in Singapore. Ten cases of family violence are reported daily. If only one in 10 police posts has to handle one case a day, this does not appear to be such a burden. However, if more manpower is required, then I am sure that the Minister for Finance, who is fortunately in the House this time, would agree to permitting more finances for this. He would agree if we convince him that the effects of family violence are going to cost society more in the long run, both in economic terms and social effects. To use an old proverb, "a stitch in time saves nine" is very appropriate here. And the Minister for Finance, being a very astute Minister for Finance, would see the advantage of spending money now so that we do not end up by spending it long term with the added social effects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The other point that the Minister for Home Affairs mentioned was that the police personnel are either national servicemen or young men below 25 years of age and cannot handle family violence cases. This is not an insurmountable obstacle and the police can be trained for this. I was heartened to hear from the Minister that the police are already beginning to be trained. And I would also urge the Minister not to look at the role of the policemen only to solve crimes, not to look at them only in the form of cops and robbers, but to extend the role of the police into the community, which I understand is already being done, where the police and the community are one part of a whole, and not just to solve crimes, like as I said robberies, thefts, murders, which, fortunately, the numbers are going down very much in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like we have a rape squad dealing with rape victims, we could also have a family protection squad to deal with family violence cases. Here, the involved officers need not all come from the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The Ministry of Community Development could also help to provide a group of specially trained family protection officers to work with the police. I would therefore like to urge the two Ministers to give some thought to this proposal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to highlight at this stage is that the Women's Charter amendments also involve a big police role. I have already outlined what happens when a Protection Order is breached and the police then have to come in to arrest the offender, because this is mandatory if there is a power of arrest attached to that order. I do not think that the role of the police can be eliminated or reduced whether you apply the Family Violence Bill approach or the Women's Charter amendments approach. However, the Family Violence Bill has the added advantage of offering one more option to the victims. The victims and those people who deal with this problem on the ground want this option to be available. Should we continue to deny to them? Of course, I understand and empathise that at this stage we do not have enough counsellors or trained police officers to attend to this very real problem. If the Family Violence Bill becomes legislation, it does not have to come into effect straightaway. We could plan to have the infrastructure ready in the next one or two years and only then put the legislation into effect. However, if we do not move the legislation now, we will not have the legislative framework and it will be difficult to get things going quickly and in a focused manner. The Bill could be the impetus to effecting changes to produce the necessary front-line professionals. This should solve the matter of logistics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to address a few specific queries that were raised yesterday. One was on clause 3(1)(a) which refers to an attempt to cause family violence. This is no different from the present section 68(2) of the Women's Charter where threatening to use violence is justification for the granting of Protection Orders. So why are Members put off with this part of the definition of family violence?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(1)(c) says, "compelling a family member by force to engage in any
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sexual act or conduct;". Members have to remember that family members extend beyond spouses. We should not confine ourselves to spouses alone here and just talk of marital rape. In any event, marital rape is not an offence under the Penal Code and therefore the intention of this Bill is not to make an issue of marital rape. However, just for information, I have this pamphlet of the Ministry of Community Development passed out yesterday and their definition of "abuse" includes when you are threatened by force to engage involuntarily in sexual relations. So even the Ministry of Community Development recognises this as a form of abuse.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(1)(d) says, "wrongfully restraining or confining a family member against his will;". Correction towards a child below 21 years of age has been clearly excluded in the Bill and so there is no ambiguity where discipline towards young people is concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(1)(e) says, "causing harassment with intent to cause ... anguish ...". Those of us who are familiar with domestic violence will know that stalking, ie, following the victim around after she moves into a shelter or alternative residence and making harassing phone calls at her place of work are two frequent forms of harassment. This form of harassment causes fear and intimidation in the victim. We should not trivialise the issue by talking of nagging as harassment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trained police officers or enforcement officers should be able to make a distinction between actual harassment and mere nagging. The hon. Member, Mr Bernard Chen, said that the very act of going to court will break up the family. If he truly believes that, then how can he support the amendments to the Women's Charter which must involve the victim and the abuser to go to court to get a Protection Order?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> I have not supported yet!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> The hon. Member, Mr Low Thia Khiang, was concerned with clauses 13 and 19. He felt that clause 13
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> gave too much powers to the police. This could be modified, if necessary, by necessitating that the police get a warrant of arrest from a Magistrate, as is done in the Children and Young Persons Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 which allows any person to give information to the police on commission of family violence is another area of concern. Even if this clause is not present, no one can stop a person from giving information to the police on any offence. However, if this clause causes some anxiety to Members, then it could be deleted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, recommended that legislation should be made according to our own social norms. This is precisely what has been attempted in the Family Violence Bill. Part III of this Bill is innovative legislation to suit our local conditions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now address some of the concerns expressed today. I think I have answered some of them in my other remarks, but first of all I would like to say how happy I am that Mr Tarmugi had announced that the amendments to the Women's Charter would go to a Select Committee and there would be an opportunity to give in more inputs at that time. I think it is very commendable of him to do so. It involves the community and all of us to continue this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter that he was quite unhappy about was clause 13(2) where he said that the interpretation obliges the police to investigate every case of violence. I am sure that he is right although my understanding was different. But at the same time what it requires of us is to make the police officers understand what is the offence of family violence and, as I said yesterday, it is not an isolated slap. If they understand what is the offence of family violence, then they are going to investigate it but after investigating, if they find that there is no offence they are not going to pursue the matter. But if there is an offence, then of course, they should pursue the matter if it is a specific offence. If, as I said earlier, the Minister thinks that this is too wide, I am sure we can find a way to address his concerns in not making clause 13(1) as intimidating as it appears.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he also talks of the discretion of the police. No legislation can take away the discretion of the police. It is always there. They can always decide whether to pursue with a particular case, of course, with the Attorney-General's advice, or not to pursue it. So I do not think the Bill can possibly take away the discretion of the police.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter that the Minister said is that it makes simple hurt and grievous hurt a seizable offence. But I would like to remind the Minister that in the Children and Young Persons Act a precedent has already been set by making both simple hurt and grievous hurt as seizable offence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter which is not very important, but I think it is good to clarify, is that the Minister said that the Society Against Family Violence was not consulted and had no part in this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> No, in drafting this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> In drafting this part of the Bill. I beg your pardon. I would like to tell him of the input of the Society Against Family Violence into this Bill. The last President of the Society Against Family Violence and their Consultant Counsellor had a long discussion with me where we went through the provisions of the Bill and they gave their input to it. Also, the Vice-President ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> May I clarify, Sir?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> resumed her seat.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true and I do concede that the Vice-President of the Society Against Family Violence did have a hand in drafting the Bill. That is Dr Alfred Choy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> No, I was talking of the past President of the Society Against Family Violence, Dr Esther Wong. She and Dr Clyde Moorthy went through the provisions of the Bill with me because Ms Claire Chiang, who is the President of the Society Against Family Violence, told me that she is sending Dr Esther Wong as her representative to discuss the Bill with me as she had some urgent personal matter to attend and would I then accept
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that as her voice. But Dr Alfred Choy, who is the Vice-President of the Society Against Family Violence helped the Bill in his personal capacity, and not as a Vice-President.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Yes, that is right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> But I still think that the Society Against Family Violence seems to be getting a lot of attention and even the Minister for Home Affairs quoted the letter from Ms Claire Chiang. I respect her expertise in this area, but I think there are other experts, social workers and many other people who do not agree with that line of thinking. As Dr Lee Tsao Yuan has said, we are not experts. We are not able to judge who is right and who is not.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure I have not addressed some concerns. The hon. Mr Kenneth Chen said that it was introducing litigation to the family at an early stage. I have already addressed that. That even in Protection Orders, if they are breached, we have to take the abuser and the victim to court.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about the introduction of police intervention at an early stage and the family loses control. No, I think at any stage if the victim does not want to pursue the matter with the police, the police cannot continue with the matter because they cannot then carry out the investigations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter that he mentioned was that we must only call the police as a last resort. I agree. Usually when the victims go to the police, it is not for the first time that they have been beaten up. It is usually after a number of times that they go to the police. So it is usually a plea for help. At that stage, they do need help.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo said that family violence is the tail-end of family problems and we should concentrate on tackling family problems. I completely agree with him. But family violence is a problem and thus also needs to be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Aline Wong raised some very important philosophical and thoughtful questions and I think many of us do not have the answers to that. In her usual very thought-provoking way, she has added another dimension to the debate.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are points that I have not made clear, I would like the indulgence of the House because I do not want to take up any more time. I have been urged by some Members of this House to withdraw the Family Violence Bill. I have given this serious consideration. I have no wish at all to enter into any legislative battle with the Acting Minister for Community Development. I respect him far too much for that. However, I feel that I cannot withdraw the Family Violence Bill. As I indicated earlier, it is not my Bill but embodies the effort of many people. It takes into consideration the hopes of many victims. It respects the viewpoint of many professionals working on the ground who want effective family-friendly legislation. I think I would be failing in my duty to all these people if I withdraw the Bill. What is not important to me is the final name and the form that the substance of the Family Violence Bill eventually takes. However, the principle and the spirit of the Bill are very important and cannot be set aside. This is the message that will come through if I withdraw the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish again to express my appreciation to the Minister for Home Affairs and to the Acting Minister for Community Development in keeping an open mind to listen to a Private Member's Bill and in agreeing to look at the provisions that could be incorporated into legislation so that the final objective of all of us is achieved in this House, that is, we try to reduce the incidence of family violence and at the same time keep the family intact. I would again like to thank the Speaker and the House very much for listening so patiently to me for two days.

  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Asian Development Bank Act (Chapter 15), resolves that the Minister for Finance be authorised to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> increase, on behalf of the Government, the total subscription of Singapore to the authorised capital stock of the Asian Development Bank by a sum not exceeding seventy-two million and six hundred thousand United States dollars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank has adopted a Resolution to increase the capital stock of the Bank by 100%. This is the fourth increase in the Bank's capital stock. The first increase of 150% took place in 1972, the second increase of 135% in 1977, and the third increase of 105% in 1983.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Singapore's subscription to the authorised capital of the Asian Development Bank totals 6,020 shares. Under the proposed increase, we have been allotted a further 6,020 shares amounting to US$72.6 million. 2% of this amount has to be paid in.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to authorise the Government to increase the total subscription of Singapore to the authorised capital stock of the Asian Development Bank by a sum not exceeding US$72,600,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Asian Development Bank Act (Chapter 15), resolves that the Minister for Finance be authorised to increase, on behalf of the Government, the total subscription of Singapore to the authorised capital stock of the Asian Development Bank by a sum not exceeding seventy-two million and six hundred thousand United States dollars.

   <b>MAINTENANCE OF PARENTS BILL</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maintenance of Parents Bill was committed by a resolution of this House to a Select Committee on 27th July 1994, more than a year ago. 1,003 written representations were received, which I think might very well be a record. However, only nine representors were invited to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> give evidence and Members will see the details of this evidence in the Report that has been presented to the House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I summarised the debate during the Second Reading of the Bill last year, I did say that many Members had made very good suggestions as to the creation of a non-argumentative and non-confrontational mechanism. But I also, as a Private Member, was not in a position to promise anything. I expressed the hope at that time that the Acting Minister for Community Development would look into the possibility of creating such a non-confrontational mechanism and that the Minister for Finance would look indulgently on financing the mechanism. I am glad to report to the House that that is exactly what the Acting Minister for Community Development has done and I am in his debt and in the debt of his officials for all the hard work that they have put in to create this new and non-confrontational mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I might just take the House briefly through the changes that have been made. The primary change takes the question of maintenance of parents away from the courts which are not equipped to deal with family disputes or family matters, and to vest it in a specially created tribunal, a tribunal that is now established under clause 13 of the proposed Bill. The Tribunal will have a President who is legally trained and other members who are not necessarily legally trained. One of the features of this Tribunal is that no lawyers will be allowed to represent clients because the introduction of lawyers in sensitive matters like this, ie, to sling mud at the other side, tends to exacerbate the differences amongst the parties. So we have taken away the legal representation although, of course, if there is an appeal to the High Court or Court of Appeal, lawyers might come in. One hopes that the disputes will not go that far. So for the most part it would be the applicants themselves, the parties themselves who appear or, with the permission of the Tribunal, who have a representative who is not paid, or a Commissioner, which is also provided for in the Bill, may make an application on behalf of an applicant.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tribunal would not be bound by the normal rules of evidence, nor would it hear in public unless there is an application to do so. Again, it is a sensitive thing. Apart from the creation of the Tribunal, there has been fine-tuning of the provisions of the Bill. A minimum age has been stipulated to be tied to the Retirement Age, although people who are unable to support themselves physically or because of mental infirmity will be able to make applications even though they are below that minimum age.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill has also been confined not only to those who are domiciled in Singapore but also to those who are residents. Perhaps I might just explain this. The legal concept of "domicile" does not require a person to stay in Singapore. And a concern was expressed that there might be in future bedroom communities of elderly Singaporeans resident outside Singapore but who have not abandoned their Singapore homeland, as it were, and rather than have a situation where these people are asking to be supported, the Select Committee accepted the recommendation made by one representor that only those who are resident in Singapore as well as being domiciled in Singapore should be entitled to make an application.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, as amended, also states the definition when a person is unable to maintain himself and makes clear now in clause 3 that we are not talking about sharing the wealth. So the concern of some people that parents might try to get a share of the wealth of their children undeservedly would have been addressed. This is not meant to ensure that you can have a share of your children's wealth. This is basically to ensure that you are supported at the basic minimum, to provide basic amenities and physical needs. And this, one will find in clause 3 of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions of the Bill are consequential on the creation of a Tribunal and a Commissioner. They provide for matters like costs and procedures. The Minister is empowered to make rules to implement this Bill and to address the concern that some people have raised
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that there might be vexatious claimants, the rules will also provide the Tribunal with power to dismiss vexatious claims at an early stage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all in all, may I say to Members that I hope with these changes, much of the reservations that were expressed at the Second Reading of the Bill may have been addressed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say once again, so that I am not misunderstood, that I do not think that this will solve the problem of parents who are not maintained because the law is not a panacea. But with this in place, with education in place, and with the continuing emphasis that we have placed on preservation of the family and family values, I have every confidence that we may be able to preserve family as the basic building block of our society. It is my sincere hope that nobody has to make recourse to the Tribunal, but if that is required, at least, the mechanism is there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I end by once again thanking all the Members who have spoken for the Bill or against the Bill and the representors who have taken the time to write in and to appear, and again to the Ministry officials and to the Minister for his support.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) notes with regret that the Secretary-General of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), Dr Chee Soon Juan, with two other SDP members, attended the "alternative panel" discussion organised by Dr George Crane in Williams College on 15 September 1995, and there endorsed Mr Francis Seow's attacks on the judiciary, and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) deplores the SDP's support for a baseless attack by a fugitive from justice on the independence and integrity of our judiciary and legal system, that ensure the rule of law in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, an honest and independent judiciary is a key pillar of our political system. The 1994 World Competitiveness Report, by Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF), rated Singapore ahead of Japan, Britain and the United States in terms of public confidence in the fair administration of justice. Singapore is the only Asian country in the top ten. The Hong Kong based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) has also ranked Singapore's legal system as the best in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one - I repeat - no one, Singaporean or foreigner, should be allowed to attack or question the integrity or independence of the judiciary, without being challenged either to back his criticisms with evidence, or withdraw them and apologise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are familiar with the events surrounding the award of an honorary degree to Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in September by his alma mater, Williams College in Massachusetts. Dr George Crane, a faculty member, organised opposition to the award in the College. He got William Safire, the New York Times columnist, to write a venomous article against the Prime Minister and Singapore. George Crane himself wrote a long article, which was published in the Washington Post on 30th August 1995. This was not an isolated effort by a few academics in one liberal arts college in Massachusetts. The Prime Minister's visit, and the award of his honorary degree, became the focus of a major campaign by some US media and human rights group to humiliate the Prime Minister and cut Singapore down to size.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Crane organised an "alternative panel" discussion on 15th September, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> day before the Prime Minister was due to receive his degree. He invited Mr Francis Seow, Dr Christopher Lingle, and Dr Chee Soon Juan to speak at the panel.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis Seow had colluded with US diplomats who were interfering in Singapore politics, after receiving assurances of support from the US should anything go wrong. Seow absconded before his trial for tax evasion charges, and is now a fugitive from justice in the United States, and a convicted criminal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lingle was convicted by a Singapore court for committing contempt of court, arising from an article he wrote for the International Herald Tribune, which accused the Singapore judiciary of being compliant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Crane invited Dr Chee because he needed someone from Singapore to lend credibility to the alternative panel. Dr Chee had already sought to participate in the debate at NUS, which the Prime Minister had offered William Safire and George Crane, but which Safire and Crane regrettably declined. Crane got Polis, a student association, to pay for Dr Chee's air ticket. Dr Chee immediately accepted, and duly turned up at Crane's alternative panel to associate himself with Francis Seow and Lingle.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee did not go to Williams College in his personal capacity. Two other SDP members accompanied him, and attended the panel discussion together with him. They are Mr Wong Hong Toy, the Vice-Chairman of the SDP, and Mr Mike Chan, an SDP member. Both Mr Wong Hong Toy and Mr Mike Chan are employees of Bukit Gombak Town Council, whose Chairman is Mr Ling How Doong. Mr Wong Hong Toy is the Community Relation Manager and Mr Mike Chan is the Estate Manager. Furthermore, Dr Chee himself is the Legislative Assistant to both Mr Ling How Doong and Mr Cheo Chai Chen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1993, after Mr Chiam See Tong resigned from the SDP Central Executive Committee, the remaining CEC members, including Dr Chee Soon Juan, Mr Wong Hong Toy, Mr Ling How Doong and Mr Cheo Chai Chen declared that they constituted a "collective leadership", and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that the CEC would be the policy-making body of the party, as laid down in the SDP Constitution. The SDP CEC said in a letter to its party members, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This is the bone of contention between the CEC and Mr Chiam. A party calling itself democratic must have a democratic decision-making process.'
  <br>
  <br>This was reported in the Straits Times on 26th June 1993.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the high-powered SDP delegation to Williams College, which included both the Secretary-General and the Vice-Chairman of the party must have gone with the authority of the SDP collective leadership. We must therefore hold the SDP Members of Parliament, who include two SDP CEC members, accountable for the actions of Dr Chee Soon Juan and his SDP delegation in Williams College.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis Seow's speech at the alternative panel on 15th September was an unfounded frontal attack on the independence and integrity of the Singapore judiciary. Among other accusations, Seow charged that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. "The judiciary in Singapore is neither independent nor free. It is pliant. It is corrupt. It is beholden to the PM (by which he referred to SM Lee) and the establishment. Judges in Singapore are invariably leaning over backwards in favour of the Government and the establishment, and award them with grotesque sums in damages for so-called defamation ... the rule of Lee has displaced the rule of law in Singapore."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Mr Lee Kuan Yew "appointed as Chief Justice of Singapore a banker, who had not practised law for two decades, whose superior claim to this illustrious position was that he was a faithful crony"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Mr Lee Kuan Yew "uses the courts as a legal weapon with which to bankrupt or cripple the opposition", because he is "confident that these judges know on which side the judicial bread is buttered."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Christopher Lingle also spoke at the panel. He alleged that while courts in Singapore follow commercial law, contract law and property law very closely, he went on to say, I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the problems come in when there may be a dispute that involves the Government and the opposition or critics. Businessmen are unlikely to have any engagements in courts on any ground other than commercial. This creates an illusion of a rule of law as opposed to the rule of Lee ... I actually refer to it as lawless order, because there is an illusion of law and order, ... this perception of order based upon arbitrary enforcement of law."
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee Soon Juan was the last person to speak at the alternative panel. He spoke from the floor, at the end of the question and answer session. Sir, with your permission, may I ask the Clerk of Parliament to circulate to Members copies of the transcript of Dr Chee's remarks at the alternative panel. [Copies of transcript distributed to hon. Members]. Sir, I obtained the transcript from journalists who were present at the alternative panel. I have highlighted the key passages, paragraphs 2 and 5. Members will note that not only did Dr Chee not rebut Francis Seow and Lingle or defend our judiciary, but his very first statement was, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've heard a lot of comments and questions about Singapore and Singapore's government this evening and I must say that I do agree very much with many things that Mr Seow and Dr Lingle have said and that even as we speak, me and my colleagues that are here this evening are going through some of these difficulties." (Paragraph 2)
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Dr Chee "agreed very much with many things that Mr Seow and Dr Lingle have said". In other words, without having to utter their unfounded allegations himself, he had endorsed Francis Seow's and Lingle's attacks on the Singapore judiciary. Dr Chee "agreed very much" with them that the Singapore judiciary is pliant and corrupt, and is being used by Mr Lee Kuan Yew as a legal weapon to bankrupt or cripple the opposition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee went on to say that while Mr Goh Chok Tong had promised to work for more open and consultative government, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My own feeling is that he has not come very far. But when you look at the constraints he has to work under, not least of which is the presence of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the difficulties become very evident." (Paragraph 5)
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Dr Chee was saying that these problems with the judiciary highlighted by Francis Seow and Lingle had been very serious problems in the past. Furthermore, because Mr Lee Kuan Yew has prevented Prime Minister Goh from making this a kinder, gentler Singapore, the situation has not improved much, and the problems still continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I gave notice that I would be moving this motion in Parliament, the SDP issued a statement signed by Dr Chee Soon Juan. It challenged the PAP to produce evidence to back our accusations that the SDP had supported Seow's claims, and offered to issue a public apology if such statements could be found. I have produced the transcript of its Secretary General's statements at the alternative panel just now.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee has demanded that the media publish in full his speech at Williams College, claiming that this will vindicate him. The SDP has since published its own version of events in a Special Williams College edition of its party organ, The New Democrat. Sir, with your permission, may I ask the Clerk of Parliament to circulate to Members copies of this issue New Democrat Issue No. 3, 1995. [Copies of The New Democrat distributed to hon. Members]. Members will note that The New Democrat completely blacked out the fact that the SDP delegation attended the alternative panel with Francis Seow and Lingle. It does not carry Francis Seow's and Lingle's speeches, nor a single word of Dr Chee's remarks at the alternative panel! Why this glaring omission? It is because the SDP and Dr Chee know that what Dr Chee said at the alternative panel at Williams College was wrong, and are trying to cover it up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier I have circulated the transcript of Dr Chee's remarks at the alternative panel and the Special Williams College edition of The New Democrat, so that Members can see for themselves the dishonesty of the SDP. This is yet another example of Dr Chee altering the record after the event, in order to deceive the public about the wrongs he has committed. He did it with Dr Vasoo over the minutes of the meeting with the Dean of NUS, Prof. Ernest Chew, when he called them "fabricated". He is a compulsive liar.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Chee's comments at the alternative panel were not casual remarks. Dr Chee was completely familiar with the issue of the integrity of our judiciary. On 7th August, Dr Chee had offered to go to Williams College to rebut William Safire's criticisms of Singapore. In a letter to the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> newspapers on 12th August, I had asked Dr Chee not to wait for an invitation to Williams College, but to state his stand immediately on Safire's most serious criticisms against the integrity of the judiciary:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Did Dr Chee agree with Safire, that we had a "corrupt judiciary" who were "black-robed enforcers of conformity"?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Did Dr Chee agree with Safire's descriptions of Christopher Lingle as being "out of reach of corrupt judges' crippling fines and canes", and of Francis Seow as an "exiled Singapore dissident ... now a fellow at Harvard Law School"? and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Did Dr Chee agree with Safire that in the Flor Contemplacion case, the Government had covered up official wrong-doing and wrongly hanged Contemplacion?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee refused to answer my questions. Therefore, when Francis Seow and Lingle repeated these accusations against the judiciary, and Dr Chee said "I do agree very much with many things that Mr Seow and Dr Lingle have said", he thought he had cleverly delivered a blow on the Singapore judiciary without having uttered the allegations himself, but using the mouths of Francis Seow and Lingle.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the alternative panel, Dr Chee referred to the speech he would be delivering the next day, 16th September, where he would address "some of these misperceptions, positive or negative" about Singapore. This is the speech printed in The New Democrat Issue No. 3, 1995.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee's speech of 16th September is significant, both for what he said, and also for what he did not say. In it, Dr Chee said: "If you believe everything that Mr William Safire has said in his columns a few months back, then you are mistaken about Singapore." He then listed out specifically which of Safire's criticisms he disagreed with, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore is not like Burma or China or the erstwhile Soviet Union. Although I maybe under surveillance, I travel freely in and out of the country. Although the national newspapers are government-controlled, press statements and letters expressing the views of my party are published. Although the sale of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> chewing gum is banned, and chewing of gum doesn't carry a $1,000 fine. Although the penalty for drug trafficking is death, smoking a marijuana cigarette does not automatically earn you a place on death row. Singaporeans enjoy a high standard of living with a relatively safe environment. The civil service is efficient and the PAP government is comparatively corrupt-free. Ours is not a dictatorial regime Iraqi-style although we have a long way to go before we find democracy.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a prepared speech from a written text, not an off-the-cuff comments. Dr Chee referred specifically to it at the alternative panel. So we must treat it as part of Dr Chee's response to any "misperceptions, positive or negative" which he felt the participants or the audience at the alternative panel had.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a month earlier, in my letter of 12th August, I had asked Dr Chee which of Safire's grave criticisms he disagreed with. The list in this speech was Dr Chee's answer. It was a considered, comprehensive catalogue of what, in Dr Chee's opinion, were Safire's errors. By clever implication, he endorsed the other Safire's criticisms as true.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee went into some detail in rebutting William Safire: on chewing gum, on smoking marijuana, on the standard of living. Yet Dr Chee never rebutted Safire's serious allegations against the judiciary. He thought that he had cleverly left unsaid that he agreed with these allegations against the judiciary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the SDP delegation returned from Williams College, the SDP has had at least two more opportunities to clarify and correct its stand. On 21st September, I wrote to the newspapers again asking Dr Chee why he had agreed with Francis Seow at the alternative panel, instead of rebutting him, if, as Dr Chee claimed, the purpose of his visit to Williams College was to "clear up any misperception that Americans might have about Singapore, and to set the record straight." Dr Chee could have used his reply to my letter to repudiate Francis Seow's criticisms of the judiciary and explain that he held the judiciary in high regard, even though he had failed to do so earlier. But again he chose not to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second opportunity, Sir, was on 10th October, when Mr Chan Heng Wing, Press
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Secretary to the Prime Minister, wrote to the press listing out Francis Seow's criticisms again, and pressing the SDP to have the honesty either to rebut them or to endorse them. The SDP has done neither. So it is necessary for me to move this motion in this House to specifically press the SDP for its position on this important issue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Dr Chee and his delegation represented the SDP in Williams College, what he said there obviously did not represent the view of every SDP MP. On 9th October, Mr Chiam See Tong told a forum organised by the NUS Democratic Socialist Club that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Political stability was critical to the country's continued success. It was therefore important, when Singapore was attacked by other countries, for opposition parties to set aside local party politics and close ranks with the Government ... The opposition must be credible, effective and patriotic. Singapore was a tiny nation dependent on foreign investments for its survival. It could not afford to have its politicians make comments which could undermine its political stability.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam did not directly address Dr Chee's actions in Williams College, but his meaning is clear. Mr Chiam has more than once sued PAP Ministers and MPs for defamation, and they had apologised and paid him damages. Both he and Mr Ling How Doong are lawyers, and hence officers of the High Court. They must understand how our judiciary and legal system operate. Both Mr Ling and Mr Chiam and also Mr Cheo Chai Chen should state in this House whether or not they endorse and support Francis Seow's attacks on the judiciary at Williams College, as Dr Chee has done by deliberately omitting to list these allegations among the items he mentioned, like chewing gum, smoking marijuana and so on. This is a final opportunity for the SDP to come clean.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Workers' Party has also issued a statement saying that it does not wish to enter into a debate over "what Dr Chee said or did not say at Williams College". This is irresponsible, dishonest equivocation. The Singapore judiciary is either independent or it is not. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Secretary-General of the Workers' Party, Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, is a lawyer. As an MP, he was censured by Parliament after a full hearing of the Committee of Privileges, for making completely unfounded allegations of executive interference in the judiciary. He lost his Parliamentary seat after the courts convicted him of criminal offences - cheating, fraud and false declaration. For the Workers' Party, therefore, to have no view on the independence and integrity of the judiciary is unbelievable. Mr Low Thia Khiang, as an MP, must either make a stand, or be seen to be condoning and abetting Dr Chee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I intend to call for a division at the end of the debate, so that the House will know where every Member stands on this issue. If the Opposition MPs oppose my motion, let them tell the House the reasons why and vote against it. But if they contrive to absent themselves when the vote is taken, they will be shown up as being as much tricky twisters as Dr Chee Soon Juan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDP claims to aspire to become the alternative government of Singapore. If the SDP MPs fail to clarify their stand on their Secretary-General's actions and statements in Williams College, they are undermining the key pillar of the rule of law in Singapore, and becoming party to Dr Chee's back-handed efforts to knock down our very system of government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore ask the House to deplore the SDP's support for a baseless attack by a fugitive from justice on the independence and integrity of our judiciary and legal system that ensure the rule of law in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Davinder Singh (Toa Payoh GRC):</b> Sir, laws are vital for the maintenance of order in society. Laws are made to prescribe the rights and obligations of government and those who are governed. Our laws also define the norms of acceptable social conduct.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws will only be effective if they are respected by the people. There is no universal law which prescribes that all citizens must support legislation or decrees made by States. People accept legislation only if, first, there is a deep-rooted and widespread belief that the executive and/or the legislature's motives in passing or amending legislation are nothing short of honourable and, secondly, that the laws will be fairly and justly applied and enforced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most well-intentioned piece of legislation will be ineffectual if a dishonest judiciary disregards the law. If that happens, it undermines all the work done by the executive and the legislature. People who lose faith in the judiciary will lose their trust in the entire system. It is very important to understand that in the majority of cases, the average man encounters the law only when he is in court.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law only becomes a reality and relevant to them when they are alleged to have transgressed it or when a dispute arises which cannot be resolved without judicial intervention. A rotten judiciary will leave a lasting impression on anyone hoping to see justice served. An accused or a litigant who feels that he has been short-changed by the courts because of extra-legal factors will not only lose his respect for the judiciary, but for the system. Why should he have any regard for a government which has fixed the judicial odds?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people lose respect for the judiciary, they also lose regard for Members of Parliament, because the perception will be that we make laws in the knowledge that those laws will not be justly applied
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and enforced. Therefore, the legislature comes in for criticism every time the judiciary comes in for attack. We therefore have a duty and a responsibility to demand that those who allege corruption prove it or abandon the charge.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another reason why we cannot sit back and do nothing. Judges are in an extremely difficult position. They have the power to punish anyone for any act or publication which is calculated to bring the court or a judge into contempt, or to lower his authority. If someone says that the judicial system is crooked, the courts can and will punish. But every time the courts do that, they expose themselves to further criticism. The judiciary, as a rule, does not engage in a debate with the public or its accusers on the issue of its independence and integrity. It therefore cannot defend itself. Parliament therefore has a responsibility to protect the honour of our judges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the duty of every Member of Parliament, first, to take a position if and when one of our institutions is ridiculed or discredited and, secondly, to justify his or her stand. We have a duty to defend the system or, if there is a flaw, change it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion has been inspired by the recent events at Williams College and their aftermath in Singapore. These are the facts:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15th September 1995, Dr Chee attended a counter panel discussion held by those opposed to the honour bestowed by Williams College on our Prime Minister. It was chaired by Mr Crane. Mr Seow was one of the panellists.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seow attacked the judiciary in Singapore. Among other things, he said that the judiciary is neither free nor independent and that judges "lean over backwards in favour of government". He described Chief Justice Yong as a "faithful crony" of Senior Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same discussion, Dr Chee, speaking from the floor, said, "I must say that I do agree very much with many things that Mr Seow and Dr Lingle have said." Dr Chee also said that he and his party faced some of the difficulties which
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Mr Seow talked about. He then went on to inform those present that he would be speaking the following day during which he hoped to address misperceptions "positive or negative" about Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following day, Dr Chee spoke on a number of issues. In his speech, he commented on some of the criticisms that had been levelled against Singapore. However, he was silent on Mr Seow's attack on our judiciary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from these facts, the issues in this motion are whether Dr Chee and the SDP have endorsed and/or supported an attack on the independence and integrity of our judiciary and, if so, whether there is any basis for the attack?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with the first issue. Did Dr Chee and the SDP endorse and support the attack on our judiciary? It has been suggested by Dr Chee and the SDP that they have not endorsed or supported Mr Seow's view because neither has made a statement impugning the integrity of the judiciary. That, with respect, misses the point. While it is true that ordinarily a statement is made by an express assertion of fact, it is equally true that one can make a statement by one's conduct. It is also the case that while usually very little can be construed from mere silence, in some circumstances, silence speaks volumes about one's true intentions and beliefs. The question here really is, do the circumstances of this episode entitle us to infer that the SDP has, by its inaction and other conduct, made a positive assertion of fact in respect of our judiciary?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a letter of 8th September 1995, Dr Chee informed the Prime Minister that he intended to present the SDP's alternative ideas for Singapore at the counter panel discussion at Williams College, and sought a meeting with the Prime Minister. In his reply, the Prime Minister's Press Secretary assailed Dr Chee's motives for agreeing to be a party to that discussion. In particular, the Press Secretary said, and I quote, "Your desire to see the Prime Minister in Williams College does not prove your
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> commitment to Singapore." In a press statement issued on 10th September 1995 on SDP's notepaper, Dr Chee signing off as Secretary-General, stated that the SDP's participation "is to clear any misperceptions that anyone may have about Singapore". That is one of the most important statements that has been made by Dr Chee and the SDP in this episode. I repeat it: "to clear any misperceptions that anyone may have about Singapore". That statement, which was carried in the Straits Times on the following day, was made specifically in response to a challenge to SDP's commitment to Singapore. Dr Chee and the SDP attempted to dispel the notion that they are anti-Singaporean by promising to clear any misperceptions about Singapore. In other words, to defend Singapore against unjustified attack.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Dr Chee and the SDP expressly represented to Singaporeans that if, in SDP's view, any unjustified allegations against Singapore are made at the counter panel discussion, he and the SDP would clear the air. Dr Chee and the SDP therefore voluntarily undertook, and assumed a duty, to all Singaporeans to defend our system if it came in for what, in their view, was baseless criticism, and to take a stand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the discussion, Mr Seow disparaged the judiciary, the legal system, and the rule of law in Singapore. The SDP was represented by three persons, including its Secretary-General and Vice-Chairman. But Dr Chee and his two colleagues were conspicuously silent on this attack. There was no rebuttal either at the discussion or in Dr Chee's speech the following day.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Dr Chee's and SDP's view, Mr Seow's claim that our judiciary is corrupt was either a misperception or it was not. If it was a misperception, Dr Chee and the SDP were under a duty, and had undertaken, to Singaporeans to speak up to clarify the matter. They remained silent when Mr Seow discredited our legal system. Their failure to refute the criticisms of our judiciary is consistent only with one conclusion: that the SDP and Dr Chee did not consider it to be a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> misperception. In other words, they considered that Mr Seow had a legitimate basis to discredit and run down our judiciary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we give SDP the benefit of the doubt. There are other possible interpretations of SDP's failure to rebut Mr Seow's claims. First, that the SDP was so caught up in the discussion at Williams College that it forgot to clear up the misperception. Secondly, that Dr Chee disagreed with Mr Seow but was too diffident to clear the air. Let me deal with each in turn.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, was there an oversight? The SDP's conduct before, during and after the event militates against any such interpretation. Well before Williams College, in a letter published in the Straits Times on 12th August 1995, Dr Ow asked Dr Chee to state whether he disagreed with the views of Mr Safire who had labelled our judiciary "corrupt". Dr Chee avoided dealing with this in his reply.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Williams College, Dr Chee did not once suggest that Mr Seow's views on the system in Singapore was a misperception. He did not do so at the counter panel discussion or during his speech the following day. Remember that, according to Dr Chee, one of the purposes of attending the counter panel discussion at Williams College was to address misperceptions about Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Williams College, Dr Chee and the SDP had many opportunities to clear up this possible misperception, this time, on the part of the PAP, about SDP's stand on the judiciary. After Dr Chee returned to Singapore, Dr Ow challenged him to state his stand about Mr Seow's attack on our judiciary. Dr Ow's letter was published in the Straits Times on 21st September 1995. Dr Ow reminded Dr Chee that during the counter panel discussion, Dr Chee had said that he and his party faced some of the constraints which Mr Seow talked about. Here was an excellent opportunity for Dr Chee to clear the air and to take a stand. Dr Chee, replying as Secretary-General of the SDP, chose not to address the issue. In fact, he and the SDP repeated that the SDP was at Williams College "to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> clear up misperceptions foreigners might have about our country". There was no doubt in their own minds about their mission.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the other possible interpretation of Dr Chee's conduct? Was he too reticent to rebut Mr Seow? Again, this is not at all a reasonable inference for the simple reason that Dr Chee has himself claimed that he "will speak forthrightly concerning matters about my country". He said this in the Straits Times of 27th September 1995. Here is the Secretary-General of a party saying that he will not mince words when it concerns an issue affecting Singapore. It is therefore impossible, on any view, to conclude that Dr Chee and the SDP were coy about setting the record straight.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the only inference which can be drawn? The SDP by its own claim has said, not once, but twice, that one of its objectives in attending the counter panel discussion was to put right misperceptions about Singapore. And yet, in the face of Mr Seow's charge, and despite many opportunities to clarify, not only has the SDP maintained a silence about the integrity of our judiciary, Dr Chee has not once resiled from his assertion that "I agree very much with many things that Mr Seow and Dr Lingle have said." That remains his and the SDP's stand up till today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDP had another opportunity to clear up the misperception, if it believed that Mr Seow's views on our system were without basis. On 10th October 1995, the Straits Times published a letter from the Prime Minister's Press Secretary. In that letter, Dr Chee was asked to clarify his position regarding the independence of our judiciary in the light of Mr Seow's allegations. Dr Chee's reply was published on 17th October 1995. The reply was issued in his capacity as Secretary-General of the SDP. Again, the SDP refused to deal with the issue. There is not one word in that letter which clarifies the position, one way or the other.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary to make a positive assertion of fact to endorse or support an attack. Where, as here, a political party
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and its Secretary-General assume a duty, indeed undertake, to defend Singapore against unfair criticisms, but remain silent in the face of an assault on our judiciary, and indeed declare agreement with many things that Mr Seow has said, the irresistible conclusion must be that SDP's silence and conduct amount to a clear and unequivocal endorsement of that attack.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the second issue, which is, is there any basis for the attack? The allegations which Mr Seow made are in essence:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the judiciary is beholden to the [Senior Minister] and the establishment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the Chief Justice is a "faithful crony" of the Senior Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the "judges are invariably leaning over backwards in favour of the Government and the establishment."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hallmark of an independent judiciary is its ability to decide in accordance with the law without fear or favour and without regard to the identity or standing of the parties. Are our courts independent? Let us test the point by a few examples.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seow has claimed that Chief Justice Yong was appointed because he was a "faithful crony" and that the "rule of Lee has displaced the rule of law in Singapore". Consider this. In 1990, Mr Jeyaretnam filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal against a decision of the High Court. The other party was the Senior Minister. The Senior Minister applied to strike out one of Mr Jeyaretnam's grounds of appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Senior Minister's application and awarded costs against the Senior Minister. Presiding were the Chief Justice, Justice L P Thean and Justice Chan Sek Keong, who is now the Attorney-General. Ask yourselves: Is the Chief Justice "a faithful crony"? Would the Court have so ruled if it was beholden to the Senior Minister or was corrupt?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seow has also claimed "that judges are invariably leaning over backwards in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> favour of Government and the establishment". A foreign company which wanted to buy land in Singapore had given undertakings to the Controller of Housing not to sell that land. Those undertakings were secured by bank guarantees. The company granted options over the land conditional on the purchaser obtaining the necessary qualifying certificate to purchase the land. The Controller took the view that the grant and acceptance of the options amounted to a breach of the undertakings which gave him ground to forfeit the guarantees. He forfeited $7.8 million. The company appealed to the Minister for Law who referred it to the Ministry of National Development which disallowed the appeal. The Government chose to retain the $7.8 million. The company went to court. The Court of Appeal ordered the Government to return the $7.8 million with interest and costs. Is this an example of a court which leans over backwards for the Government and the establishment?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are only illustrations. We should therefore ask ourselves why is it that those who discredit our judges choose to ignore such decisions. This House must demand that the SDP, indeed anyone wishing to make out a case against the judiciary, satisfy two tests: first, to show that the decisions in favour of the Government, the Senior Minister and the Prime Minister are so perverse that they cannot be justified on any view of the law. In that connection, the SDP must explain why is it that in some of those cases, the Privy Council has upheld the decisions of our Court of Appeal. The second test that the SDP has to satisfy is to demonstrate how the allegations against the judiciary are consistent with the fact that courts in Singapore have ruled against the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that SDP Members of Parliament were not at Williams College is, with respect, irrelevant. In all the material press statements and letters published in connection with this affair, Dr Chee has used the SDP notepaper, or signed off as Secretary-General of the party, or both. In his letter of 8th September 1995 to the Prime Minister he
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> said that he would put the SDP's alternative ideas of Singapore. In his 10th September 1995 press statement, he confirms that it is SDP which will participate at the counter panel discussion and that it is SDP's objective to clear any misperceptions. Dr Chee, as Secretary-General, was clearly authorised to issue the letters and statements on behalf of the party. Therefore, SDP was at Williams College and is in this House. More significantly, two of SDP's Members of Parliament are members of the bar. They are in a better position than Dr Chee to comment on the judiciary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDP Members of Parliament have the following options in the face of this motion: they can either expressly repudiate their present endorsement for Mr Seow's views or they can maintain their support for his claims in which case they are duty bound to justify the basis of the criticism.

  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from 1959 to 1990, I was responsible for appointing all Judges of the Supreme Court. Like all my other appointments throughout the Government, the statutory boards, the civil service, these Judges were appointed strictly on merit. The main attributes that I looked for were integrity, ability, qualifications and suitability for the job. If I had indulged in nepotism and cronyism, Singapore would not be what it is today, with a government, civil service, a police force, a whole structure of an establishment which is acknowledged, not just by businessmen but even by foreign correspondents who do not much favour us, to be 'squeaky clean' - in other words, honest, efficient and fair, where rules cannot be circumvented by gifts, and money politics does not exist.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When appointments are for life, as with Judges, I take the utmost care to make sure that the men and women to be appointed do not fail for lack of character, integrity or independence of mind and judgement, for having been appointed for life, they will become serious problems with effects on our social development and our economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appointed the first Singaporean Chief Justice of Singapore in 1963. The person I appointed, Mr Justice Wee Chong Jin, was already a High Court Judge appointed by a previous Governor, and he held his appointment by Letters Patent from the British Queen. So his qualification to be a judge was not based on my criteria but on the Governor's criteria in the days before elected governments. I elevated him from the Bench to the Chief Justiceship. He stayed on as Chief Justice from 1963 to 1990. Many judgements went against the Government. He was never removed. He reached retirement age; I extended it twice because there was no suitable alternative.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had planned to resign as Prime Minister at the end of 1990. One of my most important last appointments before I retired was to appoint the Chief Justice to succeed Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin. I weighed the merits of several candidates. I discussed the matter with all the Judges, separately. Each of the Judges listed for me the three best persons he considered suitable for the office, always excluding himself. With each Judge I separately went through the list of members of the Singapore Bar. I considered several outstanding lawyers from the Malaysian Bar, and looked at a few possibles elsewhere, including Hong Kong. I re-discussed the matter with the four judges who knew Mr Yong Pung How well. They all rated him the best of the possibles, excluding themselves. They were: Mr A P Rajah, Mr Punch Coomaraswamy, Mr L P Thean, and Mr S K Chan. Finally, there were four Judges of the Supreme Court who knew him and knew all the other Judges and knew all the members of the Bar who were suitable for the job. And without hesitation, they said that this man, in their view, was the most suitable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally decided on Yong Pung How because I was going to make an offer to a man who was at the top of the Singapore banking community. We were fellow students for three years at the Cambridge Law School from 1946 - 50 years ago. I knew his quality of work and his meticulous standards, and I knew them well. I had borrowed his lecture notes for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> my first term in 1946 in Cambridge because I had missed them. I had gone off to the London School of Economics and missed the first term when I decided to change from London to Cambridge. He returned and practised law both in Malaysia and Singapore for 20 years. In 1970 when he was already the head of one of the largest law firms in both countries (Singapore and Malaysia), Shook Lin and Bok, which had been started by his father, himself a lawyer, he decided to leave the law for banking. He became the head of the merchant bank, SIMBL, and later a Director and Vice-Chairman of our largest local bank, the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1981 Dr Goh Keng Swee, then doing a special job for me to form the Government Investment Corporation (GIC) - and he had Mr Lim Kim San as the first Managing Director - decided to ask OCBC to lend Yong Pung How to the Government Investment Corporation as Managing Director. He had known him separately as a banker. Later he became also Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore because his competence was beyond doubt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chairman, GIC, I could see from his work that he was the same Yong Pung How I had known as a student: thorough, meticulous, and scrupulously fair in his presentation of the alternatives for investment projects before expressing his preferences. That is a very important quality for a judge. He had his preferences, but he presented the various options scrupulously and fairly, so that if the Board decided to take a different view from him they could pursue the merits, in detail, of the other options. In June 1983 he left both GIC and MAS and returned to OCBC as Chairman.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1976 I had offered him an appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court. He was then Vice-Chairman of OCBC. He declined. In 1989, when I asked him to consider the office of Chief Justice, telling him that this was my last appointment before my retirement, he asked for time to consider it. If he agreed,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> he would have to take up an appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court for a year before he took up his appointment as Chief Justice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Chairman of OCBC, in the first six months of 1989 he earned $1.3 million from his salary, bonuses, and pay in lieu of leave. In other words, if he had stayed on in OCBC, he would have earned $2.6 million for the whole of 1989. The previous year, 1988, he had earned $1.3 million; because it was a less prosperous year for the bank with smaller bonuses. These were cash payments, excluding his entitlements to share options. As a Judge of the Supreme Court, he would receive, and, in fact, did receive, for the second six months of 1989 the princely sum of $0.177 million ($177,000) - less than one-seventh of his OCBC remuneration for the first six months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered it carefully for a month and told me that he would accept the appointment. He left OCBC and was appointed a Judge of Supreme Court on 1st July 1989. In September 1990 when Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin retired, I appointed him Chief Justice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yong Pung How's integrity, ability and standing were already well established amongst bankers both in Singapore and internationally. He is not an unknown person, like Mr Francis Seow. He is known to people who deal in billions of dollars of investments, as a man of honour. And in London, he is amongst London bankers a respected figure. In the last five years, he has earned the respect of the Bar, not as my friend, but as the Chief Justice. More than 200 of his judgements in the last five years have been published in our law reports. They are there for all to read and to judge. It is absurd for anyone to suggest that a man would give up his position as Chairman of our largest bank, earning more than $2.6 million a year, to become a compliant Chief Justice for less than one-fifth the salary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He undertook the job as a matter of duty. Of course, money did not matter to him so much because he had inherited some properties from his parents and so was not deterred by the loss of income as
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a banker. However, Singapore cannot in future depend on finding a Chief Justice who happens to be good and bedecked with ability, integrity and judicial temperament who also happens to have inherited properties from his parents. Hence, I urged upon the Prime Minister the need for a fundamental revision of salaries from the President downwards, including the Chief Justice, the Judges and the civil servants, so that they are now earning 60% of their market earnings, of their peers in the private sector and, in the longer term, two-thirds of their market earnings.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore is to remain squeaky clean when that revolutionary generation that threw me and my colleagues up cannot be reproduced, this is the only way. Face the alternatives and we will avoid the discomfiture of many other countries. We are not South Korea, we are not the Philippines, we are not Taiwan, we are not Thailand. They are the countries lauded by the American press as examples for us. I shudder to think that Singapore travels that road. Because unlike them, we do not have that hinterland to pay for such excesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time your constituent asks you, why should the Minister be paid so much, tell him the Minister handles in billions of dollars. One signature from the Minister can make or break a company, not just a man. Therefore, he must be a man of that quality, that standing, that integrity. And if he is not worth 60% of what his private sector counterparts are getting, he should not be holding that job. Settle for Francis Seow or Dr Chee Soon Juan - all you need do is to pay for his wife's postage to send the PhD thesis for correction. It is cheap.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never needed the Courts to deal with troublesome problems which I can deal with by executive decision under the law. As Prime Minister, I reserved executive powers in the Internal Security Act and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, both inherited from British times, which I did not repeal, in order to be able to act against subversives or criminals like drug traffickers, against whom there is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> insufficient evidence for a court of law, without having recourse to the courts. In other words, I was my own carrier of a hatchet. I needed no hatchet man. All those who have dealt with me know that I have never flinched from going into a dark street on a dark night and if it happens to be a cul-de-sac, no outlet, either the gangster or I will come out alive. I have done this a few times. I am prepared to do this again.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the Government, including me, takes a matter to court or when the Government is taken by private individuals to court, then the court must adjudicate upon the issues strictly on their merits and in accordance with the law. To have it otherwise is to lose us our standing and to lose us our status as an investment and financial centre. Fortune magazine is owned by Time Warner. We have restricted Time magazine for refusing to publish our replies. We are no favourites of Time Warner. But they carried out two independent surveys and they rated Singapore No. 1 investment centre.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of documents, of contracts in accordance with the law is crucial. Our reputation for the rule of law has been and is a valuable economic asset, part of our capital, although an intangible one. It has brought to Singapore good returns from the MNCs, the OHQs, the banks, the financial institutions, and the flood of capital to buy up properties in Singapore. A country that has no rule of law, where the government acts capriciously is not a country wealthy men from other countries would sink money in in real estate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the difficulties of getting good men on the Supreme Court was the meagre salaries paid to judges compared to their earnings at the Bar. And it was only in recent years, after the Ministerial and Judicial salaries were revised, that it has been possible to fill the vacancies on the Supreme Court Bench with men and women of the right quality. Most of the appointments to the Bench have been from the private practice because many in the Government service had left when the pay was grossly inadequate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is therefore presently revising Legal Service salaries so that the Service will be able to retain good officers who can, in due course, be promoted to the Bench, and we can maintain a balance between Judges and Judicial Commissioners promoted from the Legal Service and those appointed from private practice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has the present Chief Justice filled up the vacancies? He has combed through the Bar list before he made recommendations to the Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, for 10 appointments as members of the Supreme Court Bench and eight as Judicial Commissioners. Some were appointed to the Supreme Court after a term as Judicial Commissioner. He has been careful, meticulous and thorough in his selections.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he became a Judge in July 1989, he met a large cross section of lawyers, leading members of the Bar. He found out who were the highly respected. From these discussions, he settled a list of 60 possibles, both from the Legal Service and the Bar. Within a year, before he became Chief Justice, he had shortlisted them to 20. He based his selection on the academic background of the person, what the market and the Bar assessed a man to be, and from his knowledge of and conversations with the person, including his appearance before him in the courts. He then sought out the views of each of the Judges and the Judicial Commissioners on the overall integrity, legal ability and likely "judicial temperament" of these persons. Then he sounded out the candidate as to whether he would be interested to have his name considered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1992, he refined the selection process by a quiet poll every 12 to 15 months. Each Judge and each Judicial Commissioner would list three lawyers in order of preference, for their competence in civil work and, separately, in a different list for competence in criminal work. The Judges had the advantage of close observation and interaction with those who appeared before them, and also from their personal knowledge of their peers when they were practising at the Bar. From
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> these rankings, the Chief Justice obtained a rough assessment based on how many Judges and Judicial Commissioners nominated a particular candidate, and also a more precise points score, giving three points for a first place nomination, two for a second place nomination and one for a third. Then he assessed the suitability of each candidate in separate discussions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice used the same method to select the judges he recommended for appointment to the Court of Appeal. Each Judge and Judicial Commissioner named two of themselves they considered the most suitable for promotion to this senior appointment, with a third name in reserve. The two who are appointed were the unanimous choices of all the judges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These appointments to the Supreme Court, and the changes the Chief Justice has made in the administration of the courts in the last five years, have raised the morale, efficiency and effectiveness of the officers of our courts. The transformation has been nothing short of remarkable. Our courts have been brought up to date with the use of Information Technology. The large backlog of cases when we used to wait four, five, six years for trial whilst they were on the court's list, has been cleared. The courts can now keep pace with the work volume of a financial centre like Singapore. The lawyers know the judiciary has come from the best amongst their ranks. They know who has been chosen. They have dealt with them either as partners or as adversaries in the courts. Now the lawyers complain of the pace of work in the courts and it is they who want time to catch up with their work, which is as it should be.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These facts, Sir, have to be placed on the record. When Members read Human Rights groups in America, foreign correspondents who quote these Human Rights groups and their reports, or opposition parties seeking to attack the Government, by attacking the Judiciary, remember that they are out on a campaign to debase our system. They are not interested in investigating the truth. They are carrying out a campaign. Remember that the Singapore
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Chief Justice and Singapore's Judges on the Supreme Court have established reputations and enjoy the respect of the Bar. Otherwise, the World Economic Forum and PERC would not have come to that conclusion. They canvass, they poll, they meet lawyers, they meet businessmen, to find out whether they have got confidence in the system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice has not given up his Chairmanship of OCBC in order to debase himself and become a hatchet man for the Government. And in any case, as I have said, I was always my own hatchet man. I have never needed somebody to carry my scabbard for me.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has discharged the duties of his office with distinction, and he has helped to select for the Supreme Court some of the best and most respected members of the Bar. All those connected with the administration of justice, the legal officers, members of the Bar and there are now over 2,500 members, lawyers in actual practice, the judges, the media, meaning our media and indeed even the foreign media, although they may not wish to report this, watch the Leeson case. When he attacked Singapore and said that he did not want to be extradited because he would not get a fair trial, the International Herald Tribune and the Asian Wall Street Journal plastered it on the front page. When Leeson decided that he would face trial in Singapore and said he apologised for saying that he never had confidence in the Singapore judiciary, not one word was published, not even in the inside pages. Freedom of the press! Are we intimidated?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judges and Judicial Commissioners who have been appointed since November 1990 by the present Prime Minister on the recommendation of the Chief Justice have brought credit to the Singapore Bench. They have maintained the high standards established by the few who had accepted appointment when salaries were inadequate, and who had been holding the fort until salary changes made it possible to get larger numbers of practising lawyers to accept appointments. I may add that rather than appoint lawyers who were not amongst the best at
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Bar, I deliberately left the vacancies on the Supreme Court Bench unfilled. Because it was not in my nature and I knew it would be unwise to fill up those seats with inadequate men. They were lifetime appointments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to observe that our Judges have not been intimidated by the baseless attacks on their integrity from the foreign media, from doing what their conscience and the law requires of them as Judges. Their conduct of cases in open court, their judgments published for the record, their character all bear the closest scrutiny. If it was nonsensical, absurd, preposterous, if Dr Lingle had not committed contempt of court and the IHT had been wrongly convicted, they would have torn the judgments to strips. There were arguments in open court on both sides by the Attorney-General and lawyers amongst the best from the Singapore Bar and they could have brought in Queen's Counsel from London. And if the judgments could not justify the findings, then the judgments would have been torn to strips.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is all this about? From time to time since 1987, American Human Rights groups, like Asiawatch and through Asiawatch, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, have made baseless and scurrilous allegations that our judiciary is not independent. It all started in 1987 over the Marxist conspirators' arrest, when we were not intimidated by their attacks on us for using the Internal Security Act. We refused to yield. So they went on a vendetta and a crusade. They got the American Bar Association of the City of New York to come here and did a cursory talk around and came out with a report. So we are intimidated?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the SDP, through its Secretary General, Dr Chee Soon Juan, has endorsed these allegations, cleverly using - so he thought - what Francis Seow and Christopher Lingle said at the alternative panel discussion at Williams College. He did not utter these words. He just happened to be present. But he denied other things which were untrue like chewing gum with a $1,000 fine or smoking marijuana carrying the death penalty. That is untrue. There is a Latin tag
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> which says expressio unius est exclusio alterius. When you list out the items which you say are untrue, by implication, all the others are true, because you have brought your mind to bear on it. The trouble with him is that he is too clever by half. He always forgets what he said in his last letter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not Dr Chee we are beating up. We are beating up, in the argument, the people who want to make use of him. Can he change this system? Is he ever likely to get an alternative group of men to put forward to Singapore a shadow cabinet that the people could vote in? Is anybody of any quality joining him since his hunger strike in 1993?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who then are we bugging? American Human Rights groups, the American media who think that we ought to change. We have succeeded by the free market system which they espoused. We have benefitted from the system of laws, the stability which they have ensured. Therefore, we must be the ideal development country. We should not deviate and form a different kind of system. They want the whole of Asia, and eventually the whole of the world, to be ideal societies like them. They argue, they fight, they contend. They have marches where the blacks gathered in Washington, one million strong, and demand justice for all the horrors inflicted upon the blacks for hundreds of years. That is democracy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We prefer to approach our problems in a different way. We have our difficulties. We have our minorities who lag behind. We do not deny it. But our solution is to solve it in a realistic way, not by argument and debate. We will end up in riots. If Utusan Melayu and Lianhe Zaobao everyday agitate for their particular cause, would we be here to debate and discuss these things with such academic calm? Those of you too young should look at the footage of film clips, long before video, of how a picture of a Dutch girl who had been converted into Islam, sent by a British judge to a convent pending a custody suit between the adopted mother and real mother, a Dutch woman and a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Malay woman, caused a riot in which the Singapore Police Force, which was largely Malays, was inert for 72 hours, and British troops had to come down from Malaya to restore law and order.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are authoritarian. When we do this, we are like the dictatorships, just slightly better. As Dr Chee says, we are not as bad as the Soviet Union. I am grateful.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not going to retreat because they want us to change. If we are going to change for the better, I would say we would be stupid to stay put. Will we change for the better? As the Prime Minister said in his National Day Rally speech, let us give 10 years. In fact, we may know even earlier, in five years, whether the course taken by the Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, of a free rambunctious press where anything goes, brings about enlightenment and progress. Or whether our more sedate but truthful presentation of news and facts, without stirring up emotions, leads to more rational conclusions about what we should do for ourselves in the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were a crook outfit, a rogue outfit, if in fact the Chief Justice is a crony of mine and all the Judges are his cronies who will do his bidding, would we bring this debate into this House and air it? We will be hiding in a corner. But the appointments made can bear scrutiny. What have we to be ashamed of? I am not ashamed of Singapore. I am not ashamed for having arrested Francis Seow or sanctioning his arrest under ISA to discover and confirm that an American diplomat had egged him on to get a group of lawyers to contest the elections and get into Parliament and break up the monopoly of the PAP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did that in the Philippines. He proudly told our Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials how he helped Mrs Aquino to get into power. Good luck to the Philippines and Mrs Aquino, but do not do this in Singapore. We have managed our own business. We have not done so badly. We are making progress. Please leave us alone. Our people are not stupid. When they vote, they know that if they vote wrongly, and they really vote out the PAP
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government and vote in the Opposition, what would happen to them. I think it is perfectly legitimate for the PAP Government to say the choice is yours. But they want us to follow their system where every step you take is contested and contended. The US President cannot pass his Budget because the House of Representatives says they want to cut some $350 billion to trim the Budget. The President cannot appoint 17 or 18 Ambassadors because the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has decided to hold all appointments hostage until there is a cut in certain items which he desires. So the PLO is unable to get $500 million. This is from the latest news I was listening to on BBC at lunch time. They have to close down their offices. Every day is a tussle between American sumo wrestlers in the legislative arena. America has survived on that contention. But I suggest to this House that we do a lot better because we are differently constituted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that at the end of 10 years we will be doing a lot better despite all the troubles we will get from Asiawatch, Association of the Bar of the City of New York, or the Harvard Law School giving a postal address for Francis Seow. You may impress Americans with that postal address, but you have not changed the nature of Francis Seow and who he is and what he is with Singaporeans. So I have noted with great interest that Dr Chee distanced himself with Francis Seow. He did not go on with him on the same platform. He wanted to keep his distance. He did not want to be treated like Francis Seow. He knows that that carries no credits, no votes, in Singapore. If Francis Seow were a Nelson Mandela, how different it would be. We have invited him, the Prime Minister in his letter through the Ambassador, to come back. We want him back, face his charges, maximum a few months' jail. A fighter for freedom to change the whole system, intimidated by a few months' jail, which will make him into a martyr and rally the masses behind him to overthrow the system? Instead, he sends little letters to the press from the safety and refuge of America.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we must expect this to continue and we will do well every time we read it, and after a while, I believe also that our neighbours have taken note of what has happened, as indeed you can see from the newspapers, editorials from Bangkok, from Jakarta, that when William Safire was invited to Singapore for an open debate, he chose not to come. So was Dr Crane. I had always been under the impression that they were the ones who were for an exchange of views. Who did they want to convince? Williams College students about the future of Singapore? Or Singaporeans about the future of Singapore? That is what is at stake. So let us not forget that in the midst of this debate, we are talking about our future. We are not interested really in how America is run, but we are profoundly interested in whether we are making the right steps forward for ourselves. I believe it is not in our interest to have it said that our judges are compliant and corrupt. [Applause].
