<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Applications for transfer of flats)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development if he will ascertain from

the  Housing  and Development Board the  number  of

outstanding applications for



transfer  of  flats,  as at the  latest  convenient

date,   of   applicants  whose  family   membership

consists  of  (i)  5 to 7 persons;  (ii)  8  to  10

persons; and (iii) 11 or more persons; and  against

these  family membership groupings, the  number  of

applicants who have waited for one year and  under;

two years; three years; and four years and over.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the information

requested



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



for by the Member for Mountbatten is as follows:



<pre>

Waiting Period of         No, of families consisting of

Transfer of Flats          5-7       8-10    11 or more

                    	 Persons   Persons     Persons



(a)Less than 1 year        358       137         20



(b)Between 1 to 2 years    365        46          3



(c)Between 2 to 3 years    187         8         30



(d)Between 3 to 4 years    371        75          7



(e)More than 4 years       390       178         60

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;473 of the 628 applications which are in the 4-years or more waiting period have been offered

alternative accommodation at least once, while some

have  been  offered  flats  more  than  once.   The

remaining cases have not been considered because of

their lower priority, such as requests for transfer

to a similar type of flats or because of unsuitable

locality or trouble with neighbours.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

is   the  Minister  aware  of  the  fact  that  the

applications  for transfer to larger  accommodation

come  mainly from one-room flat dwellers who cannot

afford  to  buy  flats  under  the  home  ownership

scheme?  Will  the Minister urge  the  Housing  and

Development  Board  to speed up the  processing  of

these applications?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With particular reference to those living in my

constituency, will the Minister request the Housing

Board  not  to reserve all the casual vacant  flats

for  resettlement purposes but to release  some  of

these  vacant  flats,  wherever  possible,  for  my

constituents who are on the waiting list? Sir, most

of these constituents have lived in my constituency

for  more  than  a  decade and they  prefer  to  be

transferred within the estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, after that long speech by the

Member, I do not get what the question is. If it is

a   question   of  expediting  the  processing   of

applications, this can be done. But the  number  of

flats  are  limited and the number of  applications

are many.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's own estate, particularly Old

Kallang  Airport  estate and  the  Guillemard  Road

estate,  I have details of outstanding applications

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



transfer. The number of families consisting of  5-7

persons  in these estates who waited for more  than

four  years are about 33; families of 8-10  persons

who  waited  for more than four years  number  only

two; and the number of families consisting of 11 or

more  persons who had to wait for more than a  year

does  not exist. In fact, only two families of such

a  number have waited for less than a year. Most of

the  flats  vacated  existing tenants  in  the  two

estates   that  I  have  referred  to   have   been

allocated,  in  fact,  to transfer-applicants  from

these estates. Of the 46 units vacated in 1973,  34

units  were allocated to transfer cases in  respect

of residents from these two estates. Only two flats

were  allocated  to  resettlement  cases  and   the

remaining  flats  to  public  applicants  and  fire

victims from elsewhere. In fact, I do not know what

the Member of Parliament is grumbling about.

<div align="center"><b>MAIN AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES OF SINGAPORE FOR THE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 1974 TO 31ST MARCH, 1975</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee

of Supply [4th Allotted Day].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question (20th March,

1974),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be

reduced  by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1004.".  - [Mr Teong Eng Siong].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head JA -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that the Minister

is absent and I have something to discuss with him,

I do not know what to do. Perhaps when he comes in,

I  may  raise my question. But for now, I  want  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  perhaps after that little confusion I may  be

allowed to move my amendment. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AC 1201.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not against anti-smoking. This

amendment  is  moved in order to seek clarification

only.  The Anti-Smoking Advertisement Unit  has  an

appropriation  of about $46,000 for  the  financial

year 1974. What does this Unit do, Sir? As far as I

know,  occasionally we see frightening anti-smoking

advertisements  on TV and anti-smoking  posters  on

notice  boards.  Other  than  this,  is  this  Unit

responsible for anything else? If this is all  that

they  do, then could not this work be done  by  the

Publicity  Division  of the  Ministry  of  Culture,

which has an appropriation of about $2 million?  In

these  days  of manpower shortage, to  tie  up  one

Division  II officer and five Division III officers

in  this little Anti-Smoking Unit is a luxury  that

we can ill-afford.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  primary function of the Unit is to  watch  the

mass    media   to   ensure   that   no   cigarette

advertisements are being publicised contrary to the

law.  Other duties of the Anti-Smoking Unit include

routine   and   systematic  checks  for   cigarette

advertisements in hotels, cinemas, theatres,  bars,

restaurants,  markets, villages, etc; dealing  with

applications for exemption under the Act and, where

exemptions  have  been granted,  to  check  on  the

advertisements, be they on vehicles, printed matter

or   signboards;  and  vetting  imported  cigarette

advertisement materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the work has been satisfactory and there

is  very  little or no infringement of the law,  as

most  of the newspapers and other publications know

these restrictions. We have already done the job. I

quite agree with the Member that it is high time we

abolished  this Unit, and the staff  absorbed  into

the administration unit of the Ministry of Culture,

or the Publicity Division, as he has suggested.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> What else can I do, Sir, but

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BA 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what sort of censorship is imposed on the

presentation of commercial advertisements  over  TV

Singapore?  Some  advertisements show  youths  with

long hair romping around speaking of the virtues of

a  cough  mixture.  Surely advertisements  of  this

nature could have been done away with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the press some advertisements with

dubious claims are still being published. Often the

victims  are  women.  For  example,  there  is   an

advertisement  that  claims to  reduce  a  person's

weight  in  minutes. The people who answered  these

advertisements   claimed  that   they   have   been

swindled,  as  the services provided  were  not  in

accord  with  what  these  advertisements  claimed.

Again,  there was another advertisement  showing  a

quack  doctor  recommending  a  certain  drug   for

certain   cures.   This  is  mere  propaganda.   An

advertisement of this nature is misleading and  the

advertiser  is only interested in swindling  people

of their honest earnings.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Sir, the vote on this

subhead  is  to be allocated for the  Head  of  the

Publicity Division. The Publicity Division  of  the

Ministry  of  Culture has no  control  over  TV  or

newspaper  advertisements.  However,  as  for   the

advertisements  on TV, the Broadcasting  Department

sees  to  it that every TV commercial submitted  to

the Department for use is subjected to two separate

censorship   viewings,  first,  by  the  Commercial

Division  and, second, by a panel of viewers  under

the  charge  of the film organiser. In  both  these

areas,  strict control is exercised to ensure  that

the  content  of  the commercial,  both  radio  and

visual, adheres strictly to RTS programme code  and

copy policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many commercials depicting persons with long hair

have been rejected, although these entail a loss of

revenue.  From January 1973 to date, the Department

has  rejected  29  filmlets  on  this  ground.  The

corresponding figure in respect of slides is  four.

My officials in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



the  Broadcasting Department are unable  to  recall

any   commercial  showing  youths  with  long  hair

romping  round  extolling the virtues  of  a  cough

mixture.  Such  a commercial would  not  have  been

allowed for telecast.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the content of advertisements inserted in

the press, my Ministry does not censor them. If the

public  is  cheated by dishonest advertisements,  I

think the matter should more appropriately be dealt

with  by  the  Police, and reports  made  to  them.

However,  if my Ministry finds that any  particular

advertisement   appearing  in  the  newspapers   is

morally objectionable, my Ministry will advise  the

newspaper   concerned   to   stop   carrying   such

advertisements further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the control of advertisements relating to

medical matters, this function is also outside  the

purview  of my Ministry. Such matters are  governed

by the Medicines (Advertisement and Sale) Act which

is  administered  by the Ministry  of  Health.  For

advertisements over TV in which medical claims  are

made  in  respect of certain drugs and  cures,  the

Broadcasting  Department insists on  some  form  of

supporting evidence or material. For example, if  a

claim  is made in a commercial that a certain  drug

is  recommended by doctors, then the Department  of

Broadcasting    requires    the    advertiser    to

substantiate  that such recommendations  have  been

actually  made by doctors. If there  is  any  doubt

regarding  such  claims,  then  the  Department  of

Broadcasting will refer the matter to the  Ministry

of Health.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture said that the

Publicity  Division does not have any control  over

advertisements.  What  then  is  the  duty  of  the

Publicity    Division?   And   are   advertisements

controlled by the Ministry of Culture or some other

Ministry?  Is the Publicity Division controlled  by

the  Ministry of Culture or some other Ministry?  I

do  not know why the Parliamentary Secretary  keeps

on   mentioning   that  that  is  not   under   his

jurisdiction. I do not understand. Mr Speaker, Sir,

1 want my questions answered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary

can explain again.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Sir, I thought I have

already answered the question of TV commercials. As

I  said,  TV  commercials do  not  come  under  the

Publicity Division. It comes under the Broadcasting

Department  of  the  Ministry of  Culture.  I  have

already  explained  that  because  of  this,  other

matters  which are not related to the  Ministry  of

Culture,  for instance, this question of  medicines

or quack doctors and whatnots, come under different

Ministries.  I  hope  the  Member  for   Anson   is

satisfied with this explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot get

a  correct answer from the Parliamentary Secretary.

The  Minister  for Culture is supposed  to  be  the

person who approves these advertisements. Right  or

wrong,   it  must  be  referred  to  the   Ministry

concerned before approval is given. Now, is not the

Broadcasting  Department  under  the  Ministry   of

Culture?   Therefore,  the  Ministry  should   take

action.  But  he  has said that this  matter  comes

under    Broadcasting.   Broadcasting    -    which

department, which Ministry? Ministry of Culture, is

it not? So why is he confusing the issue? He should

not avoid my question, but give a straight answer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do you want him to explain again?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> By all means. Haji Sha'ari Tadin.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I

said   earlier,  the  Publicity  Division  of   the

Ministry  of Culture has no control over  newspaper

advertisements. I thought I have made  that  clear.

Of  course,  if  anybody or  any  reader  has  been

cheated  through newspaper advertisements,  he  can

make  a  report to the Police. And following  that,

the  Police will have to take action. We  have  the

Film  Censorship Board, which has the control  over

advertisements on films, but it has no control over

advertisements in the newspapers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> That is an unsatisfactory

reply. The Broadcasting Department comes under  the

Ministry  of  Culture.  Why  is  he  referring   to

Broadcasting?  His  Ministry  is  the   responsible

Ministry  to take any action. But why  did  he  say

that   the  Publicity  Division  does  not  control

Broadcasting but the Minister for Culture  controls

the  Broadcasting Department? I am very  sorry  for

this barrage of questions. However, I beg leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CA 1107*.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, inflation which is prevailing

now  throughout the world, including Singapore,  is

causing prices to rise, and rise still higher  from

day  to day. Therefore, I think it is inappropriate

for the Minister for Culture to spend $10.2 million

to  implement the plan for colour TV in  Singapore.

The sum to be allocated can be better used by other

Ministries for projects that are more beneficial to

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, workers in the low-income group are still

hoping   for   a  sympathetic  gesture   from   the

Government by giving them a higher salary, so  that

they  can meet the rising cost of living, as prices

are  very  high now. Therefore, it would be  better

for  the  sum  of  $10.2 million to  be  channelled

elsewhere,  so that people in the low-income  group

can  get  more. The Minister himself and the  Prime

Minister have suggested to the people not to  spend

money  unnecessarily.  But  when  the  Ministry  of

Culture implements TV programmes in colour,  people

will  buy  colour  television  sets.  Although  the

Ministry  does not encourage people to  buy  colour

sets, nevertheless the people will be inclined  and

influenced  into buying colour sets  on  instalment

basis. And by paying in instalments, the price



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



will  definitely be higher, and this  will  further

affect  their  cost  of  living,  making  it   more

difficult for them. Therefore, I think it would  be

better for the Ministry of Culture to postpone  the

introduction of colour television to next  year  or

to  some other appropriate time, when inflation has

subsided  and when economic conditions in Singapore

have improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the standard of

broadcasting is quite poor. Some of the  announcers

swallow  their words. I believe the reason is  that

broadcasters   are   chosen   from   their    paper

qualifications   rather  than  their   broadcasting

abilities.  This should not be the  case.  Language

proficiency is very important. It does not  take  a

very  highly  qualified person  to  be  announcers.

Therefore,  I suggest that fluency and  proficiency

in  the  language medium should be considered  when

selecting  candidates for the post.  If  not,  they

should be sent for training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the standard of locally produced

programmes so poor? Is it because our producers are

not  properly  trained? Most of our programmes  are

imported  since  we  lack  expertise  in  producing

scripts. Why we do not get foreign experts to train

our people? I also heard that the payments made  to

the  artistes are very low, but if foreigners come,

they  pay more money. If an artiste is to sing just

a  song  over  TV, he or she has to  go  through  a

number  of  auditions, before the  final  scene  is

shot.  Surely something could be done  about  this.

After all the fuss, the artiste is paid a miserable

mite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that the same faces appear again and

again  on  our local TV programmes? We  cannot  get

other  persons  -only those persons!  Something  is

definitely wrong somewhere. What efforts are  being

made to introduce new blood of screen artistes?  Is

there  a  clique system in the auditioning section?

Probably the system of auditioning artistes has  to

be  reviewed to give more people a chance  to  come

forward to participate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the programmes in the English Section are

imported  ones.  Even the plays  are  BBC-produced.

Surely with a large English-speaking population  we

should  be able to produce some plays over  TV  and

Radio. There are some local theatrical groups whose

performances  are good. Why not televise  them  and

thereby  encourage  them? How  successful  has  the

Broadcasting  Department been in attracting  people

to contribute songs and drama with local colour, or

have the miserable prizes it offers not brought  in

any contributions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago, one could view TV documentaries

quite  often. Documentaries, as one knows,  have  a

very  great educational value and for Singapore  in

particular,  where the population is  young,  these

documentaries  will enhance the  concepts  of  this

world. It is time RTS introduced more documentaries

rather  than  pop singers who were  idols  sometime

ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last Budget session, I pointed out

the  wrong  pronunciation of the word "million"  by

the  Tamil announcers. The Tamil language  is  very

old.  But the Tamil announcers do not seem to  know

the  word "million" in Tamil. They use the  English

word  "million". Last year, I mentioned about  this

and I told them not to use "million". If they speak

Tamil,  use purely the Tamil words. Why  must  they

mix English and Tamil together? If there is no such

word  in the Tamil language, then there is no harm.

But  there is a word for "million" in Tamil. Up to-date no effort has been made to rectify this error.

Why  is this so? When a Member of Parliament shouts

out  his  complaints here, is that the end  of  the

matter, closed up and finished? If so, what is  the

use of talking, talking, and talking again?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I share the

sentiments  expressed  by the  Member  for  Kampung

Kembangan.  However,  I am  most  concerned  as  to

whether it is most appropriate to introduce  colour

television at the present time. I believe there are

approximately 250,000 black and white  TV  sets  in

use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



at  the moment. With the introduction of colour TV,

it  is  expected that a large number of people,  as

has  been  pointed out earlier on,  would  want  to

switch  from black and white to colour  TV  I  have

made  a very quick calculation. Assuming that  only

25  per  cent of the people want colour television,

it  would mean a total expenditure of approximately

$62  million, based on $1,000 per set which is  the

figure given to me by the Minister for Culture.  If

everybody wants to change over to colour, the total

expenditure  would come to $250  million.  As  most

television sets are imported, or even if  they  are

assembled here, most of the parts would still  have

to  come from abroad, and the total spending of the

public  would be a drain on our hard-earned foreign

exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as pointed out earlier on, while we are

urging  people  on  the one hand to  tighten  their

belts  and  to  cut down on personal  spending  and

save,  on the other hand, it would appear  that  we

are  acting  against  our own  policy.  This  is  a

glaring   example   of  the  occasional   lack   of

consistency  in  the implementation  of  Government

policies, suggesting that the left hand often  does

not  know  what the right hand is doing. Government

departments are not the only guilty parties in this

respect. State-owned enterprises are much worse.  I

am sure Members' attention has been drawn in recent

weeks  to huge advertising spaces taken up  by  the

Singapore  Airlines enticing people to  take  their

holidays abroad. This is at a time when the  nation

is  faced  with  an  extra oil deal  of  some  $200

million,  as  pointed  out  by  the  Minister   for

Finance.  Every effort should be made  to  conserve

our  hard-earned foreign exchange, rather  than  to

squander it away on non-essentials which would only

affect our balance of payments position.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after

listening  to  the Member for Jalan  Kayu  and  his

calculations, I am sure that he did not  take  into

consideration what the Ministry of Culture has been

thinking of. Somehow or other, knowing our  Finance

Minister  and the Minister for Culture, I  have  no

doubt  that  they  are thinking of  increasing  the

rates for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



TV  licences. That may also add to the  unnecessary

spending.  When  the Minister or his  Parliamentary

Secretary gives an answer to this subhead, I  would

be  happy  if he could let me know whether  or  not

there  is any intention to increase the TV  licence

charges when colour TV is introduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I also support the Member for Kampung Kembangan and

the  Member for Jalan Kayu. I feel that  colour  TV

should not be introduced into Singapore until  such

time  when  the populace - I am talking  about  the

lower  income  group  - and the  various  community

centres   are   able  to  afford  installing   such

television sets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, there is a technical point

too.  At  the  present moment, colour TV  does  not

cover  the  whole spectrum. Many countries  in  the

world, like Japan and the United States of America,

are going to step up development to have colour  TV

that  would  cover the whole spectrum.  This  would

most  certainly  be  an advantage  because  at  the

present  moment  colours  in  real  life  are   not

faithfully reproduced on colour TV.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

last   year   when   we   were  discussing   colour

television,  there was an overwhelming  demand  for

colour  television.  The time  was  good  then  and

nobody had expected that we were going to have  the

oil  crisis,  and so on. Now suddenly everybody  is

complaining that it would be extravagant  to  spend

money on colour television. However, I believe that

if  the  viewer does not want a colour set, he  can

still receive black and white programmes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

share  the  sentiments expressed by the Member  for

Jalan Kayu over the need to be thrifty. But,  as  I

have  pointed out in the Budget debate  on  Friday,

people  are beginning to wonder whether it  is  now

worthwhile  to save. As I have said, the  new-found

philosophy  seems to be "spend and enjoy  now,  die

later", simply because of the depreciation  of  the

real value of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



money. In Singapore, whether it is this year,  next

year  or ten years later, we must keep up with  the

times. We must have colour television. It is better

to  have it now, because if a colour television set

costs  $1,000 today I think it would probably  cost

$1,500 in two years' time.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> It may be in six months' time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Or in six months' time, and

this  would  be  a  further drain  on  our  foreign

exchange  as we have to pay more for the import  of

colour  TV  sets.  I think colour television  is  a

necessary  form of entertainment. It is  much  more

attractive than black and white. It is one  way  of

keeping  the people at home so that they would  not

waste  their  money  seeking entertainment  outside

their homes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

touching  on the topic of colour television,  I  am

amazed by the rather spontaneous reactions that  we

hear  today  in Parliament against the introduction

of  colour television. As the Member for Bras Basah

rightly  pointed out, last year there was unanimous

applause  for the introduction of colour television

and this year a sudden reverse reaction,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hesitate really to say that we should proceed

with  colour television because, to my mind,  there

must  surely  be  very  good  reasons  behind   the

Ministry of Culture's intention to introduce colour

television.  But we are faced with the  problem  of

international inflation and the rise in oil prices,

and  this should certainly be a new factor  in  our

financial calculations. I therefore do not wish  to

goad  the  Minister  for  Culture  head-on  to  the

introduction  of  colour television.  At  the  same

time, I think it is appropriate for the Ministry to

sit  down  and have a serious calculation,  working

forwards and backwards, to find out if in  fact  we

should proceed with colour television. And if it is

convinced that it is necessary then we carry on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein has correctly pointed out

that  introducing colour television in  two  years'

time might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



mean  a  lot  more  money. We can foresee  that  if

colour television were not introduced by that time,

some Backbenchers or some Members on the Government

side  might come up and say, "Look, two  years  ago

you were against it."



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I think I ought to clarify

myself.  When I spoke against colour television,  I

am  not  against having colour television as  such,

but  it is a question of timing. Take our financial

policy,  for  instance.  Last  year  we  encouraged

people  to spend because times were good.  But  now

because of inflation and other factors, as part and

parcel of our anti-inflation measures, the Monetary

Authority of Singapore and the Ministry of  Finance

have  introduced a whole series of  credit  squeeze

measures. As we all know, the credit squeeze is on.

I  am  not saying that we must not have colour  TV.

The  fact that there was a demand last year and now

we  are  suggesting that there should be a  changed

attitude  is totally immaterial to the point  I  am

trying  to make, i.e, the consistency of Government

policy.  The policy and the implementation  thereof

should be consistent. That is the main point  I  am

trying to emphasise.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before

answering  the  Member  for Kampung  Kembangan  and

other   Members   who  have  suggested   that   the

Government delay the introduction of colour  TV  in

view of the present inflation and high prices which

may  cause  a social burden to our people,  let  me

answer  the  question by the Member  for  Sembawang

first,  as  the Deputy Speaker had ruled  yesterday

that   the  Member's  question  could  be  answered

together  with the others in respect of subhead  CA

1107, for which there is an amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang had asked my Minister

yesterday when colour TV would be ready. And before

I  could give an answer, some Members had also,  in

fact,  dwelt  on the subject. Television  Singapore

will   be  radiating  colour  TV  Trade  and   Test

Transmissions  consisting of Test  Pattern,  slides

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



films  as  from  2nd May, 1974. These transmissions

will be radiated on:



<pre>

&nbsp;Channel  5:   Weekdays   from   10 a.m, to  12 noon

&nbsp;              and 2 p.m, to 3 p.m.

&nbsp;              Saturdays  from   10 a.m, to  12 noon.



&nbsp;Channel  8:  Weekdays in between ETV programme slots

&nbsp;                 (Test Pattern only)

&nbsp;             Saturdays,  Sundays and Public Holidays

&nbsp;             from 2 p.m, to 3 p.m.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pilot colour TV service will be inaugurated in

August,  1974.  Film programmes from  overseas  and

local  documentary  films  will  be  scheduled  for

telecast    on   both   channels   during    normal

transmission  hours. The number of such  programmes

in  colour will be limited to a duration of one  to

two hours a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment orders for studio and outside broadcast

productions  have  already  been  placed,  and   an

extension  to  the pilot service will  be  effected

when these equipment are delivered and installed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, coming back to the

suggestion by the Member for Kampung Kembangan  and

also  other  Members  that  Government  delay   the

introduction of colour TV, which Members have  also

expressed concern, may I be allowed, Sir, to inform

Members  that  we  cannot accede to  their  request

because,  as  Members will recollect,  in  January,

1972,  Government  approved  the  introduction   of

colour TV. The whole project costs over $20 million

over  a  period  of  four  years.  This  House  has

accordingly  voted $2.9 million last year  for  the

project. Since then, a number of tenders have  been

called for the purchase of equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present black and white television service

was  inaugurated in February, 1963. This means that

most of the equipment at our TV station is over  10

years  old, and is due for replacement due to usage

and  fair  wear  and tear It would,  therefore,  be

economically sound at this stage when replacing the

equipment to introduce colour television. Moreover,

if we were to defer this project, Singapore will be

amongst  the last of the South-east Asian countries

to further develop its television service. Thailand

and the Philippines introduced colour television  a

couple of years ago.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to abandon the project at this

juncture, it would also mean that we would  not  be

able  to fully utilise some of the equipment  which

we  ordered  and  which  was delivered  before  the

energy  crisis. In this respect, I  would  like  to

thank  the  Members for Kim Seng,  Bras  Basah  and

Moulmein  who have expressed their support  on  the

introduction of colour TV. We do not know when  the

energy  crisis  will  be over,  although  the  Arab

countries  have already lifted the oil  embargo  to

the  United  States. And if we  were  to  introduce

colour  TV three or four years later, then  we  may

have  to pay a very much higher price. By that time

the  cost  of equipment would have gone up  and  we

would have to pay more for what we are getting now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we introduce colour TV later this year, we

will  telecast  only overseas film  programmes  and

some  local documentary films in colour  for  about

one  to  two hours daily. Local studio and  outside

broadcast  productions in colour will  he  telecast

next  year  when the necessary equipment have  been

delivered and installed. The plan, in other  words,

is  to  "inject" colour programmes into the  normal

service on Channels 5 and 8 in planned stages. This

is  because the technical facilities both at our TV

Studio Centre and Transmitting Station are required

for  use daily whilst new colour equipment is being

installed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV viewers would still be able to watch colour

programmes  on  their  black  and  white  receivers

though  the  pictures will be in black  and  white.

They,  therefore,  need not involve  themselves  in

extra  expenditure in obtaining colour sets. It  is

also my Ministry's intention to advise the People's

Association  to  install  colour  TV  sets  in  the

community centres so that the public at large  can,

if they wish, view colour programmes in colour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question raised by the Member

for  Anson. He says that the broadcasting programme

is  poor  and also that too much emphasis has  been

placed on paper qualification and not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



on   talent.  A  minimum  standard  of  educational

qualification  has  to be set  in  any  recruitment

exercise.  In the case of announcers,  the  minimum

qualification  is  a  School  Certificate  or   its

equivalent.  An  announcer does not only  announce.

His   other   duties   include   the   writing   of

announcements for music programmes and compiling of

records  or of programmes produced in our  studios.

He  also  has  to draft the programme summaries  at

least  twice in a day's transmission. He is  called

upon  to  draft  emergency announcements  as  well.

Depending  on  his versatility, an  announcer  also

interviews,  reads  the news and  comperes  variety

shows. Versatility, it might be stated here,  is  a

very  necessary quality in RTS. In any  recruitment

exercise  for announcers, a voice test is  set  for

all who have applied and who have the minimum paper

qualification. The voice test consists  of  reading

simple  announcements for music programmes,  public

service announcements, commercials and a short news

bulletin.  Language  fluency  and  proficiency  are

essentials for the passing of the voice test.  Only

those  who pass the voice test are invited  to  sit

for  a  written test. The written test consists  of

questions  on  basic  general  knowledge,   current

affairs,  art  and  culture, and  the  drafting  of

simple  announcements  in view  of  the  duties  of

announcers which I have just outlined. Persons with

the potentialities of a good announcer are not easy

to  find.  For  instance, in the  last  recruitment

exercise  held in April last year for  the  English

and  the  Chinese streams, the number of applicants

was  278 for English and 479 for Chinese. Only five

applicants from the 278 and three from the 479 were

found  to  be  suitable. Out of the  five  for  the

English stream, only two eventually joined RTS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the standard of locally-produced

programmes, it depends not only on the  calibre  of

producers  but  also on the budget  allowed  for  a

production and on the talents that one can be found

for   production.  Within  these  limitations,  RTS

producers  have  to  do  their  best  by   way   of

presentation and production. All producers who join

RTS  are  given in-service training. Until recently

RTS had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



two  BBC  consultants to train its staff,  one  for

radio and another for TV programmes. Their services

were   made  possible  through  the  Colombo   Plan

Technical  Assistance Scheme. Training  has  always

been in-service or on-the-job and the trainers  are

senior staff members who have to perform many other

duties  as well. Within these limitations, however,

RTS does its best to provide training opportunities

for its staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the question on the

payment of fees to artistes. The very fact that  an

artiste has, first of all, to be auditioned and  to

turn  up  for at least one rehearsal in the studio,

apart  from a pre-recording session in the case  of

some  variety shows and finally to be  present  for

recording the programme, is an indication that  RTS

producers do their best to be professional in their

productions. Any station in the world which sets  a

high  standard for itself regards these tests as  a

necessary part of production and not a fuss. If the

fee  is deemed miserable, it is another issue.  RTS

can  only  pay  the  fee that is stipulated  in  an

approved schedule of fees and can only spend within

the budget that it is given. It is a fact that very

often it has to make the coat smaller than it  need

be  because of the size of the cloth. Talents of  a

high  standard  are  still  relatively  limited  in

number in Singapore, but no one is barred from  any

audition.  Even when there are no such contests  as

talentime,  RTS welcomes anyone who  feels  he  has

some  talent,  in  terms  of  contributing  to  its

programmes, to write in for an audition whether  it

be  for  variety  shows,  dramas,  comic  sketches,

magazine items, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned that most of the radio

programmes are imported ones. To say that  most  of

the   programmes  being  broadcast  on  radio   are

imported is not true. The overwhelming majority are

in  fact  produced by our own staff locally.  These

comprise  magazine programmes of various types  for

youths,   workers,   women,  sports   and   musical

programmes of every description. Feature programmes

are  also  produced locally. It is  true,  however,

that the plays broadcast in the English service are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



mainly BBC-produced because they have proved to  be

among  the  best  available. RTS has  attempted  to

produce  local plays in English but they  have  not

proved  successful. Two drama writing  competitions

have been held but a good number of the scripts  of

plays received had stories similar to those already

seen  on TV. English-speaking stage groups are very

few  in number and when they stage plays, these are

overwhelmingly plays and not locally written.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised a question on

the  use of the word "million" by Tamil announcers.

The  use  of  the  word "million"  was  adopted  in

January  1972 after consultation with the  Ministry

of  Education's  Research and Statistics  Division.

The  Tamil phrase for "one million" previously used

was  pathu  lak sham. This is, however, not  easily

comprehended by the younger generation  as  in  the

Tamil   schools  in  Singapore,  where   the   word

"million" is now extensively used.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, on the

explanation given by the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for Culture, I would like to have his

assurance,  or  preferably from  the  Minister  for

Culture  who  has  just  arrived,  that  with   the

introduction  of  colour TV, the licence  fees  for

black and white TV sets will not be increased. This

point  was  also mentioned by the Member for  Telok

Blangah. If I am not mistaken, Sir, a few years ago

in  this Chamber, the Prime Minister said that  the

increase  in  the  number of cars, motorcycles  and

scooters registered from month to month is  related

to  the economic progress of Singapore. But in  the

last few days, we have been debating on the problem

of   reducing  the  number  of  private   cars   by

increasing taxes and the prices of petrol. I  would

like to have the Minister's assurance that with the

introduction  of  colour TV, the  licence  fee  for

black  and white TV sets will not be increased  and

will remain at $36 as at present.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Sir, I cannot give the Member the assurance that there will not be any increase in the licence fee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



either  for  black  and white  or  colour  TV  sets

because   this  is  tied  down  to  the   cost   of

production. It is too early to anticipate that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I wish to raise one small

point  of  clarification.  When  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  gave  his  explanation  to  the   points

raised, he gave me the impression that one  of  the

main  reasons that influenced us to go into  colour

TV is to keep up with the Joneses. I certainly hope

that  in  our consideration of Government  service,

this  is not the attitude and we do not go in  just

because we want to be one up on the others.  If  we

go  in  to extend our service, it should be on  the

basis  of:  is there a need? Is there  a  need  for

colour `I'V for our people? It is not a question of

just  because  Philippines and  Thailand  have  got

colour  TV, then we must have it. I certainly  hope

that this is not the main reason. The Parliamentary

Secretary gave me the impression that that  is  the

main reason why we are going into colour TV.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I do not think this is a

question  of  just keeping up with the Joneses.  We

are  keeping  up  with  time. As  my  Parliamentary

Secretary has already mentioned just now,  most  of

our  equipment  has been in use for  the  last  ten

years.  It  is  time for us to change,  and  it  is

better  we change it because the new equipment  can

be  used either for colour or black and white. That

is  one of the main factors which prompted us to go

into  colour  TV. And it would be cheaper  at  this

juncture to introduce colour because, in any  case,

most  of  the films and the tapes that we  purchase

and  hire  from overseas are already in colour.  So

why  waste it and put it on black and white  if  we

can show it in technicolour? Moreover, Members will

be pleased to know that in future their photographs

will  also appear in colour on TV. It is only  fair

to  give notice to Members now so that they  should

have colourful ties, shirts and other attire



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I find the first part of

the  Minister's answer acceptable. But  the  second

part is totally unacceptable. We do not want colour

TV  just  so  as  to see ourselves  as  Members  of

Parliament  in  colour on TV. TV is  to  serve  the

people and not the Members in this Chamber.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I want to know from the

Minister  whether they are going to  use  the  word

"million" in the Tamil language or do they want  to

continue  using the English word "million"  in  the

Tamil  announcements. I want to be  sure  that  the

word  "million"  is  changed  to  Tamil,  which  is

latcham,  so that I do not have to ask  this  again

and again. If the announcement is in Tamil, we want

to  be  sure that this word is in Tamil. We do  not

want it in Anglo-Tamil.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, in view of the

explanation  of  the  Minister,  I  beg  leave   to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead FA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that film shows have

become  an indispensable form of entertainment  for

the  people  of  Singapore. The  cinema  halls  are

always  packed  to capacity. This is an  indication

that  our people like to see film shows. Therefore,

the content of film



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



shows  do have a great impact and influence on  our

people.  Over the past few years the films screened

in our cinema halls were of questionable character.

We  all know that most of the films screened in the

cinema halls are shows of violence, sex and of  low

taste. Good film shows are few and far between. The

content  of the shows is more or less the same.  We

take, for example, the films on violence. There  is

violent action from beginning to end, until all the

characters are dead. It is a story of killing,  and

that  has no educational value at all. On the other

hand,  we  have the farcical shows which we  cannot

make  head or tail of them. In the case of film  on

sex,  there  is nothing but sex. These  films  have

undesirable   effects  on  the  young   people   of

Singapore,  especially  when  we  are  desirous  of

building a rugged and healthy society. It cannot be

doubted  that  we  all  need good  and  educational

films.  The content of such films must be  able  to

inspire people into good thinking. It must be  able

to  encourage people to love labour and to  improve

themselves.  Such films must be able  to  inculcate

the  feeling of patriotism, national consciousness,

and  how to conduct oneself as a man. These are the

kinds  of  film  shows that  we  want  to  have  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to apply a

more stringent standard on film censorship. We must

encourage  a  more  healthy type  of  films  to  be

screened  in Singapore to give our people a  better

form of entertainment. The Minister may say that as

a  lot  of films are imported from overseas, it  is

beyond  our  control, and that if a more  stringent

standard  is applied on such importation,  then  we

would have no film shows at all. I beg to differ on

this  count  because  it is the  business  of  film

producers to make money. If film producers overseas

can  understand  our  policy,  then  they  will  be

encouraged to change their policy so that they will

produce  the kind of films that we want. Our  film-viewing  population consists of two million  people

and this is a highly profitable market which should

be an attraction to overseas film producers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I fully agree with the

Member  for Sembawang that films, such as films  on

violence, have a very strong influence on the young

people. The Government has, therefore, always taken

a  serious view of screening films on violence  and

we  have always been very strict in censoring  such

films.  In  fact,  films that glorify  violence  or

brutality  are  not allowed for exhibition  in  the

Republic and those that contain violent and  brutal

scenes  are appropriately censored before they  are

passed for public exhibition. We will not hestitate

to  tighten our censorship on films on violence. In

fact,  in  1973 we had to ban about 70  such  films

which glorify violence and gangsterism, and most of

them were imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other category of films, I do not think

we can accept the Member for Sembawang's suggestion

because if we were to allow only a certain type  of

films  to  be shown and not others, then I  do  not

think  we  will  have  any films  to  show  in  our

cinemas.  In  any case I do not run a  cinema.  The

people in this business know what sort of films are

good box office draws, and therefore they know what

to bring to make good money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to forcing film producers to change their

policy, I do not think that is possible. The Member

for  Sembawang said that our potential audience  of

two million people would be sufficient to make film-producing a very profitable venture. I do not think

that  it is that profitable because film companies,

especially those in Hollywood, will not make  films

just for two million people in Singapore. They will

make  films  to suit a world-wide audience.  So  we

either  have them or not at all. That is about  the

true picture of film production.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the reply

given  by  the Minister for Culture is exactly  the

same as that given last year. He is harping on  the

same tune.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Because your question is the

same as last year!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister

seems  to  say  that we cannot do anything  because

after all the films are imported. However, since he

has  said  that  strict  film  censorship  will  be

carried out and that certain scenes will be cut,  I

hope  he will cut more of those undesirable scenes.

I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, time is getting short, and

since  I  would like to give opportunity for  other

matters  under  the  Ministry  of  Culture  to   be

discussed, I am not moving all three amendments*.

* The amendments, standing in the name of Mr J. F. Conceicao,   read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 2030.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be reduced by $10 in respect of item (a) of subhead AA 2730.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 2901.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 3001.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy is not here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 3002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this vote is for the use of rural community

centres.  The  amount  to be allocated  amounts  to

$40,000. It is really an insignificant sum compared

with  $130,000 for the previous year.  There  is  a

decrease  of  225  per cent. I  doubt  this  meagre

$40,000  can meet the expenditure required for  the

50-odd rural community centres. I am afraid  it  is

not  enough to buy one table-tennis table for  each

community centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of community centres is to create

activity  for the benefit of the community  in  the

respective localities. We should therefore  provide

them  with more funds so as to be able to give  the

people more guidance and activities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



such  as  conducting  more educational  classes  to

satisfy  their needs. As we all know, the level  of

income  of  the  people  in  the  rural  areas   is

generally  low. So we cannot expect much from  them

by  way of giving financial help to the running  of

rural   community  centres.  Therefore,  if   these

community centres cannot carry out more activities,

then  the  Minister  for  Finance  should  consider

giving more financial aid to assist them. I believe

the community centre in the Minister's constituency

is  a suburban one. So he should agree with what  I

am saying here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, the facilities in the rural

community  centres are dilapidated.  For  instance,

the  sewing machines are a decade old, and when  in

use the machines can be heard to grind and vibrate.

The  basket-ball courts are full of  pot-holes  and

the ground is so uneven that the players can easily

hurt  themselves. In my constituency, the community

centre has applied for financial assistance for the

last  three  years. No reply has  been  given,  and

therefore no actual aid can be expected. Of course,

we  cannot  blame  the  People's  Association.  The

actual crux of the problem lies in the shortage  of

funds.  Even  a very skilful housewife cannot  cook

without rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several kinds of classes, such as

sewing  and  cooking, run by the community  centre.

These are very beneficial to rural womenfolk. These

classes  provide  them with the  necessary  skills.

However,  in  recent  years, the  number  of  these

classes has dwindled. Some have closed down. Why is

this  so?  It is not because instructors cannot  be

recruited.  It  is because the allowances  for  the

instructors  are too small, and they have  resigned

to  seek  better  jobs. In these circumstances,  we

must adopt some measures to improve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



the  situation. I hope the Minister in charge  will

give  more funds to rural community centres so that

the  rural folks can get more benefit out of  rural

community services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to raise a question about

cultural  recreation  in my constituency.  Recently

there  was a cultural show full of rich items,  and

it appreciated by the people. On this, I would like

to  congratulate the Minister for having done  much

towards   the   motion   of  a   healthy   cultural

recreation. But there is also a shortage  of  funds

to stage such cultural shows. Therefore, I hope the

Minister will pay attention to this matter and will

not   stop  promoting  such  meaningful  activities

because of the shortage of funds.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it is the Government's policy to house three-quarters  of  our population by the  lend  of  this

decade. Taking the population level at two million,

this  will  approximately  amount  to  1.5  million

people  being housed in Housing Board  flats.  This

fact  has  affected certain sources and  they  have

undertaken  studies into various kinds  of  effects

that  this  situation will produce. In  fact,  Sir,

when  this  kind of massive situation comes  about,

i.e, three-quarters of our population are housed in

Housing Board flats, I think it will have a bearing

on  our  social and economic position in the  years

ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Sir, that when the populace live largely

in houses with their backyard or compounds, whether

be   kampung  houses,  terrace,  semi-detached   or

detached houses, there be sufficient room space and

opportunity  for  the youths to express  themselves

the  field  of  carpentry,  mechanics,  science  or

technology,  which opportunity either  be  severely

diminished or to lost when our populace  reside  in

Housing Board flats, which are high-rise buildings.

And  I  also  feel that it is this kin  experience,

which  the  youths  take in the backyards,  kampung

compounds,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



in  the  gardens of the semi-detached  or  detached

houses, that inculcates in our youth a capacity  to

experiment, to dabble in the elementary  principles

of mechanics, carpentry, science or technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that the schools, although

equipped  with  such facilities, will  be  able  to

extend this opportunity to our youths at the end of

this  decade when they are housed in Housing  Board

flats. The only opportunity that exists, or can  be

possible  therefore, can be found in the  community

centres which are amply distributed throughout  our

State, particularly those in Housing Board estates.

I  feel that we should think ahead and consider the

feasibility  of  making it a deliberate  policy  to

construct work rooms with work benches in community

centres,  which can accommodate such activities  of

our youths in the years to come. Unless this talent

is  nurtured and its loss prevented, our youth will

be  that much poorer in talent. I hope the Minister

will  be  prepared to cause studies to be  made  in

this  direction  and to assess its feasibility  and

practicability.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

gratified to note that the community centres  under

the   People's  Association  have  intensified  the

emphasis on how to mobilise and attract our  youths

to  participate in the youth group activities. Sir,

no  one  can  deny  that the success  of  a  nation

depends  on  the character and the quality  of  her

youth, because they constitute the next generation.

It  is  therefore our responsibility to guide them,

train  and  help  them  to develop  as  leaders  of

tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are at present 66 Youth Sub-Committees

under  the  management committees  of  the  various

community centres in our Republic. Apart from games

organised by them, the most popular activities  are

canoeing,  yachting,  mountaineering,  hiking   and

camping. But, it is sad to note that there is  only

one  community  centre, that is, the  Changi  Point

Community Centre that has such facilities, but they

are very limited. There is a small number of canoes

to cater for a large number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



members,  who joined the adventurers club organised

by the Youth Subcommittee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last Saturday the Member for Kallang and I

were  invited  to the inauguration of  the  Kallang

Adventurers  Club,  which was held  at  the  Changi

Point Community Centre. I was told that they have a

membership of about 500, which is very encouraging.

Sir,  in  the  course  of  a  discussion  with  the

leaders,  they  brought  up  problems  of  lack  of

facilities  and funds to promote their  activities.

In  the  light  of this, it is useless  for  us  to

publicise  or keep harping that we must look  after

our  youths,  train them, and so on. The  basically

important  thing is that we must provide them  with

up-to-date  facilities. Sir, I would like  to  urge

the  Minister for Culture to look into  the  matter

with  great urgency so that the enthusiasm of these

youths is not killed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Member for Sembawang raised the matter of funds,  I

had a feeling that he was trying to ask for another

community  centre in his constituency.  I  have  to

disappoint   him  again  this  year   because   the

provision  of  $130,000 in last year's  Budget  was

actually intended for five rural community centres.

But  four  of these centres had to be abandoned  or

the  plans  shelved  as  a  result  of  development

schemes  which  affect  the sites.  Therefore,  the

provision for this year has been reduced.  The  sum

of  $40,000  to be provided this year  is  actually

meant  for only one community centre, which is  now

under  construction. He will note  that  the  major

portions  of  the provision for the financial  year

1974  is meant for upgrading of facilities  in  key

community  centres.  This  is  receiving   priority

attention now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that we need to have more activities

in    community   centres   especially   vocational

activities. But I think the Member has actually pin-pointed  the  problem, and that  is,  the  lack  of

instructors. The People's Association is now paying

a very modest fee to our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



instructors,  and this is insufficient  to  attract

people  to come forward, especially for posting  to

the  rural areas, because many of these instructors

prefer to be posted very near to their homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultural shows provided by the People's

Association  will be continued and will  eventually

go  round to all the constituencies. Whether or not

we  have  the money and the funds to carry on  such

activities  is another matter. We will try  to  get

enough  funds, whether they are to be  provided  by

the   management  committees  or  by  the  People's

Association. We would rather that the provision  of

funds  be  a  spontaneous support  from  the  local

community,  so  that  it would  form  part  of  the

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Member for Serangoon

Gardens  that we need to upgrade the facilities  in

our  community centres. I think the Member is aware

that  most of our community centres were  built  in

the   1960's   to  cater  for  certain   types   of

activities.  By now I think most of  the  community

centres  are either obsolete or badly  in  need  of

renovation  or  extension.  Because  of  this,  the

members  of the Board of People's Association  have

been doing their best in trying to get either funds

or  other  facilities to provide better centres  in

the  various  places. There are lots of  things  we

would  like to do, but because of other priorities,

I do not think we can implement all of them. At the

present   moment,  the  policy  of   the   People's

Association  is that it will try to  subsidise  the

building  of community centres. In many  cases,  we

have  actually  encouraged the local  community  to

raise  funds  for  the building  of  new  community

centres. We will also try to match these funds with

a  dollar-for-dollar subsidy up  to  a  maximum  of

$60,000. But where a constituency has not got  even

a community centre, then the policy of the People's

Association is that it will bear the entire cost of

the construction of the community centre.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For additional centres in any constituency, other

considerations have to be taken into  account.  For

instance, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



a  standard-type community centre, the subsidy will

be  on  a  dollar-for-dollar basis,  subject  to  a

maximum   of  about  $80,000.  Where  the  existing

community  centre is insufficiently  equipped  with

facilities to serve the residents, the4 the subsidy

will be on a dollar-f or-dollar basis, subject to a

maximum  of $60~000. For the construction of  rural

community centres, the subsidy will be on a dollar-for-dollar basis, subject to a maximum of  $40,000.

Of  course,  these sums will not be  sufficient  in

view   of   the  high  cost  of  construction   and

materials,  but we will try to do what  we  can  in

these circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also going to expand the activities of the

Youth  Sub-Committees  feel  that  it  is  time  to

encourage  youths  to  come forward  for  community

service, and there is nothing better to place  them

in  the community centres so that they can at least

have a taste of what community life is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has mentioned about his

Canoeing Club. It is true that his community centre

in  Changi Point is the only centre with a Canoeing

Club because that is the community centre which  is

by  the seaside. I think even this community centre

is  in  danger  of  being  taken  over  because  of

development schemes. Bu course we will try to  find

other  for such activities. However, right now,  we

are  encouraging  our  youths  to  diversify  their

activities,   whether  it  be  canoeing,   archery,

mountaineering other forms of activity. The  People

Association   will  be  very  happy  to   entertain

applications for subsidy for kinds of activity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, in view of the factor, I beg leave to withdraw

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead GA 3001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this sum of $215,000 is earmarked for such

renovations as are required to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



prepare appropriate accommodation to house the  art

collection  of  the  University  of  Singapore.   I

support this development, of course. The University

art  collection, valuable and interesting as it is,

will now be made available to a much wider audience

of  our citizens who will find its new location  at

the  National Museum more convenient than  its  old

location  at the University. The art collection  is

notable  especially for the ceramics which cover  a

development  from 2000 BC to the 19th  century  AD.

The  ceramic  collection shows the  development  of

Chinese and South-east Asian ceramics over a period

of  more  than 3,000 years. Other items like  cloth

and  textiles together with the ceramic  collection

reflect  the spread of Chinese and Indian influence

through  trade  in South-east Asia. There  is  also

sculpture  in  bronze and stone, as well  as  other

items   of  historical  value  like,  for  example,

topographical  water-colours artistically  executed

by   a  well-known  artist.  Therefore,  both   the

University and the Ministry of Culture deserve  the

thanks of the public for taking steps to make items

of  our  common heritage more easily available  for

the enjoyment of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to use this amendment also

as  a  peg to hang a reference to what has not been

done  as  well  as to what has been  done.  Besides

alterations  to  house  the University  collection,

there  are alterations projected to turn a  portion

of  the  National  Museum into an  art  gallery  to

display the paintings of our own artists as well as

others  and  to  represent an  attempt  to  further

encourage  the  development  of  art  and  artistic

appreciation among our people. However, we are  not

sure  whether  this new art gallery  will  actually

materialise.  The  proposal to construct  this  art

gallery  is based on a subvention, at least  it  is

based on an optimistic expectation of a subvention,

from   the  Arts  Council  of  about  three-quarter

million  dollars. As a result of  the  increase  in

costs,  the total sum required is over $1  million.

The tender for the construction of this art gallery

in the National Museum has to be accepted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



within   a  matter  of  days.  I  would  like   the

Minister's assurance that steps would be  taken  to

ensure that instructions are given for the work  to

be   proceeded   with,  otherwise   I   am   afraid

circumstances  will arise that may well  abort  the

proposal  to provide Singapore with an art  gallery

in  the  very near future. Furthermore, even  after

the  art  gallery materialises, and I most solemnly

and  heartily  hope  that  this  art  gallery  will

materialise,  it is necessary for assurance  to  be

given to keep this art gallery alive by building up

its  collection  and encouraging activities  around

the art gallery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are yet other aspects of renovations to the

National  Museum which I would like to comment  on.

In   the   addendum  to  the  Presidential  Address

recorded in Hansard of 12th October, 1972, col. 48,

a paragraph reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Museum .., is being reorganised as a display

centre devoted to the art, history and anthropology

of the peoples of this region.'



<br><br>The  people  who  are running the Museum  have  got

ideas,  they have energy, but they have no  support

in  practical terms, namely, money. There are  many

categories of collections in the Museum  which  are

in storage. There are objects illustrating everyday

life  of our people through various stages  of  the

development of our society. These exhibits have  to

be  presented in an interesting way with an  appeal

to  visual and audial responses and with an appeal,

if  possible, to a sense of touch and of  movement.

We need to use dioramas, where these can fruitfully

be  used,  and not the dull bulky cases with  which

the  present Museum is being equipped and which  it

has  inherited, like worthless heir-looms. And  the

artifacts,  which the Museum has, which  relate  to

our  heritage  have  to be interestingly  presented

because  they  would be helpful  in  stimulating  a

sense  of  history  and cultural tradition  in  our

people   and  a  pride  in  them  in  our  cultural

environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, many of these artifacts have deteriorated.

Woodwork  has been affected by worms and  termites;

inappropriate lighting has caused fabric  to  fade,

bleach



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



and   even  crumble.  It  is  very  necessary  that

conservation   measures   should   be   undertaken,

otherwise  evidence -valuable  evidence  -  of  our

cultural past will be irretrievably lost. As I have

said,  we  can generate the expertise, the  energy,

the initiative to be directed towards this sort  of

cultural development but we need financial support.

Large sums of money have been appropriated for  the

development of the Science Centre, and certainly an

understanding of our scientific environment is also

part of our culture. But what about the aspects  of

our culture that may be enshrined and presented  in

our  Museum  of art and history? They are  just  as

important  to  stimulate, as I have  said,  in  our

people a response to their cultural environment, an

appreciation,  an awareness of their  heritage,.  I

think  this will just as much contribute to a sense

of  unity  among our people, even more so  perhaps,

than the Science Centre with which I certainly have

no quarrel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the senior Parliamentary Secretary in

the  debate  on the Budget Statement last  year  in

March,  1973, saying that more attention should  be

paid  to  the  building  and strengthening  of  the

infrastructure for the development of  culture  and

the  Minister himself has said in March  last  year

that  he  wanted to get down to something realistic

where culture is concerned. Apparently he wanted to

shy away from the abstract. How much more realistic

can  you  get  than by contriving to  get  monetary

support for the development of the Museum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the very little time

he  has  left to answer the questions that  I  have

raised, the Minister will give us some creative and

new  answers, otherwise we may have to ask the same

questions  again  and  he  will  say  that  we  are

"putting new wine into old bottles". If he were not

to  uncock the old wine bottle and give out answers

that  are  old, perhaps we can ask questions  which

will  represent  a wine of a very fine  timbre  and

quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, you have two minutes

for your creative answers!



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I shall try to be as

creative  as  possible. The $215,000  earmarked  in

this  year's Budget is to renovate three  galleries

in the National Museum to put on public display the

valuable  art  collection  of  the  University   of

Singapore    which,   when   housed    in    proper

surroundings, will become easily accessible to  and

be  better appreciated by both our own citizens and

foreign  visitors. I think this would be the  pride

of   our  culture,  because  it  would  give   good

expression to our young people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the coat which the Member for Katong was

trying  to  hang  on the peg, the art  gallery  was

actually  a  scheme by the Singapore  Arts  Council

which  has  generously provided a  capital  sum  of

$760,000  to  turn part of the museum into  an  art

gallery.   After  that  the  Government   will   be

responsible for the running and maintenance of  the

gallery  as  part  of  the  National  Museum   and,

therefore, also as part of a Government department.

However,  in  view  of the high  cost  of  building

materials, the inflationary trends and also because

of  the  delay in preparing the plans, the cost  of

establishing an art gallery in the National  Museum

has gone up to $1.1 million. However, the Singapore

Arts Council has indicated that it will again cough

out  an additional sum of about $388,000. There has

been  some  argument as to who is to be responsible

for  the additional sum. My thinking on this matter

is that we should get the project going, and we can

talk about the money later. What I am interested in

is to get it done first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head KA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is really happening to sports in

Singapore?  Sometime  back  there  were  complaints

against  the National Sports Promotion Board.  Then

the  NSPB  and  the  National  Stadium  Corporation

merged  and it i5 now known as the Singapore Sports

Council. What is the outcome of the merger? Has  it

helped in any way in promoting sports? Nothing.  We

still   see   confusion  and  poor   standards   of

performance of our sportsmen. It seems that some of

the  officials of the Singapore Sports Council  are

snobbish and arrogant as reported in the press.  If

it is true, can anything be done about this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there is a weeding exercise

being carried out on the former NSPB officials.  Is

it   really  necessary?  These  people  are   being

replaced  by  inexperienced  people  who  have   no

particular interest in sports at all. Yet they  are

being promoted within a short space of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, because of the introduction of inter-constituency games, soccer is catching up in

Singapore and thus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



manages to attract a fairly reasonable crowd at the

Jalan  Besar Stadium. But let me warn the Minister:

even  this crowd will soon melt away from  the  way

things  are being done and organised for the inter-constituency games.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this matter, let me ask one simple question.

Why  was there such a poor response for the  inter-constituency   table  tennis   and   sepak   takraw

tournaments? Is it because the officials did not go

down to the grass-root level to organise these  two

games properly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, why was the organisation of inter-constituency Chinese chess nipped in the bud? It is

a popular coffee-shop game. We are losing the great

opportunity to get our young and old folks to share

a  common  interest and attract them  to  community

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What incentives has the Sports Council offered in

the  interest  of sports promotion?  What  sort  of

motivation  has it displayed to the up  and  coming

sportsmen of our country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the wonderful white elephant

in  Kallang. It was built at great cost to host the

SEAP  games. What has happened after that?  Because

of   high  rentals,  clubs  and  associations   are

reluctant to use its facilities. To make a joke  of

the  whole  thing, the field when wet is no  better

than  a  fishing  pond. The  field  has  no  proper

drainage system.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Member for Anson speak on

the  general  policy  of the  Ministry  under  this

particular amendment? What he is talking about  now

should rightly be raised under amendment to subhead AA 2730.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, please excuse me. This

stadium  is no better than the Jalan Besar Stadium.

Over  $100,000  is  being  spent  to  maintain  the

stadium.  Is this not a waste? Perhaps a  reduction

in  rentals for the complex may attract  the  crowd

that it badly needs. At the present rate, do not be

surprised if the National Stadium is haunted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five squash courts but there are no

viewing  galleries. Something should be done  about

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us take a look at the surrounds of the

stadium.  Even during the period of the SEAP  games

and  after  that,  the surrounds  of  the  National

Stadium  are a national disgrace. What we  see  are

good   lallang  fields  and  potholes,  ideal   for

mosquito  breeding.  Surely  the  Singapore  Sports

Council   is   not  encouraging  the  breeding   of

`sporting' mosquitoes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the SEAP games because of the poor

response  on  certain  days, school  children  were

admitted  free.  But  what  a  mess  the  officials

created.  Children  accompanied  by  parents   were

segregated. Sir, you can guess what the result  was

-  missing  parents and missing children.  What  an

impression  we had given to the outside  world  one

can  only  wonder, and all because of some  foolish

and childish decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stadium complex contains facilities for

exhibitions,  etc.  How far are  they  being  used?

Again,  are  they being under-utilised  because  of

high rentals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these snags, there is an exodus of

experienced  personnel from  the  Singapore  Sports

Council. It is time that a reorganisation was  made

and  proper persons placed in office, not publicity

seekers,  but  sportsmen in the real sense  of  the

word.  There should be more innovation than control

in the betterment of sports.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Sir, I would like to

know  what  the Member for Anson exactly  meant  by

"poor  response"  at  the recent inter-constituency

sepak  takraw  tournaments. If he  was  talking  in

terms  of crowd response, then he was wrong because

I  was there every night for as long as my team was

taking part. The response from the crowd was  good.

If  he was thinking in terms of participation, then

I  must say that it is the policy of the SSC not to

force  people  to take part. This was  one  of  the

faults of the former NSPB.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



Education says that there was a good crowd  at  the

sepak  takraw  tournaments.  I  do  not  think  so.

Perhaps there was a good crowd on certain days  but

not every day.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I note that the Member for

Serangoon Gardens has an amendment* on the  subject of  what  the last

speaker has been talking  about. Would he like to

join in?

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment, standing in the name of Mr L. P. Rodrigo, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the sum to be allocated for Head KA be reduced by $10 in respect of item (m) of subhead AA 2730.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Yes, Sir, if you consider it

relevant.  I  filed this amendment merely  to  seek

information  from  the  Minister  as  to  how   the

Singapore Sports Council is going to programme  the

viability of the National Stadium. There have  been

remarks  that  the  National  Stadium  is  a  white

elephant,   and  the  prospect  of  this  condition

improving  appears to be dim. But  I  am  sure  the

Singapore Sports Council's executive and the  Board

are  working on something. The only fault  is  that

there   has  not  been  any  disclosure   of   this

programme. So this gives me an opportunity  to  ask

of the Minister details of such a programme.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Sir, sports promotion is a long-term and

continuing process of education and organisation in

sports  and  games. The aim is to make Singapore  a

sports-loving nation. The people are being provided

with  better  and improved sporting facilities  and

more  facilities are being planned  and  developed.

The   manpower  in  coaching  of  games  is   being

increased.   Increased   utilisation   of    sports

facilities  is being actively promoted  and  sports

and  games in schools are receiving a new emphasis.

How  the  people  respond depends on  the  personal

values  and  attitudes and those of their  leaders.

How  our  sportsmen  fair in  competitions  against

other  countries depends on the area or  region  of

competition.  It has been shown very  clearly  that

Singapore can hold its own in regional competitions

as evidenced by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



the high standards of performances of our sportsmen

at the SEAP games last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press relations have been improved by regular

meetings  with  the  press. An effective  bilingual

officer  has recently been appointed as  press  and

public  relations officer to ensure  close  liaison

with the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned about the

absorption  exercise.  In any absorption  exercise,

some  people will be selected and others  rejected.

Officers  of  the NSPB and the NSC  were  recruited

from  various  organisations. Some  were  seconded,

others  were  on transfer, and some were  recruited

direct  by  the  two  bodies.  The  majority   were

temporary  officers. It was necessary to regularise

the  staffing  position so that suitably  qualified

and  experienced  staff would be  absorbed  by  the

Singapore Sports Council. This assessment was  made

by   an   independent  body,  the  Public   Service

Commission.   The  Member  need  not  suspect   the

integrity of the PSC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no exodus of experienced personnel

from  the  SSC. Every organisation in Singapore  is

facing the problem of staff movement because of the

over-employment   and   booming    conditions    in

Singapore. Last year, one senior staff of  the  SSC

retired  while  two  seconded  Government  officers

returned to their respective Ministries after their

period  of  secondment. Professional, clerical  and

technical  staff  leave  because  the  SSC,  paying

Government  salary scales, is unable to  match  the

salaries  paid by the private sector. The  SSC  has

been  reorganised  and is being  strengthened  with

suitably experienced personnel from the Ministry of

Education  to ensure that sports in Singapore  will

see  a new era. The SSC is aware that football  has

problems,  and active measures have been  taken  to

look   after   its  administration.  A   group   of

experienced  and dedicated Singaporeans  have  been

given the responsibility to manage football in  the

country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These officials and the SSC will need the

collective   support   of   elected   Members    of

Parliament,   who   are   responsible   for   their

constituencies' sports associations, to ensure that

the  games  continue with spontaneous participation

and increasing spectator support. The SSC has drawn

up  a  programme  of  inter-constituency  games  in

consultation with MPs. Certain guidelines were laid

down  for  the conduct of these games. It  was  the

consensus  of the MPs, present at the two  meetings

to    discuss   inter-constituency   games,    that

participation by the various constituencies  should

be spontaneous. Those constituencies that could not

fill  teams would not participate. The response  to

the  table tennis tournament was encouraging.  That

of   sepak  takraw  was  poor,  because   in   many

constituencies  the game does not  enjoy  the  same

degree  of  popularity as other games  do.  Another

reason  for lesser participation is the  fact  that

constituency  sports associations are  being  newly

established  and  have not been  consolidated  with

adequate  manpower and financial resources.  Inter-constituency  Chinese chess was  omitted  from  the

1974 programme at the request of MPs present at the

second meeting to discuss inter-constituency sport.

The  Member for Anson was absent. He would  perhaps

be  relieved to learn that the People's Association

has  been requested to promote what he called  this

"popular coffee-shop game" at community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also spoke about incentives to encourage the

sportsmen.  Sports  and  recreation  are   healthy,

wholesome,  leisure-time activities.  They  develop

talents  in  individuals with  good  character  and

discipline, team spirit, community cohesiveness and

national  loyalty. Are incentives  really  required

for  participation  in such a movement?  Steps  are

being taken to ensure that emerging sportsmen  from

our  schools  find suitable clubs to join  so  that

their  sporting  careers  are  developed  to  their

benefit  and to the benefit of the nation. The  SSC

further offers sports facilities free of charge  to

national sports organisations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



for  the  training  of  national  teams  for

competition, locally and abroad. Injured  sportsmen

are treated free in the Sports Medicine Unit of the

SSC.   If   the  Member  is  thinking  of  monetary

incentives for national sportsmen, this  will  have

to be the responsibility of the respective national

sports organisations. The SSC does not consider  it

proper to disburse public funds among a handful  of

talented   sportsmen.   The   greatest   and   most

satisfying reward lies in being chosen to represent

Singapore. It would really be a day of sorrow  when

the  quality  of  performance of our  sportsmen  is

directly proportionate to the size of their  pocket

allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of the National Stadium, let me point

out  that the National Stadium was not built solely

to  host the 1973 SEAP Games. The moving force came

from   sports  officials  in  the  national  sports

organisation  way back in 1963. Sports  authorities

at  that  time felt that Singapore's sportsmen  and

sports fans deserved a modern sports stadium.  This

is   still  true  today.  Our  sportsmen  performed

creditably,   even   beyond  the   expectation   of

officials,  in  the recent SEAP Games.  Members  of

Parliament who witnessed the Games would have noted

this  spontaneous loyalty to the nation that  these

Games  generated amongst sportsmen and  sportswomen

who  rose  to  the  occasion, and  among  fans  who

cheered the national team with charged emotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All public amenities cost money to run. Clubs and

associations  which  are  reluctant  to   use   the

facilities  of the National Stadium do  so  because

they  are poorly organised and are unable to  raise

monies for their programmes. The rental charged  at

the National Stadium has been carefully worked out.

They  are  correlated to charges  of  other  sports

facilities in Singapore. The user merely  pays  for

the  direct cost of the services provided. The  SSC

is  unable to subsidise the use of the stadium,  as

it  is being stretched to its maximum in trying  to

earn  revenue to maintain its facilities. There  is

no  stadium in the world which can be wholly run on

its collections from sporting activities alone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exhibition area of the National Stadium has

been   developed  on  the  initiative  of   Stadium

authorities. This is being actively promoted  among

organisers  of trade fairs. It is true,  Sir,  that

the  sub-soil drainage system has been  inadequate,

but  I  have  not seen anybody yet fishing  in  the

field.   Steps  have  been  taken  to  remedy   the

situation.  The squash courts which were  built  at

the  National Stadium were originally not  part  of

the   Stadium  but  were  constructed  to  increase

utilisation.  Viewing  galleries  for  squash   are

considered a luxury. The maintenance of the  ground

outside  the  National Stadium has still  not  been

settled  as  the  area  has  officially  not   been

confirmed  as  part  of the property  of  the  SSC.

Lastly,  Sir,  on  children who were  lost  in  the

stadium. There might be one or two-odd children who

were separated from their parents momentarily,  but

it  would  be  an  exaggeration  to  say  that  the

situation was chaotic in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the queries raised by the Member for

Serangoon  Gardens. He wanted to know the programme

of  sports being considered by the SSC. The  sports

programme of the SSC is at present limited  to  the

organisation of inter-constituency games.  Together

with  the co-operation of the People's Association,

it  will  encourage  and promote intra-constituency

games  mainly  for recreation and sports.  The  SSC

will  assist  national associations and  the  SNOC,

that is, the Singapore National Olympic Council, in

the  organisation and staging of national, regional

and  international games. It has close liaison with

the  Ministry  of  Education and  is  assured  that

sports and games are receiving adequate emphasis in

the   development  of  our  school  children.   The

positive  methods being adopted to  encourage  mass

participation  in  sports  in  Singapore   are   as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to give sportsmen and supporters a new

identity.   Adult  sports  has  died  in  Singapore

because  of  a  lack of identification.  Sports  in

Singapore received considerable support in  yester-years  because  they  were communal-orientated.  In

modern independent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



Singapore, loyalty to one's constituency  is  being

actively promoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, optimum use of existing facilities is

being secured. School children are allowed to train

on  athletic tracks, without charge. Swimming pools

are  being made available to the public from 7 a.m.

to  10  p.m, on a continuous-use system,  so  that

anybody may swim at a time convenient to him rather

than  on  the  present system of a fixed  or  block

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, schemes are being studied to increase

the amount of dual use of sports facilities so that

constituencies without sports facilities may  share

in the use of facilities in other constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, planning for the future provision of

sports  centres has begun in conjunction  with  the

Ministry  of  National  Development,  Housing   and

Development  Board.  Urban  Renewal  Authority  and

Public  Works Department. Such forward planning  on

the  nature and scale of sports centres and  stadia

in  newly-planned urban areas and densely populated

residential   areas   will   ensure   the   orderly

development  of  sports facilities where  they  are

much needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, existing sports facilities will be

programmed  when funds are available to  allow  for

diverse and increasing participation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, people are being made aware of what is

happening. Better liaison with the press  and  mass

media has been established, which I have just said.

Sports and recreation will be promoted by publicity

in  the  mass media, films and publications.  These

are  only some of the methods being adopted. In the

final  analysis, mass participation  in  sports  in

Singapore  will only take place when the  drive  of

every Singaporean for wealth and prosperity can  be

directed towards the desire for a gracious style of

living  and  the  regular habit of taking  part  in

sports.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

remarked  that I was absent at a meeting. That  was

because I received very short notice of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



meeting and therefore I could not attend as I had

other  engagements. Another point is  this:  does

the  Minister  agree that the  officials  of  the

Singapore   Sports  Council  are   snobbish   and

arrogant as reported in the press?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> That was a matter of

opinion from the press.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> In view of the Minister's

explanation,   I   beg  leave  to   withdraw   my

amendment.



Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head KA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an item in respect of the Central

Complaints  Bureau.  Judging  by  the  increasing

number  of complaints against various aspects  of

Government   service  appearing  daily   in   the

readers'  column of the various local press,  and

indeed  the continuing large number of complaints

handled  by  the  Bureau  as  contained  in   the

Minister's written answer to me recently,  it  is

clear that our citizens are becoming conscious of

their  entitlement  to  courteous  and  efficient

service from our civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bureau is performing a very important

function.  It  is therefore rather  disappointing

for  me to note that from year to year no attempt

seems to have been made to increase the number of

staff in this Department, to the extent that some

people  have come to me and said that they  would

rather  write  to the press than to approach  the

Bureau,  because  by writing to  the  press  they

could get their problems solved very quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears rather strange to me that the

remuneration  of the officer in  charge  of  that

Department should remain the same at $19,800.  Is

it  because `he has not done his job well?  As  I

have   pointed  out  earlier,  in  view  of   the

important functions of the Department, perhaps  a

more senior person should be put in charge there,

perhaps a person with a status equivalent to that

of a Permanent Secretary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, in my written answer

to the question of the Member, the actual fact is

that  the number of complaints has decreased from

120  in 1972 to 93 in 1973. There is no increase.

Looking at the work of the Bureau and also at the

general  nature  of the enquiries and  complaints

dealt  with  by the Bureau, there is no  need  at

present  to strengthen the establishment  of  the

Central Complaints Bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the salary of the Director, which the

Member  said  is  static,  he  has  reached   his

maximum.  It is not because he is not  doing  his

work properly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I did not say that there

is an increase in the number of complaints to the

Bureau. I said that there is an increasing number

of complaints to the press, the reason being that

one gets a much quicker answer by complaining  to

the press than to the Bureau.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> That is something beyond

me. If people want to complain to the press, they

are  free to do so. But the Complaints Bureau  is

open  every  day, except Sundays, for anybody  to

make a complaint.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I would like to support the point which  the

Member for Jalan Kayu is trying to drive home. It

has  been  suggested that if the Bureau can  show

its  effectiveness  in  tackling  complaints   by

having  a  more  effective  manpower  force,   or

perhaps  a  higher officer to be  in  charge,  it

could  give the service that the public  expects.

Then  perhaps the public would not be writing  to

the  press.  However,  it is obvious,  therefore,

that  they  have  to  write  to  the  press   for

effective measures to be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point that we are suggesting here is

that  perhaps the Minister could consider looking

into  the reorganisation of the Bureau, in  terms

of  better manpower or more effective leadership.

I  think that may encourage more complaints to be

made to the Bureau.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the press

is  much more effective than the Complaints Bureau,

I would suggest to the Minister that the Complaints

Bureau  is  of no further use. Would the  Minister,

therefore, think of scrapping it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Further to that, Sir, I am thinking

that it is simply because of the efficiency of  the

Members of Parliament in tackling problems in their

Meet-the-People   sessions   that    the    Central

Complaints Bureau appears now to be redundant, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for  Jalan Kayu has a very important  point

which  has been further stressed by the Member  for

River Valley. I rise in support of their sentiments

because it seems to me that there is obviously more

room  for  improvement  in the  Central  Complaints

Bureau,  and this will help to cut down the  number

of  letters to the press. I am not against  letters

being sent to the press, because I think people are

free  to express any opinion they like. But if  one

were  to plough through the papers and look at  the

type of complaints that have been lodged - some  of

these are very minor -- one does not see any reason

why  this  should  be  in  the  press  at  all.  If

anything,  it  gives  the public  and  the  foreign

tourist  in  Singapore a very  poor  image  of  our

people  and,  sometimes, of  our  officers  in  the

public service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I certainly

go  along with the previous speakers over the  need

to increase the efficiency of the Complaints Bureau

by  the increase of adequately qualified staff. But

I think the Complaints Bureau will never be able to

compete with the press simply because complaints to

the  Bureau are not made public and the complainant

does  not  get  the  satisfaction  of  seeing   his

complaints  expressed publicly. The medium  of  the

press, however, gives him that satisfaction because

to  the complainant nothing is more satisfying than

to see his grouse aired publicly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But talking about complaints, Sir, I wonder

whether we have got a Complaints



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



Bureau in Parliament because I believe  the

reporters who have got to work from 2.30 p.m, till

<br><br>8.00 p.m, are not supplied with tea. They are

experiencing great difficulty in getting tea around

the  vicinity. Perhaps to make them  happy  and  to

ensure that they are properly refreshed, it is only

decent that we supply them with tea.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, two opinions have been

expressed  in this House this afternoon  about  the

Complaints Bureau. One is that the Bureau should be

scrapped  and the other that it should continue  to

be strengthened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is effectiveness in the function of the

Complaints  Bureau, otherwise people  will  not  go

there  everyday to complain. If they  want  to  air

their complaints in public, there is nothing I  can

do  to stop them. The only difference, Sir, is that

we  do not publicise what we do. Our purpose is  to

investigate  into the complaint and  take  whatever

action  we  deem fit to settle it.  But  if  people

complain to the press, perhaps because they like to

see their name in the press, there is nothing I can

do  about it. We cannot judge the deficiency or the

efficiency of the Central Complaints Bureau against

the number of complaints appearing in the press.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, as the Minister has

correctly  suggested, perhaps publicity  should  be

given  to  the existence of the Central  Complaints

Bureau,  so  that more people will know  about  it.

Maybe  the  Minister may even  want  to  give  some

examples of its effectiveness.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, all this leads to my original

point  when  we started off this Budget  debate.  I

think  that  if  we have sufficient annual  reports

from   the   various  departments   as   to   their

performance,  achievements,  and  difficulties,  we

would be that much informed and we could then  make

a   pertinent  assessment  of  the  redundancy   or

effectiveness  of  this  or  that  department   and

thereby make our recommendations accordingly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> That is an ideal suggestion

voiced by the Member for Serangoon Gardens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I would just like to

clarify. When I brought up this amendment, my whole

intention was to give publicity to this Bureau once

a  year. I am not really complaining. I think  this

Bureau deserves a bit of publicity, and it is  only

once in the year that we are able to let the people

know  that there is the Complaints Bureau to  which

they can go. And if the Minister assures us that he

is satisfied with the service, nevertheless we have

put  up  useful suggestions for him to think about.

On this note, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head KA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead DA 1111*.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Haji Mohd. Ariff  Bin Suradi).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, I wish to know whether the

Singapore  Government has made any contribution  to

the  Medical Department, Malaysia, in Saudi  Arabia

for the medical needs of Singapore pilgrims. If so,

what  is  the amount of contribution that  is  made

yearly?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in view of the number of our pilgrims

increasing year by year, I wish to suggest that the

Muslim  Religious  Council be asked  to  set  up  a

Pilgrimage Office in Mecca and Medina to house  the

local  medical  officer there,  so  that  they  can

assist  our  pilgrims who are  sick.  To-date,  our

pilgrims have to depend on the medical officers  of

Malaysia,  Pakistan and Saudi  Arabia.  This  is  a

shame on our part. Although we are independent, to-date  we  have not shown any responsibility towards

our  own  people who make pilgrimages to  the  Holy

City.  We  must show our readiness to  protect  our

citizens wherever they may be.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  the point raised by the Member for Geylang

Serai. The Minister for Social Affairs has said  in

this House on 21st March, 1972, [col. 940]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... that the arrangement for pilgrimage through

the  establishment of Tabong Haji or the Pilgrimage

Fund  will  include the provision  of  welfare  and

health facilities for pilgrims during their sojourn

in   Mecca,   Medina  and  Jeddah.  The  Pilgrimage

Committee  is considering the provision of  medical

facilities, including the services of a doctor  and

a  nurse  for the pilgrims when they are in  Mecca.

The provision of a welfare officer to look into the

welfare aspects of the pilgrims and the services of

a  reputable  pilgrim broker, .., are  also  being

looked into.'



<br><br>If these services mentioned by the Minister in 1972

have  still not been provided, I do not  know  when

can  they  be  provided, as two years have  already

elapsed, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, is that last year the

Pilgrimage Office in the Ministry of Social Affairs

announced  that  as  from 1974  Singapore  pilgrims

travelling  by  air  would  be  required   to   use

pilgrimage passports, and that they would no longer

be  using international passports as had been  done

in  previous  years.  I wish to  know,  Sir,  which

department  will be responsible for  the  issue  of

these   pilgrimage  passports.  Would  it  be   the

Immigration   Department,  the   Muslim   Religious

Council  of  Singapore, or the Malaysian Pilgrimage

Fund? Sir, I also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



wish   to   know  if  this  requirement   will   be

implemented this year.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Geylang Serai may wish to know that the Muslim

Religious  Council is now looking  into  the  whole

matter concerning pilgrimage and is considering the

setting  up of a Pilgrimage Advisory Committee  for

this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of complaints from Singapore pilgrims

regarding  the  treatment they receive  from  their

agents or their pilgrim brokers. By and large, most

of  the  complaints are not from Singapore pilgrims

who  travel by sea, as there is an arrangement with

the  Tabong Haji of Malaysia that their medical and

welfare  mission at Saudi Arabia will take care  of

Singapore  pilgrims  arriving  by  sea.   But   the

arrangement  does  not  include  our  pilgrims  who

travel by air. There is, therefore, a need to  come

to  some arrangement with the Malaysian authorities

whereby   their  network  of  medical  and  welfare

facilities all over Saudi Arabia will also be  made

available to our pilgrims who travel by air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may wish to know that for the period

1970-73,   Singapore   has   made   the   following

contributions:  1970 $18,827;  1971  $14,540;  1972

$16,349;    and    1973   $8,472.   These    annual

contributions  are  based  on  the  number  of  our

pilgrims who travel by sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both Members referred to the need to provide

welfare   and  medical  facilities  for   Singapore

pilgrims during their pilgrimage to Mecca.  I  must

first stress that to establish a network of welfare

and  medical facilities in Saudi Arabia is  a  very

costly  business.  It  costs  our  neighbour  about

$450,000   a   year.   The   present   satisfactory

arrangement  with the Tabong Haji of Malaysia  does

not   warrant  the  setting  up  of  an   elaborate

organisation  only to duplicate  the  services  and

facilities which are already made available to  us.

However, something modest may be possible along the

lines  of what I had suggested in the Committee  of

Supply in March, 1972. The Muslim Religious Council

has already planned the establishment of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



co-operative to build a Pilgrimage Fund. Once  this

scheme  is fully implemented, it should be possible

to   consider   providing   medical   and   welfare

facilities if these are found necessary.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our immediate concern is to ensure that

pilgrim  brokers  do  not make  empty  promises  to

pilgrims  and  their agents in  Mecca,  Medina  and

Jeddah.  They  must be really reliable  people  who

carry  Out their duties diligently and not just  be

interested  in making money by taking  on  a  large

number of pilgrims if they cannot manage or provide

them  with adequate facilities. In this connection,

the  officials of the Muslim Religious Council will

be  holding  a meeting of all pilgrim brokers.  The

Council welcomes any information on pilgrim brokers

or  their  agents. If the services of these  people

are  unsatisfactory in any way, their licences will

not be renewed in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of extending medical welfare

services  and facilities to pilgrims who travel  by

air  to  perform  the  Haj is  being  looked  into.

Officials of the Muslim Religious Council  will  be

holding    discussions   with    their    Malaysian

counterparts on this matter. For the time being, we

are  considering  the  possibility  of  sending   a

welfare   officer  to  Saudi  Arabia   during   the

pilgrimage season to look after the welfare of  our

citizens performing the Haj.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, from this year onwards prospective

pilgrims  proceeding to Saudi Arabia,  irrespective

of  the mode of travel, will be issued with pilgrim

passes  by  the  Pilgrim Officers.  The  Pilgrimage

Office has started the registration of all pilgrims

for  the current pilgrimage season. However, in the

case  of  pilgrims travelling by air,  arrangements

are  being made with the Immigration Department  to

issue  international passports with a pilgrim  pass

endorsement  to  obviate  the  necessity  for  such

pilgrims   to  possess  two  documents.   Such   an

arrangement  would  be economically  beneficial  to

pilgrims  as they only need to pay for one passport

instead of two.

<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In view of the

Minister's explanation, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head KA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead EA 1107.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Legal Aid Bureau provides a

commendable service to our unfortunate citizens who

are  unable  to obtain the services  of  a  private

legal  counsel. It is very obvious  that  more  and

more  of  our citizens are seeking assistance  from

the Legal Aid Bureau. It is known that one may have

to  wait  for a considerable period of time  before

aid  can  be given because of the pressure of  work

and the number of cases the legal officers have  to

deal  with. The waiting period for legal assistance

is  becoming longer and longer. I do not  apportion

any  blame at all either to the Director  of  Legal

Aid  or to his officers because of the shortage  of

manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1968 there has been no in-crease at

all in the number of legal officers assigned to the

Bureau. In 1968, that is, six years ago, there were

four  legal  officers,  other  than  the  Director.

Today, with the increase in the workload and in the

number  of  people  seeking legal  assistance,  the

establishment  strength remains the same.  If  this

position  is not improved, the time will come  when

the  whole machinery of the Bureau is bogged  down,

and  the very purpose for which the Bureau has been

set  up would be defeated. I hope the Minister  for

Social  Affairs will not refer me to  the  Minister

for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the time

taken  to  complete  a  case would  vary  with  its

circumstances. Civil cases normally take some  time

to  settle. Usually it will be necessary to  obtain

reports,  notes  of  evidence  and  other  relevant

material from various sources. Sometimes more  time

is   required   because  of  the   involved   court

proceedings. Therefore, the delay is unavoidable. I

regret it very much.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons applying for legal aid are normally given

an  appointment two or three weeks after they  have

registered  their  cases.  Although  the  situation

could  be improved, the Bureau could not have  done

better  in  view of the limited staff and increased

work-load. The number of applications for legal aid

has  increased from 3,745 in 1972 to 4,394 in 1973,

and  the number of staff that we have is only  five

legal  officers and four interpreters to deal  with

all  these  cases. Fortunately we  have  one  legal

officer  on  loan  to  the  Bureau  and  a  student

interpreter who is attached to the Bureau on a part-time  basis. However, the Member may wish  to  know

that  the  staffing  position  is  still  far  from

satisfactory  and we are pressing the  Ministry  of

Finance very hard for more staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

is  complaining of the same complaint that  I  have

made!  Where  do  we  go from  here?  Pressing  the

Ministry of Finance for yet more staff would not be

enough. He has the support of the Members from this

side  of  the  House, but I am  afraid  he  is  not

fighting  hard  enough. Since 1968,  i.e, for  six

years, the strength has still been only four  legal

officers and one Director; only five officers since

1968.  On  the  one hand we have some  departments,

bureaux  and  units  where  more  people  are   not

necessary,  and on the other hand we are  short  of

officers in some departments. Perhaps the Minister

should fight harder, if necessary, to get more  men

in the Legal Aid Bureau.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Member  for  Telok Blangah show me a way  to  fight

harder with my colleague, the Minister for Finance?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as early as April, 1969, I

complained  about the existence of the archaic  Co-operative  Ordinance.  May  I  quote  myself   from

Hansard, Vol. 28, col. 1005?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`whether he [that is, the Minister] is aware that

the Co-operative Societies Ordinance which was last

amended  in  1955,  is  outdated  and  if  he  will

consider   setting   up   a  committee   comprising

officials   from   the   Co-operative   Development

Division,  the co-operative movement and the  trade

union movement to review the Ordinance;'



<br><br>Let  me now quote the reply given then in the  same

column of the Hansard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.., the Ministry will consider making

amendments, if necessary, to the Ordinance in order

to   meet  the  practical  difficulties  which  co-operative  societies  have  experienced  with   the

existing Ordinance.'



<br><br>Sir,  these words were spoken in April, 1969,  five

years  ago.  Since then, the Ordinance  has  become

more  archaic  now. Perhaps it  should  go  to  the

National Museum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are happy to note, however, that the

Minister   is  inclined  to  help  the   NTUC   co-operatives,  as may be necessary in recognition  of

the  services they are rendering towards  consumers

by offering them goods and services at fair prices.

To curb undue profiteering and to stabilise prices,

co-operative   ventures   should   be   given   all

encouragement. In this connection, I would like  to

draw the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



attention   of   the  House  to  the   Co-operative

Societies Act which was promulgated as far back  as

1925 but has not undergone much basic change in the

meanwhile. The provisions and rules made thereunder

do  not,  therefore, take cognizance of the changed

economic  and  social conditions now prevailing  in

the  Republic. It is now agreed by the  authorities

as   well  as  those  connected  with  various  co-operative   societies   that   the   Act   requires

substantial  amendments. In fact, in  April,  1973,

the Registry of Co-operative Societies called in an

ILO  expert, Dr Jurgen Von Muralt, to look into the

matter.   Having  held  discussions  with   various

people, including the NTUC, Dr Muralt is on  record

as   saying   that  the  Act  requires  re-writing.

However, since then no further developments  appear

to have taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the provisions applying to meetings,

quorums  and  filing of various  returns  with  the

Registry of Co-operatives, the items which  require

looking into are: (1) The 6 per cent limit  on  the

dividends on the capital of a co-operative society.

(2)  Provisions  for reserves. (3) Restrictions  on

investments.   As   banks   and   other   financial

institutions currently allow much more than  6  per

cent  interest  on  their  fixed  deposits,  it  is

difficult for the co-operative societies to attract

the necessary capital funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While for some primary societies the provisions

under (2) and (3), i.e, provisions for reserves and

restrictions on investments, might have been useful

in  the  olden days they are unduly restrictive  if

the  co-operatives want to enlarge their  field  of

operation. This is especially so in the case of non-primary  societies operating in specialised  fields

such as insurance and banking. These societies  are

also   governed  by  specific  Acts  such  as   the

Insurance Act and the Banking Act which do regulate

appropriately   their   investments   and   reserve

policies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



Further   restrictions   under   the   Co-operative

Societies  Act  are  not necessarily  conducive  to

their orderly progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we need not have to wait for another

five  years  before something is done  by  the  Co-operative Development Division. What we need to  do

now is not amendments to the Co-operative Societies

Act but perhaps re-writing the whole Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, under this subhead, I would

just   like   to   ask  for  some  information   or

clarification.  I  am  rather  curious  about   the

description   of   this   Unit   for   co-operative

development.  I  would like to  ask  what  sort  of

encouragement this Unit gives to the development of

co-operatives and parenthetically, maybe  we  could

know  what  are the co-operatives that come  within

the  purview  or  supervision of this  Co-operative

Development  Unit.  What sort of co-operatives  are

involved,  and  whether we have adequately  trained

staff   to   conduct  the  encouragement   of   the

development of co-operatives?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know what sort of

supervision  or  monitoring  of  the  existing  co-operatives   is  exercised  by  this   Co-operative

Development Unit to see that the co-operatives  are

run  and  managed properly for the benefit  of  the

members  of  the co-operatives. In this connection,

it would also be useful to know whether we have the

staff   who  understand  the  management   of   co-operatives  and who also understand the  accounting

problems  associated  with these  co-operatives  so

that  they  may be able to see any shortcomings  in

the  management  of these co-operatives.  They  may

thus  also  be able to assure themselves  that  the

accounts are properly rendered and that members  of

the  co-operatives do not suffer because there have

been  cases of certain shortcomings in the  running

of co-operatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Singapore Government

Officers' Co-operative Housing Society has been  in

financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



trouble  for a long time. What measures  have  been

taken by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies to

solve the problems of this Society? Is it true that

this  society is trying to overcharge  its  members

for  payment of houses bought? What action is being

taken to solve the problem? How many of the members

who  have  resigned  so  far  have  realised  their

assets?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know how many

registered co-operative societies are in  existence

at  the  moment, how many are active, and how  many

have  been  considered as "lost in the wilderness"?

What  is  the  Registrar  doing  to  control  these

societies?  I  hope they do not become "crocodiles"

like some of the chit fund companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the present inflation, what part do these co-operative societies play to help the lower income

group?  Is it possible for the Government to import

essential products and channel them through  proper

co-operative  societies so that the middle-men  and

the big profiteers can be cut off?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to inform the Minister that one

of  the  officials of the Registry of  Co-operative

Societies used his influence to get benefit in  the

Singapore Government Officers' Co-operative Housing

Society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on

the Co-operative Development Unit, I share the same

sentiments expressed by the previous speakers.  The

function of the Unit should not be confined only to

the  registration  of  co-operative  societies.  It

should be developed into a body to promote the  co-operative movement in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe you will agree with me that the co-

operative movement is still in its infancy. At  the

present  juncture, we know that prices  are  rising

day  by  day  and certain traders are indulging  in

profiteering.  We also know that the  way  to  deal

with  profiteering is to set up more  consumer  co-operatives. The Ministry of Social Affairs can do a

lot more in this respect. In other words, it should

make the people aware that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



there  is  such a thing as a co-operative movement,

especially the consumer co-operative societies. For

example,  in  Queenstown there is  a  consumer  co-operative  society which has done  a  lot  for  the

consumers.  We  should make this as an  example  so

that  the  other  constituencies could  learn  from

Queenstown  in  setting  up  consumer  co-operative

societies. If we launch it vigorously, we  will  be

able   to   deal  with  profiteering   by   traders

effectively  and  to  counter  inflation   in   the

Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I agree

with the Member for Jurong that the Registry of Co-operative Societies should not concern itself  only

with   the   registration  of   co-operatives   and

administrative   procedures.   It   should   launch

campaigns to inculcate in the people the importance

of  having  a co-operative movement to counter  the

rampant  inflation. I would like  the  Minister  to

launch  a  campaign  on consumer  co-operatives  in

conjunction with the community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the consumer co-operative society

in  Queenstown has done splendidly. I have  on  one

occasion been to this co-operative society.  I  saw

people queuing up to buy the daily necessities, and

I  believe this co-operative society has made a lot

of  money.  This  money should be refunded  to  the

members of the co-operative society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Members for Jurong

and  Sembawang  are confused. We are debating  here

the  item on the Registry of Co-operative Societies

and not the co-operative movement. The co-operative

movement should rightly be part of the work of  the

trade  union  movement, and not just some  sort  of

work  of  the  Registry.  And  these  co-operatives

should be controlled, of course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also clarify what the Members said about

my  club  in  Queenstown. It is  just  one  way  of

offering  a  service  to my  constituents.  As  the

Member of Parliament for that constituency,  it  is

my   duty  to  see  that  residents  enjoy  certain

privileges, and if Members share



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



this view, they should start their own clubs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would

like  the  Minister for Culture to tell us  whether

his consumer co-operative is registered or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> It is not a co-operative. It

is part of the activities of the PAP branch.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I just want to make the point

again  that  the queries of Members for Katong  and

Anson  could  all be answered in a suitable  report

from  this  department. We therefore come  back  to

this  same problem again. The queries arising  from

Backbenchers  again and again consistently  show  a

need  and a demand for information, information  on

statistics,  information on  performance,  and  any

information that could lead them and help  them  to

undertake a more effective Backbencher-criticism of

the various departments.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, after what has been

said  by  the Member for Serangoon Gardens  and  my

colleague, the Minister for Culture, I do not think

I need answer all the queries raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever it is, Sir, the co-operative movement in

Singapore,   though  still  a  young  movement   as

mentioned  by the Member for Jurong, is  unique  in

many  ways.  The direct involvement  of  the  trade

union  movement in co-operative ventures is a  rare

feature  even  in  countries  which  have  a   well

established  co-operative system  with  the  active

participation of the trade unions. Furthermore, the

co-operative societies in Singapore have  developed

within  an  urban setting. The movement itself  has

undergone   traumatic  changes  in   recent   years

adapting  itself to changes in social and  economic

needs  and  to technological progress, so  much  so

that the existing co-operative legislation has been

found  to be out of step with the movement and  the

requirements for its future growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Registrar of Co-operative

Societies  is hamstrung in his work because  of  an

antiquated legislation and the shortage of staff  - again the shortage of staff. In fact, when Dr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



Von  Muralt, as mentioned by the Member  for  Telok

Blangah,   of   the  ILO  made  a  study   on   the

reorganisation of the Registry in April,  1973,  he

also  discussed with various co-operative officials

on the existing co-operative legislation, which was

enacted  in 1953 and geared to the requirements  of

the thrift and loan type of co-operatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consensus now is that we need to revise the

co-operative legislation to make it more applicable

to  the needs of the present diversified activities

and  development of the co-operative  movement.  Dr

Von  Muralt  recommended that the  services  of  an

expert  be  obtained to redraft  the  existing  Co-operative Societies Act. It is expected, Sir,  that

very  soon  an  expert on co-operative  legislation

from abroad, maybe from New Zealand or from the ILO

itself,  will be here on a six-month assignment  to

redraft the legislation. Once this is done, all the

other  related problems can he looked into  further

and with depth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong no doubt is aware of the

basic      principle     governing     co-operative

organisations throughout the world  -  that  a  co-operative  is  an association of persons  who  have

voluntarily joined together to achieve a common end

through   the   formation   of   a   democratically

controlled    organisation,    making     equitable

contributions to the capital required and accepting

a  fair  share  of  the risks and benefits  of  the

undertaking   in   which   the   members   actively

participate. In other words, co-operative societies

are  autonomous organisations formed by persons  on

the   basis   of   equality  to  promote   economic

interests.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-operatives determine their own management

policies and activities. Sometimes failure  of  the

management  results  in  financial  difficulty  and

inability to complete projects to the detriment  of

members.  Under the existing Co-operative Societies

Act   and   rules,   the  Registrar   has   certain

supervisory  and advisory functions, but  he  could

not and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



should  not  interfere with the internal  financial

administration of co-operatives other than checking

on the financial position and ascertaining that the

activities are run in accordance with the  bye-laws

of the co-operative legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings up the next point on the functions of

the  Registry. The Member for Katong  may  wish  to

know  that the title "Co-operative Development"  in

the Estimates is an old title inherited in the days

when  the  Co-operative  Development  Division  was

under  the Primary Production Department.  At  that

time  the  intention  was  to  promote  rural   co-operatives as part of the functions of the  Primary

Production Department. The present Registry,  apart

from  inheriting this title in the Estimates,  also

inherited  the structure and functions and  also  a

small   staff   geared  only  to  carry   out   the

administrative and auditing duties as far as  other

co-operative  societies are concerned.  It  is  not

geared   for  promotional  research  and   training

functions  which  are  considered  vital  for   the

strengthening  of  the  co-operative  movement   in

Singapore.  Whether the Registry can be reorganised

for  these  roles  or not will depend  to  a  large

extent  upon  the availability of additional  staff

which, unfortunately, was not made available to  us

despite strong representation from the Ministry and

despite  the  recommendations of  the  ILO  expert.

Despite  the  shortage of staff which has  remained

unchanged all these years, the Registrar has  drawn

up an ambitious programme which has already created

some  impact  and helped the movement not  only  in

diversifying its activities but also in  developing

a sense of common purpose and common identity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still much to he done. In April

last  year a plan of action to strengthen  the  co-operative  movement has been drawn up.  School  co-operatives  are  being  established.  Consumer  co-operatives  are  being  encouraged  throughout  the

economic  sector.  There is  now  a  close  working

relationship between the Registry and the Singapore

National  Co-operative Union and the  NTUC.  It  is

hoped   that   in  time  to  come  a   co-operative

federation will be formed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



monitor  the activities and give new directions  to

the  co-operative  movement in Singapore.  The  co-operative  legislation  will  be  revised  to  suit

present-day needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson made specific reference to

the  Singapore  Government  Officers'  Co-operative

Housing Society and the role of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies in solving the problems of this

society.  As  I  have stated earlier,  co-operative

societies   are   autonomous   organisations.   The

problems of this particular society could have been

easily solved by the sale of properties since  that

Co-operative   has  considerable  capital   assets,

including  buildings and lands, but the  management

considered this to be a last resort. The  Registrar

in  circumstances  like this  cannot  overstep  his

authority  by  imposing  his  will  upon  the   Co-operative to order it to sell its properties  at  a

time when property prices were rising rapidly.  The

Registrar  very  prudently avoided a  confrontation

with  the  management and endeavoured to  help  the

society in other ways. A loan was arranged from the

Government to strengthen the financial position  of

the  Co-operative. The activities of  this  Society

are  being  closely supervised to  prevent  further

misuse  of  funds  and  mismanagement.  Also,   the

Registrar  insisted on a priority list for  refunds

to  be  drawn  up.  Priority  was  given  to  those

resigned   members  who  could  furnish  proof   of

purchasing  flats or houses on their  own.  So  far

about  700  resigned  members have  realised  their

assets.  I  am not aware of any instance where  the

Society has overcharged its members for payment  of

houses. The Society normally estimates the price of

a   housing  unit  and  grants  loans  to   members

amounting  to 7/8ths of the estimated  price.  This

does  not  include charges incurred by the  Society

for  the  completion  of the houses,  for  example,

roads,  drains, sewerage, planning and  architect's

fees  and  legal fees, and so on. In  addition,  it

charges  one  per cent on those members'  borrowing

rate of interest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member's question on co-operative

societies  in  general, he may be pleased  to  know

that   at   present   there  are  77   co-operative

societies.  Out  of  these,  seven  are  considered

inactive, but I do not think they are "lost in  the

wilderness"  as  efforts  are  being  made  by  the

Registry  to  revive  them. I would  also  like  to

assure  the Member that there are no crocodiles  in

the  co-operative movement. Co-operative  societies

are  closely  supervised by  the  Registrar.  Their

accounts are periodically audited by the Registry's

officials,  including an accountant  working  part-time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-operatives are entirely different from chit

funds.  The  co-operative system and principle  are

specially designed to improve the economic,  social

and  cultural  situation of any country,  and  more

particularly  for  groups of  people  with  limited

resources and opportunities, based on the principle

of  self-help and mutual co-operation.  It  is  the

Government's  policy to encourage the  movement  to

grow,  and to curb inflation greater emphasis  will

be  laid on the formation of consumer co-operatives

and the WELCOME-type supermarkets. More and more of

the   existing  co-operative  societies  are  being

encouraged to form themselves as multi-purpose  co-operative  societies whose activities will  include

bulk purchasing to enable members to purchase goods

at  a low price. The Member's suggestion, Sir,  for

essential  products  to be channelled  through  the

appropriate  co-operative societies  is  a  welcome

one.  Already we have the NTUC WELCOME Co-operative

whose organisation can easily take on this role.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, as the Minister seems to

agree  with all my suggestions, I am just wondering

whether  we should make a $10 reduction after  all.

However,  we have waited five years for  amendments

to  the  Act, and with his assurance that  it  will

definitely  be amended this time, I  beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head KA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 3001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no objection to the Renovations to

Upper Barracks for Occupation by Ministry of Social

Affairs.  If  they want some additional  amenities,

let them have it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to know is why is there no

development estimates at all in respect of building

creches?  Sir, I would like to know what programmes

the  Ministry of Social Affairs has in  respect  of

building creches for the coming years. I also  want

to  know  the  number of creches that  we  have  in

Singapore  under the management of the Ministry  of

Social Affairs, and their hours of operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days of near full-employment in

Singapore,   imported  female   labour   is   being

utilised.  In many of our industries it  is  highly

desirable  that our own young wives be employed  in

the  labour  force. This can only  be  done  if  we

provide creches either in the place of work or -

<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head KA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 3002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is moved merely to seek

information from the Hon. Minister. I notice that a

sum  of  $4  million  is  to  be  allocated  as   a

Government loan to the Singapore Sports Council  to

meet  final payment for the cost of Phase I of  the

National Stadium complex. I would, therefore,  like

to  ask  the Hon. Minister what is the total amount

of  money  that  has been loaned to  the  Singapore

Sports  Council, and how much has  been  repaid  so

far?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember, when the Hon. Dr Goh Keng Swee

was  in charge of the Ministry of Finance, he  once

mentioned  in this House that the income  to  repay

the  Government's  loan to the Stadium  would  come

from  two  sources, i.e, the profits  of  Singapore

Pools (Pte) Ltd, and the takings at the gate of the

Stadium.   Since  there  will  be   no   Phase   II

development   for  the  National  Stadium   Complex

construction, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister

whether his Ministry is planning to make use of the

profits of the Singapore Pools (Pte) Ltd, for other

purposes, such as sports promotion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to

answer  the question of the Member for Tiong Bahru,

let  me first dispel the impression that the entire

proceeds  of  Singapore  Pools  go  direct  to  the

Singapore  Sports Council or the National  Stadium.

The  financial procedure adopted is for the SSC  to

put up to the Government a budget for the year, and

this  will  be  duly processed by the  Ministry  of

Finance.  After  the  usual pruning  down  to  bare

essentials,  a  certain sum  is  allocated  to  the

Council  either in the form of a loan  for  capital

expenditure  or in the form of a grant  for  sports

promotion. The total amount that has been loaned to

the   Singapore  Sports  Council  to  date  is  $12

million. There has been no repayment by the Council

so far, because they cannot afford it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the coming into operation of the Singapore

Sports  Council,  the takings at the  gate  of  the

Stadium  amounted to only $41,000. So you can  see,

Sir,  that it is insufficient to cover the cost  of

maintenance of the Stadium, which averages slightly

over $400,000 annually. From the start, it is never

intended  that  the  entire proceeds  of  Singapore

Pools   (Pte)   Ltd, are  to  be  used   for   the

construction of Phase II of the Stadium.  In  fact,

the  Singapore Pools (Pte) Ltd, started  operations

even before we thought of Phase II. Therefore,  the

change  of plan in the construction of the  Stadium

does  not affect in any way the use of the  profits

of the Singapore Pools (Pte) Ltd.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that the Social Welfare

Department  has done a great deal in looking  after

the under-privileged and the unfortunate people  in

Singapore. The Social Welfare Department has  given

care  and  comfort  to the poor  and  the  sick  in

Singapore.  It  has always been the policy  of  the

Singapore Government to look after the poor people.

But at the moment because of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



the rising cost of living resulting from spiralling

inflation,  many people are suffering in  Singapore

because of the high cost of daily necessities  such

as  rice, food, sugar and other items. In addition,

the  costs  of other items such as rent, water  and

electricity  have  also  gone  up.  So,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, judging from the present situation, I

am   afraid  that  the  present  public  assistance

granted  to  the  poor people  is  inadequate.  The

meagre  sum  granted  under the  public  assistance

scheme is too little for the livelihood of the poor

family.  May  I therefore request the  Minister  to

reconsider  revising the rates of public assistance

so that the poor people on public assistance can be

better looked after, in the face of the rising cost

of living?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister to

answer this question: how much has been granted  by

way  of  public assistance to the needy  people  in

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether

there  is  any plan or scheme to set up a home  for

the handicapped children?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Haji Mohd. Ariff is not here.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, what is the guideline

used  by the Social Welfare Department in the issue

of  permits for the purpose of entertaining inmates

of  welfare homes? During festive occasions permits

are  granted to certain organisations to  entertain

inmates,  while  certain  other  organisations  are

refused, without any reason being given. Since  the

inmates  are  being entertained  with  food,  cash,

etc.,  why  refuse these organisations  from  doing

their bit during such occasions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a report in the press about old inmates

in a certain home run by a Buddhist monk. The home,

if it can be called one, is in an old condition and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



the  monk stated that the Social Welfare Department

had refused to give a helping hand. Why is this so?

Does  it require publicity in the press before  the

Social   Welfare  Department  acts,  or  does   the

Department   think  that  our  old   citizens   are

unproductive to the Republic and, therefore, should

be treated as "embarrassing liabilities"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know how much pocket

money are the inmates receiving as welfare aid.  Is

it  sufficient  to meet their expenditure  at  this

moment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, may I seek your

permission  to discuss, under the present  subhead,

an   item  for  which  I  have  already  tabled  an

amendment?  My  amendment* is on  Head  KB,  Social

Welfare,  subhead AB 3001, regarding the  Home  for

Destitute   Persons.  In  view  of  the   line   of

discussion,  I thought if I were to  speak  now  it

would  be  easier  for  the Minister  concerned  to

reply.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head KB be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AB 3001.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Thank you, Sir. With reference

to  the  care of the old and chronic sick, I  would

like  to find out from the Minister what facilities

as provided by the Government are available for the

care  of the old and the chronic sick in Singapore.

I  would also be appreciative if he could inform us

whether the facilities available are sufficient  to

meet  the  present needs of Singapore. If,  in  his

opinion, the facilities are inadequate, what  would

be  the  Government's policy towards  the  care  of

these old and chronic sick people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with reference to the question posed by

the Member for Anson regarding the temple mentioned

in  the  local press on the 17th March  this  year,

what  steps  would the Government take towards  the

supervision and control of establishments, such  as

that  temple  in  question, which purportedly  take

care  of  the  old  and aged  sick?  It  is  common

knowledge that there are in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



existence in Singapore a good number of such places

which   are   neither  licensed   nor   under   the

supervision  of  either  the  Ministry  of   Social

Affairs,  or  the Council of Social Services.  This

temple in question has, in fact, been usurping  its

name  by charging its inmates from $50 to $180  per

head.  I think there is a case for the Ministry  to

step in to regulate and, if possible, supervise its

activities.  At  the  same  time,  it  should  also

supervise  the  provisions for  the  care  of  such

people.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go on to a second topic with regard

to  grants  or subventions to voluntary  charitable

organisations. May I ask the Minister what  is  the

present  Government  policy in deciding  grants  to

voluntary  welfare organisations? It is  well-known

that  no formula is used by the Ministry of  Social

Affairs  with regard to the provision of  voluntary

grants to welfare organisations. Would the Ministry

consider  setting up a standard formula in granting

aids  to  these voluntary organisations? A standard

formula  has  been utilised in some countries,  for

example,  Hong Kong, Japan and Australia,  to  good

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of a committee to review aid to

voluntary  organisations,  I  understand   that   a

committee was set up by the Government last year to

review  grants  to voluntary organisations.  I  was

surprised  to learn that the Singapore  Council  of

Social Services which is, in fact, a statutory body

concerned   with  matters  relating  to   voluntary

charitable organisations, was not consulted on this

matter,  and  neither was it asked to sit  on  this

committee. I would like, if possible, to  find  out

the reason for its exclusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on the matter of public assistance, I

think  there are grounds today for us  to  ask  the

Ministry   to  reconsider  the  rates   of   public

assistance. I know that this is an issue  on  which

the Government has very definite ideas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



We do not wish to encourage people to be passengers

but,  at  the same time, we must realise  that  the

cost of living has spiralled significantly over the

last  year. I can show Members concerned here  that

the public assistance scheme is certainly far below

what can really provide for a subsistence level for

the recipients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I seek to find out is really this. Would the

Ministry  of Social Affairs consider a readjustment

in  the  means  test? This would,  therefore,  give

incentive to a member or members of a family  under

welfare  aid.  We know that a family  under  public

assistance can receive no more than $70 and another

family under tuberculosis assistance not more  than

$120.  If we were to stick to the means test  under

the  present  scheme, then if a  member  under  the

public  assistance scheme were to come home with  a

salary  of  $120, in effect, he will  be  receiving

only  $10  from  public  assistance.  This  is   no

incentive at all for anyone in a family to  go  out

and  work  in order to increase the family  income.

The  same  can be said for those under tuberculosis

assistance.  I am quite willing to provide  details

of  such cases. My intention is that in readjusting

the  means  test we can, with the present inflation

and  high  cost of living, also provide these  poor

and needy people with incentive to work.



<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, can I speak on my amendment  on  Head

KB, subhead AD 1201*?

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head KB be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AD 1201.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I support

the  proposal by the Member for Sembawang. In  view

of  the present situation where prices of food have

increased sharply, there is a wide gap between  the

haves  and  the  have-nots.  The  poor  people  are

experiencing   hardship  under  the  pressures   of

inflation.  They are now in a sorry  condition  and

they need public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



assistance. They are suffering in silence. Yet  the

Government  has not considered whether  or  not  to

increase the public assistance. The workers have so

far received two salary increases, first, the 9 per

cent wage supplement as recommended by the NWC and,

second,  the $25 interim wage supplement. But  what

about  the  people who depend on public  assistance

from  the  Social Welfare Department?  Should  they

also not be given an increase in public assistance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to add my

views  on  this subject. First of all, let  mc  say

that  I agree very much with what has been said  by

the Member for Kim Seng, and that is, that care for

the  aged and the sick, as is being given  now,  is

not enough. In my view, it is not enough because  I

found  that  certain aged people who  need  certain

care are not given proper care or accommodation  as

in  the  home for the aged. In this respect I  feel

the  Government should remedy the situation. We all

agree  that  the cost of living is now  increasing.

Everybody  is hoping that members of a family  will

be  able  to  get  a  job and earn  some  money  to

supplement    the    family    expenditure.     But

unfortunately  if there is one aged member  in  the

family  who  needs  particular  care,  and  if  the

Government cannot look after such people, then  can

it  be  taken  as a loss of income  to  the  family

concerned?  From what I have seen  of  the  various

homes  for the aged, the facilities there are  very

poor   and   their  conditions  are  not  hygienic.

Whatever  views I may have of these homes,  T  hope

the Government would not overlook them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of food for the aged, I feel that

they do not have proper food. From what I have seen

at  the homes for the aged, the food provided  cost

no  more than Si per day for each person. At a time

when  prices of food are so high, T feel  that  the

amount of food provided is really too little. So in

line with what the other Members have said, I would

like to ask the Minister for Social Affairs to give

us a definite answer as to whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



at  this  moment  he is considering  any  steps  to

remedy  what needs to be remedied to improve  their

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  just now I heard various colleagues  of  mine

appealing  to  the Minister for Social  Affairs  to

increase  the aid to the aged who are  without  any

proper  care.  I  very much agree with  this  view.

However,  I  feel  that the customary  practice  of

providing aid to the aged is not the final solution

in  the  long-term. I believe that  the  Government

should  try  to  seek other avenues. For  instance,

Government can look for certain light jobs for  the

aged  so as to help them to be productive. In  this

way  these aged people will find that not only  are

they  occupied  but  they are also  useful  to  the

society. Therefore, they will not be a parasite  to

society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Sir, I would like

to  take  this  opportunity to  echo  some  of  the

comments and observations which have been  made  by

previous  speakers.  I  think  the  facilities  and

provisions in these institutions definitely need to

be improved. As mentioned by previous speakers, the

amount   of   public  assistance  given   is   very

inadequate   in   view   of  the   rapid   economic

development  and high cost of living. Unless  these

facilities   are   improved  and  the   subsistence

allowances are also proportionately increased, I am

sure  the  Minister will agree that eventually  our

society  will  have  to pay more  for  the  present

neglect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I do not agree with the Member for Bras Basah

in  describing the aged, who are without  care,  as

social parasites, because there is a Chinese saying

that  we  should give due respect to the  aged  and

befriend the childless and look after them.  As  we

all  know, these aged people do not have anyone  to

support them. We must, therefore, respect them  and

put  them in the home for the aged. This is one way

of  showing  our esteem and respect  for  them.  To

apply  the  term "social parasite"  to  these  aged

people is, therefore, improper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I share the sentiments expressed by the

Member  just now, when he said that the  amount  of

public   assistance  to  such  people   should   he

increased because they are in dire need. They would

not  try  to  fool the Government into giving  them

more aid. They are in actual need of more financial

assistance.  The  present amount of  assistance  is

merely  a  pittance to them and is only  enough  to

keep  them on a bare level of subsistence.  It  can

neither  fill  their stomachs nor  starve  them  to

death.  We should therefore increase the amount  of

public   assistance  in  the   present   state   of

inflation.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like

to  make a clarification. By "parasites", I do  not

mean  the  aged  people who are  without  care  are

parasites.  I was referring to certain  able-bodied

young  people  with good physique and good  health.

Such  young  people can actually  take  up  various

kinds  of  work in our society. But they are  lazy,

and  do not want to take up proper jobs. They  only

want   to   receive   public  assistance.   So   my

description is to apply to this kind of people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, all these speeches by  Members  have

deeply touched our hearts. We definitely share  the

deep   concern   of  Members.  But  one   principal

guideline   that  we  must  know  is  that   public

assistance  is  meant  to  assist  and  not  to  be

sufficient. However, for the less fortunate citizen

who has to depend on public assistance given by the

Social  Welfare Department, in view of the  present

inflationary condition in Singapore, my Ministry is

now exploring the possibility of an upward revision

of the public assistance rates -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> - even though it has been

increased  as recent as January last  year.  As  an

interim  measure,  we  are  now  looking  into  the

problem  of  giving  further  assistance  to  7,042

public assistance cases to help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



them  cope with the rising cost of living. A  study

is  being  undertaken to see in  what  way  we  can

increase  the  family income by finding  employment

for  the  recipient himself or for members  of  his

family. Consideration will be given to provide some

form  of  assistance, if necessary, for  those  who

because  of their age and incapacity are unfit  for

employment,  including the  very  old.  Members  of

Parliament   may   rest  assured  that   everything

possible  will  be done to alleviate  the  hardship

experienced by those people as a result of the rise

in prices of essential goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the guideline and permit for

entertainment of inmates of welfare  homes  of  the

Social Welfare Department, no permit is issued  for

purposes  of visiting and entertaining  inmates  of

welfare  homes by community groups. What  community

groups are required to do, if they wish to visit  a

creche  or a certain home, is to contact the Social

Welfare Department for permission, not a permit, to

do so. Normally such permission is readily granted.

It  is the policy of the department to welcome  and

encourage more people to visit the welfare homes to

bring cheer to the inmates. The department has  not

refused  any  organisation a visit to  the  welfare

homes,  except in circumstances where  such  visits

would embarrass the inmates of a particular home or

upset law and order in the home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed visits that might have been refused by

the  department would be visits by young males with

long  hair to a girls' home, or male visitors whose

intention to visit a girls' home for ex-prostitutes

was  doubtful. In other circumstances,  a  proposed

visit  to  entertain  only a particular  ethnic  or

racial group within a home has been discouraged, as

such  acts  of discrimination or favouritism  could

upset  the  law and order in the homes  which  have

many inmates of other races. Entertainment for  the

inmates of the homes should not be confined to  any

particular  racial group because we cater  for  all

the  inmates in the homes. Examples of such  cross-sectional entertainment are a grand dinner recently

given by a commercial organisation to all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



inmates of the Woodlands Home for the Aged  and  an

annual  Chinese  New Year party when  all  inmates,

irrespective   of  race  or  ethnic   group,   were

entertained   together.  The  Government   welcomes

welfare   service  by  community  groups  but   not

racialist welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the particular old people's

home,  I assume the Member is referring to the  Poh

Thong  See  Buddhist Old People's Home in  Aljunied

Road. I must say that the Social Welfare Department

has  never  refused to give a helping hand  to  the

inmates  of this particular Home, as alleged  by  a

Member.  On the contrary, I am satisfied  that  our

Social Welfare Department has in the past done  all

it can to help the inmates of this particular Home.

Out  of  the 80 inmates of the Home, 51 are  paying

cases, i.e, they are financially supported by their

own   relatives  and  dependants  who  pay  monthly

maintenance  charges ranging from $60 to  $180  per

head to the monk in charge. The department has been

helping  the  remaining cases, which are  eligible,

with public assistance allowances ranging from  $28

to  $50  per  month and with other  forms  of  help

wherever possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wrong to assume that the Social Welfare

Department  only acts after publicity is  given  in

the press of any such stories. In fact, long before

publicity  was made in the press on this particular

Home, the Social Welfare Department has during  the

past  years been giving assistance to this Home  in

its usual quiet and unannounced manner. Every month

Social  Welfare  officers  visit  this  Home.   The

department   has  been  consulting   the   relevant

authorities  on  ways  and  means  to  improve  the

condition  of living of the inmates.  It  has  even

gone out of its way to get voluntary social workers

interested in this Home to give a helping hand.  In

fact, before publicity was given in the press,  the

department  consulted  the  Singapore  Council   of

Social  Services,  which is the co-ordinating  body

for  such  private voluntary welfare organisations,

and  the  Ministry  on the possible  need  to  make

alternative arrangements for eventual placement  of

the old inmates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report that the monk is running the home

single-handed is not true, as he has employed seven

workers  to attend to the needs of the old  inmates

and  to  keep the place clean and tidy. The  recent

outburst  of publicity after so many years  of  the

Home's existence is probably due to the realisation

by  the monk in charge that the Home is in its last

few months of existence, in view of the forthcoming

acquisition of the land for urban renewal purposes.

Because  of the imminent closure of this Home,  the

Ministry  of Social Affairs has recently  issued  a

press statement advising members of the public, who

wish  to make voluntary donations to this Home,  to

send  their  donations to the Singapore Council  of

Social Services indicating that the money should be

used  for  the  benefit of the old people  of  this

Home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the question of pocket money for

the  inmates of our homes, I have explained earlier

that  the majority of the inmates in the homes  are

paying   cases,  financially  supported  by   their

relatives. The remaining cases as clarified earlier

are  being looked after by the department under its

public   assistance  scheme,  and  they  are   paid

whatever allowance that they are eligible for, each

case  depending  on  its  own  merit.  It  must  be

appreciated  that  the Poh Thong Sec  Buddhist  Old

People's Home is a private home run on a commercial

basis,  and it is not the general practice  of  the

Government  to give pocket money to the inmates  of

such  private homes of which there are  several  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng has asked about the

inclusion  of  the  Singapore  Council  of   Social

Services  in the committee for revision  of  grants

for  all the voluntary organisations. I would  like

to  make  this  clear  - the Singapore  Council  of

Social  Services  is, in fact, a recipient  of  the

grant.  So  it is quite unwise to put the Singapore

Council of Social Services on the committee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I have requested the

inclusion  of  the  Singapore  Council  of   Social

Services  on  the special committee  to  look  into

Government    grants    to    various    charitable

organisations. The Parliamentary Secretary has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



put the role of the Council very well by calling it

a  co-ordinating body. The Council itself, if it is

a recipient, is not, I think what its name implies.

It is not a recipient in the same nature as another

society  like the Society for Aid to the Paralysed,

because the Council itself is a co-ordinating body,

i.e, a  body that is responsible for co-ordinating

the  activities of various voluntary  organisations

doing  welfare  work. If the Government  recognises

the   role  of  the  Singapore  Council  of  Social

Services as that of a co-ordinating body,  then  on

the  matter  of  award of grants or  assistance  to

various  such  bodies,  I think  Government  should

consider  including this Council on that committee.

This is only a request, and I hope the Minister and

the  Parliamentary Secretary will  look  into  this

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Sir, if the Singapore Council

of  Social Services were to be the only parent body

in  charge of all the voluntary organisations, then

it  is all right to include it on the committee  to

review  aid to voluntary organisations.  But  there

are  many  other organisations which  do  not  come

within the scope of the Singapore Council of Social

Services.  If  we  include  the  Council   on   the

committee, then, firstly, it is very difficult  for

the  Council to face its members if the members  do

not  get any aid. Secondly, it is also not easy for

the  Council to explain its position because of the

other  organisations which do not  come  under  its

scope.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification.  I  believe that this  committee  to

review  aid to voluntary organisations is  in  many

ways  a product of the Ministry of Finance, and  it

is  well-known  to Council members that  in  actual

fact even a senior official of the Finance Ministry

was  surprised to learn that the Singapore  Council

of   Social  Services  was  not  included  in  this

committee.  I take this opportunity once  again  to

appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other matters, Sir, first, I did also touch on

the  question of available facilities for the  care

of the aged and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



chronic  sick. I am afraid there was  no  reply  to

this   question.  Secondly,  with  regard  to   the

question  of supervision or legislation  to  impose

some   degree   of  control  over   standards   and

facilities  provided for by various accredited  and

non-accredited welfare organisations, we  all  know

that there are a good number of homes that are  run

by the Government and the standards are good. There

are also a number of welfare organisations that are

grouped  under the Council of Social Services,  and

the  standards are also the minimum at  least.  But

there  are  also in existence in Singapore  a  good

number     of    purportedly    called     "welfare

organisations" when they are, in actual fact, money-making  organisations. I think something should  be

done  to control these organisations. If we do  not

move  in  this  direction, I am  afraid,  that  the

number  of  under-privileged  old  people  in   our

society  who  are helpless will become subjects  of

exploitation    by    these   so-called    "welfare

organisations".



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I entirely agree with

the   view  of  the  Member  that  some   sort   of

investigation should be carried out to  put  things

right in respect of such dubious welfare homes.  In

fact, they are mushrooming in Singapore. Of course,

people  who  do not want to look after  their  aged

relatives find it very convenient to send these old

people   to  such  homes.  There  is  no  condition

attached  to  those people who send their  unwanted

relatives  to  these  homes. Aged  people  who  are

admitted into our homes have to conform to  certain

conditions.  For example, they must be alone,  with

no  relatives, and must be really poor. But in  the

case  of private welfare homes, some of the inmates

can  maintain  themselves, as  the  Member  himself

knows,  and  they are paying as much  as  $180  per

month.  But,  I  think some sort  of  investigation

should  be  done on this. In fact, I have discussed

this  with  my  officials  and  we  are  going   to

institute  an investigation into this to  find  out

how many such homes there are in Singapore. Pending

such findings, I cannot say anything more on this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the

Minister for his reassurance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Sir, sending the

old  and aged people to such homes is, I think, the

modern  way  of  living. All these old  people  are

facing  a  lot  of  problems  and  difficulties.  I

believe  the  mentality of the  younger  generation

today  is  that  they  prefer to  send  their  aged

parents to the various homes. This is a modern  way

of  living which we cannot escape. In view of this,

I  would  strongly  urge the  Minister  for  Social

Affairs  to consider the possibility of  a  project

whereby all old and aged people may be given decent

places to live so that they can be well taken  care

of, especially those who can afford to pay. This is

a  project  where  the Minister  can  give  certain

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, as mentioned by the

Member,  there is such a home now in  existence  in

Singapore, and that is the St. John's Home for  the

Aged.  The capital sum required to build  a  fairly

comfortable accommodation of flats or rooms costs a

lot  of money. Unless that capital sum is found  by

the  voluntary  organisations themselves  -not  the

Government  because I do not think  the  Government

can  afford  to have such homes built for  them.  I

think society has a responsibility towards the aged

people   in  these  days.  Furthermore,  with   the

announcement made by my colleague, the Minister for

Finance, of the $750 tax relief allowance  for  the

caring of aged parents, I hope this incentive  will

persuade  the  people  to  look  after  their  aged

relatives and parents, rather than just put them in

old people's homes, whether run by the State or  by

voluntary organisations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank

the Minister and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary

for  their replies, and I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head KB be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AC 1201.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that creches for the care of

children   are   essential  in  an   industrialised

society,  especially when in our present  state  of

industrialisation we are faced with a  shortage  of

labour and are trying to recruit female labour  for

our  factories. More creches should, therefore,  be

set  up in the industrial estates. However,  it  is

one thing to set up more creches, and it is another

thing  to  improve the facilities in these creches.

And  if  the  creches  are  well-provided  but  the

service is not adequate or that it is not up to the

expectation of parents, the creches will only be  a

white elephant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an open-house day for the creche in Jurong on

5th  November last year, I made two suggestions  to

improve  the creche. The first suggestion was  that

the  creche should lengthen its opening  hours.  At

present the creche is open only up to 5 o'clock.  I

hope  the  opening hours can be longer in order  to

help workers on shift duty, especially those living

in  Jurong  area who work on second shift  so  that

their  children will be looked after. Therefore,  I

think creches should extend their opening hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion was that transport to the

creches   should  be  provided  for  the  children,

because  during peak hours it is very  inconvenient

for  mothers to carry their children to the  creche

and  then take a bus to the factories. If there  is

transport to send the children to the creche,  this

will  be most welcome to the parents, and more  and

more  parents  will  send  their  children  to  the

creche.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to ask

the Minister whether he has any intention to set up

another creche in Neighbourhood II in Jurong.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, with the new format of

presenting  the  Main  and  Development  Estimates,

somehow  or other the subhead on Children's Centres

and   Creches  completely  escaped   me.   I   must

compliment  the Member for Potong Pasir  for  being

sharp  and pointing this out to me earlier. If  all

of us exercise some consideration and restraint and

speak  under the proper subhead, it will make  your

job easier



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



and so also will it make the Minister's job easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also compliment the Member for Jurong for

touching  on most of the points I want to  make.  I

too, like the Member for Jurong, urge that the  few

creches   that   we  have  should  organise   their

activities in such a way that they will  cater  for

the  need of mothers who are engaged in shift work.

Perhaps   the   Ministry  of  Social   Affairs   in

collaboration with the People's Association, should

also look into the possibility of utilising to  the

maximum   the  facilities  and  the  infrastructure

available in the community centres in Singapore and

in  the creches as well. In places where there  are

no  creches, I believe the community centres  could

be  used  as  creches in the mornings and  even  at

night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is: are there any plans to build

a  creche  in Telok Blangah? The Member for  Jurong

wants  two. Good luck to him if he gets them. Telok

Blangah  is a new town. This is a new complex  just

coming up, and I think there is the possibility  of

a  need for a creche there because an area there is

going to be an industrial estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would

like  to  talk on something about creches. I  agree

with  the  Member  for Jurong  that  in  industrial

estates  there should be more creches to cater  for

the needs of the working mothers so as to encourage

them  to  work in factories. I would like  to  take

this opportunity to pay tribute to the Ministry  of

Social  Affairs for the wonderful scheme in setting

up  creches in Singapore. On the 16th of this month

I  was  invited to the opening ceremony  of  a  new

creche in Kallang Bahru. I found that the place was

very  spacious, occupying about 10,000 sq, ft.  The

facilities  were  very  good  and  the  staff  were

polite.  They are bound to look after the  children

very  well. Therefore, parents can be rest  assured

when they entrust their children to such staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that more creches should be built in

the  various areas, for example, in Sembawang. Very

soon,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



Sembawang will be developed into an industrial area

and  I  hope the Minister will remember to build  a

creche  there. There should at least be a provision

to build a creche in Sembawang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Sir, I fully support the views

expressed  by  the  Members for  Jurong  and  Telok

Blangah  with regard to the building of creches.  I

think  it  is important that employers,  especially

those  investors who run factories, must themselves

play  an important part. If they want employees  to

work in their factories, it is high time they built

small creches in their various factories. If  I  am

not  mistaken, they have such facilities in  Japan.

So it is high time they did something about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Sir, I rise to

support   all   those  Members  who   praised   the

establishment of creches. I should say  that  wider

publicity  should  be  given  by  the  Ministry  to

encourage the women to leave their children in  the

creches and go to work. At the moment the hours for

mothers to put the children in the creches are very

unrealistic. I should say that it caters purely for

the  majority of office workers or teachers. It  is

possible  that some housewives would want  to  send

their  children to these creches so that they could

go out to play mahjong. We have to change the hours

to  suit  the  shift workers. If we  are  going  to

encourage  married women with children to  work  in

industrial concerns on shift duty, I think we  have

to  change the opening hours of the creche. Instead

of opening at 8 am., it should be 7.30 a.m, so that

they  can  have  time to put the  children  in  the

creche and go to work.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

first, in reply to the matters raised by the Member

for  Jurong.  I am glad to say, Sir, that  the  two

suggestions  made by him are being looked  into  by

the Social Welfare Department. As for the extension

of  hours of opening of the creche, the Member  may

be  pleased  to  know  that,  though  the  official

closing time of the Jurong Town creche is 5.00



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



p.m., parents have been allowed to come back to the

creche  to collect their children as late  as  6.30

p.m, or even 7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, a survey is being conducted to find

out  ways  and means to improve the facilities  and

services available in the creches. The results  and

findings  of the survey, which include  the  Jurong

Town  creche, will determine whether it is feasible

to consider an extension of the hours of opening of

creches   and  the  service  of  transporting   the

children  to  the  creches.  However,  such   extra

services  can  only  be carried  out  if  there  is

sufficient  response from the parents, the  Social

Welfare  Department was most disappointed when  the

extension  of creche hours at the Toa Payoh  creche

met with very poor response. As creche services are

very  heavily  subsidised by  the  Government,  the

Member for Jurong will appreciate that unless there

is  ample  response,  it will not  be  feasible  to

extend the opening hours of the creche for the sake

of   a   handful  of  children.  Furthermore,   any

provision  of  transport services for children,  if

found  necessary eventually, will have to be  borne

by  the  parents  concerned, as the  Government  is

already   very  heavily  subsidising   the   creche

services  rendered to each child  who  attends  the

creche every day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Welfare Department has made enquiries

from  parents  using the Jurong  Town  creche,  and

learned  that  only  five  parents  have   so   far

expressed   the  need  for  transport   for   their

children. The result of the survey presently  being

conducted  will decide whether the need to  provide

transport  facilities  is  justified  or  not.  The

Social  Welfare Department maintains that it  would

be  pointless to arrange for a NTUC van or bus with

a  capacity of 20 to 30 children to carry just 6 to

8 children who require transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a second creche in Jurong Town, Sir, he

will  be  pleased  to know that the  Government  is

planning,   with   very  close   co-operation   and

assistance of the Jurong Town Corporation, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



build one more creche in Jurong Town, most probably

in  Neighbourhood  II.  The department  is  at  the

moment   actively   consulting  the   Jurong   Town

Corporation  on this matter, and it is  hoped  that

this  second creche in Jurong Town will materialise

soon  and will be a boon to the mothers working  in

Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Telok

Blangah,  Sir, he is right in putting up  the  need

for  the  establishment of more creches,  not  only

from  the point of view of promoting child welfare,

but  because we must actively encourage more  women

to  take  up  full-time employment to overcome  the

shortage  of  labour.  In  fact,  the  Government's

policy  is  to  build  more creches  especially  in

housing  estates, where there is a demand for  such

facilities.  Creches  will be  established  in  the

major  housing  estates built by  the  Housing  and

Development Board as part of its social services to

residents  therein and to people either  living  or

working  near these estates. As such, there  is  no

necessity  to  make provision in the Estimates  for

the building of creches. The normal practice is for

the   HDB  to  build  creches  within  the  housing

estates.  Once  the  creches are  built,  they  are

rented  out to the Social Welfare Department  which

will  provide  the creche service. If  there  is  a

demonstrated  need  for creches to  be  established

outside the housing estate, then provision will  be

sought in the Estimates for the creche.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be pleased to know that the Social

Welfare Department is now negotiating with the  HDB

for  a  new creche to be built in the Telok Blangah

New  Town.  The  Government  is  also  planning  to

establish  creches in other Housing and Development

Board  estates  where there is a high concentration

of  working  mothers for the benefit of the  Member

for Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible, Sir, to use the community

centres  and  their facilities for the  running  of

creches.  The Member, I am sure, is well  aware  of

the  intensive use of community centre  facilities.

In  any  case, creches should be specially designed

with special equipment and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



facilities  to cater for very young children,  from

babies of a few months old to children of six years

old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee has rightly

mentioned, Sir, that private concerns should play a

part  in  making  available more  creches  for  the

benefit  of  the  workers.  This  is  an  area   of

community welfare in which the private sector,  the

factories     and    industrial    and     business

establishments,   can   play   a    part,    either

individually or jointly with others. Commercial and

industrial  establishments  can  set  up   creches,

whether  big  or  small, as part of  their  welfare

facilities   for  their  staff.   This   helps   to

discourage  job-hopping and ensure that  investment

on  the  skill  given to female  employees  is  not

wasted  when they stop work just because they  have

children to look after at home. In my recent  visit

to   factories  to  encourage  the  employment   of

handicapped  persons,  I raised  this  question  of

establishing  creches with many  employers  in  the

private sector. The response from the employers was

encouraging,   and  some  of  them   have   already

contacted   the   Social  Welfare  Department   for

assistance in creche planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 would like to thank the Member for Sembawang,

Sir,  for his compliment on the newly opened creche

at  Kallang Bahru. In fact, I was told that he  was

the   first  person  to  register  his  child   for

admission to the creche.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the question raised by the Member for

Boon  Teck,  the hours of all creches in  Singapore

are  from  7 a.m, to 6 p.m. I think this  is  quite

fair  to both working mothers and mothers who  want

to play mahjong, as he has put it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in line

with  the  Government's policy on family  planning,

does  the  Minister not think there is a  need  for

these  creches to introduce rules saying  that  for

those  mothers  with  more  than  two  children  an

increased  fee will be charged if they  send  their

children to these creches? In this way we can  help

make  family planning more effective. Otherwise  if

we  go  on building creches, and they go on  giving

births, family plan-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



ning  is  going to take a downturn, and  1  do  not

think  this  is  the right way to help  our  family

planning to be more effective.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I

am  trying to point out to the Minister is that the

creche  at this moment purely caters for those  who

work  during normal office hours and not for  those

who  work  in  a factory running three shifts.  For

instance, for this month, a shift worker  may  work

in the morning shift, but next month when she is on

night  shift, she may also want to put her children

in  the creche. So my request is whether the  hours

can  be  lengthened so that those who work  in  the

afternoon shift or in the night shift can also send

their  children to the creches. At this  moment,  I

should say that the response in Toa Payoh is  good.

I  must  compliment the people running the  creche,

for they are doing a good job. What I would like to

say is: can we maximise the use of these creches so

that  all  industrial workers who are married  with

children can make use of these facilities?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  in reply to my remarks the Minister said that

there  was  a survey on the need for transport  and

that  the response was not very good. What I  would

like  to point out to him is that those people  who

make  use  of the creche in Jurong Town at  present

either live near the creche or they may have  their

own  transport  arrangements. But  those  who  have

transport problems have not been able to send their

children  to the creche. And I do not know  whether

there  is  any  response from such  people  to  the

survey. I would suggest to the Minister that if  at

all  a  survey is to be conducted, it should  be  a

thorough survey covering other people living in the

area  so  as  to reflect the actual  needs  of  the

people.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I want to thank the

Member  for Boon Teck for his suggestion. If  there

is  a  need for the hours to be extended to include

the shift workers, we will certainly consider it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the point raised about transport, we did a

very thorough survey into this problem and we found

that only five parents require transport. But being

a  man  who is open to suggestions, I will  satisfy

the Member's curiosity and direct another survey to

find out how many people really want such transport

service. If the number justifies it, we will have a

transport service for the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Bras Basah, he has got a

point  there,  Sir,I will bear his  suggestion  in

mind,  and  when the time is appropriate,  I  shall

then take the necessary action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to

occasion to refer a large number of cases involving

my  constituents, to this particular  section.  The

advice,  guidance and assistance. This i5 one  area

of  Government service which, in my opinion, should

he  further  extended by establishing  branches  in

selected localities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on going through the Estimates, one gets the

impression that for those departments which are not

revenue-producing there appears to be a reluctance

on the part of Government to expand or to improve

upon existing services, even though there may he a

The  Social Welfare Department is looking into  the

possibility of setting up branches not only to give

counsel and advice but also to render other aspects

of  social  welfare service so as  to  make  social

welfare services more readily accessible to  people

staying in different parts of Singapore. Whether or

not  it  is possible to decentralise social welfare

services will depend on the availability of  funds,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within the last few years, Singapore has

experienced  some tragic fires. The  Robinson  fire

was  the worst, where innocent lives were lost.  If

sufficient safety precautions had been taken,  such

a  monstrous disaster could not have resulted.  But

that is the past, and from this single fire, we can

learn  a  lesson.  May  I ask  at  this  time  what

compulsory  measures  have been  imposed  on  large

departmental  stores  where  many  members  of  the

public  patronise,  so that we may  not  experience

another "Robinson fire"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been complaints of cases where

the  hoses leak and the fire engines arriving late.

Surely we cannot boast of an efficient fire service

if  the  hoses  leak  when connected  to  the  fire

engines or to the hydrants. If that is the case,  a

four-gallon pail of water is a more efficient fire-fighting  equipment than a fire engine which  comes

late  and with hoses that leak. What is being  done

with  the  fire service to up-date it  with  modern

equipment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire-fighting equipment installed in many

establishments  serve as very nice  decorations  in

those  places. Even though they are there, I wonder

whether  the Fire Service can insist that  all  the

staff   are   taught   to  use  the   fire-fighting

equipment. Nothing is more disastrous than seeing a

factory go up in flames, when at the initial stages

the  flames  could have been controlled or  stopped

from  spreading  by using the simple  fire-fighting

equipment installed in the factory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, may I draw attention to the fact

that  some of our schools are hardly equipped  with

any fire-fighting equipment. Even if there are fire

extinguishers around, the teachers do not even know

how to use them. Do we have to have a disaster on a

scale  larger than the Robinson fire to prove  that

there  is  a lack of fire-fighting service  in  our

schools?  I  wonder whether this  Ministry  is  co-operating with the Ministry of Education over  this

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, of late

we  have  read in the press quite a lot  about  the

understaffing   position  in  the   Fire   Brigade,

indicating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



that  they  are  working  only  with  60  per  cent

strength.  Despite the limitation  in  manpower,  I

must say that they have performed their duties very

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the turnover rate of staff in the Fire

Brigade  is also very great, and the main complaint

seems to be that the fireman`s salary scale is very

poor.  It is time that something was done  to  look

into  the  question  of their remuneration.  To  my

mind,  the  fireman's job carries as much  risk  as

that  of  a  policeman. In the case of the  Police,

there  was  the  Lee Soo Ann Commission  which  had

ended increments of salaries and In the case of the

Fire Brigade are we not going to do something about

it? Are we going to step up the recruitment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the Fire Service is this. I

think it was only last week that our attention  was

drawn  to  a  fairly serious fire  in  one  of  the

Housing  Board  flats.  I  remember  watching   the

incident  on television. The building is  a  fairly

low-rise  flat, about five storeys  high,  and  the

firemen  were fighting the fire from  a  ladder.  I

wonder what will happen if a fire should occur in a

block of flats 20 storeys high. I do not think  the

ladder  is  going to reach that height. What  about

the  water  pressure? How is it going to reach  all

the  way up to the top? I do not know when was  the

last  time  all  the Housing Board flats  were  put

under close examination to make sure that the fire-fighting facilities are adequate and that the water

pressure is sufficient to go up to the top  of  the

building. I think the highest building in Toa Payoh

is more than 20 storeys high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the exits? In the case of private

buildings the present requirements for fire-escapes

and emergency exits are very stringent. However, in

the  case of the Housing Board flats, we do not see

any  fire-escapes at all. What will happen if there

should  be a fire in a high-rise block of flats  in

one of our housing estates? What will happen then?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to bring up is the

question  of modernisation of our equipment.  Under

the  Development Estimates there are provisions for

fire tenders. But how up-to-date are these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



fire  tenders?  Moreover, are we sending  our  fire

officers  abroad  to learn more  about  the  latest

techniques of fire-fighting? With the tendency  for

buildings to go higher and higher, there has been a

suggestion  to  make  use of  helicopters.  Are  we

looking  into this matter? There are a hundred  and

one suggestions one can think of. As the Member for

Anson has pointed out earlier on, the Robinson fire

has  certainly opened our eyes. I think we will  be

failing  in  our duty if we do not  look  into  all

these areas fairly promptly. I would certainly urge

that  every attention be paid to the safety of  the

Housing Board flats. Although I do not have Housing

Board  flats  in my constituency at the  moment,  I

shall  have  them  very  soon  as  they  are  under

construction.  Therefore, I feel  that  this  is  a

matter which concerns me as well.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Fire Brigade has always insisted on a high standard

of  fire  preventive measures in buildings, whether

they be private or public buildings or whether  the

building  is  a  block  of  Housing  Board   flats.

Previously  the  Housing Board was responsible  for

prescribing  and  enforcing  such  requirements  in

their  buildings on behalf of the Building  Control

Division.  The  recommendations made  by  the  Fire

Brigade  would ensure that in the event of a  fire,

protected   staircases  would   be   available   to

facilitate evacuation and that the construction  of

fire walls would minimise the possibility of a wild

fire  involving the entire building. All  buildings

that  would be frequented by members of the  public

are   also  required  to  install  automatic   fire

detection  systems connected to fire stations,  and

in-built  fire-fighting facilities, such as  risers

and  hose  rails, were prescribed for all buildings

for the use of firemen in an emergency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson may wish to know that the

Robinsons  building which he mentioned was  erected

in  1910,  and it was not built in accordance  with

the  current regulations governing fire  protection

measures.   The  fire  precautionary  measures   in

Robinsons  building  were  clearly  inadequate   by

present-day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



standards.  The  Commission  of  Inquiry  into  the

Robinson's  Fire  was satisfied that  the  building

could  not  have been saved by the  time  the  Fire

Brigade was summoned. The fire had been allowed  to

be   nursed  in  the  loft  stores  without   being

detected, and the fire-fighting squad was  fighting

the fire at the wrong location.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the leaking hoses, the Member may

wish  to know that a certain amount of leaking  was

intended in certain types of hoses to saturate  the

hose  jacket and to protect the hoses from catching

fire.  Both  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  and   my

Ministry  are satisfied that the Fire  Brigade  has

maintained its forces well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint that fire-engines

sometimes  arrive late, may I point out that  these

allegations   have  never  been  proven.   On   the

contrary,  our  records show that the  Brigade  has

always  responded  promptly to fire-calls.  Perhaps

people  in  distress are often prone to  over-react

and exaggerate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may also wish to know that the Fire

Brigade is ready at any time to educate members  of

the  public  in fire-fighting and fire  prevention.

Since  the  beginning of this year the Brigade  has

given  lectures  to  youth  organisations,  welfare

homes,  Government and quasi-Government bodies  and

industrial   concerns  on  13  separate  occasions.

Approximately  200 school children  and  industrial

workers   visited  the  fire  stations   and   were

entertained to a demonstration of fire-drills, fire-fighting  and rescue exercises. Through  the  years

the  Brigade  has  been advising  the  Ministry  of

Education  on  fire  protection  measures  in   the

schools.   The   Brigade  has  also  planned   some

programmes on fire education for the schools, which

would include lectures, exhibitions, film shows and

fire-drills.  We hope to implement such  programmes

during the course of the year.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether the equipment for fire-fighting in high-rise buildings is adequate or not,

I am happy to affirm that the Brigade is equipped



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



to  fight fires in high-rise buildings. The Brigade

has  a total of 37 modern fire-fighting appliances,

27  of  these appliances can each pump 500 to 1,000

gallons  of  water per minute at a reasonably  high

pressure.  The  Brigade is also equipped  with  two

mechanical ladders reaching a maximum height of 100

feet  and  one hydraulic platform of 65 feet  high.

The   upper  floors  of  high-rise  buildings   are

obviously   above  the  range  of  this  equipment.

However,  the modern method of extinguishing  fires

in  high-rise buildings is to fight the fires  from

within.  No mechanical ladder in the world is  high

enough to reach levels above 150 feet or so. Hence,

the   Fire  Brigade  has  previously  insisted   on

stringent  fire  protection measures  in  high-rise

buildings.  However, this function has  been  taken

over  by  the Building Control Division  under  the

Ministry of National Development since 1st  August,

1973.  With effect from 1st April, 1974, all  other

five  regulatory functions, including the licensing

of  dangerous  trades, will be transferred  to  the

same authority, so that henceforth the Fire Brigade

will be able to concentrate on fire-fighting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of use of helicopters, this is

being  discussed by the Ministry with the  Ministry

of  Defence.  The use of helicopters  is  more  for

rescue than fighting fires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of the shortage of staff in

the  Singapore Fire Brigade, I am happy  to  inform

the  House that the Ministry's negotiation with the

Amalgamated Union of Public Employees on the salary

revision  of the Fire Service has been successfully

concluded. I have the new salary scales  here  but,

because  of lack of time, I am not able  to  inform

Members  of the full details. But if they  like,  I

can  circulate  it  to them for their  information.

Sir,  it is common knowledge that the salaries  and

conditions of service in the Singapore Fire Brigade

are  not  as  attractive as those  offered  in  the

private  sector.  There  were  few  incentives   to

attract  good  recruits into the  service  and  the

Brigade   also   found  it  difficult   to   retain

experienced  and  promising  officers.   This   was

especially so during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



the   past   three  years  when   the   growth   of

industrialisation  in the Republic  created  golden

opportunities for experienced fire officers to join

the  private  sector as fire and  safety  officers.

Such  careers  in  the  industries  offered  better

salaries and were less hazardous than the job of  a

fire officer in the Singapore Fire Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage of staff is also due to crimping by

the  private  sector.  Last year  alone,  the  Fire

Brigade  lost one divisional officer, one assistant

divisional  officer and eight station officers  who

were top people in the service to the shipyards and

petroleum  companies. In the public interest,  such

crimping  must cease. The firms should  employ  new

staff  instead of taking experienced  officers  and

men from the Brigade. The Brigade would be only too

pleased to assist in giving the needed training  to

them,  if  necessary. Whatever it is,  Sir,  it  is

hoped that with the new salary revision of the Fire

Service  we  will be able to retain our experienced

men  and  attract more candidates of  fine  calibre

into the service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, the point on fire safety

at  Housing  Board  flats  is  still  bothering  me

because there have been a number of fires in flats.

I am just wondering whether the Fire Brigade cannot

work  together  with  the Housing  and  Development

Board. The staff of the Fire Brigade would have had

some  experience. They would have investigated  and

come  to  certain conclusions, and  perhaps  it  is

about time that they made a thorough survey to find

out  whether or not the existing facilities in  all

these  flats  are,  in fact, adequate.  What  I  am

particularly   concerned   are   those    high-rise

buildings.  I  do  appreciate  that  there  are  no

ladders  high  enough to go up to the  20th  storey

and,   therefore,  fighting  a  fire  in  high-rise

buildings is to fight it from within. But the point

is  that  if  within  the  building  there  are  no

adequate  facilities, then how are  they  going  to

fight the fire? They cannot fight from without  and

they cannot fight from within.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of adequate exits, fire escapes

and  so on, I think none of the Housing Board flats

has got



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



emergency fire exits, extra staircase, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I wish to raise two

points. Firstly, the hoses should be checked  every

now  and  then.  Secondly, when there  is  a  fire,

vehicles  on the road must make way for  the  fire-engines, because if there is a traffic jam the fire-engines cannot go through. The Minister should  ask

the Traffic Police to advise the public to make way

for the fire-engines.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, there has been a

discussion between my Ministry and the Ministry  of

National Development on the question of fire safety

precautions  in  Housing  Board  flats.  The   Fire

Brigade  has  put up quite a number of  suggestions

and recommendations which are now being studied  by

the  Ministry of National Development. We  have  to

wait and see what action will be taken by the other

side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member for Anson,

the hoses are checked and maintained, not every now

and then but everyday. But, as I have said, certain

types of hoses must be allowed to leak a little  so

that  the  hoses are saturated and that keeps  them

cool and prevent them from getting burnt. In a  big

fire,  the  heat is tremendous and  some  hoses  do

catch fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of traffic jams and the

suggestion  that  drivers  should  be  told   that,

whenever  a  fire-engine is answering a call,  they

should  keep  to the side and allow the fire-engine

to pass through, the fire-engines are equipped with

very  loud-sounding sirens. Every driver knows that

he has to give way to the fire-engine. But if there

is  a  traffic jam, nobody can move and so the fire

engine also cannot move.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the

Minister's explanation, I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head KC be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 3001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item is in connection with the setting

up of a fire station at Jurong. If my memory serves

me  right,  this  allocation has  appeared  in  the

Estimates  for many years, sometimes more sometimes

less.  Although we see this allocation many a  time

in  the  Estimates the fire station has yet  to  be

built.  We can only hear the sound of requests  but

we  cannot  see  the  fire  station  in  existence.

Recently, certain factories have been burnt to  the

ground, and the National Productivity Board  itself

was  nearly  burnt down. I feel that  the  Minister

should  pay  more  attention to  this  question  of

building  a  fire station at Jurong.  In  fact,  he

should give it top priority and should not postpone

it  year  after year. I would like the Minister  to

give  me an assurance now that the fire station  in

question  will  be built within the next  financial

year, and not postponed again to another year  when

I  will have to raise the matter and so wasting  my

time as well as his time.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I would like to

congratulate the Member for his patience, tolerance

and  keenness to see that a worthwhile project like

the fire station at Jurong is completed to the end,

as he has asked this question on several occasions.

Sir,  the  project was unavoidably delayed,  first,

because   funds   were  not   made   available   by

Government,  and then because time was required  to

plan  for the station. The Member may wish to  know

that  piling  work  for the station  has  now  been

completed  and  tenders have been invited  for  the

construction  of the fire station.  Provided  there

are no snags in the way, the fire station should be

completed  by  the end of this year  and  could  be

operational early in the new year. In the meantime,

I would plead with him to he a little more patient.
