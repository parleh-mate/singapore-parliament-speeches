   <b>HDB LESSEES AND TENANTS IN ARREARS SERVED WITH NOTICES OF COMPULSORY ACQUISITION</b>

   <b>(Particulars)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development if he will state (i) the number of rent and instalment arrear cases served with notice of compulsory acquisition of flat, (ii) the types of problems faced by such cases and (iii) the various steps that will be taken to enable particularly those facing financial hardship to cope with payment of their arrears without undue stress.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the past one year, 759 lessees who were in arrears of mortgage instalments and service and conservancy charges were served with notices of compulsory acquisition. Of these, 16 had their flats recovered by the Housing and Development Board. In addition, 845 tenants in rent arrears were served with Court Judgments and 48 flats were recovered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessees and tenants who are in arrears fall into one or more of the following categories:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) those who lost their sole-breadwinner;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) families which suffer a loss of income owing to prolonged illness of a family member or the loss of employment by the head of household;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) families who depend on a sole-breadwinner to support many young dependants;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) delinquent cases who mismanage their finances; including those who are gamblers and alcoholics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB makes a great effort to help lessees and tenants to settle their arrears. For those who would be eligible for assistance, the Board refers them to social agencies and the Social Welfare Department. The Board also helps lessees and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tenants who are in financial hardship by the following measures:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) allowing payment of arrears by instalments;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) allowing subletting of rooms;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) allowing resale of home-ownership flat (owned for more than five years) and purchase of smaller flat for a lessee or transfer from a bigger to smaller flat for a tenant; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) approving home-based work in the flat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, lessees are also given the following assistance:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) extension of loan instalment payment period up to 25 years;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) easy repayment scheme(Ballooning Scheme, which is lower amount in the initial years and a bigger amount in the subsequent years);
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) return of home-ownership flat in exchange for 1-room rental flat; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) inclusion of third or even fourth co-lessees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB takes compulsory acquisition action of a home-ownership flat or court action on a rental flat only as a last resort. Before a notice of such an action is served, the lessee or tenant concerned will have received at least three written reminders and several personal advices to pay up the arrears.inders and several personal advices to pay up the arrears. HDB will also arrange for him to pay his arrears over a reasonable period. It is only when all these measures have been taken and failed that the Board takes compulsory acquisition or court action. In many cases such action is only taken as a last resort after the lessees or tenants have repeatedly broken their undertaking to pay their arrears by instalments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Bo Wen):</b> Sir, in cases of families that have problems which are beyond their control and they are unable to pay the arrears, what steps would be taken to help such families to still continue to live in HDB flats?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already mentioned some of the measures. One way out for the family, if the family is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> occupying a leased flat, ie, a purchased flat, is to give up the bigger flat and buy a smaller flat or even give up the purchased flat and rent a flat. HDB will make the arrangements. But what cannot be done after repeated attempts to help the family, is to allow the family to continue to live in the flat when there seems to be no way for the family to pay the instalments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, despite what the Minister has said, may I ask why is it that at Area Offices, partial payments initiated by the tenants themselves are normally not permitted? I have received many such complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, in every case that I have come across, the tenant or lessee wants to make partial payment only after he has accumulated arrears of a large amount, and after repeated reminders to the tenant or lessee concerned to pay up. Once the amount accumulated reaches a very high figure and court action is taken or compulsory acquisition action is taken and the process is in train, if the tenant or lessee comes along and says, "Look. I want to pay 10% or 20%", HDB would normally not allow it. The whole process only starts after many attempts to get the person concerned to pay up. Once the process starts, I think the HDB will insist that a substantial amount be paid, which is at least 50% or 75%, in order to ensure that we do not unravel the whole process and then find that the person does not pay and we have to start the process all over again. But if the tenant or lessee has accumulated three or four monts' arrears and he wants to pay up by instalments, that would always be welcomed provided action has not started yet through the court or compulsory acquisition process.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether the Housing and Development Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority will consider replacing the coupon parking system with season parking for periods of 6 and 12 months for the car parks under their charge or, alternatively, privatising these car parks.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Lee Boon Yang) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to manage car parks efficiently and to minimize the cost to the users, a distinction must be made between regular parking at specific car parks and short term parking. Season parking tickets will not be attractive to those who do not need to park regularly in a particular car park.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's season parking tickets catering to the parking needs of HDB's residents who would park at designated car parks on a regular basis are sold for periods from one month up to 12 months. Similar season parking tickets at specific car parks valid for three months, six months or one year are available at a number of URA parking stations and some off-street car parks. But unlike HDB's season parking tickets, URA's season parking tickets are not popular.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of stand-alone parking stations, the Ministry is studying the possibility of privatizing them. For a start, it was decided to free private car parking rates from Government control to allow the rates to be determined by market forces.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st December 1987, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote to the Australian High Commissioner in Singapore to ascertain whether Edgar D'Souza had applied for permanent residence in Australia and, if so, whether the application was granted, and under which scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a letter dated 21st December 1987, the Australian High Commissioner replied that he was unable to provide the specific
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> information requested. He explained that this was because of the practice the Australian Government followed in respecting the privacy of individuals in their dealings with Australian Government authorities and agencies. The High Commissioner added that in accordance with the normal procedures followed in such matters, the authorities in Canberra had contacted Edgar D'Souza to seek his agreement to the disclosure of information as to whether he had been granted permanent residence status and if so on what basis. According to the Australian High Commissioner, Edgar D'Souza had declined to give such consent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Australian High Commissioner's reply, it is quite clear that it was D'Souza's refusal to give consent that had prevented him from providing the information requested.

   <b>TOXIC ASH FROM GARBAGE DUMPS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Dr Aline K. Wong</b> asked the Minister for the Environment what steps his Ministry is taking to ensure that the ash from incinerated garbage which is dumped in landfills does not contain toxic substances.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng) (for the Minister for the Environment):</b> Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, incinerator ash contains toxic substances especially heavy metals such as cadmium, chromium and nickel. These heavy metals are present in trace quantities in domestic as well as industrial refuse, and are left behind in the ash after incineration. Although we do not allow certain types of industrial waste, such as sludge and chemical wastes to be incinerated as they are known to contain a high proportion of heavy metals, it is not possible to segregate domestic waste as even waste such as wood and paper contain traces of heavy metals. Hence, like other developed countries that employ incineration, our ash also contains heavy metals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These heavy metals are toxic if ingested through the food we eat or the water we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> drink. It is important that our food and water are not contaminated by incinerator ash.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the ash from our incineration plants is dumped in controlled landfills located outside our water catchments. There is therefore no possibility that our water supplies could be contaminated with incinerator ash. Tests of our water quality confirm this to be true.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Information since the operation of the Mass Rapid Transit system, what problems have been encountered and what remedial steps have been taken to overcome them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications and Information (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Punggol has raised a question which is topical and of great interest to Singaporeans. Coincident with the Member's submission of that question in late December 1987, the SMRT put out a press release which answered the question in detail. Let me answer the question very briefly and I will ask the Clerk to circulate the press release which contains all the details. Some of the details have already been carried in the press.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MRT is a totally new transport system for us in Singapore. The public has embraced it enthusiastically. Because we are able to bring forward the start-up into the school holidays and in time for the festive season, the response from Singaporeans has been overwhelming. To date, a total of about eight million passenger trips have already been made on the MRT. This averages about three passenger trips for every Singaporean. Currently, the MRT makes about 140,000 passenger trips per working day and averages about 200,000 on a week-end.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I indicated some months ago before the start-up of the system, we expect some teething problems for such a complex system. Indeed, there have been some teething problems. Most of the problems are related to equipment failure because of extremely heavy or improper
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> use. Others are due to the general public being unfamiliar with the ticketing machines, the automatic gates, the escalators and the operation of the trains. These teething problems led to some congestion in the more popular stations, particularly during peak hours. Overall, the teething problems have been relatively minor. For example, the problem with stored value tickets is approximately 0.2% of all tickets issued; misalignment of train doors, approximately 0.1%; train delays exceeding two minutes, approximately 2.6%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MRTC and SMRT have been working very closely with the engineers of the contractors to resolve all these problems. I expect the equipment problems to be also resolved within the near future. I expect also with more commuters buying stored value tickets that the queues that we saw prior to Christmas will be things of the past. As passengers become more familiar with the system, the queues will eventually disappear. Indeed, reports recently indicate that there are no more queues practically throughout the entire day.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge members of the public to continue to give SMRT their full cooperation and understanding and to take these teething problems in their stride. MRTC and SMRT value their feedback. With the support and understanding of the public, we have built a system that I believe all Singaporeans are proud of. Let us help operate it well, so that we can be proud of the system for a long time to come.

  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how serious is the brain drain problem for Singapore in terms of the number of Singaporeans who have emigrated and renounced their Singapore citizenship over the last ten years; and (b) under what conditions the Government will allow such ex-Singaporeans to return and work in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Boon Yang (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minster.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, statistics from the Registry of Citizens show that from 1977 to October 1987, 8,144 persons had renounced their Singapore citizenship. In the same period, 2,772 persons had their Singapore citizenship terminated on the ground that they had taken up other citizenship. These 10,916 persons are known to have emigrated in the past 10 years. There are, however, others who have emigrated but have not yet renounced their citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statistics tell one part of the story. During the same 10-year period, 88,132 persons acquired Singapore citizenship. Another 67,400 persons became permanent residents. Of the permanent residents, many will acquire citizenship eventually if they have not already done so. We have not got the data to compare the socio-economic status of those who have left us with those who have joined us. We hope to collect such data in future. For the present, we cannot say whether we are net losers or gainers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister and the First Deputy Prime Minister have recently dis-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cussed in detail the implications of Singaporeans emigrating in significant numbers. Every Singaporean, especially a skilled and talented person, who decides to leave permanently is a loss to Singapore. Although more people are sinking their roots in Singapore than those who are leaving there is no room for complacency. Many who might in the past have come to Singapore are now going to countries such as Australia and Canada. Even some Singaporeans are going to these countries. If nothing is done and the trickle turns into a torrent, the well-being of all Singaporeans will be seriously affected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are free to travel. We cannot prevent people from leaving. Therefore, we must make life in Singapore more satisfying so that fewer people will want to emigrate. While we cannot duplicate the ski-slopes and natural sceneries of Vancouver or Perth, we can and must recognize and reward talent and ability and make Singapore a more pleasant place to live in. Then more foreigners who can contribute to our society will want to settle here, and fewer Singaporeans will be tempted to leave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not place any impediment in the way ex-Singaporeans who wish to work in Singapore so long as they have recognized qualifications or skills and can contribute positively to our nation. When they apply for permits to work in Singapore, the Immigration Department will consult relevant vetting authorities and decide each case on its merits.

  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Chong Boon):</b> Question No. 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although the Member for Potong Pasir is not here, I think it is right that the Member for Chong Boon has stood up to ask the Question so that it can be given an answer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reply to the Question. It is not true that the released detainees have been deprived of their constitutional rights to participate in constitutional political activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member is convinced that a matter is unconstitutional, which is a question of law, he can easily have this tested in the Courts of law. He can offer himself to any of the detainees, as a public service, to be their constitutional law expert and to take their case up. If the Member was present here today, I would have asked him whether he can inform us which detainee has been so deprived and which specific provision of the Constitution has been transgressed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Member ought to know that six ex-detainees had contested in elections previously.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Members may wish to know what are the restrictive conditions. First, it is that he or she shall not travel beyond the limits of Singapore without the prior approval of the Director of the ISD. Secondly, he or she shall not, except with the written consent of the Director of the ISD, be a member of any society within the meaning of the Societies Act or in any way assist in the activities of any society. And third, he or she whall not associate with or take part in or in any way assist in the activities of any organization which, through its publications, statements or other activities, has shown itself to be used in propagating Marxism or Communism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these restrictive conditions are necessary to prevent the released person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the Republic's security. There is nothing unconstitutional about these conditions. They are imposed pursuant to the Internal Security Act. Article 14 of the Constitution which deals with freedom of speech, assembly and association, expressly
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> authorizes Parliament, by law, to impose restrictions necessary in the interests of the security of Singapore or of public order.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three restrictive conditions do not prohibit them from taking part in constitutional political activities. In fact, they are free to stand for elections as independent candidates. They can even join a political party and take part in the activities of that party. But as the Member would know, and all Members would know, the whole objective of the Communist United Front is to penetrate and manipulate lawful organizations for its subversive acts. Therefore, he must obtain the approval of the Director of the ISD, and this requirement applies to all societies, not just political societies. And it is a necessary control so that the ISD can make its professional security assessment whether the person will pose a security threat or risk if allowed to join a society, or whether he will abuse it or will be made use of. Once he joins a political society, no further consent of the Director of the ISD is needed if he wants to stand for elections.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, under the Internal Security Act, the Government has the power to prohibit absolutely any released person from taking part in any political activities. We would not have hesitated to impose this condition for the recently released detainees if we felt it necessary to do so on security grounds. But we did not consider it necessary.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Regulation of Employment Act requires all non-citizens seeking employment in Singapore to apply for work permits if their salary is not more than $1,500 per month. Singapore permanent residents, being non-citizen therefore need to have work permits to work in Singapore if they earn less than $1,500 per month.

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work permits of 3 years' duration are issued liberally to Singapore permanent residents. They are allowed to work in all sectors of the economy and are not confined to the manufacturing, hotel, construction and domestic service sectors as in the case of foreign workers who are not Singapore permanent residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> May I ask the Minister how many permanent residents of this sort are refused work permits if they apply for it?

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have the figures here. But to my knowledge, very few, I think practically none, have been denied work permits because there are plenty of jobs available. The basic point is that there are fundamental differences in the rights and responsibilities of permanent residents and citizens. For example, permanent residents do not have to do national service, unlike citizens. So I think we should maintain some areas of differences in terms of the rights of permanent residents.

   <b>SINGAPORE DOLLAR</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the impact of the strengthening of the Singapore Dollar on the economy, particularly on new investments, exports and tourist trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whether Singapore can attract tourists and investments, and whether we can export goods and services depends not only on the strength of the Singapore dollar but even more on domestic costs, which are influenced by wage levels and productivity growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry has constructed an international competitiveness index which compares the cost of doing business in Singapore, including labour costs, productivity, and also exchange rates, with corresponding levels in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> which are our major export competitors in the region. I have shown a graph (Cols. 255 - 256) of our trends of competitiveness. You can see between the first quarter of 1985, when our relative costs were at their highest, and the fourth quarter of 1987, the most recent, our competitiveness has improved by 32%. The sources of the improvement are: labour costs, 88%; exchange rate, 16%; productivity, minus 4%.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1988/19880111/19880111-HA-0500255.gif">graph - SINGAPORE RELATIVE UNIT LABOUR COST (Cols. 255 - 256)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the CPF cut and the wage restraint policy account for nearly all of our higher competitiveness. The exchange rate contributed only one-sixth, mainly because other NIC currencies, especially the Taiwanese NT, have appreciated by even more than the Singapore dollar. The contribution from productivity growth is actually negative. Even though we have enjoyed good productivity growth in Singapore, the other NICs have done still better than us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitiveness has continued to improve in 1987, despite the strengthening of the Singapore dollar against the US dollar. This reflects the success of our wage restraint policy, and the higher wage increases in the other NICs, particularly South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restoration of our competitiveness has underpinned our strong recovery. Last year, our GDP grew by 8.6%, foreign investment commitments in manufacturing went up by 20%, and tourist arrivals up by 15%. Total non-oil domestic exports up by 32%, exports to the US up 29%, to Japan up 32% and to the EC up 45%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1980, the Singapore dollar has appreciated by about 7% against the US dollar. It has also appreciated by about 25% against the other three NICs. On the other hand, it has depreciated by about 40% against the Yen and 4% against the Deutschemark. On a trade-weighted basis, compared to a basket of foreign currencies, the Singapore dollar has appreciated by about 10 to 15%. As the Minister for Finance and I have earlier explained, there is no reason to expect the Singapore dollar to appreciate drastically, as Singapore runs a large trade deficit every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the stronger Japanese Yen and the weaker US dollar, some Singapore firms who import machinery and components from Japan and export final products to the US have had their profits squeezed. This is due not to the movement of the Singapore dollar, but to the bilateral exchange movement between the Japanese Yen and the US dollar, over which Singapore has no control.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI watches our international competitiveness very closely. It monitors all components of the index, especially labour costs. So far, the evidence shows that we are highly competitive and we intend to remain so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all figures which we have available and are relevant and helpful to our case have been made public. The US government has access to them. It is not a matter of intellectual conviction but of political expediency which is causing the US to look for scapegoats to attack in order to divert attention from the fundamental problems which cause their trade deficit.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987, the Singapore economy recovered fully from the recession and grew by a robust 8.6%. Growth this year is likely to be slower, 5 to 6%, in line with the expected slowdown in the international environment. With indigenous labour force growing by about 2%, provided our productivity improves by about 3.5%, we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> should be able to achieve steady growth within the long-term target of 4 to 6%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This forecast for 1988 assumes that there will be no global recession. We expect the US economy, our largest domestic export market, to grow by 2%. However, should a recession materialize, external demand for our goods and services will weaken, and our growth will be much slower than the 5 to 6% presently projected.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Kaki Bukit):</b> Sir, based on the growth of 5 to 6%, what proportion of the growth is likely to come from employment creation; how many jobs are likely to be created; and from which economic sectors?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clairvoyant as MTI is, we do not have the answers to all those questions. We are projecting a labour force growth of about 2%. It certainly cannot be more than this because we know the number of young people coming into the workforce, about 40,000 a year. You can tell roughly the number who will retire each year, about 20,000. And we cannot easily expand the total number of foreign workers within the economy very much more, because we already have so many foreign workers. So that sets a constraint. That means the balance of the growth has to be made up through productivity improvements. Whether we will achieve that depends on whether companies invest in equipment and training. It also depends on demand: having put in this capacity, whether we can sell our goods and services overseas. I am sure by the end of the year, what the Member wants to know will be known.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, could the Minister explain to this House why the recent stock market crash in Singapore appears to have very little impact on the growth rate?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, first of all, we are not sure that it has very little impact on the growth rate. There is a lag of about two quarters between movements in the financial sector and the stock markets and the real sector of the economy: exports, production. So far, as a result of the stock market crash, we have seen our leading indicator go down. After a very long period
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of improvement every month, it has gone down for three months in a row: down, then flat, then down again. Will this mean that in six months' time the economy will slow down? Maybe. It depends on what happens after this. But I think the stock markets not only in Singapore but elsewhere are in for an uncertain time because the fundamentals which were out of synch before October 19th are still out of synch.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much effect will the Singapore stock markets have on the Singapore economy? we think relatively less than in the United States, because fewer people in Singapore own stocks and because a lot of our economy really is based on companies which are not listed on the Stock Exchange but are listed elsewhere: all the multi-nationals, for example. Will this mean that we will escape? No, because our stock market movements are derivative. They are derivative on the US stock markets, the Japanese and European stock markets. So whether the global movements in the financial circles will affect us depends whether they affect the US economy. we will be on the same roller coaster. I think we will know in about three months because by then, the trend of the leading indicator will be known and whether there is any slowdown overseas will start to be seen.

  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, in view of what the Minister has said about the more robust Japanese growth expected for this coming year, are there attempts being made to push our exports in the Japanese market since that is where the potential lies?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not recall saying anything about more robust Japanese growth in the coming year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> In the review.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> That is in the review. We are pushing our exports to Japan. The numbers have gone up. In percentage terms, they have gone up quite well, but in absolute numbers, they are still low. As you are aware, the Japanese market is not an easy one to break into. There are many - perhaps impediments might be too strong a word - but many reasons why each time we move, the results are far
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> less than one might a priori expect. For example, recently we were informed that the Japanese were generously improving some GSP preferences for Singapore. There were a number of items. The one which was supposed to be of interest to us was peppermint oil. You might not be aware that we are exporting peppermint oil. In fact, neither was I. As it turned out, the total value of peppermint oil and many other things which we cannot name came to less than $200,000 a year. So the benefit might disappear into the decimal points. Nevertheless, it is a market which will gradually become more open because the Americans will push it and the Europeans will push it and we will do our little bit. And as it opens, our people should be ready to move in.

   <b>POLICY ON MEDISAVE</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching</b> asked the Acting Minister for Health if he will explain the policy on the use of Medisave by account holders and whether there are plans to extend it for other uses.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Acting Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, the Medisave Scheme was introduced specifically to meet the hospitalization needs of the average Singaporean worker and his immediate family. The immediate family includes his spouse, children and parents. It has also been extended to include his grandparents if they are Singapore citizens or permanent residents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Medisave can be used to pay for the hospitalization expenses incurred in Government and private hospitals. In the Government hospitals, Medisave covers the full hospital bill. There are limits to the Medisave withdrawals by private hospitals. These are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) a limit of $300 a day for the daily hospital charges which includes investigations, medicines and doctor's daily attendance fee. From this limit of $300 per day, $50 can be used to pay for the doctor's daily attendance fee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) surgical operation fees based on the fees charged in the Singapore General Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has already extended Medisave to cover day surgery, radiotherapy, expenses incurred in Government or private hospitals for deliveries up to the third child and recently Hepatitis B vaccination.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other extension presently being considered is the payment of premiums for the Catastrophic Illness Insurance Scheme when it is finalized.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, with this proposed extension of Medisave usage, are there plans to increase the contribution rate or to raise the limit of $15,000?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> There are no plans at the moment to increase the 6% contribution rate. However, my Ministry is closely monitoring the usage and the profile of the balances in the Medisave accounts to see whether there is any need to increase it in the future.

   <b>ABUSE OF MEDISAVE</b>

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Measures to prevent)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Acting Minister for Health (a) what is the number of reported or known cases of abuse of Medisave; and (b) what other follow-up measures will be taken to prevent abuse of Medisave besides those reported recently in the press.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the Ministry has so far detected four cases of abuse of Medisave involving false declaration of relationship between the patient and the Medisave account holder.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Random audit checks also revealed that there were errors in the submission of claims. These included incomplete filling up of the Letter of Certification by the doctor, and incorrect coding and classification of surgical operations. Claims were also made for multi-stage procedures as separate operations instead of as one single operation. We have viewed such errors as having occurred because doctors were initially unfamiliar with the Medisave claim procedures. To minimize such errors, the Ministry has issued comprehensive guidelines to all private hospitals
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and doctors on the settlement of Medisave claims.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry plans to monitor more closely the use of Medisave and to check on its possible abuse. The CPF Board and my Ministry will be setting up, by the end of March this year, audit teams to scrutinize the financial and medical aspects of Medisave claims. Private hospitals have also been required to set up their own audit committees. We will also be sending study teams to various countries with well-developed national health insurance schemes. They will study how these countries monitor medical claims and prevent abuses. These measures, when implemented, will allow my Ministry to better monitor Medisave usage and to prevent its misuse or abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that although the intention of allowing the use of the Medisave Scheme for immediate relatives is a good one for compassionate reasons, at the same time, it really has represented a big drain on the entire scheme because practically everybody who has got relatives would then depend upon their Medisave to foot the bills? At the same time, is he aware that there are many cases where actually the relative is footing the bill indirectly by paying to the person the amount that is actually taken from Medisave? So it is a back-door way of withdrawing from Medisave.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> For the Member's information, 40% of the Medisave usage has been for the account holders' own use. The remaining 60% have been split almost equally between the spouse, the children and the parents, ie, 20% each.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of any specific instances where relatives other than the approved relatives have been allowed to use the Medisave accounts of account holders. If the Member has any specific knowledge, we will definitely appreciate such information and we will follow up on such information.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Approved relatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Under the regulations, if the Medisave account has been used to pay for hosipital expense, then any
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reimbursement by any family member to the account holder should be paid back into the account holder's Medisave account. If the Member has any specific knowledge of such payments being made to the account holder without being reimbursed back into the Medisave account, we will definitely be interested to know.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware of the unintended impact of his scheme whereby a relative who might not otherwise be able to afford class A ward but by virtue of the use of the Medisave scheme of the son or the parent or close relative is able to afford it and it is the doctors, the hospitals, that really benefit from the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> The Medisave funds belong to the account holder. Singaporeans generally are quite careful about the usage of their money. With the setting up of the audit committees that we have planned, we will have a better knowledge of the amounts and the usage patterns.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo:</b> Sir, would the Minister consider taking serious action against known cases of abuse of Medisave?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> We have taken action to recover the money used in the four cases of abuse. If there is extensive abuse, then the Ministry will definitely see how we can further increase the penalties.

  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many blocks/units in the old Housing and Development Board estates have been demolished to date and in how many constituencies; (b) whether the programme has been carried out according to schedule; and (c) whether the HDB will consider building smaller and compact types of flats with separate entrances to encourage more 3-generation families to live together.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Lee Boon Yang)(for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, from 1979 to 1987, HDB demolished 136
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> building blocks comprising 28, 000 units. These units were from 25 constituencies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board's demolition programme for the period 1986 to 1987 affecting 61 blocks with about 12,600 units has been completed as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has no plan to build smaller and compact types of flats with separate entrances since many small compact flats of the 3-room type are already available in the old estates. There are existing schemes such as the joint balloting scheme and the multi-tier family housing scheme which are designed to encourage 3-generation families to live together. Under the joint balloting scheme, 3-generation families can purchase two flats near to each other and, wherever possible, next to each other.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has also undertaken a pilot scheme in Bishan, Yishun and Tampines to convert some 3- and 4-room Simplified flats to Multi-generation flats which are pairs of flats, one being a 4- or 5-room flat and the other a 1-room (self-contained) flat. However, the take-up of these flats is poor. Whether the building of 'multi-generation' flats continues will depend on the future response of the public.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications and Information (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Sir, the law allows for more than one distributor for gazetted publications. The FEER has nominated its distributor and we have given it approval to distribute out 500 copies per issue. Since the FEER has indicated that it will not distribute the magazine in Singapore, applications from interested parties for importing and distributing the magazine up to a total of 500 copies per issue will be considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, I have two questions. First, will the Minister revoke
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the approval given to the distributor nominated by the FEER which has banned its circulation in Singapore? Second, what is the Minister's response to the FEER's self-imposed ban for the magazine in Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, yes, if there is a need for revocation of the approval, the Ministry will do it if there are other applicants for approval to circulate the magazine.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the self-imposed ban of the FEER, the gazetted publications claimed to be champions of the free flow of information in Singapore. For example, the Asian Wall Street Journal, if you recall, offered to distribute its newspaper free of charge. The Government agreed provided it does not carry any advertisement. The Asian Wall Street Journal beat a hasty retreat and withdrew its offer. Now the Feer claims that it wants to serve all its readers in Singapore, yet they have imposed this self-inflicted ban of circulation of the magazine in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has stated categorically that it is not against the free flow of information. I shall be introducing a Bill later to facilitate the free flow of information in Singapore with regard to the gazetted publications. The Bill will make it possible for photocopies to be made more essily available to readers in Singapore. The Bill will put the gazetted publications' claim to the test. We shall see if they will change their tune.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, if the Member for Potong Pasir has read the newspapers, he would have got the answer. It is not true.

The objective is to enable the general public to have easy access to the magazine.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the drastic curbing on the sale in Singapore of the Far Eastern Economic Review and three other international foreign publications has hurt Singapore's effort to promote it as a regional communications centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, the gazetting of the three foreign publications has no effect on the printing industry in Singapore. The domestic export of the printing industry in the first 10 months of 1987 is $206 million, ie, about 36% more than the corresponding period for 1986.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only the gullible will believe the propaganda of the editors of the gazetted publications, that such gazetting will damage us as a regional communications centre. Sir, even the management of the gazetted publications themselves do not believe it. That is why Time magazine, Asian Wall Street Journal, Asia Wall Street Journal, and FEER, continue to be printed in Singapore does not give the paper the right to circulate in Singapore. Publishers of publications do not come to Singapore because they want to do us a favour. They come to Singapore because of the higher profits that Singapore offer them by way of lower printing and transportation cost, more efficient telecommunications, comprehensive sea and air services and a good total business environment. As long as these major factors prevail, we will continue to be a major regional communications centre.
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br> our efforts to make Singapore a communications centre?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I am not aware of the Economist moving its headquarters from Singapore because its headquarters has never been in Singapore. It has moved its bureau which probably consists of one journalist plus one or two clerks. I do not know the details.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not commented on the significance of this move. Whatever it is, whether it is the regional bureau or headquarters, the fact is that it has moved away from Singapore.

  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Acting Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, promotion of health and prevention of disease is the main emphasis of my Ministry's policy for achieving better health for all Singaporeans. The policy recognizes that prevention is better than cure. It includes a comprehensive programme of health education, screening and preventive health care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry's health education programme is structured to reach all sectors of society. It encourages Singaporeans to lead a healthy lifestyle through the inculcation of healthy habits, good nutrition, adequate exercise and relaxation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As heart disease and cancers cause the largest number of premature deaths, mass media and individual programmes to reduce the risk of these diseases have been introduced in recent years. For example, in 1986 my Ministry launched the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font>

  <b>The First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I bet to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Objectives of Bill</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill, and the one following it, the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> together secure the long-term political stability of Singapore in two ways: first, by ensuring that Parliament will always be multi-racial and representative of our society, and second, by encouraging the practice of multi-racial politics by all political parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Multi-racialism - a fundamental axiom of Singapore politics</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a multi-racial, multi-religious society, but not by chance. For Singaporeans to enjoy racial and religious harmony, the PAP and the Government consider multi-racialism to be a fundamental axiom of politics in Singapore. It is an issue of such vital importance that there can be no room for polite disagreement. It is a key objective in the PAP Constitution, which reads:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To forge a nation of Singaporeans: to build a multi-racial society, fair, just and tolerant to all, whatever their race, language and religion; to infuse into Singaporeans a sense of national identity and to bind them together by patriotism and commitment to Singapore."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has always enjoyed racial and religious harmony. Harmony has resulted from the philosophy, policies and practice of the PAP, and the precautions taken by the Government. For example, soon after Singapore separated from Malaysia on 9th August 1965, the Government set up a Constitutional Commission to see how the rights of the racial, linguistic and religious minorities could be protected and adequately safeguarded in the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr E.W. Barker was then the Minister for Law and National Development. He told this House, on 22nd December 1965:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the cornerstones of the policy of the Government is a multi-racial Singapore. We are a nation comprising peoples of various races who constitute her citizens, and our citizens are equal regardless of differences of race, language, culture and religion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst a multi-racial secular society is an ideal espoused by many, it is a dire necessity for our survival in the midst of turmoil and pressures of big power conflict in an area where new nationalisms are seeking to assert themselves in the place of old European empires in Asia. In such a setting a nation based on one race, one language and one religion, when its people are multi-racial, is one doomed for destruction.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure this bias in favour of multi-racialism and the equality of our citizens, whether they belong to majority or minority groups, a Constitutional Commission is being appointed to help formulate these constitutional safeguards."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the recommendations by the Constitutional Commission was one which led to the setting up of a Presidential Council for Minority Rights. The proposal to elect Team MPs or MPs on a group basis in Group Representation Constituencies is to be seen against this backdrop.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>When Bill first discussed</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister and I first discussed the need to secure a multi-racial Parliament in July 1982. He was concerned at a voting trend which showed young voters preferring candidates who were best suited to their own needs without being sufficiently aware of the need to return a racially balanced party slate of candidates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every constituency in Singapore is integrated racially; the majority of the constituents are Chinese. A Malay candidate is disadvantaged against a Chinese candidate on the basis of race, language, including dialects, and religion. If the voting trend continues, there would be fewer and fewer Malay MPs. The problem is not so much with the established Malay MPs, but with first-time Malay candidates. Once an MP is established, his merits are known to the voters. But a first-time Malay candidate would be vulnerable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister feared that in the 1990s, the Malays could be under-represented in Parliament. He asked me to discuss this problem and also his proposed solution with my colleagues. He proposed twin constituencies as a solution where of the two candidates one must be a Malay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I agreed that this problem was real. We agreed that we should find a way to ensure that Parliament would always remain multi-racial. But we could not agree on the Prime Minister's proposed solution of twin constituencies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ahmad Mattar, for example, was against it. He wrote to me on 30th September 1982:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not in favour of the idea. We should avoid it if we can. As a Malay, I don't think I would like to contest
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in any Elections where my victory is guaranteed - not because I am a 'strong' candidate but because I have a so-called 'strong' twin brother to lean on."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Ahmad Mattar recognized the problem and the need for a solution, for he added:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the objective is to ensure that there will always be minimum Malay/Muslim representation in Parliament, I am quite agreeable to the idea of having 'Nominated' seats in Parliament, the filling of which is left to the President."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I wrote to the Prime Minister on 7th October 1982:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The younger Ministers are not attracted by the idea of twin constituencies. They think by introducing racial considerations into elections we will be undoing what we have achieved so far, ie, giving all Singaporeans regardless of race a sense of equality and self-respect. They fear that twin constituencies will undermine the self-respect an confidence of the Malays. I share the same misgiving but at the same time recognize the larger problem of a non-representative Parliament."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister replied the next day (8th October 1982):
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can understand Ahmad Mattar's reaction. He has expressed his feelings at the prospect of his being a passenger in a twin constituency. If the younger leadership does not want to go through with it, I am prepared to live with the consequences of one election where we have lost half the Malay seats and let the lesson be learnt the painful way."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger Ministers chose not to go through with it in the 1984 General Elections. We thought we should not rush things. We should take our time to find the best solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Review after 1984 General Elections</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 1984 General Elections, we felt the problem more keenly. The voting in the General Elections of December 1984 showed a continuation in the trend of younger voters preferring candidates who were better qualified and suited to serve their own needs because of their education, abilities, culture and languages, including dialects. The older voters voted for the party rather than the candidate out of experience and habit. They accept the need for a multi-racial Parliament. But the younger voters have not lived through the same excruciating experiences, the acrimony, the racial riots. And at each election, more thousands of first-time voters join the rank.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chandra Das, the MP for Chong Boon, for example, particularly felt the pressure of this voting trend in 1984. Ling How Doong was Chiam's man, standing for the SDP, whose party constitution does not include multi-racialism as one of its objectives. It was reported that when Ling went campaigning house to house, he would ask in Mandarin and dialects, whether "that Indian man" had visited them. Chandra Das, a strong PAP candidate, got only 55% of the vote. Ling How Doong is now the Chairman of the SDP. The newspapers reported him as being against the idea of Team MPs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> So am I.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Tan Chee Kien, the former Chairman of the Singapore United Front, picked Kaki Bukit. Saidi Shariff was our MP before the general elections. Tan Chee Kien did not know that we were going to change Saidi Shariff for Chew Heng Ching. I am convinced that had we not changed our candidate in Kaki Bukit, and also in Telok Blangah, we would have lost the two seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>What the problem is</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make clear what our fears are. We do not like to lose. Nobody likes to lose, but that is hardly the reason for introducing the concept of Team MPs. If opposition candidates defeat the PAP Chinese candidates, that is a loss, but there is no great problem. There is no trauma for the nation. There will still be many Chinese MPs in Parliament. But if they defeat the PAP Malay candidates, chances are the PAP Malay candidates would have lost to non-Malay candidates. Then a problem is created because there will be fewer and fewer Malay MPs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP has gone out of its way to find and field good Malay candidates. It has succeeded, but only with great difficulty, because the pool of Malay professionals is so small. Opposition parties are under no obligation whatsoever to make the same effort. The SDP did not field a single candidate from the minority community in the last General Election.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is make-belief to pretend that race and language do not affect voter preferences. I am not saying that there are no other factors. There are other factors like a candidate's character, charisma and copetence. But race and language do influence boter preferences. It is not so elsewhere in the world, in Britain and United States, for example. Welsh candidates beat English candidates in Wales. And it is no secret that an Irish American stands a better chance of winning in Boston against all others. Even when all the candidates are of the same race and speak the same language, their dialect group or where they come from plays a part in their electoral support. Look at the recent Presidential elections in Korea. The three main candidates drew their main support from their native province.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to find a way to induce all serious political parties to field candidates from the Malay and Other Minorities. This way, whether the PAP loses a seat or wins a seat, there will be an adequate number of Malays and members of the other minority communities in Parliament. Paradoxical as it may seem, to ensure that multi-racialism succeeds in Singapore, we have to openly recognize that race does play a part in politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Acceptance of GRCs by Malay MPS</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982 our Malay MPs rejected the idea of twin constituencies. Their experience in 1984 changed their views. They now agree with group representation as a safeguard to ensure that Malay candidates, particularly first-time Malay candidates, will be returned in future elections in fair numbers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, the Indian MPs did not support the proposal of twin constituencies either. They now support group representation. They, both the Malay and Indian MPs recognize that the problem can get worse with more first-time voters joining the rank.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Town Councils and GRCs</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, we were implementing three pilot schemes in Ang Mo Kio to test out the feasibility of forming town councils
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to manage public housing estates. From the experience gained, we decided that town councils are feasible and beneficial to the residents. We also concluded that an economic size for town councils to manage is a group of three constituencies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town council proposal and the team MP proposal are two different concepts. One is to give residents more authority, more responsibility, to manage their own housing estates; the other is to ensure that Parliament would always be multi-racial. But though the two concepts are different, they are compatible. After an election three MPs, although they are voted in separately, can get together to form a town council. Also, after an election, a group of MPs, three in this case, in a Group Representation Constituency, can also form a town council. Thus, though the two concepts are different, they can be worked together. That was how Group Representation Constituencies, each about the size of three single-member constituencies and each to be served by a team of three MPs, came to replace twin constituencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Group Strength and Decisive Role of Malay Candidates</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With group representation, candidates will contest for election on their strength as a group. Each one of them has to be an asset and no one can be a liability. Whether a candidate is a Chinese, a Malay, or an Indian, he cannot be a weak candidate. Because if he is, he is going to pull down the whole team. The quality of the Malay candidate in the group of three can be decisive. This is so where the non Malay candidates in the two contending teams are of about the same quality and of about the same value to the electorate. Then, the quality of the Malay candidate will decide which team will win the election, particularly if in the constituency there are 20 to 30% Malays. At present, we all know that the Opposition is unlikely to be able to field non-Malay candidates of the calibre of the PAP's Chinese candidates. But we do not make the assumption that they cannot do so in future. When they do, then the quality of the Malay candidate becomes decisive. Because if the two Chinese candidates in each team are of about the same quality, then the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Malay candidate will play a decisive part in determing which team wins an election. The Malay candidate helps the team to win, just as the team helps him to win.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Events which reinforced our thinking</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several events in 1987 also influenced our thinking and reinforced our conviction that we should introduce voting on a group basis in certain constituencies in Singapore. Two were external events, and one internal.
  <br>
  <br>(A)
  <i>External</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First was the open war between the Tamils and the Singhalese in Sri Lanka, leading to intervention by Indian troops. The Tamils felt neglected, discriminated against and threatened. Parliamentary democracy, similar to ours, has not safeguarded their interests. They resorted to extra-Parliamentary means to protect their interests. Second was the military coup in Fiji mounted by Col Rabuka against an elected government. The native Fijian-based political party lost the general elections to the Indian-based party. The military, which is controlled by native Fijians, overthrew the newly-elected government because the Fijians, who are in the minority in Fiji, felt threatened by an Indian-dominated government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two events highlighted one basic fact of a multi-racial society - that when a minority feels threatened, it will resort to all means, including non-constitutional means, to safeguard its interests. These were external lessons.
  <br>
  <br>(B)
  <i>Internal</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also an internal event which brought home the reality that we are a multi-racial society. Do you remember how the Malays and Muslims reacted over the visit of President Herzog? Do you remember how they reacted when Lee Hsien Loong brought up the subject of Malays in the SAF? Suppose there are no Malays in Parliament, how would we have discussed such issues like the participation of Malays in the SAF? Would non-Malay MPs be able to explain the issues to the Malays, and achieve understanding? Would such issues have remained only an amicable debate?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Need for Multi-Racial Parliament</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all Singaporeans, but the fact remains that we are Singaporeans made up of many races. It is harmful for stability and harmony if one important racial community is not adequately represented in Parliament, where our laws are passed, where government policies are debated. That community is bound to feel aggrieved, resentful, and fustrated. And you cannot blame the community. Frustration will lead to communal distrust and distrust to friction. Eventually, sparks will fly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a disaster for the Chinese community in Singapore if Singapore wakes up one day to find that we have an all-Chinese Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Bill to establish GRCs</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to prevent such an unhealthy situation from arising. It is the culmination of five years of discussion within the PAP leadership, including the Malay MPs. It is the best mechanism we can think of, amongst all proposals considered. It seeks to ensure that Parliament will always be multi-racial by requiring some constituencies to be contested on a group basis. These will be larger constituencies, each having about three times as many voters as single-member constituencies. They will be represented by three MPs each. Parties contesting in these constituencies or GRCs must put up a team of three candidates. Of the three candidates, one must come from either the Malay community or another minority community. Thus, if there are 13 such larger constituencies, at least 13 Members of Parliament will come from either the Malay community or another minority community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, GRCs overcome the problem of voters picking candidates only on their personal attributes and ignoring the larger need for a racially balanced slate of candidates in Parliament. Whichever group wins, whether it is the PAP's group or the Opposition's group, there will always be a multi-racial group. This way, voters can still vote on the basis of who can serve them best, and yet return a racially-balanced slate of candidates to Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Multi-Racial Politics - Larger Objective of Bill</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also has a larger objective beyond merely guaranteeing that Parliament would always be multi-racial in character. It makes it necessary for all political parties to adopt a multi-racial approach in their competition for seats in Parliament if they hope to form the government. Constituencies to be contested by multi-racial teams of candidates will require political parties and their candidates to take a moderate, multi-racial approach when campaigning instead of a communal or racially extreme approach.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. In a GRC, one of the three candidates must come from the minority community. In other words, in a GRC, there will always be someone coming either from the Malay community, Indian or another minority community. There would be at least two ethnic groups in a team of three contesting in a GRC. In fact, it is possible to have a team comprising candidates coming from three ethnic groups. Each will provide a check on other. It will provide a check on another candidate who may be tempted to exploit communal sentiments in order to win votes. For example, if a Chinese candidate were to go around campaiging talking about "that Indian man", that Indian man in his team would also loss electoral support. And the loss of support for that Indian man in his team would also affect him. Ther is therefore a vested interest to force candidates in the team to take a moderate multi-racial line in campaigning. This is a self-check mechanism in the GRC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since GRCs will have a multi-racial team of candidates, this Bill, once passed, will require all parties to field a racially balanced slate of candidates if they want to win power. GRCs will produce almost half the number of MPs. Whichever party wants to win power in Singapore must contest in them. It cannot just contest in single-member constituencies. That will be an open admission of its failure to field a multi-racial team. Just like the Member for Potong Pasir who admitted just now that in the last elections, he could only field four candidates from one community. Any party intending to assume office must act and offer itself as an alternative
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> government and must move into centre ground to win Malay votes, and Indian votes besides Chinese votes in order to capture power. A party which does not do so and contest only in the single-member constituencies is unlikely to be able to win power. It is unlikely that such a party fielding candidates from one or two communities only can sweep all the single-member constituency seats. This is the larger purpose of the Bill for Team MPs - to require all parties which aspire to form the government to enhance and practise multi-racial politics and policies. It is the philosophical underpinning for Team MPs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Details of the Bill</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I shall deal with the details of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 enables the President to declare a certain number of constituencies where Parliamentary elections will be held on a group basis. Such constituencies will be known as Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). Each group will have three candidates and this clause allows the President to stipulate that one of the three candidates in every group shall be a person belonging to the Malay community, or a person belonging to any other minority community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause also limits the number of MPs to be returned by all GRCs to half the total number of MPs to be returned at a general election. In the next election, if the total number of MPs remains at 79, the number of GRCs will not exceed 13, or 39 MPs. There will be at least 40 seats where opposition parties which cannot field a team of multi-racial candidates can still contest. Such opposition parties are not shut out by this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 stipulates that no by-election will be held to fill any vacancy unless all the three members of that GRC have vacated their seats in Parliament. This is to ensure that no Member who has been elected under a GRC will be forced to vacate his seat through the departure of his team-mates, for whatever reason.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 requires all three candidates in a GRC to belong to the same political party, or if they are independent candidates, standing as a group, contesting
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> under one common logo. This requirement is to ensure that each group of three candidates contesting in a GRC share generally the same political values and can work as a team to serve the constituents. It is to discourage marriages of convenience for the purpose of contesting in a GRC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 also defines the phrase "person belonging to the Malay community".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 also requires any person who desires to contest as a candidate from the Malay or other minority community to apply to the appropriate committee for a certificate stating that he belongs to that particular community. The appropriate committee shall decide and its decision will be final. The members of the two committees shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights. They must also be members of their appropriate community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this certification is, firstly, to ensure that the minority communities are properly represented by people who are accepted as members of their communities and, secondly, that there is no dispute over this point on Nomination Day.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 15 spell out the procedure and conduct of an election in GRCs. Each voter in any GRC will have one vote. He votes for a group of candidates and not for the candidates in the group separately. The group of candidates receiving the highest number of votes will be declared elected. The three candidates in the group thus elected will serve as Members of Parliament for that GRC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 16 to 26 make consequential amendments to the Act arising from the introduction of the electoral system for group representation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 provides for defeated candidates in a GRC to qualify for non-constituency seats:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) If the highest percentage of votes among defeated candidates is from a GRC, all the three non-constituency seats will be occupied by the three candidates from the GRC.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) If the second highest or third highest percentage is returned by candidates from a GRC, then the three candidates are to determine which of them should occupy the two or one non-constituency seats (as the case may be). If they fail to agree, the decision will be made by ballot.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If there is a tie between candidates in two GRCs, the decision as to who among them will occupy non-constituency seats will be made by ballot.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, let me reiterate the objectives of this Bill. This Bill seeks to institutionalize the practice of multi-racial politics by requiring all political parties to field multi-racial teams of candidates to contest in Group Representation Constituencies if they aspire to win power. This will at the same time ensure that Parliament will always be multi-racial in composition. It underlines the commitment of the Government to the building of a multi-racial society through representative and democratic government.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Strengthen multi-racial framework of Parliament</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All multi-racial societies contain underlying forces which, if not wisely managed, will tear them apart. Loyalty to one's own community, to race, to one's religion and language is stronger than loyalty to the nation, particularly if that nation is a new one and has many races.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a beautiful, peaceful country, but the same primordial human emotions exist here as elsewhere in other multi-racial societies, like Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Fiji, Cyprus, Northern Ireland. For Singapore to remain a beautiful, peaceful country for many more generations, it is wise of us to strengthen the political framework before it is weakened by disillusionment, despondency and despair when one community finds itself thrown out of Parliament by the electoral system.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Questions to ask yourselves</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions you have to ask yourselves, and answer, when debating this Bill are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Do you believe in taking steps to encourage the practice of moderate, multi-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> racial politics and to discourage the practice of extreme, communal politics in Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If you do, should we not take precautionary steps to ensure that Parliament will always remain multi-racial?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If your anser is "yes" to both questions, can you think of a better alternative than Team MPs in Group Representation Constituencies to achieve these two objectives?
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Better alternative than GRCs?</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRCs stand for multi-racialism. If any of you have a better suggestion to achieve this objective, we are ready to listen. We have always been prepared to hear you out. That is why we discussed the concept of Team MPs publicly for about a year before introducing this Bill in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Issue</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue before us is not GRCs per se. It is whether we should entrench in our Constitution the right for all communities - Chinese, Malay, Indians and Others - to be always represented in Parliament. The GRC is only a means to an end. It is the best means we can think of. It is democratic. You retain the right to elect the government you want. You still have your one vote. You still choose the MPs you want to represent you except, in the case of the GRCs, you elect a group of three MPs. All three MPs in the group will serve you, and not just one of them. Whichever group of MPs you vote in, whether it is the PAP's or the Opposition party's, the result is a multi-racial Parliament; always. Your democratic right remains intact. Singapore's future is safeguarded.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Relationship with Constitution (Amendment) Bill</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provisions of this Bill are closely related to the provisions in the Constitution (Amendment) Bill which is next on the Order Paper. Much of what I say on this Bill will therefore also be relevant to the Constitution (Amendment) Bill. To avoid having a repetitious debate later, I would urge Members who wish to speak on the concept of GRCs and multi-racial Parlia-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ment to make their substantive points in this debate on this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Bill is politically important, I intend to refer the Bill to a Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. [Applause.]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Siglap):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I first heard of the intention to introduce this Bill, my reaction, rather similar to the reaction of many Singaporeans then, was: do we need to resort to this? Have we as a country which has accepted and practised multi-racialism all this while suddenly begin to realize that we can't maintain such an environment? Have we failed as a Government and as a people?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for one who has grown up in a multi-racial setting and living in such a setting now, I see others not in terms of people of different races, of different colour, but as individuals, each with the good and the bad that exist in all human beings. Therefore, the given reasons for the introduction of this Bill appeared to me, then, too far-fetched, too improbable. But then, Sir, it dawned on me that perhaps I have taken our racial harmony for granted. That perhaps my own experience and hopes and my wishes for my country have distracted me from seeing what reality can be. Like in Fiji, Sri Lanka and other countries that we have read of in the papers and mentioned by 1DPM just now, where one's inherent differences, one's beliefs, are causes of conflict, of havoc, of pain. And all these, Sir, have taken place when man's civilization, man's reason and knowledge, have reached a point higher than he has ever been before, when his ability to communicate has gone far beyond having to stand in front of each other and speak a common language. This, Sir, is reality.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore have our realities too. Not only do we have different languages, different dialects, different groups, one of which is the majority, we are also cut vertically by differences in culture, differences in religion and marked again, mind you, Sir, horizontally by differences in economic, political and social
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> achievements. Now, add to these a relatively short history and set against a backdrop of different pulls, different pressures, different influences from outside and without the region, ours, Sir, must surely be one of the most fragile of nations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have attributed our success, even our survival, to many things, ranging from the presence of a good, stable, strong, continuous government to the mere existence of fortuitous events and circumstances. But whichever reason is true, Sir, one thing is certain, and that is, we would not have reached where we are now had it not been for the relative absence of civil strife brought about by our differences and our diversity. This, Sir, we must bear in mind. Always. So then where do we go from here? Do we go on as we have done contented and comfortable in our belief that such troubles will never come to us and that reason, goodwill and good sense will always prevail to ensure that we will always live happily together ever after? Or do we put together safeguards to ensure that the voices of each community, big or small, are heard, dealt with and resolved by constitutional means rather than leave things as they are and hope and pray that any communal discontent will never erupt into fighting in the streets. Or do we wait until such horrors are imminent before we hastily come to this Parliament to pass a Bill such as this one, only to find that we have acted very much too late.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, as mentioned by 1DPM, seeks to institutionalize a multi-racial Parliament in this country regardless of who forms the government, be it the PAP; be it a coalition; be it a non-PAP Government. This point, Sir, I think must be stressed and must be fully understood. The end effect, Sir, will be the presence of minority MPs in Parliament, even though governments may change.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, one may ask: what is wrong with a mono-racial Parliament so long as Members are elected fairly and through the usual democratic process; so long as we have the best men and women in this House, who are sensitive enough to the needs and concerns of the minorities and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> can adequately represent them? Sir, the signals such a Parliament sends to the country's minorities will be a far-reaching one because it is tantamount to telling the Malays, the Indians and Others, that they count for little, that they have no part in governing the country. If Parliament is to be a symbol and a reflection of Singapore's society, then it is only logical that the various communities will have to be in it. But more than this, Sir, such a Parliament ensures that the minority communities also have a stake in running the country and that every community counts, that each community has a contribution to make to the country. Sir, what better way to maintain racial harmony here?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore perfectly clear to me, Sir, that this Bill intends to entrench the concept of a multi-racial Parliament for generations to come. This objective, Sir, I fully support and I see no reason why every well-meaning Singaporean should not support this aim.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sir, let me say a few words about the contention that Minority MPs will, under the Bill, be second-class representatives of the people. Pause for a while, analyse the sentiment that lurks behind this belief? Is this not confirming the argument for this Bill? And why not? If there is no doubt that Minorities can enter Parliament unless they are, to quote some people,"piggy-backed", "coat-tailed", or "carried in the arm-pits of their team mates", then this contention does not arise at all. For those who condescendingly argue that the Bill would make us Minority MPs feel second-class, I can only wish that they take the trouble to be familiar with what we have to face every day. For example, Malay MPs, just like any other MPs, are elected by their constituencies and will have to represent the interests and look after the welfare of their constituents, the majority of whom are on-Malays. And like any other MPs too, they have to take cognisance of the national interest which has to supersede sectional interests. And yet, Sir, the Malay community expects us individually and as a group to provide the leadership, the direction for the community's development. They expect us to represent their interest and bring up their concerns to Government. Because we have to balance
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Malay community's interest with national interest, deal with contending, sometimes even conflicting issues or demands, out jobs become that much more arduous. And for us, it will be pure preceived as a communal MP by the electorate. It would therefor be a grave insult to any Minority MP, be it PAP or non-PAP, and to the community he comes from, that he is merely playing second-fiddle to his term-mates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of this Bill is a political one. As I see it, it seeks to tackle a potential problem that can have wide political implications locally as well as geo-politically. It does not impute any grade or stigma to MPs elected under the Team MP system. Therefore, any allegation of inferiority must either contain some mischievous intent or show a dismal lack of understanding of this Bill altogether. But, Sir, the Bill before us is by no means perfect, despite being an important and unique one. There are issues attached to this piece of legislation which I think Government ought to turn its attention to. For instance, some say that we seem to be in such a hurry to push this Bill through regardless of the viewpoints of the public and seeing that many Singaporeans appear to be still unclear about how the Team MP system will operate or even the concept of the Team MP itself. It has been said that the Bill attempts to overcome the trend towards ethnic voting. We have been told that this is the very premise for the introduction of this Bill, but some people in Singapore still doubt that this trend exists at all. Some say, why don't we continue with our tested ways and in the meantime explore other, perhaps better, measures? Are we afraid of our own shadow that we should panic; that we should rush into something which we may not need but which instead introduces contentious and divisive issues? Will this Bill not accentuate our ethnic differences? Will it not make it difficult for the Opposition to take root in Singapore? Then, Sir, there had been calls for a referendum or for the Bill to be committed to a Select Committee. I am glad that the First Deputy Prime Minister has announced that the Bill will be committed to a Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a responsible Government, we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> must give these views due regard and due consideration and I hope the First Deputy Prime Minister will give this House full and satisfactory answers to all our questions. Certainly, Sir, more public discussion and education is necessary to convince everyone of the need for and the benefits and merits of this important and far-reaching Bill.

  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, actually I was about to make my concluding remarks when we broke off for lunch. All I would like to say, Sir, is that in our debate today we must think of our country's future seriously, not tomorrow, not next week, not next month, but 10-15 years down the road. As I said, Sir, on my part, I would be more than happy to do away with this Bill altogether if I can assured, my children and my children's children can be assured ed that this country will always have a multi-racial Parliament and that our commitment to multi-racialism as a Government and as a people remains intact. If not, then surely my support must be for this Bill unless there is a superior one or a less imperfect one available.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the crucial question which we may wish to debate on today is: Will there be such an alternative to this Bill?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng (Kebun Baru):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the First Deputy Prime Minister asked us when we consider this Bill to ask ourselves the question whether we believe in taking steps to encourage multi-racial politics and to discourage extremist racial politics. I think in considering this Bill and the one to follow we should ask these questions perhaps also in different forms. First, do we believe that Parliament should reflect the multi-racial character of our society? Do we want
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to ensure that all the principal ethnic groups in our society are represented in Parliament? In particular, do we want to see that minority groups always have a voice in Parliament? These are questions we all have to ask ourselves when we examine the intent and the contents of the two Bills before us. These are questions which we have asked the people in the past year's National Agenda discussions. I think what the people have told us is that we want to have multi-racial representation in Parliament and these are also questions that I posed to more than 300 Muslims, mostly Malay Muslims, on 24th January 1987 at a function to celebrate Prophet Mohammad's Birthday.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told our Muslim friends that in our multi-racial, multi-religious society, all groups must be integrated into the mainstream of society. All groups must feel that they are active participants and not mere observers. To me, the highest level of participation is in Parliament. We need to ensure that there will always be minority representation in Parliament. To them, I outlined the concept of electing MPs in teams, say, of three, of which one must be from a minority group. All political parties should be required to compete on the basis of multi-racial slates and let the people choose the team most worthy of their support. Electing MPs in this way will ensure that there will always be minority representation in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the second time that evening that I had outlined the concept of Team MPs to my constituents. An hour earlier I had explained the concept in relation to Town Councils at an RC Senior Citizens' Club inauguration ceremony. The press were present at this Senior Citizen's function but not at the Prophet Mohammed's Birthday function. So the public heard of the Team MPs concept only in relation to Town Councils when the concept was first made public. It was not the negligence of the press. I had not intended my second speech that evening to be publicized. This was because our internal discussions within the People's Action Party had yet to reach a consensus. We were still debating whether Team MPs or GRCs is the best system to ensure minority representation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only about three months earlier that the Minister of State (Home Affairs) and I had discussed in his office the problem of Town Councils with MPs from different political parties. We discussed the multi-seat constituency idea and the Team MPs concept. We agreed that the concept provided a neat solution to keep Town Councils free from political teamsmanship. We both also agreed that more importantly the concept provides a solution to the problem of ensuring minority representation in Parliament, a problem that had been discussed within the PAP for several years. It was because of the overwhelming merit of the concept in respect of enshrining multi-racialism that this idea was further pursued.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the single-seat constituency, first-past-the-post system, bears a high risk of political exclusion of minority groups because of the natural affinity that goes with race and this natural affinity influences voting behaviour. We cannot deny that even in Singapore this is so and the risk rises when, in the passage of time, younger voters who have not experienced the race riots of the 1960s ignore the need to vote in minority candidates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older generations of Singaporeans know that racial feelings are latent, easily aroused, and can be quicky fanned to dangerous emotional levels, if politicans take a wrong turn. And wrong turns have been taken. The evidence abounds. Ethnic problems plague many countries with multi-racial populations-Sri Lanka, Fiji, Guyana, Cyprus, Spain- just to name a few.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countries with longer histories and higher levels of education than ourselves, but they are not free from ethnic problems because in spite of the higher level of education, it is still evident that blacks vote for blacks, and whites for whites a tendency noted even in an advanced country like the United States. Where in countries the race consciousness is lower, we find the main political groups do not use race as a means of obtaining the voters' support. But where racial tensions are high, political parties tend to be racially based.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, we have a multi-racial Parliament because the PAP believes in multi-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> racialism. Since its inception, the PAP has consciously presented to the electorate a balanced mix of candidates at every general election, even from the first time the PAP contested in elections with only four candidates, the PAP presented a multi-racial slate to the people. In earlier years, there were constituencies for fielding minority race candidates. The experience of ract riots drove home the lesson that we must have a racial balance in political representation. Our older voters still remember, and they now constitute a counter-balancing force. In time, however, this counter-weight will be proportionately smaller. So far, this counter-weight, and the strength of PAP minority candidates, has been able to ensure us a multi-racial Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we want to wait until the day when the counterweight is ineffective? Do we want to wait until the day comes when minority groups find themselves excluded from political expression in Parliament before we decide to address the issue? By then, the division may be deep and blood may be spilled once again on account of race. The sheer logic is compelling that we must enshrine in our Constitution and in our electoral laws the sacrosanctity of multi-racialism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we believe in multi-racialism, then we must support the intent of the Bills, otherwise our words will ring hollow. At a time when all is well and calm, we Singaporeans can consider the intent of the legislation before us and I think all thinking Singaporeans will conclude that we should have multi-racial representation in Parliament. That we are born Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian or others is determined by hereditary factors. We cannot help being born the way we are or the colour we wear. So how can we assure that the majority group does not, intentionally or unintentionally, exclude the minority groups from representation in Parliament?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few options: proportional representation, communal-based elections, reserved wards for specific ethnic groups, nominated MPs if an insufficient number of minority MPs are voted in, or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the group representation constituency system. Personally, I have weighed the pros and cons of each.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proportional representation will lead to racially-based political parties, and religious based political parties too. There are examples in other countries, both near and far. What it would mean is the polarization of racial and religious groups and this goes against our intention of building mutual tolerance and respect and down-playing race and religion. Furthermore, proportional representation as a system has been shown to paralyze governments even in developed Europe because of the inability of parties to win a majority in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communal-based elections mean defining and allocating seats in Parliament based on racial groups. It means Chinese will vote for Chinese, Malays vote for Malays, Indians for Indians, and so on. This will forever enshrine racialism in politics. It is against what we want. The reserve ward system means that specific constituencies will have minority MPs only. But I do not think that voters in such constituencies, granted the spread of our electorate at the present moment, will be happy to be restricted in their choice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nominated MP system, if an insufficient number of minority MPs are voted in, would give these minority MPs the status of runners-up MPs, or worse, labelled as second-class MPs. If we are to judge the reaction and the action of people to the non-constituency MPs system, we would conclude that the nominated MP system would be an unsatisfactory system. The runners-up minority candidates may not take their seats inParliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Group Representation Constituency system, or Team MP system, however, will pit one multi-racial team against another multi-racial team. Those who are elected would be endorsed by the electorate, by the people as the team of their choice. So all have contributed to the success of that team; all are duly elected as champions and not runners-up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Team MP system will require serious-minded political parties to include
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> multi-racialism as a principle of their organization. If all political parties are multi-racially based, then the foundation of our society will be strengthened and the fabric of our society will have stronger bonds. We are aiding the process of integration and not polarization.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Team MP system, therefore, offers us the best method of enshrining multi-racialism in our society. It is the best method of ensuring that Parliament will be multi-racial and no minority group will run the risk of political exclusion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, as the First Deputy Prime Minister said, a larger purpose, that is, to make all political parties multi-racial or multi-racially based, to make this a moderating influence on politics in Singapore. Then the question is, that being the wider objective, why do we not extend GRCs to all constituencies rather than limit it to less than 50%? Perhaps the reason may be that there may be over-representation of minority groups in Parliament. Any- way, I think that the multi-seat GRC system would dovetail in very conveniently with the implementation of town councils. We have operated town councils in Ang Mo Kio. I have direct experience. I think it is a good system. I hope that those constituencies that will not be considered as GRCs will get together to form town councils.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those political parties who argue against the Group Representation Constituency system either have leaders who cannot see the risks and dangers of racial division or are unable to accept multi-racialism as a fundamental principle of their organization. Some argue that the system has worked well, why change now? All Singaporeans regard themselves as Singaporeans and not Chinese, Malay, Indian or Eurasian. To those who think that all is well now and will forever be well, I ask them to look at the case of Lebanon. For many years, over a hundred years, Lebanon was a place of harmony, a place of vitality and a thriving tourist resort. After over a hundred years of this experience, Lebanon today is so sharply divided. Before the last war, would we imagine that in Lebanon we have a situation it is today. I think that lesson tells us that whilst all is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> well with us now in Singapore, there is no guarantee, unless we take steps to integrate our population, that this will remain forever so. For those parties that cannot accept multi-racialism, I think we have to ask them the question: are their parties based on race? Do they or do they not, like the rest of us in Singapore, accept multi-racialism as the basis or our society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Bill.
  <br>2.20 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong(Potong Pasir):</b> I am much oblidged to you, Sir. First of all, I am thankful that this this matter which has very far-reaching implications is now placed before a Select Committee. I think the PAP has wisdom after all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I be allowed just to refer to what the First Deputy Prime Minister has said. He says the purpose of this Bill is to ensure a multi-racial Singapore and that there will be practice of multi-racial politices in Singapore. He is going on an assumption. The assumption is that in time to come the Chinse will vote only the Chinese. And because the Chinese are in the majority, the other minority groups will be edged out. And because the fear of such an event happening, as he has said, one morning we get up we find the whole of our Parliament just Chinese faces. Because of that fear, the Government now is introducing law to ensure minority representation. I shall be happy if he can convince me that such an event will happen. Because Singapore's history does not show that we are racial, it does not show in any way that we vote according to racial lines.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have taken the trouble to compile the election results in Singapore since 1955 during the British colonial days when there was only Legislative Assembly elections. You will note that in every one of those elections, all the minority races were well represented. In fact, the Chinese were under-represented. You will find that the Indians all always over-represented. In 1955, 12%; 1957, 12.5%; 1959, 11.76%; and 1963,11.76%. Indians again at 1968, 8.62%. But of course from 1972 onwards, it dropped to about 6%. But in 1980, it jumped to 9%, and then again dropped to 7%. But what about the Malays? The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Malays are also always well represented. In fact, during the Colonial days, they were over-represented. Malays in 1955, 12%; 1957, 9% --
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> How come you say that the Malays are over-represented when you say it was 12%?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No, 9%.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> There was already a drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> All right, there was a slight drop. But in 1959, it was 19%. So it was over-represented there. And since then, the number is around 11%, 12%.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Still under-represented.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> In the last two elections, there was an increase. In 1980, the representation of Malays was 10%, but in 1984 it jumped to 11%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in human affairs, as long as there is adequate and effective representation, that is what we want. We do not want to have a mathematical 100% direct representation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that the Malays have always been adequately represented in Parliament. There is no need for alarm bells to be sounded. There is no drastic drop in Malay representation in Parliament. So why all the alarm now? PAP Ministers, Backbenchers, the lot, are very fond of comparing Singapore to Sri Lanka, Fiji and other palces which, I think, cannot be compared to Singapore. We are a more enlightened people. I think we should compare ourselves with more enlightened countries. It is a continual insult to compare us with people who are worse off than us and who have a system which is inferior to ours.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why do you highlight Cyprus? Lebanon has cited from a prosperous, happy place to a place which it has now engulfed itself in a kind of civil war. Why do we not look at Cyprus? What is the fault of Cyprus? What happened in Cyprus was that there was this movement of enosis, the Greek majority want to join with Greece. And if they had the forsight to call an independent Cyprus and have a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> multi-racial Parliament or an assembly or legislature, they would not have ended with the ultimate result of partitioning their country. [Laughter] Don't laugh. Because you are going the reverse way. We are starting off with multi-racial and you are going into the reverse. You are going into communal representation in Singapore. Now, what happened was they have a communal representation in their Parliament. They said, "All right, we give 70% seats to the Greeks, 30% to the Turks, and we have got 70% for the Armed Forces, for the Civil service." And they go down the line. That is their big mistake. Because if you start on communal basis, you will remain that way. But if you start, like in America, a melting pot, all come together into one nation and start off like that, you see how prosperous America is. So if we want to reverse our process and go along communal lines in our Parliament, this entrenchment of communalism in our Parliament will be more enhanced. You will just get the reverse result. You would not get racial harmony. In fact, you will get racial strife. But I think Singapore is too small for partition. But in any event, the problems that you sow today will wreak very serious consequences from this policy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the comments made on the SDP, I am surprised that the First Deputy Prime Minister has made those remarks. Sir, I think strategically speaking, in every of our elections, the SDP has done very well. We started off in 1980 and we always improve with at every general elections. We have not gone down. So that is a good sign. We did not chicken out at Anson. I have to tell you that. If you think that we chickened out at Anson, you are a very poor strategist. Because if we did chicken out, as you say at Anson, the result would be exactly like in South Korea - none of the Opposition would have come in. Because we on our own accord took a positive step not to split the Opposition votes. As a result, we had an opposition in Parliament. Do you not think that is good strategy?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about SDP fielding four candidates of one race. Because the circumstances dictate. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> PAP had four candidates at the 1955 elections and they had one Malay, I think. It is because in those days the unions were strong. But where are the unions today? I think the hon. Member for Kebun Baru would know that the unions are all properly muzzled. And what representation do you have in Parliament from the Unions? You tell me, where around us is anyone representing any unions here?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Next to you and behind you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I say that it is important that the PAP must prove and show by concrete evidence that their assumption is correct first, their assumption that in future elections the people of Singapore will be voting according to racial lines. They have to prove to us. Unless they can show that, I think this whole GRC system will fall flat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise to oppose the Bill because it will introduce communalism in our statute books. If I had advocated that we have communal representation in our Parliament before 23rd December 1984, I would surely be arrested. We can all recall that it was in the very early hours of 23rd December 1984 after the general elections' results had been announced that the Prime Minister gave his press conference. In that press conference, he questioned the one-man-one-vote system. He was very annoyed because there was a huge swing of 12.3% of votes towards the Opposition. The PAP think tank has been working extra hard from that day on to devise a way to stop the move or enlargement of votes in favour of the Opposition. I believe that this Bill is the PAP's answer to the prevention of a further move towards the Opposition. That is the real reason for this piece of legislation. The PAP thinks that with the concept of the Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs), they will not only ensure electoral victory at the next general elections but also hopefully to edge out the sole Opposition in Parliament and regain a 100% PAP representation in Parliament. The ultimate purpose is to achieve such an overwhelming majority so as to dispense with the necessity to hold a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> referendum to amend the Constitution with a view to provide an elected Presidency with executive powers. That is the real reason of all this law that is being introduced here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am opposing this Bill certainly not because I think that the Opposition will be disadvantaged. Far from it. With the present mood of the people's support for the opposition, this GRC system may even favour the Opposition. Perhaps this is the reason that prompted the PAP to refer this piece of legislation to a Select Committee. Instead of getting one Opposition Member voted into Parliament, we may get three Opposition members returned to Parliament in one constituency.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Why oppose the Bill?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I oppose this Bill because I believe it is going to be bad for our efforts in nation building and it is going to be a threat to our racial harmony. The Government has given a very flimsy reason, namely, to ensure Malay and other minority representation in Parliament. This must first assume that for the next and other coming general elections the voting trend in relation to Malay and other minority community candidates of the past 32 years since 1955 will suddenly change. This cannot be because there is no evidence to show that Singaporeans will become racialists overnight and will vote only a candidate belonging to his own race.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1959 general elections, when the PAP first took office, the Malays were over-represented in Parliament. And in subsequent general elections, up to the last one in 1984, they have always been adequately represented in Parliament. Their representation for the period 1963 to 1984 was about 80% of their quota. Effective representation need not be 100% mathematically matching between the percentage of the number of minority MPs and the percentage in population. In the case of the Malays, no alarm bells need be sounded. It is not a case where Malay representation in Parliament has suddenly dropped drastically. There is no such sign that Malay representation in Parliament has this trend. In fact, Malay representation in Parliament has increased from 10.81% in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 1980 to 11.39% in 1984. There is no proof at all that the Malay representation in Parliament has dropped to such low levels that we need to amend the Constitution and other laws to introduce communal representation in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must also be noted that if there was a drop in Malay representation after the 1968 general elections, it was not due to electoral defeats but it was due entirely to the selection policy of the ruling party. A former Minister of State, Haji Yaacob Mohamed, has pointed out that no PAP Malay candidates standing in a non-Malay constituency was ever defeated in general elections since 1959. Haji Yaacob also pointed out that in the general elections of 1984 both PAP Malay and non-Malay candidates suffered a decline in votes. So it is not just the Malays alone. Haji Yaacob does not believe that Singaporeans were voting along racial lines. There you are. There is already a difference within your own ranks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect to forge Singaporeans into one nation and become one people is real. At one time, Chinese parents were sending their children to Chinese language medium schools rather than to the English language medium schools. By 1954, the pattern of enrolment was reversed and far more children were sent to English medium schools than to Chinese medium schools. Now, in Singapore, we practically have only one common type of school with the bilingual policy as its cornerstone.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Ministry of Education's statistics, it can be noted that in 1986 out of a total of 268,820 pupils in primary schools, 266,396 of them, comprising 99.09%, were enrolled in English language medium schools. And the balance of 2,424, about 0.9%, were enrolled in Chinese language medium schools. There were no Malay or Tamil language medium schools. It is inevitable that even the 0.9% of those studying in Chinese language medium schools will be absorbed into the English language medium schools. As time goes on, the racial differences will be less marked, as all school children will be attending a common type of school undergoing the same experiences, speaking the same language. If this educational policy is not changed, then Singapore shall become
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a melting pot of all races, and I for one am all for it. This is the only way to forge a cohesive and united nation. Mixed marriages in time will increase. Even today in this House, we can note that a few hon. Members by entering into mixed marriages have already paved the way for Singaporeans to be one people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumption that in future Singaporeans will vote according to their race is ridiculous. This is particularly so when Singapore in the 1980s has already gone through over two decades of nation building and the Singapore identity is already established. The last two National Day celebrations clearly demonstrated that the majority of Singaporeans, especially young Singaporeans, recognize that we are all Singaporeans. We are one nation, one people, and we are not Malay Singaporeans, Chinese Singaporeans, Indian Singaporeans or Eurasian Singaporeans. Anyone who says that Singaporeans today and in future will vote according to racial lines is actually insulting Singaporeans because we do not think so. Singaporeans, in fact, in the past and up till today have never voted any candidate in any Legislative Council in the time of the British or parliamentary elections when we became independent by the colour of the skin of the candidate but by his ability, good name and character and the credibility of his party.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can recall that Singaporeans voted Mr David Marshall who was of Jewish stock to be the first Chief Minister of Singapore. He was the best man and the Chinese in Singapore voted him at that time. And also Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam who is of Sri Lankan descent at Anson in 1981, after 15 years of PAP one-party rule. If anyone put forward the theory that Mr Jeyaretnam won in Anson in 1981 was due to Indian support from Blair Plain, that theory can easily be proven wrong. Because in 1984 when all the PSA flats at Blair Plain were demolished, Mr Jeyaretnam was returned with an even greater majority. All the Indian voters at Blair Plains by that time had already moved away. Yet he polled a greater majority of votes. This proved that the Chinese voters were the ones who cast their votes in favour of Mr Jeyaretnam. So that is proof
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> enough for you that even the Chinese preferred a non-Chinese in preference to a candidate who was a Chinese. So it can be seen that Singaporeans never voted a candidate purely because of his race.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill requires a Malay or other minority candidate who intends to stand for elections in a GRC to appear before a special committee. In the case of a Malay, he needs to appear before a Malay committee to prove that he is a Malay and a certificate to the effect that he is a Malay will be issued to him. In the case of a non-Malay minority candidate in a GRC, he is required to obtain a certificate from a non-Malay committee certifying that he is from a minority community other than the Malay community. This would mean that at every general elections the issue of race will be brought up again and again at every parliamentary elections. This will make the people of Singapore more race conscious. For this reason, I say that this Bill when it becomes law will be racial in nature. For the first time in our history, certain citizens will have to prove that he is of a certain race before he is allowed to contest in a parliamentary elections.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I oppose this Bill because it will introduce communalism and racialism in our electoral system. The Member for Kebun Baru has said that last January he saw 200 over Malays-
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> 300.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> 300 over Malays just supported the GRC. But my feedback is just to the contrary. The major Malay parties have, in fact, urged me to ask this House to put it before a Select Committee because they say that the Malay community generally are against this Bill and not for this Bill. Malay will feel insulted to be made a second-class Member of Parliament. Yes, they will have to be a passenger to two other Chinese candidates to get into Parliament. Of course, hon. Members who are from the Malay community here will have to reject his Bill on this score, just as the Opposition MPs have rejected the Non-Constituency Members of Parliament. Why? Because they have honour, they have pride and dignity in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> themselves, they do not want to come into Parliament by the back door. They want to walk in proudly through the front door. So in future, all of you, hon. Members from the Malay community, when you sit here, you are not walking into Parliament by your own steam. You are walking into Parliament by the grace of two other candidates. Do you have that honour? Do you have that pride to reject the GRCs? I hope Malay MPs here will speak up on this very point. I think we know from the Malay culture, they are a very proud people. When you hurt their honour, they will go to the full extent to deal with you.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> They will deal with you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am not hurting their honour. I am against this Bill. It is said that the Government is unwilling to hold a National Referendum to determine whether or not the majority of the people of Singapore want minority representation in Parliament under the proposed law. It is not true to say that since the majority of Singaporeans are Chinese, therefore, they do not want minority representation in Parliament. This law will affect all Singaporeans, both the Minority as well as the majority communities in Singapore. Therefore, it is only fair that the majority have a say also in it, since this will have such far-reaching effects on Singaporeans. The Government says that they shall probably have 10 - 13, GRCs. If that is the case, the number of Malays and other minority representation in Parliament will even be less than today. On the other hand, the Government says, "Well, the minority can stand in the single MP constituency." If that is the case, then their assumption is wrong. Because on the one hand, you say that they have got no chance of getting elected when they stand in single seat Members of Parliament. Therefore, we musthave GRCs to ensure that we get representation. Then in the same breath, you say they can also stand in the single Member constituency. This is a contradiction. So your assumption on the one hand says that Malays cannot get into Parliament by their own effort and on the other hand you say they can get elected if they stand in single Member constituencies. This is a contradiction which you have to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> answer. So if the PAP does not believe that in future voters will be voting along racial lines, if Singaporean Chinese are not going to vote for the Chinese, then they should not have this Bill or options. I think this is a contradiction which, in the present state of the law, cannot be resolved at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the other contradiction we can see is with regard to the Independent candidates. In fact, the First Deputy Prime Minister has said that by virtue of the fact that they are independent, they do not want to be affiliated to any party, they do not want o be disciplined or to have the values or policies of that single party. If three Independents do get elected and they want to manage a town council, what then? Assuming that the three Independents, one is an ultra-conservative, one is an ultra-leftist and one takes the centre line, you will have a carriage pulled by three horses in three directions. So how are they going to manage the town council? You have to resolve this problem of independents. Again, as regards by-elections. You say that unless the whole lot of them, three of them, resigned or something happened to them, then they can have a by-election. What happens if two of them through some events are kicked out of the GRC and only leaving one of them? The poor fellow, the single MP, will have to carry the burden of three MPs. This is another problem area. You say that this system does not hurt the one-man one-vote system. I say it does, because the one-man one-vote system implies that one vote you elect for one person. Even in the proportional representation, one vote you can have multiple choices. You are putting the first choice for one man, second choice for another. But in this case one vote is voting for three. In other words, the value of that one vote is only one-third. So it is not a whole one vote. In fact, somebody has said that PAP has offered a cheap sale. With one vote you can vote in three candidates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there will be polarization of the races because in the implementing of the GRCs, say, you have got a Malay MP there and every one of the Malays born to speak Malay and they all gravitate to the Malay MP, and all the Chinese ones will gravitate to the Chinese. So you have this polariza-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tion in the working of the GRCs. So again it is bad. Now, a more important one. I suppose we will be debating the Amendment to the Constitution. We note that you have an amendment there to keep out Article 12 and Article 78 in regard to equality before the law, and if there is a provision in this Amendment that is inconsistent with Article 78, then it will not be invalidated. So this is an admission of the fact of the Government that the law that we are going to pass is not equal before the law. How can it be?

  <!-- Encik Ibrahim Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Ibrahim Othman (Tanah Merah)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Parliamentary Elections(Amendment) Bill moved by the First Deputy Prime Minister. The Bill would ensure a multi-racial Parliament as it provides for candidates from the minority communicates to be fielded in a group of three in constituencies proclaimed as GRCs or Group Representation Constituencies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this Bill the people of Singapore are being reminded of the Government's multi-racial policy. The PAP, which has been in power since 1959, has been fielding candidates from all the communities in every election held since then. The multi-racial policy has received the support of voters and in every Parliament so far we can find Members of Parliament from the Chinese, Malay, Indian and also the Eurasian communities. But would it continue to be so in future? We cannot guarantee that such a multi-racial composition of the Parliament will remain in future. But with this Bill we would be able to ensure that Parliament in future will have Members from all the races in Singapore. Whichever political party that governs Singapore will have Members of Parliament from the minority communities. Indirectly, extreme communal politics would be avoided by all political parties contesting in future general elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is unique in that it creates a "compulsion" on the minority communities to participate in governing the country and in determining its future directions. This "compulsion", I think, will create a good atmosphere in the country's political arena. Members of Parliament from the minority communities would be able to express their views and comments on matters relating to their communities. Indirectly the Government or the governing party would act with more care and sensitivity in matters relating to the minority communities. This, I feel, would bring about a situation of more stability, tolerance and harmony in our multi-racial community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay community is the largest minority community in Singapore. Up to June 1987 the Malay people numbers 393,800 or 15% of the total population of Singapore. Since the Bill was first tabled in Parliament, many issues have been raised on the definition of a "Malay". Who actually is a "Malay"? Who is the person qualified to stand as a candidate representing the Malay community? And who should be appointed as Members of the proposed Malay Committee? These are among the questions raised. Although we know who a Malay is, if we study the definition in more detail, we will find a number of different descriptions. Although our Constitution provides for the special position of the Malays as the indigenous people of Singapore, the definition of "Malay" is not given. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Education has laid down certain criteria to determine pupils who are to be included in the category of the "Malay" to qualify for free education. Among these are (a) Malay pupils who fulfil the specified requirements of birth and citizenship; (b) Pupils of Indonesian origin, like the Boyanese, the Banjarese, Javanese, Sumatrans, Bugis, people of Minangkabau, Achinese and other communities of other areas in Indonesia, who fulfil the following conditions: that he is born in Singapore, that his father is a Singapore citizen and that both the pupil and the father are Muslims.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bill was first introduced, there were attempts to define the people who
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> should fall under the category of Malay. But the definitions given received a lot of protest from individuals. Amont the questions raised was: why is the element of Islam not included as an important criterion in determining candidates to represent the Malay community? There were also non-Malay Muslims who expressed dissatisfaction that they were being categorized as Malays. In any case, I think an explanation of who a Malay is must be provided to define, firstly, who should be elected as members of the Malay Committee, and secondly, who may be fielded as candidates for election to represent the Malay community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose a number of criteria for the Government to consider:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) they must be a Malay or a person of Indonesian origin as provided under the Ministry of Education criteria in determining Malay pupils and they should, of course, be Singapore citizens;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) they must speak Malay, practise Malay customs and be of the Islamic faith;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) They must consider themselves as Malays and be accepted as Malays by the Malay community in order to represent them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for members of the Malay Committee, in addition, they must be people who have done service to the Malay community and to Islam. The element of Islam is an important factor in determining the identity of a Malay. According to the 1980 Population Census, almost 99% of Malays are of the Islamic faith. Islam, as we know, has enhanced the Malay value system and non-Malays who are converted to Islam are described as "become Malays". This shows that Malay and Islam have blended together. Although our country is a democratic and secular country, I could understand the reasons why the element of Islam is not included in the definition of a Malay. However, in the context of our country where almost all the Malays are Muslims, I think it is only proper that Islam be included as an important criterion in determining whether someone should be accepted as a representative of the Malay community in Singapore. The Malays have made Islam
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> an important part of their identity. Although there are some who are less than devout, ie, failure to observe the precepts of the religion, such as praying, fasting and giving zakat and so on, they still affirm themselves as Muslims and will not take the prohibited items of food. In the same way, if they accidentally touch things deemed foul in Islam, they will have to cleanse themselves in the way prescribed by the religion. The idea of defining a Malay as a Muslim is also well-known to all the other communities in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, in determining whether someone is qualified as a representative of the Malay community in Singapore, in addition to the definition given to the Malay origin, three important criteria should be considered, ie, his own affirmation as a Malay, his acceptance by the Malay community and the element of Islam, that is, he must be a Muslim.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the fact that this is a very important issue, I would support that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. It would enable the people of Singapore of all communities to contribute their views to refine the Bill further. With that, I support this Bill, Mr Deputy Speaker.

  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das(Chong boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to participate in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sitting down and listening to the Member for Potong Pasir, I expected a very fiery speech opposing this Bill. What we actually heard from him was really a rehash of an article that appeared in the "Hammer". I was equally disappointed that he did not even rebut some of the points which the First Deputy Prime Minister made regarding his own party. Nevertheless, this debate did not begin today. In fact, this has been going on for quite some time and many of the issues have been voiced out both publicly and privately.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in debating this Bill, it is important to ask two basic questions. Firstly, is a multi-racial Parliament good for Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Of course.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Secondly, if it is yes, how do we go about doing it?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Scrap GRC.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> That is your view. Sir, given the population structure and the geopolitics of the region we are in, the answer to the first question, including my friend, Mr Chiam See Tong, is a big 'Yes'. We then come to the next question as to how we go about achieving this. Here I am prepared to accept the Government's position that our present system of elections cannot guarantee multi-racial Parliament in the longer term. Like many Singaporeans, I also agree that it will not be a problem in the next one or two general elections. But, Sir, who will guarantee that things will be the same in 15 years' time?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has two options. Firstly, to do nothing and pretend that there is no problem and wait till the problem explodes in our face - as it happened in Fiji recently. Everyone knows the outcome. Secondly, it can recognize the problem and find suitable solutions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am satisfied that the Government has examined the various options available - proportional representation, reserved seats, creating an Upper House, and introducing this GRC concept. The GRC, I believe, is the best option for Singapore. The only snag is that it is unique and has not been implemented elsewhere. Surely, this is not the reason for its rejection. In fact, I am reminded of the time when this Government introduced the Central Business District concept to control the flow of vehicles into our business district by imposing a levy. It was unique. No one else had tried it before. There was a lot of hue and cry and even a magistrate in our courts ruled that it was ultra vires the Constitution. But subsequently his decision was over-ruled in an appeal. Today, Sir, the CBD is working well and many countries envy this system of ours. Only recently, I read in the Straits Times that London is looking at the Singapore system as a model for implementation. I am making this point to illustrate that if something is new and unique, it is no reason to reject it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, some of the learned pundits opposing GRC have not offered alternatives. They say it is wrong. But what are the alternatives? The Member for Potong Pasir seems utterly confused. One day he says that it is not to the advantage of the Opposition. On a GRC basis, he feels he will lose his seat.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I never said that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> The next day he seems to welcome it and says that it will give him an opportunity to defeat the Second Deputy Prime Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have to interrupt here, Mr Deputy Speaker. When did I say that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Refer to your TV interview on Team MPs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Please. I said that the PAP think that we will lose.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> You refer to your interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No, don't misquote me.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> No, I am not quoting you. You can check the tape.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You are quoting me.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> I think he should make up his mind whether GRC is good for Singapore or not. Whether he wins his seat or not is not the issue, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. The issue is whether he believes in a multi-racial Parliament in Singapore. The PAP believes in a multi-racial Parliament and has always fielded a multi-racial slate in all these elections since the inception of the Party.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also believe that the timing of this legislation is appropriate. It is better to introduce changes now when there is no problem than to wait for it to arise and then to come to this House to seek solutions. In fact, this Bill aims to ensure that the minority interests must be protected and places reserved for them in Parliament. This in itself is quite unique
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> because, for the first time, the majority are guaranteeing the rights of the minority which, in actual fact, they do not have to do it. Every reasonable person must applaud this move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has mentioned about referendum. He tried mass signature campaigns. Referendum to do what, Sir? Ask the majority, or ask the minority? One would like to know what has happened to his signature campaign. Nothing has been mentioned about it lately.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> We are going on.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have discussed this GRC concept with my constituents, community leaders and some of the Indian community leaders. All of them are in agreement that we have to ensure that our Parliament remains multi-racial at all times. Some even felt that the introduction of GRC is to take a step backward in order to stand still, otherwise we will fall flat on our faces.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have discussed this matter in some detail with the Tamils Representative Council which represents 18 affiliated Tamil organizations. At the end of the discussion on 8th January, 1988, the Council issued the following statement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After seeking clarifications, the Singapore Tamils Representative Council endorsed the view that multi-racial representation in Parliament is essential for preserving inter-racial harmony and that the proposal would enshine in the Constitutency minority representation in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council further emphasised that in line with the recognition of Tamil as an official language, Tamils shuld be specifically mentioned as a minority group."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, GRC and Team MPs is a new political formula not introduced in any other country. I am satisfied that the Government has done an exhaustive comparative study of the various systems of the various countries practising a mix of both Westminster style and continental European democracies. On balance, I am prepared to accept the findings of the Government. But I would like to add a word of caution by asking a question. Where do we stop, or is this the beginning of a potentially dangerous practice of multi-racial representation
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in every facet of our daily life? Let this not lead to clamour or calls for allocation of jobs, scholarships and public office on ethnic grounds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Team MP and the GRC concept is not designed to entrench the PAP as a ruling party forever. The Member for Potong Pasir strongly believes that this concept was thought out after the last general elections. In fact, he said "23rd December 1984". The First Deputy Prime Minister has taken great pains to explain in this House his correspondence with the Prime Minister, his correspondence with the Minister for the Environment, Dr Ahmad Mattar, and these dates do not show "1984" at all. They were well before 1984.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Sir, it is the Government's long-term strategic approach to an imminent problem. In short, the GRC and Team MPs is an additional ballast to the political and social stability in an increasingly turbulent geopolitical environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the decision to refer this Bill to a Select Committee so that whatever reservations and queries some may have, there is still an opportunity for them to air their views.

   <b>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Kaki Bukit)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill. Sir, the First Deputy Prime Minister stated that the real objective of this Bill is to ensure Malay participation and the participation of other minority communities in Parliament. It is aimed at enshrining multi-racial politics in Singapore. This is important condition for political stability in multi-racial Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Team MP concept is not new. It is a system that has been practised in democratic countries. The system has been discussed in Singapore for the past one year. For the last 12 months, this subject has been widely discussed. In changing the parliamentary election system, Singapore will be moving away from the British Westminster system. However, it will not be deviating from the fundamentals of democracy - government by the people through the one-man-one-vote system. We must remember that we cannot run away from what is happening in our neighbouring countries. Unless the multi-racial society that is the foundation of political stability in Singapore is secured, the country might face problems. For the last 28 years Singapore has undergone many tests that have given us anxious moments. Now we have succeeded. We have succeeded because of the far-sighted vision and the ability of our Government to guide our society along the right path.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore is highly regarded by other countries. Today, we live in a multi-racial and a multi-cultural society. Today, we recognize ourselves as Singaporeans. As Chinese Singaporeans, some of us can speak Malay. As Malay Singaporeans, some of us can speak Hokkien, Mandarin, or other Chinese dialects. There is no doubt that today we are a cohesive multi-racial society. In view of this you might ask, "Why do we want to introduce GRCs in Parliament?" Our future is full of uncertainties. The system to be introduced is meant to protect our multi-racial infra-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> structure. It is a guarantee that would help us face an uncertain future that could destroy our infrastructure. Introducing GRCs in Parliament now is timely because we have political stability. To wait until problems crop up or until our multi-racial infrastructure is destroyed, I think, it would be too late. Our Government is far-sighted in dealing with national problems and it has been introducing policies to ensure peace, harmony and political stability in a multi-racial society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with the Member for Potong Pasir who said that a Member of Parliament elected from a minority race will find himself being belittled in the Team MPs System. The question of weak Members of Parliament does not arise unless political parties field weak candidates. On the other hand, this system requires them to ensure that qualified candidates from minority communities are fielded in the elections if they want to win. If the Opposition parties wish to participate in the elections, they should field capable candidates from the minority groups, just as the PAP has done. PAP Malay MPs or MPs from other minority communities have shown their abilities, just like PAP Chinese MPs. I appeal to good and capable leaders from the minority groups to come forward to participate in the elections and serve our nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we should understand our situation and learn from the mistakes of other countries. Our Government plans to strengthen the multi-racial political system in Singapore as a precautionary measure. The GRC is a good system and serves our future interests.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will speak on certain problems of racialism as reflected in this Bill. Let me recount some stories relating to the challenge of racialism which we are often confronted with. From these stories, we know that the measures taken by the Government to prevent racial problems well in advance is very appropriate and important.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some two decades ago, I had the occasion to meet a Malay friend from Johor Baru who came to my office. I was acquainted with him when I took part in the 1964 general election in Malaysia. We talked about many things. Finally, he told me that his Malay colleagues had accused him of being a traitor to the Malay race, for selling out Malay rights and interests. So he was very embarrassed. But he still stoutly supported the PAP's multi-racial policies and principles of nation building. Yet he was faced with pressures of Malay racialism all round. Finally, when he and his family could not live in peace any longer, he withdrew from PAP. After that, Singapore was separated from Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this episode, I was reminded of my own position when I was once accused of being a traitor to my race, for selling out the interests of my race. At a general election in the 1970s, I in particular and the PAP were accused by an Opposition candidate at a mass rally in Henderson for selling out Chinese culture as I was from the Chinese education stream and yet joined the PAP which espoused the policy of selling out Chinese culture and that, as a PAP candidate, I was therefore a traitor to Chinese culture. But I was not ashamed by this accusation. I was still very proudly living the way I have been and stoutly supporting the PAP policies and principles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered when I was a Nanyang University student, one night I visited a teacher who was the Dean of Arts Faculty and an advisor to the Chinese Teachers' Association of Malaya, Dr Yen Yuen Chan. We talked at length about the future prospects of Chinese education and culture. This teacher whom I most respected gave me a very good impression. He was serious and careful in his choice of words. When I left his house at midnight, I had a very clear mind that if you want to seek basic rights of the Chinese through such a racial political party as the Malayan Chinese Association, then it would cause the Malays also to seek special Malay rights through UMNO. This would lead to perpetual racial disputes and political instability in Malaya (there was no Malaysia yet). In such circumstances, as a Chinese, what should I do? I remembered my teacher's words, "If you have read all
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the books and teachings of the sages, what do you learn? All those who have the will and ambition should try to seek a practical way out to enable the Chinese also to share on this common land he basic rights and interests of a multi-racial country." So this talk enabled me to separate from a very close friend and colleague in the 1964 general election. He stood under the banner of MCA and was elected. Later, he became a leader of MCA in Johor. So we went different ways.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my failure in the election had redoubled my conviction in multi-racial line of nation building, particularly in view of the racial turmoils which I went through in 1964, and the May 13 communal incident. I was perturbed and it abhorred me to see the savage behaviour of extreme racialists towards whom they considered to be enemies. I hate this kind of behaviour. I remembered one day just before the Japanese surrender in the Second World War, my mother and I together with all the villagers were brought to the countryside. All of us gathered round and squatted on the grass. What did we do there? We were watching the Japanese soldiers cutting heads off with their sword. I was too young then to understand what was going on. After the Japanese surrendered, the village elders disclosed that the Japanese had asked all the Chinese to turn up to see how their soldiers kill people. The Japanese had a very intense feeling for communalism. In fact, as we all may know, everywhere in the world there is such a thing as the fire of racialism. As some people may know, on 20 October 1943, some 14 missionary Bishops of the Church of the Province of South Africa issued a joint declaration saying that the Bible espouses universal love and against racial prejudices. Therefore, the 14 Bishops jointly condemned the apartheid racial policies of the South African Government. What kind of country South Africa is today after these 40 odd years we all can see. In this world, at the present moment, there is still the ubiquitous existence of the superiority complex of the universal white supremacy. There was one Miss Lillian E. Smith, an American black, in 1944 who wrote a book called "Strange Fruit" which was all about the whites and the blacks. Later many
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> whites destroyed the books or prohibited the book from being on sale. Why? It was because of racial prejudice. I will give another example for all of us to think about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the 20th century, there was a Sir Wilfrid Laurier who was the first French Canadian to become a Canadian Premier. He fervently called upon the French Canadians to be loyal to Canada not to France. He also said that in the coming 20th century there would be a bright and prosperous era for the Canadians, not the French. However, half a century later when General De Gaulle became a French President, he not only wanted the French to be strong and to support Franch, very good, but he also wanted the Canadian French to be stout and strong and to be be firm. This was in the 1960s. He said this at the time when some parts of Canada were having some intense racial partition campaign on in the country. Until 1974 the Canadian Federalgovernment had to concede to even allow French to be an official language in the province of Quebec where the French were in the majority.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about language, we all know it is a very sensitive issue. In Malaysia recently, there was an atmosphere of racial tension. We all know that it was closely related to language. I can recount a story. In the 1963 general elections, one night at the height of campaign Mr Ho See Beng who took part in the elections in Bras Basah Constituency who had left, this Chamber few years ago, happily coming to our PAP Waterloo Street office. He was very happy. He took out a piece of document full of signatures to show us. I have also saw this document. He said with full confidence that he had got very popular support and was absolutely sure of becoming an elected PAP Member two days later. He said a very important reason was because the Opposition candidate was a Hainanese who professed at a rally that he could not speak Hainanese, he could only speak in Hokkien. That had caused the voters in that constituency, the majority whom were Hainanese to sign jointly to support him, a PAP candidate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ostensibly, in the United Nations Declaration, all men are born equal.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> However, we are living in a practical world, a world of cold reality where we strive for survival and preservation, not a halcyon world of fancy and idealism with blissful living. In the human history of several thousand years of civilization, there are several countries which have a few thousand years of experience. We do not have to talk about Sri Lanka, Fiji and such small countries with only a few decades of history. We can look at those countries which have a few thousand years of history like China which is growing stronger day by day and India, countries with a long history of culture. Today, even in China which has 5,000 years history, there is still the Tibetan revolt or opposition. Why? It is because of racial question. In India, there is the Sikh rebellion and opposition also. This is also a question of racialism. So it is high time that we should discard any fanciful thinking or self-delusion and take up and meet the challenge of communalism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we already have this sytem of non-constituency MP besides the elected MP. The GRC system will add a new dimension to the picture. This new system will ensure that every political party which wants to be the government will have to ensure that they are going along multi-racial line, reflecting the characteristics in our multi-racial Parliament. What is wrong? So if the Member for Potong Pasir wants to be the government, if he is going along with multi-racialism in Parliament, I will also welcome him, if he is able to. So this is a measure by the Parliament to chart the course which will ensure future peace and prosperity for Singapore. As for personal interest, whether this constituency or that constituency, or whether one wins or loses, it is of individual and minor interest which is a small matter and does not matter. What is important is to enable the Parliament to look after the interest of the whole country and we all should support the measure whole heartedly. Don't you think so? Thank you.

  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill because the main purpose of the Bill is to ensure the representation in Parliament of Members from the Malay and other minority communities. Multi-racialism, as the First Deputy Prime Minister has said this morning, must remain a cornerstone in our Constitution. And this Bill will ensure multi-racial representation in Parliament. One may disagree on certain clauses in the Bill. But I am confident that few Singaporeans will disagree that multi-racialism is essential to the survival of Singapore as a nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Constitution is adopted from the Westminster system. The Westminster model is not especially geared to the protection of the minorities. The concentration of power that it allows in the hands of the parliamentary majority may work against minority interests. Thus there is a need for the constitution of multi-racial societies to tackle this problem in different ways. Some examples of this have been cited and can be seen in the constitutions of New Zealand, Cyprus, Mauritius and Fiji.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our concept of GRCs, in each of a team of three, there will be one MP representing the Malay or minority community. The Singapore Democratic Party in its publication says that this will "enshrine racialism in our Constitution". Is this really true?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Of course.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> I disagree with this. Let us just for a moment compare other models with the Bill presently before us, before we make sweeping and emotive judgments such as this. No country enjoys racial strife.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Prove your case.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Each of those that I will cite have tried different methods. Some are more successful than others. Let me categorically state that my reason for making these comparisons with other nations is not to criticize their system, for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> each of them have their own historical reasons and special problems to deal with, just as we have ours. Yes, I will prove my case.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first example is that of Cyprus which the Member for Potong Pasir himself has cited.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It ended up with partition.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> The total number of elected representatives is 50.35 or 70% shall be elected by the Greek community and 15 or 30% elected by the Turkish community. Thus each community elects its own representatives. Which system is better? Ours or theirs?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The effect is the same - communalism.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Example two is New Zealand. The electoral Act here provides for four Maori representatiaves, one each for four Maori electoral districts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example three is Fiji. Sir, I must emphasize that this is the constitution before the military coup. This constitution is a rather complex one. May I have your permission to have the Clerk distribute a summary (Cols. 271 - 272) of this constitution?
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Much obliged, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this system, there are 52 elected representatives in the House of Representatives. They are elected on the basis of two main electoral rolls. Firstly, a communal roll and, secondly, a national roll. From the communal roll will come 27 representatives to the House. The communal roll has again three sub-rolls, a roll for voters who are Fijians, a roll for voters who are Indians and a roll for voters who neither Fijians nor Indians. Then there is a national roll from which will come 25 representatives. This is an additional roll. All voters who are registered on the communal roll are also registered on the national roll.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Allocation of seats in the House</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the communal roll, the Fijians will have 12 seats, Indians 12, Others 3. Under the national roll, Fijians 10, Indians 10, Others 5.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does all this mean during an election? What it means is, firstly, that there are four electoral rolls or registers, three on communal or racial lines, plus one national roll. Secondly, that voting will be on communal lines. How will this work out? Let us take an example. For example, 22 members of the House of Representatives shall be elected from among members who are registered on the roll of voters who are Fijians, ie, the Fijian communal roll. And of those members, 12 shall be elected by voters only on the Fijian communal roll, 10 shall be elected by voters registered on the national roll.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we compare our proposed system of GRCs to any of these, it is my opinion that we have a far better system, the one that is most importantly best suited to our local context. Why is our system better? Firstly, minority representation will be ensured in the House. Secondly, the one-man-one-vote system remains. Thirdly, on the ground, to hold the ground and serve the people, a team of MPs of various races will have to work closely together.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Polarization.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> This will lead to better rapport and understanding. Unless the Team MPs who are expected to provide leadership and direction on the ground can work together, they will undoubtedly lose the next time around. Fourthly, as has been mentioned by the First Deputy Prime Minister, any party that refuses to contest in a GRC will obviously be one that cannot field a multi-racial team regardless of whatever execuse they may want to give.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would next like to raise several questions as to how a GRC will be administered, as this is not mentioned in the Bill. These are issues that are being asked by our grassroots organizations. Firstly, will every GRC also be a town council?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Secondly, will the component constituencies of the GRCs maintain their present names? Thirdly, will the GRCs be carved out into three separate areas, one MP being responsible for each area? Fourthly, how will responsibility be shared among the MPs? Fifthly, has the Government considered the problem that may arise and probably will arise that the residents will surely want to see the MP with the highest stature in the team, namely, a Minister, if he has a problem? Will grassroots organizations in the GRCs continue to exist in their present form or are changes to be expected?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, Sir, I would like to make reference to only one clause of the Bill for clarification, clause 6 (new section 27A (5). In this subsection the minimum time for application to the appropriate committee is stated as two clear days before nomination day. My fear here, Sir, is that as an election strategy most parties may submit their application at the latest possible time. Will there be sufficient time for the committee to scrutinize these applications as the committee will have to issue a certificate to the candidate not later than the day before nomination day? Thus the committee must make their decisions in actuality within a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline K. Wong (Changkat):</b> Sir, I think it is important for us, before we go into the details of the various clauses of the Bill, to sort out the more fundamental question of why this Bill is necessary as well as to answer some of the points, in my view rather serious points, made by the Member for Potong Pasir. Unless these questions are settled in our minds, I think the public may be confused over details.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put my position across from the beginning. I support this Bill and my position is simply this, that the multi-ethnic mix of our population is a fact of life. By institutionalizing multi-racial representation we are no more than giving a recognition to the differences that exist among our different ethnic groups, not only in terms of language, religion, cultural values, but also in terms of the different levels of achievement. To me it is also a rational step, not just logical but
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> also rational, because it is far better to discuss these differences and how Government policies affect the different ethnic groups in an open, rational manner than to pretend that such differences do not exist. And what better ways to hear these differences out than to let representatives from the different ethnic groups speak from the perspective of their own communities. So I support this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address the two points which have been repeatedly harped upon by the Member of Potong Pasir and which, in my mind, are serious and must be answered. First, he said that by institutionalizing multi-racial representation we are heightening the racial consciousness of Singaporeans and therefore we may be doing away with, completely demolishing, the 22 years of nation building efforts that we have made. I do not dispute that building a Singaporean identity is very important. We should continue every effort to help Singaporeans feel Singaporean first and foremost. But 22 years of nation building have not obliteratedour cultural differences.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member of Potong Pasir mentioned something about mixed marriages as a good method or an indicator of improving ethnic relations. I would like to remind the House that for the last 20-25 years, the rate of ethnic inter-marriage or inter-racial marriage in Singapore has not increased. In fact, it just remained within 6%. There has been no trend of increase whatever. Now, of this 6%, half,or 50%, actually come in terms of inter-ethnic marriages among Muslims only. These differences have not been obliterated. I want to make the point that neither do we want to obliterate our cultural differences. In fact, we want all Singaporeans to retain as much as possible their cultural roots. Our policies on bilingual education and our policies on art and culture are geared towards instilling in our young people's minds a consciousness of the cultural roots. It is important to stress that a national identity is not at odds with a cultural identity. At times the two objectives may pose some strains in our policy. But this is a dilemma posed by the fact of a multi-ethnic mix. This is a dilemma which we must live with and no simple solution can be found.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to move to his point of enshrining racialism. Sir, I react very strongly to the word, or his use of the word, "racialism".
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Call a spade a spade.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> In ordinary language, we often use race and ethnic group interchangeably. But this is actually not accurate. "Race" refers to differences based on biologically inherited traits or genetic make-up, whereas ethnic group refers to differences in social characteristics such as language, religion, birth place and culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Let us not split hairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> That is not splitting hairs. Because what I find in the Member for Potong Pasir's statement that "we are enshrining racialism" a very insidious intention. Racialism implies that instead of treating everybody on an equal basis, we are treating people based on the biological make-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> But how can this be true where in Singapore all the ethnic groups are equal before the law? How can this be the case when educational and occupational advancement is based on merit and, in addition, all the ethnic groups use the same housing, medical care, social and cultural amenities?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Why are you taking away Article 12?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, I must warn you not to interject.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> You had hardly any interuption just now.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> To suggest that multi-racial representation means racialism is to stir the darker emotions and to vilify the good intentions of the Government. May I ask the Member for Potong Pasir, if it not not clear -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, she is asking me a question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> May I ask the Member of Potong Pasir, rhetorically, a question that, if it is not clear that open but sensitive and responsible discussion of ethnic differences and different perspectives is for the long term good of the nation, which government would want to make this move? I welcome the 1DPM's intention and resolution to commit this Bill to a Select Committee. I think it is very important to let the public speak up its mind and to really come to grasp with the issues at hand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I believe the reasons for not conducting a referendum must be explained very clearly to the people. By the way, I do not understand or I do not really know why the Member for Potong Pasir has come down so much from his past demands for a referendum to accepting a Select Committee now. But I think his point about referendum must be addressed, and must be addressed adequately. It is no good, it is not sufficient, to say that because we are all duly elected representatives and since Constitutional amendments only require a two-thirds majority in this House, therefore a referendum is not necessary. Because many people believe that the changes proposed are major changes and that they involve changes in the ground rules. So I believe the need to explain to the population why a referendum is not instructive, is not useful, and in fact can be confusing in this case, must be clearly explained. The need to explain this issue, Sir, does not lie in the number of people who call for a referendum. Petitions and the number of signatures are never accurate indications in such kinds of campaigns. What is important is to understand why there is a demand for a referendum at all, and I think we must read this population sentiment right. We are seeing in this demand the same desire among the better educated, more politically conscious, young Singaporeans who wish to have a say in policy-making and not just to exercise a vote during election time.

  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, the hon. Member for Potong Pasir is not too happy about us using Sri Lanka or Fiji as examples. Actually there are examples in the Western developed countries like Holland and Belgium where there are also institutionalized power-sharing arrangements amongst the different communities there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many countries in the world with pluralistic community of any significance have, in fact, adopted many types of power-sharing arrangements in order to ensure communal harmony. Perhaps only Switzerland does not have any formal power-sharing arrangements. Sir, in this respect, why Switzerland? I would like to read a quotation from a report done by Prof. Claire Palley of Oxford University.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Only in Switzerland has power-sharing developed organically over a century. The Constitution provides for a 7-man federal council holding office for a fixed term of four years. By convention, proportionate representation is used by the federal assembly to elect council members. The effect is that there are usually four or five German speakers, one or two French speakers and one Italian speaker. Power-sharing with voluntary acceptance of the principle of proportionality and a stable fixed time coalition together with an attitude of compromise prevalent since 1874 has resulted in relatively good inter-communal relationships.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps 100 years from today we do not need the Team MP proposal. But with our short history, Sir, I am afraid that what we fear most, and what we do not want most to come about, may come about if we do not take steps to prevent it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir again
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> touched on Cyprus and showed in his example how communal politics has split the country. Sir, I must add here that he is correct in that in Cyprus, communal politics has indeed split the country. But then, Sir, he is talking about communal politics, not multi-racial politics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Deputy Prime Minister has taken great pains to explain the difference between communal politics and multi-racial politics. And even after such explanation, I am afraid the hon. Member has found it difficult to understand. So I would like to add my simple explanation, which is, communal politics is politics based on the appeal to one race and on that appeal a government can be formed, to the detriment of the other races in the community. Multi-racial politics must appeal to as many races as possible because without that appeal, Sir, no government can be formed. Surely, any intelligent Singaporean can see that the Team MP concept is therefore multi-racial and not communal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most important, the Member for Potong Pasir has missed the crucial point of the issue before us. This issue is not that the candidates from the minority communities can be elected on their own steam and thus an arrangement such as the Bill before the House is not necessary. Sir, the issue is, what happens to Singapore if they are not elected. What if one day, due to reasons beyond our control, say, internally, such as a party appealing to the chauvinism of the majority or, even externally, such as events or actions in neighbouring countries causing our people to react in an emotionally realistic mannar. Sir, what if one day all returned candidates in a general election are Chinese? Then what happens? How will our neighbours react? What will be the geopolitical effect in our region?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more importantly, within our country, how would each and every one of us react? How will we face our Malay neighbours or our Indian friends? Can we ever have the same trust and belief in our hearts that as Singaporeans we will always look after one another as true Singaporeans if that happens? Because then, we will ask: are we really Singaporeans or are we not Chinese, Malay,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Indian first, and then Singaporeans second?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must remember that if such an event happens nothing in the world can erase it. Even if the winning party refuses to be the government and calls for a fresh election with fresh rules to prevent such a thing from happening, it will be too late. We will all know what has happened.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is, and I suppose this is the point in the mind of the Member for Potong Pasir, what is the chance of this happening? One in a million? One in ten million? Or even one in a billion? Even if it is one in a trillion, can we afford to take the risk of this unimaginable event happening? Some of the arguments put out by the Member for Potong Pasir may be considered rational, even sometimes sound, but of all persons, Sir ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Always sound.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sometimes sound. But, Sir, of all persons, he should be the first to realize and to know that voting in a general election is just as emotional. The fear is not so much the normal emotional reaction to a ruling party who has given Singapore its prosperity and progress for the past 30 years. Sir, the fear is that there may be a more basic emotional response to fundamental instincts, such as race, religion and culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What about your case?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, I must warn you to stop interrupting. If you want to say anything, rise from your seat and seek the permission of the Chair.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Thank you, Sir. Maybe what we fear can happen may not happen. But then what is so wrong as to enshrine in our law to ensure that it shall never happen?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of ensuring multi-racial representation for the Malay and the minority communities is, I believe, accepted by the majority of Singaporeans. I fully support this principle just as I support the move by the Government to enshrine this principle in our Constitution. However, Sir, I would like to ask the Hon.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> First Deputy Prime Minister that in selecting the Team MP and the GRC concept as the most appropriate and best system for Singapore, has he looked at other systems being practised by other countries with similar problems? My point is whether the Government has looked at all alternatives before selecting on the present one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that Members before me have already given some examples, such as communal system that has been given by the Member for Kebun Baru and the Member of Fengshan and these systems are being practised in some Fengshan and these system are being practised in some respects, in some modifications, by countries like Cyprus, Fiji, New Zealand or even India until 1985 where there were some seats reserved for the Untouchables. We have also touched on Fiji. They have a system where they have more than one electoral roll and where communal seats can be elected by the national voting population.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to touch more on the concept of proportionate representation. There have been many variations being used in this system, such as the list system, the single transferable vote system or even the alternate vote system, and there are many methods of calculating the voting weightage, quota, etc. Unlike the Member for Kebun Baru I would not like to dismiss it out of hand because there are obviously some merits in this particular system. We must remember there are many variations under this system of proportionate representation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect here, I would like to touch on the example of Mauritius. But before I do, I would also like to ask the First Deputy Prime Minister to consider the possibility of a bicameral system where we can have an Upper House based on a multi-racial voting basis.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to Mauritius. Mauritius has a similar problem, such as ours, of ensuring multi-racial representation. There are basically three main communities. Their Constitution divides the people of Mauritius into the Hindu community, the Muslim community, the Sino-Mauritian community and the general category called "Others". In their system, the voters return three successful candidates from each constituency. Therefore, if we look at
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> their system which is already being practised, our GRC with the Team MP proposal is not unique to us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have 21 constituencies of which one particular constituency only returns two. Why? I do not know. Perhaps it is because the population there is lesser. But other than these 62 elected representatives from the constituencies, they also have eight other members of the Assembly. There are eight seats allocated to the most unsuccessful candidates in a general election. Again, this is very similar to our Non-Constituency MPs. However, their allocation is based on a formula to ensure that the additional seats are given in such a way that they ensure a fair and adequate representation of each community in the Mauritian Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you also have a system where they face problems like Singapore and by all accounts so far, their system has been working fine for them. In fact, what we are doing perhaps is that we have adopted two features of that system, ie, the Group Representation Constituency as well as the Non-Constituency MPs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know I have taken a bit of time going into this example of the Mauritian Assembly but I believe that the Bill before us is an important one and will affect all of us. Like the member of Changkat, I heard many have asked for a referendum to be held on this issue. However, I am not too sure whether she favours or does not favour a referendum, although I do agree with her that the issue is complex and very emotive. Perhaps here, my view is that a referendum may not be the best way. In this respect, Sir, I commend the First Deputy Prime Minister on his proposal to put the Bill before a Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to propose another dimension to the Select Committee. Just to receive comments, views and ideas from the general public may not be adequate. Sir, constitutional law is not an easy subject to grasp. Unfortunately, too, the emotive content of this Bill is very high. As such, I would like to propose that a special parliamentary committee be formed to examine other alternatives and to determine from a rational, logical view-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> point that the proposed Team MP system is the most appropriate for Singapore. This committee could even be a sub-committee of the Select Committee and, if necessary, this committee can visit those countries with multi-racial legislation to see at first hand the workings of such legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in concluding whether or not Singapore should have legal rights of ensuring minority representation in Parliament it may be worthwhile for the House to note the conclusions of the report that I have earlier quoted. In the study, the professor noted the presence of institutional arrangements to regulate and clamp down inter-community conflict in many countries with a mixed population. The most important conclusions she reached are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) In countries where such institutional arrangements have been introduced, the institutional arrangements have progressively been accompanied by accommodating attitudes between different communities; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The fewer the presence of such institutional arrangements the more intense is the conflict between communities, whereas the more such arrangements are present, the more accommodating are the attitudes of the different communities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I would like to support the Bill.
  <br>4.13 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the many discussions I had with the ground I cannot help but come to the conclusion that many are still unclear about the Team MP proposal. Therefore, lest we get detracted from the main purpose of this Bill, I think it is of utmost importance that we should try to win the hearts and minds of our people on this very important and fundamental issue of racial representation in Parliament by further discussion and explanation and to allow representations by many interested groups, interested parties, to air their views to the Government. I therefore welcome and support the move to let this Bill be referred to a Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will recall the Howe Yoon Chong Report on the Problems of the Aged, how it was focused primarily on the CPF issue, thus detracting most Singaporeans from the real issues presented in the Report. Similarly, let us not get detracted from issues such as the definition of who is a Malay, and concentrate on the main issue, ie, multi-racial representation in Parliament. We should let our Malay community decide who is a Malay. They know better and we must abide by their decision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now give some feedback from the ground to this House on this issue. We met many people and the participants agreed that it was necessary for a multi-racial society like ours to have a multi-racial representation in Parliament. But they were divided in their views as to whether there was really a need to tinker with the existing electoral system in order to ensure multi-racial representation. One participant wondered why the subject was being broached now. He felt that multi-racialism has always been a feature of politics in Singapore even before the PAP. All parties, except the communal-based ones like UMNO and MCA, were multi-racial in nature. Moreover, considering that the PAP had been so succcessful in blurring communal differences and had through its dominance attenuated communal-based politics, there was really no need to tinker with the present system. And in his words, "If it works, why fix it?" He felt that the solution was to develop a national identity so that all Singaporeans could feel as one regardless of race, language or religion. Only when racial differences were blurred, would there be real political stability.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other participants supported his views. They felt that the fear of the Government that the minority race might not be represented was unfounded. One participant commented that this view could imply that minority candidates were incompetent and there was a need to tamper with the system in order for them to be elected. The participants supporting this view felt that the solution laid not in tampering with the existing system but to entrench it as it had been working so well. One participant further noted that the PAP should revive
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the enthusiasm of the voters and prove its worth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another commented that there was a lot of cynicism about the Team MP proposal. Many Singaporeans wondered whether the proposal was a guise by the PAP to ensure its dominance or was it a genuine effort to ensure minority representation?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some others supported the need to modify the existing system in order to ensure there would always be multi-racial representation. In fact, one thought that there was no immediate problem. One could never be sure about having continued multi-racial representation in the future. He said that the recent controversies illustrated vividly that despite 20 years of independence and nation building, there were still many emotional issues which ran along racial lines. Examples in other countries, such as Fiji, reminded us that it was better to put ground rules in place to prevent racial polarization rather than wait for the problem to erupt and then to think of a solution. Any solution then would always be too late, too inadequate and viewed with great suspicion. He felt that as a start, there should be an amendment to the Constitution to require all political parties in Singapore to be multi-racial in make-up. While this in itself would not assure a truly multi-racial political party nor ensure multi-representation in Parliament, it was a necessary first step. In the long term, the real solution was to ensure integration and the development of nationhood.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participant added that the Team MP concept was a workable one and should not be confused with the town council concept. He added the town council concept was to develop estate management responsibilities to the residents, and that was a good idea. After all, estate management was delegated to the HDB, why not let the residents decide? However, the Team MP concept was for a different purpose. He felt that the earlier linkage between the two concepts had confused people. While the Team MP concept was acceptable, he felt that if the ground rules were to be changed, then this should be subject to the approval of the population, possibly through a referendum. Otherwise, there would always be accusations
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that the ground rules were changed to ensure continued dominance of the PAP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another participant supported his view. He commented that based on his experience with the ground, there were still considerable emotional differences among the races. It was naive for anyone to assume that there was complete integration and that we were all one people regardless of race, language or religion. He added that all that was needed was a spark to ignite the dormant but not defused forces of racial polarization. He added that the older generation was different and was grateful to the PAP for the prosperity it brought to them. But the younger generation took things for granted and were more assertive of their rights. Not only was the minority questioning the perceived discrimination, but even the majority was asking why special privileges were given to the minority. For example, poor Chinese were asking why they should not be assisted in the same way that the Malays were.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One participant commented that the adoption of one political system or another would be a result of political motivation and consideration. He felt that the solution offered was a technical one and did not address adequately the fundamental issue. The more fundamental questions were whether there was really racial integration and whether in fact the elected minority MPs were looked upon as leaders by their own race. He felt that recent events indicated that there was still no integration and as long as this remained so, there would be need for some modifications to ensure multi-racial representation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants agreed that at the end of the day, it was a political judgement, whether there was indeed a problem. If the consensus was that there was a problem, then there would be a need to do something now to defuse the problem and not to wait until the problem really surfaced before trying to solve it. From the discussion, it would appear that many of the racial differences were simmering below the tranquil facade and these forces could erupt into ugly incidents with the slightest provocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the views of those I met. I would like now to express my views. If we all believe in multi-racialism, we must ensure that every race in Singapore, irrespective of whether he belongs to the majority or minority group, must have a place here. In my opinion, throughout our years of independence, we concentrated and achieved good economic growth to provide the basics for our people, like housing, clean water supply, roads, hospitals and schools. And in spite of the fact that we were so busy getting our people housed, clothed and educated, we did not take for granted our multi-racial society. We may have overlooked some aspects but we were aware of the problems. And we did try to lay the foundations of a multi-racial society by ensuring the majority race, Chinese, from imposing its language and way of life on the minority. We set up a Presidential Council for Minority Rights. We dispersed concentrations of Malays into housing estates so that different races will have a better chance of mixing and understanding each other. And above all, we adopted a neutral language, English, at the expense of alienating the majority. Therefore, this attempt to ensure multi-racial representation in Parliament is nothing new. We have done this in the public housing estates, we have adopted a neutral language, English. So I am surprised that there are people who said that this is wrong. Like some of the measures taken, this will also not be perfect. It will have its flaws. But one thing is important - we make attempts to try to make multi-racialism work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, believing in multi-racialism is one thing, making it working is another. There are many countries which want to believe that they are practising multi-racialism in their society, but make no attempt to actually get it working. I think we are different. We are brave to face the realities of multi-racial living. To avoid this is to court trouble later on. The outside influence through the television and the mass media has a profound effect on our young, who like one of the participants in the forum questioned: why should we give the Malays special privilege on education and land for mosque? My answer, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, was my generation and my father's generation
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> accepted many aspects of multi-racial living without question because we know the alternative is chaos and bloodshed. But our young are a different breed. It is not that they are wrong in asking such questions but the influence they had through the television set their inquiring minds ticking and wondering. Therefore, unless we put the ground rules in order for multi-racial harmony in Singapore, we may face problems later on. In attempts to do this, the Government has been accused by one of the participants in the forum for having taken a step or two backwards as a result of this move. My answer is simple. So be it. If we are seen to have taken one step backwards as a result of this legislation, I see no harm. I would rather we take a step backwards as a result of this legislation, I see no harm. I would rather we take a step back than take two steps forward. We are consolidating our position on multi-racial living in society. I think this is not only being pragmatic but realistic.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore must try to understand that this Government did not only consider the Term MP proposal. The First Deputy Prime Minister has listed out all the proposals and I shall not go over them again. If we did not consider all thses proposals, then they have every right to condemn us for just pushing this through. Consultation in public on this was started as early as 1986, but in private I think we started as early as 1982. And if more is needed, then I am sure this will be done at the Select Committee stage where anyone not happy with this must make his views heard.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changkat has called for more in-depth explanation as to why a referendum is not necessary. I think we should give adequate explanation on this. As for my view, I think this Bill is for multi-racial representation in Parliament. To askfor a referendum against multi-racialism, I think is not correct.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let this Team MP proposal be but one of the ways to achieve a multi-racial society. Now that we are a more matured society and are more open in our discussion on race and religion, we must take a critical look at ourselves to see where we have made oversights in planning. It calls for a concerted effort by all - the Government and the private sector. We must break down certain prejudices about
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> race. We must not stereotype certain race. In the schools we must avoid situations like putting all Tamil students in one class for administrative reasons. But whatever change we may want to make, it must not be done at the expense of meritocracy because it was through the principle of meritocracy that has brought Singapore this far. While the majority has a moral obligation to look after the minority, the minority also has a moral obligation to understand the constraints and limitations of multi-racial living. In the end, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it boils down to trust - trust in each other, in believing that the intention is for the overall good and not for the betterment or the putting down of a particular race.

  <!-- Encik Wan Hussin Bin Hj Zoohri -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Wan Hussin Bin Hj Zoohri (Kampong Ubi):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, after five years of intellectual incubation, this GRC egg, so to speak, has now hatched. In hatching this egg, the First Deputy Prime Minister in his press statement underscored the main thrust of the Bill. I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is to institutionalize the practice of multi-racial politics in Singapore, a necessary condition for political stability in a multi-racial Singapore.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, this Bill seeks to ensure that the minorities will be represented in Parliament. The logical extension of this is that by having minority representations in Parliament, the welfare and interests of the minorities will be appropriately heard and advanced. This also means that by institutionalizing multi-racial politics, it would also institutionalize the mechanism by which the minorities will have a guaranteed political avenue for the advancement of their interests.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As minorities, the Malays in particular, may have interests that could be of special nature to them. It is again logical to assume that only members representing their respective minorities or the Malay Members of Parliament can best appreciate what these special interests are and have them properly presented in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to elaborate further on this question of representation of minority interests in Parliament, with particular reference to the Malay community. It is my
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> thesis and my belief that the interests of the Malay community can be better served through political representation in Parliament than otherwise. In other words, some form of political linkage is necessary in the advancement of Malay interests.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to substantiate my thesis. But before I do that, let me first state the constitutional position of the Malays in Singapore. I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is necessary as it would help us focus the advancement of the Malay interests in its proper national perspective. Article 152 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore on minorities and special position of the Malays states:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.'

  <b>Encik Wan Hussin bin Hj Zoohri:</b> I have just stated the educational, religious, socio-economic, cultural and the well-being of the community as a whole constitute the Malay interests. I thought it is so simple. I am not sure why it has been so perplexing to the Member.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it must be pointed out that this constitutional status of the special position of the Malays in singapore is not similar in intent, interpretation and in its implementation with Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution regarding Malays or bumiputras in Malaysia. This distinction is important to note because it is this apparent misconception of the constitional weightage of this Article amongst the general Malay public that made them want to equate the special position of the Malays with that of the bumiputras in Malaysia. As I see it, the translation of this Article into practical terms must, whilst taking cognizance of the special position of the Malays, take into account the interests of the majority of the non-Malays. In other words, there must be a blend or a judicious balance of minority and majority interests in a manner that is seen to be fair and just to the electorate. Thus, decisions that are to be taken by the Government will have to be based on a balance of all interests, ie, the special position of the Malays and also the legitimate interests of the non-Malays in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach of advancing the interests of the Malays in Singapore repudiates the model or approach of giving special privileges to the Malays. This stand, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, was clearly enunciated by the Prime Minister when Singapore was in Malaysia then. I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There shall be no reservation for Malays in accordance with Article 153 [of the Malaysian Constitution] of positions in the public service to be filled by recruitment in Singapore.' (Source: The Battle for Malaysian Malaysia, Lee Kuan Yew, Vol. 1, pp. 29.)
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-racial context such as Singapore, it is necessary to fully appreciate and understand the political undercurrents that are operating in the society. This is of re-emphasize the point that there are certain constraints and necessary restraints
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> existing within the practical sphere of multi-racial politics in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this political reality as our backdrop, let me now return to substantiate the thesis of the need for some form of political linkage in the advancement of Malay interests in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Since 1965, when Singapore became independent, free education from primary to tertiary level was accorded by the Government to Singapore Malays.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In 1966, the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) was enacted which resulted in the establishment of the Muslim Religious Council, better know as MUIS, in 1968.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The establishment of MUIS made it possible for Muslims to subscribe to the Mosque Building Fund by the check-off system through the Government CPF machinery starting in 1975.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In 1982, the Muslim Members of Parliament together with the Muslim community leaders created the Council on Education for Muslim Children or better known as Mendaki. This was well received by the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In 1984, the Government expanded the Mosque Building Fund into Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund to provide financial strength to Mendaki through voluntary contributions by Muslims in Singapore, again through the CPF machinery.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Hopefully, by the end of 1988, the Malay Members of Parliament's idea of a new concept of a Malay kampung in Geylang Serai will be a reality when its construction is completed by the HDB.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Going back a little into history, in the colonial days of 1920s and 1930s, the Malay settlement or kampung Melayu, through the effort of Encik Mohamed Eunos, President of the Singapore Malay Union or Kesatuan Melayu Singapura who was then a member of the Straits Settlement Legislative Council. He was also instrumental during his tenure as Legislative Councillor in securing English education through the special Malay class and the establishment of a trade school for Malay children.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These assisted programmes seen from the proper national perspective are directed towards multi-racial ends and not as special privileges to the Malays. The point to note is that it is the general community that benefits from these programmes and not individuals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now show the antithesis that efforts which had no political linkage and initiated outside Government or quasi-government machinery were not followed through and did not achieve their desired results.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In 1964, when Singapore was in Malaysia, the then UMNO Singapura which was at its high point in terms of Malay support held a Malay Convention to press for special Malay privileges for the Malays. This was rejected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In 1968, the Singapore Malay Teachers' Union organized a seminar on Malay education and called on the Government to establish an elite Malay medium school that would help boost the standard of Malay education. This remained unresolved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In 1970, the Singapore Malay Teachers' Union again proposed to the authorities its version of the national system of education. This was unacceptable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Also in 1970, the Central Council of Malay Cultural Organizations or Majlis Pusat organized a multi-racial seminar entitled "Malay Participation in the National Development of Singapore". Its submission of the seminar findings received no official response.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the above choronological accounts, I have shown that my thesis stands, ie, the interest of the Malays in Singapore is better served with the existence of a political linkage. As the aim of this Bill is to institutionalize Malay representation in Parliament, it also leads to the institutionalization of this political linkage. In that sense, this Bill is worthy of support as it will contribute to the maintenance of this judicious balance of minority and majority interests so essential in multi-racial politics of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to make some observations on the Bill regarding the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Malay Committee. This Committee consisting of a chairman and four members shuld rightly be persons belionging to the Malay Commity. My observation is that just as this Committee would have its own guidelines and criteria as spelt out by the Member for Tanah Merah in determining the status of a prospective candidate to be a person belonging to the Malay Community, the Presidential Council for Minority Rights which would be given the task of nominating members of this Committee must logically be guided by certain criteria which would then be the basis for the guiding principles for the Malay Committee. In other words, the criteria to be used by the Malay Committee must be in consonance with those of the Presidential Council in determining the status of a person belonging to the Malay community. It is therefore my hope that both the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and the Malay Committee be properly advised by competent authorities on this matter. I am glad that interested parties will now be able to submit their submissions to the Select Committee on these two items.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other observation is regarding the mode of decision made by the Committee as specified in the Bill. The Bill states that a decision of the Committee is by a simple majority. I take it that this would facilitate the practical aspect of the Committee's deliberations. However, in spirit and in essence, such a decision would appear a little strange. If the Malay Committee, which is supposed to be the constitutional macrocosm of the feelings and aspirations of the Malay community, reflects a division in its decision, this can signal an anticipated division in the degree of acceptability of the prospective candidate by the Malay community at large. It is therefore in my opinion essential that decisions of the Committee should be unanimous or on a consensus rather than by a simple majority. It is important that the Malay community should have no qualms or reservations on the decision of the Committee in determining whether a prospective candidate belongs to the Malay community or otherwise.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes, Encik Zulkifli.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed (Eunos)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the basic question that should be asked by the people of Singapore after detailed and thorough consideration is whether the Bill now being debated upon will have more positive effects or otherwise for the future, that is, for the sake of our future generations. I believe the people of Singapore would be able to consider all aspects of this Bill and would be satisfied. In my judgment, a responsible Government will not neglect something which in its opinion should be given serious consideration and will seek a solution before it is too late. It is unthinkable that a responsible Government would table a Bill that would bring forth problem. The task of governing a country is not an esay one, especially if the country is a multi-racial society like Singapore. Each community has its own special problems and its own priorities. From this it is clear that there will be competing interests among the different communities. This kind of situation can bring about communal strife if one community feels that they have been alienated from the national mainstream.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble aim behind the GRC concept is to ensure through legislation by enshrining it in the Constitution of Singapore the representation of minority groups in Parliament. Is there anything wrong to move towards an objective that is based on the principle of multi-rationalism? I cannot understand the reasons given by
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Member for Potong Pasir. As a Member of Parliament who comes from a minority group, I understand the implications of this Bill. And I feel the Member for Potong Pasir is not qualified to voice the anxieties and fears of the minority groups in Singapore, in particular the Malay community. I consider this issue a crucial one and, looking far ahead, I am convinced Singapore cannot afford to be trapped in a situation where the minority groups are not adequately represented or perhaps not represented at all in the legislative process. If this is allowed to happen, the consequences will be very serious, protracted and would affect our political stability.
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I clarify, Sir?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): I am not giving way, Sir.

  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> He is not giving way, Mr Chiam.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the people of Singapore should support this Bill, which also is proof that our national leaders are leaders who are fully committed to the concept of multi-racialism, multi-religionism and multi-lingualism. Although the GRC concept is still open to some questioning and inadequate in some respects, without a better alternative, it is only proper for us to experiment it with the hope that it would offer us long-term solutions to the issue of Malay and minority representation in Parliament for the sake of the stability and well-being of our nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support this Bill and I am happy that the First Deputy Prime Minister intends to commit the Bill to a Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Bo Wen):</b> Sir, I think we have to examine the Bill from a wider perspective. I feel that a very narrow examination of the Bill in terms of doing the Opposition in, doctoring the electoral boundary and creating second-class MP, is indeed a parochial orientation. The acid test of examining this Bill is to ask ourselves whether the Bill is in the long term good of Singapore. This is a fundamental question that we all have to address.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that the Bill ensures a multi-racial Parliament. And if this is the case, is it necessarily bad for Singapore? I assert that by having a multi-racial Parliament, it provides a conduit for minority groups to express their aspirations and their feelings in terms of issues which are specific to the minority groups. Unless such a conduit is available, it will spell danger in the longer term, and in many situations and in many countries I see the problem has arisen. We all know it. And if we can learn to avoid this from happening to Singapore, I think we have taken the right step in the right direction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Parliament without the presence of the minority group does not provide a multi-cultural orientation to the communities' issues and problems. One would perhaps look at things from a mono-cultural point of view. I am of the opinion that a bi-cultural focus will be provided if we have a multi-racial Parliament. Therefore, I see that in terms of Singapore's long term survival and healthy development, it is necessary to ensure that we have a multi-racial Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I have a number of observations to make which I hope the First Deputy Prime Minister will provide the necessary clarifications. First, Sir, the Bill enshrines minority representation. Though it is good, in the longer term it might create some racial differences if it is not carefully tackled at the earlier stage, in the sense that one might heighten ethnic sensitivity and differences. Unless and until we tamper this and ensure that Members of Parliament look at issues broadly and represent the community on a broader basis, then any ethnic sensitivity can be minimized to a great extent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being a minority representative, the danger is that one might expect pressure from minority groups to get minority-elected members to articulate opinions in terms of their needs. I feel that we must find ways to maintain a sensible balance such that Parliamentarians themselves will look at things on a universal perspective.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, the Bill suggests a slight departure from the original Parliamentary voting pattern. We now vote for a team of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> three persons instead of one Parliamentary candidate. Sir, would such a change reduce the status of the MP who belongs to a minority group? Sir, there is a need to clarify and ensure that the roles and responsibilities of the MPs in the GRCs are clearly spelled out so that they can have a better perspective of their work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thirdly, the Bill seems to be silent in defining Indians as a distinct minority group. Instead, Indians are lumped under a definition of "minority community". It is interesting to note that in dealing with the Indian community, there is this articulation of concern from them. They were thinking and wondering, what is the rationale for leaving them out specifically in the definition? There are more or less no obvious reactions from this community so far. But I feel there is a need to provide some clarification as to why they have been excluded from this definition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Bill, if a Member of the Team resigns or dies, there is no need for by-elections. This seems to be acceptable if the MP of the Team is not from a minority group. In the event he is not from a minority group. In the event he is an MP from a minority group, it does pose a dilemma. Logically speaking, a by-election needs to be called. However, the Bill does not take this into consideration. Why is this so? I hope the First Deputy Prime Minister will be able to explain that. In the event a minority Member resigns or dies, the prin-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ciple underlying the Bill itself would be affected and this needs to be looked into.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, some quarters think that the Bill tries to subtly whittle down the Opposition. I gather this has been the trend of public opinion from various quarters. I feel that this perception has to be erased. The Bill is basically an answer to the long-term interests of Singapore, and we should bring this message across to this quarter which has stated a whispering campaign that we are whittling them down. Sir, why not leave out the Opposition constituencies out of the GRCs and be gracious to let them be as they are? This would then erase the possibility of people saying that they are being done in with.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion I support the Bill to be referred to the Select Committee.
  <br>
