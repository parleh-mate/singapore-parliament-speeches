<div align="center"><b>1972 WORLD BADMINTON TOURNAMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Selection of national team for training)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Social  Affairs if a national badminton team  has

been selected for training in preparation for the 1972 World Badminton Tournament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Singapore  Badminton  Association  has  been

advised by the International Badminton Federation

that the project to hold the World



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



Badminton  Tournament in 1972 has been  postponed

indefinitely,  and will not be held  in  1972  as

envisaged.  The  Member may  wish  to  know  that

active   consideration  is  being  given   to   a

systematic  and  continuous  training  scheme  to

promote  badminton  in  Singapore  and   to   the

training of a national badminton team.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Parliamentary Secretary say whether the

National  Sports Promotion Board  has  engaged  a

professional coach to train our national team?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the N.S.P.B.

has  not  engaged a coach because  the  Singapore

Badminton  Association already  has  a  corps  of

experienced coaches to train the national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



team. All these coaches are volunteers. It may  be

desirable  for the Singapore Badminton Association

to  consider engaging a professional  coach  at  a

later  stage in order to bring up the standard  of

the  players  who  are selected for  the  national

team.  Meanwhile, the present corps of coaches  is

also   engaged  in  training  several  squads   of

selected  badminton players who have the potential

to  make  the grade for selection in the  national

team.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING ESTATES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up of creches)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Social Affairs if consideration is being given  to

setting  up  creches in the various large  housing

estates, and if one will be set up in or near  the

Kallang Housing Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Social Welfare

Department operates 11 creches at the moment.  The

Jurong Town Creches, which was officially opened on

19th June, 1971, is the first creches to be set  up

in a new township or housing estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has plans to set up creches in the

other  new  towns, such as Toa Payoh,  Queenstown,

Telok  Blangah and Woodlands, where the  projected

population justifies the setting up of a creches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, no plan at the moment to set

up a creches in the Kallang Housing Estate as there

is  already a creches, the Lee Kuo Chuan Creches, at

Guillemard Road nearby. Although the Lee Kuo Chuan

Creches  has  accommodation for  80  children,  its

average  attendance is only 55 and  more  children

from  the  Kallang Housing Estate can be  accepted

for admission to this creches. As it is, already 22

children  out of the 55 attending the  creches  are

living in the Kallang Housing Estate. However,  if

there  is a dire need to have a creches within  the

Kallang   Housing  Estate  in  the   future   when

circumstances warrant it, consideration can always

be given.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Lee  Kuo Chuan Creches  is  not  in  the

Kallang Basin Housing Estate but in Kallang  Park,

which is miles away from my constituency. Does the

Parliamentary    Secretary    agree    that    the

circumstances in the Kallang Basin Housing  Estate

warrant  the setting up of a creches, and,  if  so,

whether he will consider providing one in the very

near future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> I think so, Sir.

<div align="center"><b>SHIPYARDS AND SLIPWAYS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Short-term leases to replace T.O.L.s)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance if he will ascertain from the Jurong  Town

Corporation  whether shipyard and  slipway  owners

will  be  offered short-term leasehold to  replace

the present Temporary Occupation Licences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   Temporary  Occupation  Licences  have  been

issued  to three shipyards in Jurong Town  and  21

shipyards in Kallang Park Industrial Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the three shipyards in Jurong Town,

leases  of  up to 30 years will be issued  in  due

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 21 shipyards on Temporary Occupation

Licences  in  the Kallang Park Industrial  Estate,

the  offer of short-term leases to these shipyards

is  being considered. The final decision, however,

cannot be reached until the type of crossing (low-level  bridge,  high-level bridge,  drawbridge  or

tunnel) over the Kallang River and the future  use

of  the  Kallang Park and Tanjong Rhu  areas  have

first been decided.

<div align="center"><b>SHIPYARDS AND SLIPWAYS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Exemption from property tax)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if he will consider waiving the  proposed

levy  of  property  tax  on  Temporary  Occupation

Licences



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



held  by  shipyard  and slipway owners  along  the

Geylang  River  in  the  Kallang  Park  Industrial

Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, property tax is leviable on all

land  and improvements on land. Property  tax  is,

therefore,  payable  on  shipyards  and  slipways.

Under  the present arrangement between the  Jurong

Town  Corporation and the owners of the  shipyards

and  slipways, these owners pay the  property  tax

through the Jurong Town Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any exemption or reduction of property tax is a

hidden  subsidy from the Government. The shipyards

and slipways have been enjoying boom conditions in

the past few years and there is no reason why they

should  be  further subsidized by Government.  The

Government   has,  therefore,  no   intention   of

exempting  shipyards  and slipways  from  property

tax.

<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S SPEECH</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Fifth Day)</b></div>



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Question [30th July, 1971],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the

speech of the President be agreed to : -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of

Singapore, express our thanks to the  President

for the speech which he delivered on behalf  of

the  Government at the opening  of  the  Second

Session of this Parliament.".'.-[Dr Chiang  Hai Ding].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may 1 be allowed to make a

few  remarks in reply to some of the points raised

by  hon. Members in this House during the last few

days,  so  far  as  these  points  relate  to  the

Ministry of Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa raised the points of export

promotion and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



finance.  With  the  rapid  industrial  growth  in

Singapore  and  our  emphasis  on  export-oriented

industries,   it  follows  that  we  should   give

emphasis to export promotion. As early as 1966, an

Export Promotion Council was established with  the

objective of servicing the industrial and business

communities   by  way  of  supplying   them   with

commercial  information as well as assisting  them

in  the  organisation of trade fairs and  missions

abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of Intraco (International

Trading  Company)  in 1968, the  Export  Promotion

Council was transferred under its wings. Intraco's

main  task  is  the  development,  promotion   and

marketing    of    Singapore-manufactured    goods

throughout   the  world.  It  now   has   overseas

representatives   in  Indonesia,   the   U.S.S.R.,

Australia,  West Germany, Holland,  South  Vietnam

and  Cambodia all this with the aim of helping  to

promote  and sell Singapore-made goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an Export Promotion Advisory Committee in the

Trade   Division  of  the  Ministry  of   Finance.

Representatives   from  the  joint   Chambers   of

Commerce,     the     Singapore     Manufacturers'

Association, Intraco, and the Economic Development

Board, sit on this Committee, the main function of

which  is  to advise on participation by Singapore

manufacturers and exporters in international fairs

overseas.  With  the encouragement and  assistance

given  by  the  Trade Division, our  manufacturers

participated in the Jetro Fair held  in  Tokyo  in

April  this  year, and at the present  moment  are

participating   in   the   Djakarta   Fair.    The

manufacturers  will  also be taking  part  in  the

"Partners for Progress Exhibition" to be  held  in

Berlin in October this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa himself led a large

mission to Tokyo in connection with the Jetro Fair

last April.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experience gained in the participation of

trade  fairs  and missions abroad, action  is  now

being   taken  to  expand  the  Export   Promotion

Advisory Committee so that it will be better  able

to  serve  the  promotion and sale  of  our  goods

abroad.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Export financing is intimately tied up with

export  promotion. At present,  a  great  deal  of

export financing is through short-term trade bills

financed by our commercial banks. A careful  study

was  made  on  an Export Guarantee  Scheme  by  my

Ministry  some  time ago but its introduction  was

found to be inadvisable at the moment. At present,

short-term financing is not a serious problem  but

when  we start exporting more sophisticated  goods

and  capital  equipment, long-term  finance  would

then become more urgent. My Ministry is keeping .a

close  watch on this matter and we are  exercising

our minds in devising a solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa also asked whether the

Government  will  help to identify  limited  areas

where   local  capital  and  enterprise   can   be

encouraged  to  go  into. My  Ministry  will  give

consideration to this suggestion. Where the market

is   entirely   local,   there   appears   to   be

justification in trying to obtain at least a share

for local capital and enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained that the 10 per cent

tax  on  P.U.B, bills is a regressive tax. It  may

interest  him  to know, however,  that  more  than

115,000 out of a total of 320,000 accounts do  not

pay  the 10 per cent tax because they consume less

than $13 a month. These represent some 36 per cent

of the total number of accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang raised the question of

cement  shortage.  My Ministry  is  aware  of  the

situation  and  has  requested Intraco  to  import

60,000  metric tons of cement, the first  shipment

of  which is scheduled to arrive in about a week's

time,  and the second shipment of 10,000  tons  by

about  the  end of this month. Further, the  three

cement   manufacturers  have  been  requested   to

maintain  minimum levels of production  to  ensure

adequate  future  supply. We are keeping  a  close

watch  on  the  situation, and,  if  it  warrants,

further imports by Intraco will be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang, together with the

Member for Bukit Ho Swee, also raised the question

of price increases. This subject was thoroughly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



debated  during the budget debate  in  March  this

year.  During  that debate, Members were  informed

that,  because of the openness of our economy  and

because  we  import almost everything we  use  and

consume,  we  are very much dependent  upon  world

prices,  and that in recent years there  has  been

worldwide  inflation, especially in the  developed

countries.  What we can do to help  is  to  ensure

that   there  is  an  efficient  port   and   that

competition in Singapore is free, so that we could

import at the cheapest price, and that there is no

monopoly   which  could  artificially   manipulate

prices to the detriment of the consuming public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, a Consumers' Association has been

formed,  and  this Association, which  works  very

closely  with  the Trade Division of my  Ministry,

has  been able to exert considerable influence  on

the  price level. The Trade Division on  its  part

has  been  giving  considerable encouragement  and

help  to  the Consumers' Association and has  been

sending out inspectors to check on prices whenever

there   is  report  of  any  unjustifiable   price

increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, however, would like to emphasise

the  positive side of encouraging competition  and

fair  prices  rather  than the  negative  side  of

regulation  and  control.  One  of  the  ways   of

encouraging traders to sell at fair prices  is  to

give these traders maximum publicity. This we hope

to  do  by  enlisting the help of hon. Members  of

this House. This is what we are going to do:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inspectorate of the Trade Division, in their

rounds  of  price checking, have come across  many

shopkeepers who sell at fair prices. In  fact,  it

can  be said that unscrupulous traders who are out

to  make a fast buck is the exception rather  than

the rule. This is also confirmed by the Consumers'

Association.  What  we  are  going  to  do  is  to

publicise the names of these traders who  sell  at

fair  and reasonable prices by putting their names

on  a notice board in the community centres of the

areas concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



And  hon.  Members can help by giving the  fullest

publicity  to what we are going to do.  This  free

publicity will give fair and reasonable traders  a

competitive  edge  over  the  others,   and   will

encourage other traders to follow suit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumer himself can help in maintaining

stable prices. He should keep himself informed and

see  whether  there are substitutes  for  what  he

wants  to  buy. I think an example will make  this

clear.  When the Public Utilities Board  announced

some time ago that there would be a possibility of

water rationing, people rushed to buy plastic tubs

for  the  storage of water. Because of this  rush,

the  price  of plastic tubs went up two  to  three

times  overnight. The rush, however, was  entirely

unnecessary because the P.U.B, did say that  ample

notice  would  be given before the  imposition  of

water  rationing. Furthermore, people should  have

found  out  whether  there  were  substitutes  for

plastic  tubs for the storage of water. If  people

had not rushed all at once to buy plastic tubs, or

if they had looked for substitutes, then the price

of  plastic tubs would not have gone up, at  least

would   not  have  gone  up  two  or  three  times

overnight.  The  price  of plastic  tubs  has  now

dropped  back  to its original level  because  the

demand for them has eased. Those who panicked  and

rushed  to  buy plastic tubs at exorbitant  prices

had only themselves to blame.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government  believes  that  with  a  well-informed

consuming  public and efficient port services  and

free competition in Singapore, we would be able to

maintain  a stable price level for the benefit  of

us all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to associate myself

with  the  motion thanking the President  for  the

speech  which  he  delivered  on  behalf  of   the

Government at the opening of the Second Session of

this Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  in support of the motion standing in  the

name  of  the  hon.  Member for  Ulu  Pandan,  and

proposing  a  vote of thanks to the President  for

the  speech that he has delivered on behalf of the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worker in Singapore, whether a citizen or

otherwise,  can exert considerable influence,  for

better or for worse, on matters pertaining to  the

well-being  of  the  nation at  large.  In  order,

therefore,  for him to earn a fair  share  of  the

fruits  of prosperity, he has to exert himself  to

contribute  to  the  achievement  of  the  optimum

economic growth as a condition precedent  for  any

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968, the Employment Act was enacted in order

to  create  a  favourable investment  climate  for

Singapore, in anticipation of and preparation  for

the crucial years ahead. We in the National Trades

Union   Congress  have  accepted  the   unpleasant

conclusion  that  if  Singapore  did  not   become

economically viable, the bells will toll first for

the organised labour. Although we detested certain

features  of  the  Employment Act as  restrictive,

nonetheless we accepted the underlying  objectives

of  the Act,, that is, the curbing of malpractices

and  the  creation of a more favourable industrial

relations  climate to attract foreign investments.

The  consequences  of any other alternative  would

not only be more painful, but also disastrous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent events proved that, on the whole, it

was a right decision taken by the N.T.U.C, leaders

in  accepting the Employment Act as inevitable and

infinitely  more  desirable than  the  chaos  that

would  have  resulted if the problems  of  growing

unemployment had not been checked in  1968  before

they   posed   a  serious  threat  to  Singapore's

survival.   Not  only  were  a  general   economic

depression  and massive unemployment averted,  but

an  extraordinary industrial development was  also

generated,  giving rise to boom conditions  and  a

serious labour shortage in the Republic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel with, and equally as impressive as, the

economic  development  is the  significant  social

progress that has taken place in Singapore  during

the   past  six  years.  Social  progress  is  not

automatically  a  consequence of economic  growth,

even when the rate of such growth is exceptionally

high.  Despite  favourable  growth  records,  many

countries  in  Asia have greater unemployment  now

than  a decade ago, and millions of their citizens

still   lack  educational  opportunities,  despite

heavy  investment in educational facilities. These

problems  are  compounded by the rapid  growth  in

population  which in itself is swallowing  a  vast

amount  of  the  additional capital  generated  by

economic development. Millions live in poverty and

do not even enjoy the minimum degree of well-being

and security compatible with human dignity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Singapore has not only

brought  population growth under control, but  has

also   achieved   a  situation  of   nearly   full

employment. Our social amenities such as  low-cost

housing,  educational and medical facilities,  and

communication services are among the best  in  the

region  and  comparable to any part of the  world.

Our  educational system, after decades of colonial

inertia, has now been oriented and geared  to  our

manpower  needs. There are parks  and  gardens  to

make for a more gracious living. We may yet attain

in  the near future, as the Prime Minister himself

has so wished, a gracious way of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, a combination of so many factors has

been   responsible   for  our  relative   economic

affluence, social order and political stability at

present. No less important than any factor is  the

part played by labour in the success of our socio-economic progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the N.T.U.C, made it clear in 1968, when

accepting the Employment Act, that we did  so  not

for  the  purpose  of  enriching  the  pockets  of

employers,  but  for the purpose of  ensuring  the

success  of  our industrial expansion;  first,  to

overcome  the growing unemployment situation,  and

then  to  raise  the standard  of  living  of  our

workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that the Government is

conscious of the sacrifices and contributions made

by  labour to rapid economic growth and has  urged

employers  making  exceptional  profits  to   give

better  bonuses to their workers. The announcement

by  the  Government to review the prevailing  wage

policy, after the full effects of the run-down  of

the  British bases have been assessed, is  also  a

welcome move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not doubting the sincerity of the

Government's intention to improve the general wage

level  in the best possible way at the right time,

I cannot help' having a strong suspicion that some

employers may not take kindly to such a  move  and

will  do their best to thwart it under one pretext

and  another.  It is, most conceivable  that  such

employers  will  attempt  to  equate  any   upward

revision  of  the  wage  level  with  terms   like

"inflation",   and  advance  the   argument   that

"prohibitive    labour   costs"    would    damage

Singapore's   congenial   climate   for    foreign

investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very recent example of such an unhealthy

attitude  of  some  employers, is  the  atavistic

reaction   of   their   representatives   in   the

International   Chamber  of   Commerce   and   the

Singapore    Employers'    Federation    to    the

Government's, proposal to set up a national  wage

council  as reported in the Straits Times on  14th

July,  1971.  One  of  them  re-marked  that   the

Government  had its, own idea of the  council.  By

that  remark,.  I take it to mean that  he  had  a

different  idea  of  what the council  should  be.

Another employers' representative piously remarked

that  "If  the wage increases were kept  in  hand,

there  would  be  no inflationary effect."  Before

even   considering  what  constitute   fair   wage

increases, they are already sounding a warning  on

the  inflationary  effects of wage  increases.  In

yesterday's  Straits Times,  a  spokesman  of  the

International Chamber of Commerce was reported  to

have  said  that  the  proposed  telephone  rental

increase  would only tend to "narrow the  area  of

manoeuvre   for   wage   increases".   Both    the

International   Chamber  of   Commerce   and   the

Singapore Employers' Federation represent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



some  of  the  most  successful employers  in  the

Republic,   many   of  whom  are  not   Singapore-incorporated  firms. Their reactions  and  remarks

are significant in that they betray the reluctance

of  some employers to grant a fair share of  their

substantial profits to their employees. The  irony

of  it all is that even if the trade unions manage

to squeeze an additional one or two months' salary

from  such  employers, the latter  would  have  no

hesitation  in passing the bill to the  consumers,

who include the workers. As a matter of fact, wage

increases can be easily met out of the substantial

profits of the employers even without steps  being

taken  to  streamline and modernise the prevailing

set-up  and operations of the various enterprises.

It  goes without saying, of course, that a prudent

employer  would  be  expected  to  take  all   the

necessary steps to reduce production and operation

costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is meaningless for workers to regard

themselves  as  partners with the  Government  and

employers  in Singapore's progress and  prosperity

when  the  employers make it a point  to  preclude

them from having a fair share of the fruits of the

prosperity to which they have greatly contributed.

The  problem today is one of educating some of our

tight-fisted  employers to realise  the  folly  of

their persistent refusal to see beyond their  nose

that  their true interest must necessarily lie  in

the fair treatment of their workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic growth, some degree of

inflationary   effect  is  inevitable.   What   is

important is that the rate of inflation should  be

kept  to  the lowest level possible. Inflation  in

our  Republic  thus far, unlike inflation  in  the

highly  developed countries of the world,  is  not

due  to  wage increases. Wage levels in  Singapore

have    remained   remarkably   stable   over    a

considerable  period of time. On the  other  hand,

the  same  comment  cannot be made  of  the  price

levels in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months, there have been rampant

increases  in the prices of consumer goods,  which

are very often



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



unjustified price-hikes and profiteering  by  some

unscrupulous traders and shopkeepers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These runaway price increases are bound to upset

not  only  wage stability, but also cause  genuine

hardships,  particularly to families in  the  low-income  group. We must not forget that  there  are

some  120,000 workers employed both in the private

and  public sectors whose take-home pay per  month

is  between $100 and $200, and many of  them  have

families  to  support. They are the  persons  most

affected by any increase in the cost of living, no

matter how slight. And these persons form the bulk

of   our   factory  workers,  without   whom   our

industrial  growth would not have  been  possible;

our  Division  IV civil servants  and  our  public

daily-rated  employees, without whom  our  streets

would not be clean, and the Public Utilities Board

and  the  Housing and Development Board would  not

function efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, therefore, that one of the

urgent  tasks before the Government is  to  uplift

the  social conditions of the low-income group  of

workers.  I hope that after assessing the  effects

of   the   British  run-down  in  May  1972,   the

Government will pay particular attention  to  them

in  the  general review of the wage policy.  Apart

from  any general wage increases for them,  active

steps must be taken to initiate schemes to improve

and upgrade their skills in order to enlarge their

earning capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hawkers and taxi drivers also make up the

lower  strata of our society. Unless they  find  a

stake  in Singapore's prosperity, they are  likely

to pose a social problem in the years to come. The

Government  must  be  congratulated  on  proposing

steps recently to improve the lot of such persons.

I refer to the proposal to allocate $5 million for

the acquisition of land in a pilot scheme to build

clean  and  attractive  footstall  complexes   for

renting  out  on  a subsidised basis.  Apart  from

providing  cheap and wholesome meals, the  hawkers

can  look  forward to better business in  view  of

their cleaner and more attractive stalls.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support given by the Government to the

N.T.U.C, has  enabled it to run a  transport  co-operative  (COMFORT)  with the  purchase  of  some

1,000  taxis  and  200 mini-buses  for  our  taxi-drivers  and  mini-bus drivers. The COMFORT  taxis

and  mini-buses not only help to provide  improved

transport services, but also enable the respective

operators  to  be  owners of the taxis  and  mini-buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the question of the shortage of

labour. The importation of foreign labour to  meet

the  labour shortage is fraught with all kinds  of

implications and may be inimical to the  long-term

interests  of  Singapore.  Though  I  accept   the

rationale  that  the  present shortage  of  labour

being   experienced  by  our  factories,  if   not

counteracted   as  speedily  as  possible,   would

slacken the pace of our industrial expansion, I am

of  the  view that we should not be contented  now

that  the  importation of foreign labour seems  to

have  resolved  the labour shortage  problem.  The

present  shortage  of labour  should  serve  as  a

timely  reminder to us of the urgent need to  make

constructive  plans for the future  regarding  the

maximum utilisation of our own human resources for

our  manpower  requirements.  The  importation  of

foreign labour is at best a short-term solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps some scheme may be devised for the

employment   of   a  greater  number   of   women,

especially housewives, in factories. The  validity

of  the  old saying, "A woman's place  is  in  the

home",  has  already been disputed by the  women's

liberation  movement.  In  industrially   advanced

countries,  women  have abandoned  the  chores  of

housework  and taken to employment in the  offices

and  factories. The departure from the traditional

concept  of  the role of women is in keeping  with

the  concept  of  "fraternity,  liberty,  equality

(with  man)", and is also rewarding  in  terms  of

enhancing the family income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we find many of our married women

working in offices, schools, hospitals, and so on,

but  they  come largely from the middle-income  or

upper middle-income groups. They are usually well-educated as their jobs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



demand that of them. They get domestic help to  do

the  chores of housework and the caring  of  their

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the housewives from the lower

income  homes, however, is different. They  cannot

afford to hire domestic help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many clean factories now sited in housing

estates providing job opportunities, steps  should

be taken to encourage the housewives living nearby

to seek employment in the factories. One such step

is   the  building  of  more  creches  in  housing

estates. Perhaps tax incentives could be given  to

factories   requiring  large  numbers  of   female

workers to encourage them to build creches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our more enterprising Singaporeans

should  be encouraged to establish laundrettes  in

housing  estates to provide cheap laundry services

with the use of washing machines. With the creches

to  look after their children and laundry services

to  look after their laundry, many housewives will

be  freed from their household chores and  enabled

to  find  suitable employment in nearby factories.

By doing so, they will help to increase the income

of  their  families and improve  the  standard  of

living  of their families. At the same time,  they

are  making a useful contribution to the  economic

development of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government, as an employer,

will not forget the civil service in its review of

the  wage policy next year. The role of the  civil

service  in  the  socio-economic  development   of

Singapore has been both significant and vital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the problem of brain drain from

the civil service to the private sector because of

greater  rewards offered, perhaps  the  Government

can  take  one  positive measure  to  counter  the

attraction of the private sector, that is, a home-ownership scheme of Government-built houses.  With

the   Government's  considerable   experience   in

housing programmes, I am sure that Government  can

build comparatively cheap houses and sell them  to

deserving  civil servants at cost as an inducement

to them to remain in the civil service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to comment, from my own personal

observation,    that   the   various    Government

Ministries  and  departments  seem  to  be  poorly

served  in the field of public relations. The  sum

total  of  public relations efforts of  Government

Ministries  and  departments  seems  to   be   the

employment  of  a public relations  officer  whose

sole  function seems to be the drafting of replies

to letters of complaints in the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely public relations, which constitute an

important   aspect   of   modern   and   efficient

management  and organisation, should be  conducted

on  a  more constructive and effective basis. This

is  all the more important from the point of  view

of the Government in that it is both desirable and

necessary to obtain the support of the public  for

the  policies of the Government through the better

understanding of such policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is vital that Government should give more

attention and make efforts to improving its public

relations activities, as what is at stake  is  the

public  image  of the Ministries,  departments  or

statutory boards concerned. It is not my intention

to  cast  any aspersion or slur on the  fine  work

done  by the serving public relations officers  in

the  various  Ministries. What I am suggesting  is

that  more  funds should be allocated  for  public

relations  work  so that the necessary  staff  and

facilities  can  be obtained for effective  public

relations efforts.



<br><br>3.05p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications (Mr Phua Bah Lee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, our Republic, like all countries new and old,

has  to  face problems of rapid change.  Singapore

has made great progress since its independence six

years   ago.  We  are  happy  and  proud  of   our

considerable progress in the spheres  of  economy,

politics,  social  welfare,  trade  and  industry.

Without  a stable government and a strong  economy

we  will not be able to make the progress which we

have now achieved. We might then be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



in  serious  trouble, faced with a  growing  young

population, rising unemployment and social unrest.

But  with fast progress come the problems of rapid

change,  and  our  people  have  to  face  various

inconveniences, such as being cleared  from  sites

required  for redevelopment, for example, schools,

hospitals,  new  roads, impounding reservoirs  and

airport extension. People have to be uprooted from

their homes and moved to new satellite towns. They

have  to  adapt  themselves  quickly  to  the  new

environment and mode of living. The petty  traders

and   part-time  farmers  have  to  change   their

professions  and trades in order to fit  into  the

new  environment.  But,  nevertheless,  all  these

changes are made for the good of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of us would like to see a backward

Singapore.   We   all  want  a   progressive   and

flourishing  Singapore. To achieve  this,  we  all

have to put in effort and make sacrifices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tampines Constituency is now very much affected

by  the Paya Lebar Airport extension programme for

the  jumbo jets and the complete British  pull-out

at the end of 1971. The Government, though firm in

its  policy, has also shown humanity in  enforcing

it.   The   affected  families  of   my   Tampines

constituents  fully  realise  the  importance   of

development in a country seeking to progress. This

is evidenced by the development of slum areas into

modern housing estates and industrial sites. Those

of   my   constituents   who   are   affected   by

redevelopment are very grateful to the  Government

for   its  generous  compensation  and  ex  gratia

payments  under the new revised rates as announced

by  the Minister for National Development on  20th

July, 1971.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constituents of Tampines know that there is

no  alternative but to extend Paya Lebar  Airport.

They  hope  that  by their little contribution  in

clearing  from  their homes, Paya  Lebar  Airport,

when fully developed, could form an important link

in the chain of major airports around the world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 3,500 families are affected by the

Airport   extension  project,   expected   to   be

completed  by 1975. Some families have  taken  the

opportunity to purchase Housing Board flats in the

Kallang  Basin and Toa Payoh with the compensation

ex   gratia   payment   and  transport   allowance

received,  in  keeping  with  Government's   home-ownership scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board, I understand,

will  be  building about 2,000 units of flats  and

industrial workshops for light industries  at  the

7th  milestone, Tampines Road. I am positive  that

the  Housing  and Development Board will  complete

construction of the flats well before  the  target

date  so that the displaced persons can get  their

alternative accommodation in time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good government always has the welfare of its

citizens  at  heart.  Though  our  Government   is

engaged   in   affairs  of  state   and   in   the

strengthening of our industrial sinews, it has not

forgotten  for  one  moment  the  welfare  of  its

citizens, in particular the rural folk. The  Urban

and  Rural  Services Committee  and  the  Projects

Committee  have been set up to provide facilities,

amenities  and services to all the constituencies.

Large  sums of money have been spent on  essential

facilities  like supplying electricity  direct  to

individual homes in the rural areas, making up  of

roads  to kampong standard, installation of water-mains in order that clean pipe water can reach all

the  houses, erection of bridges, construction and

repair of drains to prevent flooding, and building

of  jetties for the islanders. As I have said, all

these   projects  and  services  have   cost   the

Government many millions of dollars, but they have

succeeded  in  bringing a brighter life  and  much

convenience to the villagers. However,  there  are

many  more  laterite  roads  to  be  metalled  and

repaired  in the rural areas and numerous kampongs

to  be  lighted up, and a large sum  of  money  is

needed to do this. The rural tracks cannot just be

metalled  within  a short time, so  the  villagers

will   have   to   put  up  with  this   temporary

inconvenience until more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



funds are available to accomplish this objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that

nowadays we are prone to jump on the civil service

for  whatever  offences they are alleged  to  have

committed.  The civil servants are always  at  the

receiving end. In fairness and in justice to them,

let  us  first  make  certain of  our  information

before  we  point an accusing finger at our  loyal

civil  service which is, as a matter of fact,  one

of  the  most efficient in this region. They  have

acquitted themselves very well in the past and  it

is  my  hope  and belief that they  will  maintain

their  high  standard of discipline and efficiency

in the future. Just as there are a few black sheep

in  every flock, so it is not unusual to find some

in  the  civil service. Let us weed them out,  but

let  not  the civil service as a whole be  branded

because of the misdeeds of a few.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  at  the  outset to  congratulate  the

President  on  his  realistic  appraisal  of   the

situation which this nation can expect to face  in

the  coming  years  ahead in  his  speech  to  the

Members of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After six years of hard work by our people and

our  Government  to ensure the viability  of  this

nation,  we  have on record proof  of  commendable

achievements  in  almost  every  sphere   of   our

nation's development. We have also succeeded  even

to  the  extent of over-achieving in some spheres,

especially  in economic development  and  tackling

unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the six years since our independence, the

nation's  Gross Domestic Product has  jumped  from

$3,043  million  in  1965 to $5,564.5  million  in

1970,  while  the  birth rate  has  been  severely

checked  and population growth has greatly  slowed

down. Our annual economic growth rate stands at 15

per  cent  since the last count in 1970, which  is

well above the generally accepted take-off rate of

10  per cent, which indicates an economy as having

succeeded



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



in achieving developing status. In 1965, Singapore

had  an unemployment figure of some 65,000. Today,

we are in the realm of full employment with labour

shortage  in  certain industries in spite  of  the

issue  of  some 55,800 work permits to allow  non-citizens to work in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our achievement in the past, which has

brought  this  nation  its present  stability  and

affluence,  is  no  guarantee of  a  rosy  future.

Singapore is and will be as vulnerable as  it  was

six   years  ago  if  new  and  serious   problems

confronting  it  from within and without  are  not

tackled  effectively. Singaporeans should  not  be

gullible  and  soft-headed  in  respect  of  these

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government of late has had to take

certain  hard-headed  and unpleasant  measures  in

dealing  with some of these problems. Singaporeans

should rightly take their cue from this policy and

intensify  their  own  efforts  in  combating  the

destructive  forces  from within  and  without  by

containing and isolating them. In the meantime, no

effort   should  be  spared  in  promoting   other

positive measures to enhance the self-reliance and

cohesiveness of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that of late there has

been  an insidious campaign by certain mass  media

and  racialists to create unrest and  instability,

through  exploitation of race and language  issues

and  the promotion of destructive forms of Western

permissive  philosophies.  One  English  newspaper

during  the  last months of its existence  did  in

fact  succeed  to  a  certain extent  in  arousing

emotionally the feelings of a small section of our

people  over  inconclusive  issues  like  freedom,

rights  of  the  newspapers, and a host  of  other

abstractions    related   to   decadent    Western

permissiveness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the recent steps taken by the

Government have undoubtedly thwarted the growth of

this    cankerous   development,   some   scathing

criticisms have been made of the ruling  party  by

individuals or groups representing a small



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



section  of the opposition to the effect that  the

P.A.P, has  become  dictatorial  and  that   the

Republic   has  become  a  one-party   state   and

intolerant of any opposition. However, the  common

man,  who  periodically reviews his early decision

and continues to send the P.A.P, to Parliament, is

unlikely  to hesitate to question the  motives  of

this   motley  crowd,  who  represent   none   but

themselves in airing such views with no  relevance

to reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is indeed a touch of humour when we are

informed  that  those  who  forfeit  deposits   in

general   elections   and  by-elections   despatch

memoranda to Buckingham Palace complaining of  the

alleged  absence  of democracy  in  Singapore.  It

might  perhaps  provide merriment to  Her  Majesty

over  the  breakfast table to  read  such  amusing

messages  from one of her ex-colonial possessions,

especially  when  most  of  John  Bull's  previous

possessions are steadily resorting to one-man rule

through not infrequent coup d'etats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are vociferously expressing their

"displeasure"  in the emergence of  "dictatorship"

in Singapore basically consist of three groups. In

the  first  category, you can spot the individuals

who  have  been defeated in general elections  and

thus deprived of the opportunity to warm the seats

of  Parliament. The second group are those who  do

not  subscribe to democracy but believe  in  their

own   concept   of  "people's  democracy",   which

obviously  refers to a one-party state.  The  last

group  applies  to those who, while hesitating  to

step  forward to meet the challenges of democracy,

content  themselves by giving frequent  advice  to

all and sundry on how to conduct themselves, while

completely  ignoring their own  responsibility  to

society  and  the nation. They are the "escapists"

who  live  in a world of their own creation  while

not  hesitating to provide frequent "intellectual"

solutions  to the political and economic  ills  of

the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a few pertinent questions are directed

towards  this minority group, it would  thoroughly

expose  them  as  men with ambition  but  with  no

substantial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



support  from any section of the population.  What

exactly  do they expect from the P.A.P.? Are  they

suggesting  for  a  moment  that  those  who   are

defeated  in elections and others who hesitate  to

face  the  electorate should be  invited  to  take

their   seats   in  Parliament?  Do  they   demand

constitutional changes to that effect? If not,  in

what  other  manner do they seek accommodation  in

our  political set-up? Further, how best  do  they

expect  the  P.A.P, to assist  another  political

organisation  within  our  democratic   framework,

especially when that party has expressed no belief

in true democracy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to touch on the Education

Ministry. Despite the commendable proposals of the

Ministry   contained  in  the  addendum   to   the

President's  speech  to  improve  the  quality  of

education    through   increased    emphasis    on

bilingualism,  technical  training  and   a   more

flexible system to meet individual student  needs,

I  remain  unconvinced that these noble objectives

can  be  achieved without an efficient and  highly

motivated teaching force. The bulk of our teachers

today  are  far from motivated, a good  number  of

them  far  from efficient, and will remain  so  if

they are not adequately rewarded for the important

and  arduous role which they are expected to  play

in educating the young of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education seems to have realised

this  problem by its recent attempt to revise  the

salaries  of teachers, although by some mysterious

act, it has not mentioned this in the addendum  to

the  President's speech. Perhaps it fights shy  of

the fact that its proposed wage revision scheme is

ineffectual and no more than a mere token.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an analysis of the wage revision for

teachers  by  the Education Ministry would  reveal

that  there  is no immediate incentive  whatsoever

conducive  to  attracting  and  promoting   higher

standards  of  performance in  the  ranks  of  the

teaching profession, especially in respect of  the

ordinary  teachers. What should be given to  these

teachers should be immediate benefits in the  form

of higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



salaries   comparable  to  the   best   in   other

Government   establishments   and   not   marginal

increases  in their maximum pay over an  increased

timescale    period,, which    is    the    main

characteristic  of  the Education  Ministry's  so-called salary revision scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also particularly perturbed by the

illogical  distribution of  remuneration  in  this

salary  revision wherein the small group of senior

assistants  and  principals  are  given  immediate

salary  increases while the bulk of  the  ordinary

teachers, especially those in the primary schools,

are  not given an additional cent. This is  indeed

ironical  when we realise that it is the rank  and

file   teachers  who  really  perform  the  actual

function  of teaching, while the senior assistants

and  principals are mere arm-chair administrators,

and  that  it  is  the teaching  standard  of  the

ordinary teachers that we seek to improve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I submit that the Education

Ministry  should  re-study  its  proposed   salary

revision  scheme so as to provide a more equitable

and  effective  salary  structure  to  generate  a

higher  standard of performance among the teachers

directly  responsible  for the  education  of  our

young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish also to touch on other problems

confronting  Singapore which, if  not  effectively

handled, will seriously threaten the stability and

progress of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the Government's urban renewal

programme has inflicted considerable economic  and

social  hardships on those sections of our  people

who  have  been affected by it. A large proportion

of  these  people are small businessmen,  workers,

petty   traders   and  farmers  who   find   their

livelihood  and traditional environment threatened

by the upheaval of urban renewal. However, while I

believe that a certain amount of sacrifice for the

good  of  the  country should be forthcoming  from

these  people, I feel that the Government is  duty

bound  to act judicially in the interest of  these

people.  I  must  commend the Government  for  its

intention to increase the rate of compensation to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



property owners affected by urban renewal schemes.

I  wish,  however,  to bring to  the  Government's

attention  the  plight `of the tenant  shopkeepers

and   the   petty  traders  who  find   themselves

gradually  pushed out of the streets  where  their

source  of livelihood comes from. As these  people

are considerable in number, especially in the city

areas, I am in favour of the Government setting up

a  permanent  body to look after the  resettlement

problems  of these people. Hitherto, the piecemeal

efforts  of different Government departments  like

the  H.D.B.,  the  Hawkers' Department,  etc.,  to

resettle   these  people  have   been   far   from

satisfactory,  as complaints of  high  rentals  or

alternative  Government  accommodation  and  other

problems  abound.  Among the  matters  which  this

proposed  body  can look into are  more  `economic

rentals for the poorer classes in H.D.B, flats and

a  longer  period  of  rent subsidies  for  tenant

shopkeepers   provided  with  alternative   H.D.B.

accommodation for their shops. This body can  also

seriously  look into the possibility of  providing

alternative  employment  and  controlled   hawking

sites  for  those petty hawkers who are  gradually

taken  off  the  streets  as  a  result  of  urban

renewal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in short, I am for the establishment of a

permanent body to minimise the hardship  of  those

affected   by  our  urban  renewal  programme   in

whatever way the Government can afford to do. Such

a body, I believe, can more effectively handle the

present  and future resettlement problems  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to touch on the very

important issues of defence and foreign policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in agreement with the Foreign Affairs

addendum  that our foreign policy in the past  has

been relatively inward-looking out of necessity to

ensure  domestic stability and to aid  Singapore's

economic  and industrial development. I  do  agree

that  we  should  in the future be  more  outward-looking   by   reacting   more   consciously   and

realistically  to  bigger  power  and  super-power

manoeuvres



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



in  the Pacific region. Perhaps we may  have

already begun in this direction by our efforts  in

promoting regional co-operation through ASEAN  and

the Five-Nation Defence Pact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, while foreign

diplomacy  is an important weapon in ensuring  our

sovereignty, it is my belief that in the  ultimate

analysis  reliance  on our own ability  to  defend

ourselves will be the decisive factor in  deciding

whether  we keep or lose our sovereignty, in  this

respect,  there is much for us to learn  from  the

recent development in relations between Washington

and   Peking  and  in  the  revelations  from  the

Pentagon Papers Affair. Although the Taiwanese and

Vietnamese today have their own Governments,  they

do  not have sovereignty over themselves, as  they

are  not in a position to decide what their future

will  be.  They lack the ultimate weapon of  self-reliance, and their future will be decided between

Washington  and  Peking  in  accordance  with  the

convenience    of   these   two   super    powers.

Singaporeans  must realise that  Singapore  should

not be trapped in a similar situation if they wish

to  continue to live with respect and  dignity  in

the  future. They should ensure that we  have  our

own  defence force capable of ultimately defending

our  own  sovereignty, and not  allow  some  other

foreign  powers  to  take charge.  We  should  not

expect  any  foreign powers to  intervene  on  our

behalf  in  the  case  of any armed  conflict.  No

foreign  power will be in the least interested  to

help  us unless its own interest is at stake. Some

Members  in  this House may have  read  about  the

Pentagon  Papers in the June 28th  issue  of  Time

magazine.  For the benefit of those who have  not,

they  may  be surprised to learn that a  top  U.S.

official in the Johnson Administration was  quoted

as having expressed U.S, objectives in the Vietnam

War  in  the following order: "70 per cent  -X  to

avoid  a humiliating U.S, defeat, 20 per cent  -to

keep  South Vietnam territory from Chinese  hands,

and  10  per cent - to permit the people of  South

Vietnam to enjoy a better, freer way of life."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, serves to sum up the

moral  of my argument, that self-reliance  should

underlie our defence and foreign policies.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise in support of the motion moved by the

Member  for Ulu Pandan in thanking the  President

for  his speech delivered at the opening  of  the

Second Session of the Second Parliament recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to speak on

subjects  that  my colleagues here  have  already

touched on. What I would like to talk about today

is some aspects of urban living in Singapore that

may tend to escape our more immediate notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of our people will be living in

high-rise  flats  by  1975.  During  the   family

planning  campaign organised  last  year  by  the

Family  Planning Board, I had the opportunity  of

observing  life  in several of  the  Housing  and

Development Board estates. I noticed that  nearly

all  the  large families living in  H.D.B, flats

were  from the lower income level, in the  H.D.B.

one-room  flats,  for  example,  the  number   of

occupants averaged, strangely enough, some six to

eight  people. Most of these people  were  either

resettled families affected by clearance  schemes

or   those  dependent  for  their  livelihood  on

hawking  or  other low-paid jobs such  as  manual

labour  and lorry driving. If we do not  want  to

see  our  H.D.B, estates degenerate  into  slums

because of this kind of overcrowding, our  people

must  be  made to understand the vital importance

of  family  planning, the need to keep  a  family

small  in  order to maintain a high  standard  of

living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore eradicate the old concept

that  large  families are a sign  of  prosperity.

Large  families, more often than  not,  mean  low

family  income, with the parents having  to  work

extra  hard  to  supplement their finances.  This

will   automatically  mean   that   very   little

attention is paid to the children, and this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



could lead to a drop in the quality of education,

at  a  time when education is all-important to  a

young  and vigorous Republic determined to  speed

ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adapting to life in high-rise flats -which has

become the order of the day-- is but one aspect

of adapting to urbanisation and modernisation,

which is inevitable in our society. Traditional

practices which hinder progress have to be

discarded and new achievement-orientated values

imbued, especially in our young. All citizens

should be motivated to reach the top.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To press purposefully on to our goals, it is

imperative that we infuse a spirit of oneness,  a

sense of cohesiveness, in our people. Working for

a   common   objective  will  help   create   the

harmonious society we are striving for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacrifice" is the key word in this context.

Those   people   who   have  been   affected   by

reclamation  schemes have to  sacrifice  for  the

sake  of the whole population. The Government  is

quite  aware  of  the hardship  and  difficulties

posed  by resettlement. These are being minimised

as  far  as  possible. The rate for  resettlement

compensation  has been increased,  for  instance.

But  we  cannot  please everybody.  Some  of  the

people  will  always have to sacrifice  something

for the sake of the common good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have to be outward looking, not

inward-looking. We must not become too Singapore-centred.   We  should  strive  to  be  aware   of

situations   in   other   countries.    Comparing

standards  of  living,  Singaporeans  should   be

thankful for what they have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True leadership, not only political leadership

but   leadership  at  all  levels,  can   greatly

facilitate    the   process   of   modernisation.

Singapore  leaders  must be  problem-solvers  and

reformers, understanding the problems around them

and helping the people reorientate their thinking

and  adopt  correct  attitudes  to  new  ways  of

living.   Grass-roots  organisations   like   the

Citizens'   Consultative   Committees   and   the

community centres can help a great deal  in  this

respect, for they serve as a very useful and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



profitable liaison between the Government and the

people.   Once   we   accept   the   fact    that

modernisation is inevitable and adaptation is our

only  course of action, we will really begin  our

progress.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the President

rightly said in his policy speech on the 21st  of

July  that  most of our people have accepted  the

realities  of  life in present-day Singapore  and

that  their  approach  to problems  is  generally

practical  and tolerant. Sir, we, the  people  of

Singapore,  are  indeed glad to hear  these  most

encouraging and rewarding words. Tributes are due

to  our people for their understanding, tolerance

and  support without which no government, however

efficient  it is, can successfully implement  its

policies.  The sacrifices of our people  for  the

sake of the country's progress and well-being are

enormous.  It is appropriate now that  we  should

place on record the tremendous contribution  that

our   people   have   made  to  our   present-day

prosperity.  During the last  six  years  of  our

independence, we have shown, beyond any doubt  to

the  world, that although we are a small  nation,

we have the capacity and determination to live as

a people, survive and continue to prosper. We set

down  our  aim  to transform our  once  disparate

community   into   a  modern  and  industrialised

nation. This is by no means an easy task, and yet

we  have achieved in these six years what it took

some advanced countries half a century or more to

attain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From now on, we have to set our aims even

higher. To achieve this, it is imperative that we

should  be  viable in defence and stable  in  our

internal  security. This is critically  necessary

for we are only assured of stability and security

for a few more years under the Commonwealth Five-Power Defence arrangement. After this, we will be

by  ourselves.  We  should  always  remain  alert

politically, and invulnerable in our defence.  No

subversion from within or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



aggression from without can ever rend us asunder.

We  either survive or disintegrate. Our choice is

to survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now turn to our water resources which

affect  our  very survival. It is  heartening  to

note  that  the  Public Utilities Board  will  be

taking  measures to develop our water  resources.

Short of this effort, we will not be able to cope

up  with  demand  of  the growing  population.  I

endorse  the  views  of my  two  colleagues,  the

Members  for Anson and Bukit Panjang, who earlier

in the House suggested to open up new reservoirs,

or  to  enlarge  the existing ones.  I  would  go

further to suggest that more catchments should be

created  to collect rainfall that goes  into  our

network  of drainage in the city area.  The  rain

water  so collected can then be pumped and  drawn

through  pipes into reservoirs. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

you  are  aware  that most of  the  rainfall  has

fallen underground through bare soil in the rural

areas.   We  should  therefore  look   into   the

feasibility of tapping water resources  that  can

be  found in abundant supply underground. We  can

open  up wells on a large scale and draw  up  the

spring water to supplement our shortage of water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retrenched civilian employees have

become   a  problem  which  needs  our  immediate

attention  in  the next few months. I  understand

that  the  Government has taken steps  to  absorb

them  into alternative employment in the  various

Government  departments. There is the problem  of

finding  them jobs of equivalent posts  with  pay

similar  to  what they received during employment

with the British military establishments. Most of

these  employees  have reached their  mid-forties

and  have  still to support their minor children.

Lesser   pay  in  their  new  jobs  will   create

financial  hardship. One solution to assist  them

to  earn more money would be to allow them to  do

part-time  work  outside  their  jobs.  This   is

normally  not  allowed if  they  are  taken  into

Government  departments. Sir, the P.U.B, is  now

facing   a   shortage  of  meter   readers,   and

employment of more meter readers will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



inevitably increase their operational costs.  May

I  suggest that the P.U.B, consider a proposal of

offering these retrenched civilian employees part-time  work  in meter reading. 1 am sure  some  of

them will he willing to earn extra income to make

up  the deficit in their earnings. I do not  wish

to  attempt to work out how the scheme should  be

carried out, and I shall leave it to the PUB, to

consider  its feasibility. Perhaps such part-time

work  can be carried out on weekends and  in  the

area near the homes of the part-time workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I conclude by expressing my full support

and  appreciation  of the policy  speech  by  our

President.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before the P.A.P.

took  office  in  1959, there were  only  300,000

children   in  schools,  and  the  privilege   of

education  was  limited only to a lucky  few.  In

less  than a decade, this Government has  ensured

every  child  a place in school and 10  years  of

education.  Today, the question is no longer  the

provision  of  sufficient places  in  school  for

children,  hut the emphasis is on the improvement

of  the  quality of education. As stated  in  the

addendum to the President's speech at the opening

of   this   Parliament,  this   Government   will

concentrate  its  efforts on  developing  a  more

flexible  education system and  curriculum,  with

particular emphasis on language teaching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Jurong has certain

reservations about this, and I would like to take

this  opportunity to clarify a few points.  First

of  all, let me assure him and the House that the

emphasis   on   language   teaching   does    not

necessarily  mean it will be done at the  expense

of   other  subjects.  On  the  other  hand,  the

teaching  of other subjects is to supplement  the

teaching  of language. What we try to achieve  is

to  have all lessons being considered as language

lessons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes that have been taking place in

the revision of the curriculum have been done  in

the closest consultation with the Teachers' Union

and  those  in  the  teaching profession.  1  can

assure  the House, especially the Members in  the

teaching  service, that there will be  continuous

and close consultations with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah raised the question of

the salary structure for the teaching service. Mr

Speaker, Sir, I could hardly disagree with him on

the importance of a motivated teaching force. But

1  wonder  if financial remuneration is the  only

criterion   for   motivation  in   the   teaching

profession. I would like to refer him to the very

successful  seminar organised this  year  by  the

Singapore  Teachers' Union. I  think  it  is  the

general  consensus that the bargaining  power  of

the  teaching  profession is in  the  display  of

their  professional expertise,  and  not  in  the

constant  moaning of self-pity. The  negotiations

between  the Ministry and the unions are  on  the

restructuring of the salary scales  to  iron  out

certain anomalies. I fail to understand what gave

him  the  impression that only a certain selected

group  of  senior assistants and  principals  are

being  promoted. The principle of the new  salary

scale is to enable teachers to be promoted within

their  own ranks. In fact, I could hardly  answer

any   more   of   his   questions   because   the

negotiations have not yet been finalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Jurong also raised the

question  of  the  long  queues  at  schools.  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  I  would  like  to   take   this

opportunity to emphasise two facts:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There are more Primary 1 places than are

required.  For  1972, there will he  over  60,000

Primary   I  places  for  the  estimated   51,000

children seeking admission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For last year, 95 per cent of the parents

obtained places for their children in schools  of

their  own  choice. There is therefore no  reason

for him to believe that it will be any worse this

year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These facts have been reported by most of the

local  newspapers recently, and it is most amazing

how the Member for Jurong, who is the President of

the  Singapore  Chinese  Middle  School  Teachers'

Union and a teacher himself, could be ignorant  of

these   facts.   Perhaps   the   temptation    for

sensationalism and publicity is irresistible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact that there are long

queues at the schools for registering children  in

Primary   I   classes  is  the   most   perplexing

phenomenon.  Let me quote an example.  Last  year.

after  parents  had queued for many  days  to  get

places in Primary 1 classes for their children  at

the   Raffles   Girls'  School,   an   established

Government  English  primary  school,  there  were

still  12  vacancies remaining at the end  of  the

registration  exercise.  Perhaps  the  Member  for

Jurong would like to send his sympathies to  those

who  had queued up for the seven days. At the same

time,  for the other established schools, such  as

Chong  Pun Girls' School, which has an average  of

96  per cent P.S.L.E, passes for many years,  and,

for  that  matter,  Nan Chiau  School,  there  are

hardly any queues at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An analysis of the background of the primary

schools   attended  by  this  year's   President's

scholars  could be very interesting. Of  the  nine

scholars,  seven received their primary  education

in  Singapore,  of whom three are from  Government

schools,  and four from Government-aided  schools.

Of  these  four,  three are from  Government-aided

Chinese  schools,  and one from a Government-aided

English  school.  This school and another  Chinese

school  are  the only schools in the  list  having

long queues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this phenomenon of queuing up

for  registration at the schools is not a new one.

It   has   occurred  year  after  year.   We   are

considering   various   alternatives,   such    as

registration   by   balloting, and   registration

limited   only   to   children   living   in   the

neighbourhood of the schools. But we believe that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



whatever  measure we take cannot  do  better  than

satisfy 95 per cent of the people.



<br><br>3.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo):</b> And so, Mr

Speaker, Sir, this debate has arrived at  a  point

when  I  rise  to  make  a  few  comments  on  the

President's  speech  in  support  of  the   motion

standing in the name of the Member for Ulu Pandan.

1  believe  I  am  the last speaker,  Sir,  but  I

certainly hope not the least.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate on the President's speech at this

time is opportune, for our plans to stabilise  our

nation  in  the future are being made at  a  point

which  allows  us  an honest appreciation  of  our

successes  and shortcomings in the past decade  of

the  `60s, and a vision of the challenges and  the

prospects  which the new decade of the  `70s  hold

for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In suggesting our political, economic and social

efforts  for  the `70s, hon. Members  have  ranged

expansively  over the addenda to  the  President's

speech  and  dealt  with  refinements  of  foreign

policy,    hospitals    and   public    utilities,

employment,  hawkers  and  education,  daily-rated

workers,  cost  of living and our  psychedellistic

youth,  quality control, black ops  and  community

centres,  industrialisation, profitable recreation

and  price  hikes, land acquisition,  occupational

diseases and family planning, and a host of  other

matters including the freedom of the press, all of

which  our responsible Government must necessarily

and  successfully manage for the  benefit  of  the

people of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that anyone who has followed this

session through the five days of debate will agree

with  me  that we have quite a job to do. But  the

leadership of the People's Action Party  will  not

be found wanting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the `60s, there was the task of establishing

the  basis  of our economy and security.  We  have

done that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the `70s, there is the task of shaping our

country  and  people  into  a  strong,  coherent,

sovereign nation. We will do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members speaking before me have made thorough

analyses  of the political, economic  and  social

situations  which confront us. I do not  wish  to

add  yet  another.  But I wish to  underline  two

imperatives  which,  in the last  analysis,  will

determine the outcome of all our efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first imperative is the collective

commitment  of the people to nation building.  It

is  highly imperative that every single  body  in

the  Republic make a contribution to  the  common

good  - from  the business tycoon to  the  busmen;

from  the company director to the charwalla; from

the    historiographer   to   the   hawker.   The

contribution should be by constructive action, or

even  by constructive inaction, such as not using

water  unnecessarily. The decade before  us  must

not   recede   into   history  without   singular

achievement on our part. To that segment  of  our

disinclined youth I say the biggest and  grandest

happening in the country is nation building.  Why

not be in with it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second imperative is silent but implicit in

the voluminous addenda to the President's speech.

It  is  the  quality of our human resources  upon

which  the achievement of all the plans  that  it

describes is contingent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven score and ten years ago, our forefathers

came  to  this  little island, dedicated  to  the

proposition  that nobody owes anybody  a  living,

and  the  good life is got out of sheer toil  and

tenacity  of  purpose. The world  then  was  less

complicated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are a sovereign nation in a community

of  sovereign  nations whose interaction  between

and  among  themselves is determined by multiword

considerations,  the  least  of  which   is   our

national  welfare.  We, the  descendants  of  our

forefathers, stand upon the conviction today that

no  nation  owes us a living. The prospect  of  a

good   life   for  ourselves  and  our   children

therefore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



depends on the quality of our physical and  moral

strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Mr Speaker, Sir, as I see it, the years

ahead will demand of us, the people of Singapore,

unfailing   stamina,   ready   competence,   grim

determination,   unflinching  courage,   re1iabIX

shrewdness and endearing compassion if we are  to

measure up to the task and dangers which await us

in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting it all more colloquially but bluntly, we

must  have the four Gs, namely, the Go, the Grit,

the  Guts and the Goodness. We have shown in  the

past  that  we have these qualities and  we  must

continue  to manifest these qualities to  succeed

in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we will succeed, Sir, because we can

succeed,  because we must succeed  and  we  shall

succeed.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was so

refreshing listening to the last speaker  that  I

think 1 need hardly wind up this debate. But if I

choose  to  remain silent, Members will  go  away

with  no  replies  to  their  questions  on   the

Ministry of National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, may I, as Leader of the House, thank all

Members  who  have  taken part  in  this  debate,

especially  the  Backbenchers.  Some   of   their

criticisms  were constructive, some were  not  so

constructive,  but  none  were  destructive.   As

usual,  as the last speaker has pointed out,  the

debate  ranged  over  a  wide  range  of  matters

concerning  all Ministries. Several  issues  were

repeated  by several Members and, as  usual,  the

Ministry  of  National Development attracted  the

most  attention. I will now attempt to  reply  to

some,  but  not all, of the points raised.  If  I

choose  to reply to all of them, Members will  be

here the whole night. My replies will not satisfy

all  Members of Parliament, but if there is  some

particular  problem  in  his  constituency  which

remains unresolved, the M.P, is free to raise the

matter  further  directly  with  me  or  with  my

Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may refer to the Member for Toa Payoh

first.  He  suggested  that special  priority  for

public  housing  should be given to  occupiers  of

homes  who  are  evicted by private developers.  I

believe he went on to say that though these people

were  compensated, there were those  amongst  them

who  received  only  token  sums  and,  therefore,

should  be given special consideration or priority

for  public  housing similar to those affected  by

Government  urban renewal schemes or  those  whose

homes have been burnt down by fire. The Member  is

aware  that there is an Act called the Control  of

Rent  Ordinance in Singapore. This  Act  does  not

apply  to  State  land. Under the Act,  controlled

premises  are  those built before  7th  September,

1947.  The result of control means that  not  only

the  rents are controlled but also the tenants  of

controlled  premises  cannot  be  evicted  by  the

landlord. In the result, the landlord has  to  pay

compensation  to the tenant if he desires  him  to

move  out. There is no need for the tenant to move

out unless he considers the compensation adequate.

In fact, some tenants have held their landlords to

ransom.  If  the tenant accepts such compensation,

then  he has been well paid and he should not  ask

the  Housing Board for special priority. He is not

debarred from applying for accommodation in public

housing,  but  he  does not deserve  to  jump  the

queue.  In  the  same way, tenants  of  controlled

premises  living in the Golden Shoe area are  paid

compensation  under the Control of  Rent  (Special

Provisions) Act by those landlords who  desire  to

evict  these  tenants and rebuild. Some  of  these

affected  tenants, after being paid  compensation,

have  applied to my Ministry to be allowed to jump

the  queue for Housing Board accommodation.  Their

requests  have  been refused because  the  Housing

Board  can  find  no justification  to  give  them

priority. Their circumstances are certainly not on

all  fours  with  those of fire victims  or  those

evicted  under the urban renewal schemes, because,

as I have said before,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



State  land  is not bound by the Control  of  Rent

Ordinance and different rates of compensation  are

paid for resettlement therefrom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be interested to know the figures in

respect of housing applicants as at the 31st  July

last month. They are as follows. There are a total

of  18,912  applications to rent, of  which  about

8,705   applicants   want  one-room   flats.   For

applications to purchase, there are in all 29,420.

About  18,000  of them want three-room  flats  and

another  517  want three-room point  block  flats.

About  7,900 applicants want four-room  flats  and

about  2,800  want five-room flats.  In  addition,

there  are  about  1,323 applicants  who  want  to

purchase  existing  flats. In all,  therefore,  we

have  more  than 30,000 applicants who  desire  to

buy,  and nearly 19,000 who want to rent. In these

circumstances, if the Board were to grant priority

to tenants of private property who are required to

move out by private developers, the list would  be

even  longer and those already in the queue  would

howl.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may come to the question of resettlement,

Sir.  The  Member  for Jurong has complained,  and

rightly so, that the Resettlement Department  team

in  Jurong  is  under strength. We have  recruited

young  people  to serve as resettlement  officers.

Unfortunately, they in turn have been  "recruited"

or  conscripted  into national  service.  When  we

train  more, more have been conscripted!  But  the

delay  in the payment of resettlement compensation

is  not  mainly  due  to the  shortage  of  staff.

Although  there  are vacancies in the  department,

the  situation there is not any worse off than  in

any  other Government department. The delay in the

payment of resettlement compensation is mainly due

to  the  delay  in  resettlement  cases  accepting

alternative accommodation or disputing the quantum

of  compensation. I think the Member is aware that

payment  of compensation to the settlers can  only

take  place  when  they have accepted  alternative

accommodation or are about to vacate the site.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked why the Housing and

Development Board does not sell its shops  to  the

occupiers. The Board has not sold shops and is not

at  the  moment in favour of selling them for  the

following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the policy of the Government is to

subsidise  the rental and even selling  prices  of

flats to enable the lower income group to live  in

decent     housing.    However,    non-residential

accommodation,  such  as  shops,   factories   and

godowns,  is  not entitled to public subsidy  and,

therefore, such shops are normally rented  out  at

market rentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the shops are to be offered for

sale,  they will have to be sold at market prices.

In fact, the Board did conduct a small survey last

year and the result has revealed that the majority

of  shopkeepers  are not in favour  of  purchasing

shops at market prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the sale of shops will lead to the loss

of  control over their use. Members are aware that

in  all  shopping centres in our housing  estates,

the  Board  has always maintained a  diversity  of

trade  so as to provide a complete service to  the

residents.  If shops are to be sold, they  can  be

sold  again, and those trades which can afford  to

pay  higher  rentals, such as  banks  and  finance

companies, may squeeze out the smaller trades like

stationery  and  barber shops  from  the  shopping

centre.  If  this happens, then  in  the  end  our

residents will not be provided with full  services

in the shopping centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present policy of the Board in renting out

shop premises has worked out quite satisfactorily,

and  it  appears that there is no valid reason  to

revise  it. For resettlement cases, the Government

is now granting rental concessions for five years,

starting  with a 50 per cent rental for the  first

year, and it is only in the sixth year  that  the

resettlement cases pay the normal rent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Tiong Bahru raised two

particular points amongst others - namely, that in

resettlement cases, people have been offered shops

even  if they do not want them, and when they find

alternative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



premises  of  their  own, the Planning  Department

takes enforcement action on unauthorised change of

use.   Sir,  when  a  census  is  taken   by   the

Resettlement Department on the clearance of shops,

shopkeepers are requested to indicate the locality

they  would  prefer. However, it is not physically

possible  to  offer  alternative  shops   in   the

selected localities, in order to facilitate  early

resettlement, the shopkeepers are in fact  offered

alternative shops in various localities.  Some  of

them accept the offer while others decline it. But

the  Housing arid Development Board has not at any

time  forced  any shopkeeper to accept  any  offer

which he does not like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those who find alternative accommodation

of  their  own,  they  would be  well  advised  to

consult    the    Planning    Department    before

establishing   their  businesses   elsewhere.   As

Members  know,  there is zoning under  the  Master

Plan  in  Singapore, and where the use is contrary

to  the zoning under the Master Plan, the Planning

Department   has  no  alternative  but   to   take

enforcement  action. Otherwise we  would  have  to

scrap the Master Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru also complained of

residents in one-room flats who have requested for

transfer  to  2-room or 3-room flats but  have  to

wait  for  a  long time. From the figures  I  have

quoted, I think the Member has got his answer. But

perhaps  the  Member could encourage some  of  his

constituents  to  purchase  Housing  Board   flats

instead  of  renting them. The rent for  a  2-room

flat  is $40 per month, and that for a 3-room flat

is  $60 per month. The instalment for the purchase

of  a  3-room improved flat for a duration  of  20

years  is only $47 per month. Therefore, it  would

not  be  too  difficult for those  who  are  in  a

position to rent either a 2-room or a 3-room  flat

to purchase a flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee asked why we do not

build more flats. The target is 100,000 units  for

the  next  five years. He asked, "Why do  you  not

increase  this  number to, say 125,000  units?"  I

wish  we  could. At present, the building industry

is already overloaded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



Shortages  in  both skilled and unskilled  workers

and building materials, including cement, on which

Members  touched, have occurred from time to  time

and  are  becoming a more common  occurrence.  Any

further increase in the building programme of  the

Housing and Development Board will only worsen the

situation and accelerate the pace of inflation  of

construction costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However. Members perhaps can take a little

satisfaction  when I say that after 1973,  when  a

substantial number of office buildings and  hotels

will have been completed and if there is a decline

in   the   building  activity  in  the   Republic,

consideration   will   certainly   be   given   to

increasing or accelerating the building  programme

of the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the 1st of July, the Government allowed

the  income group of $1,200 to go up to $1,500 per

month in order to enable a wage-earner to purchase

his own flat. I am asked why we do not extend this

limit  further. I think the answer is obvious.  It

would  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of

applicants already on the waiting list.  The  fact

is   that  the  demand  for  Housing  Board  flats

considerably exceeds the supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may go on to Tanjong Rhu, Sir. The Member

for  Katong  complained that  the  Board  has  not

provided  parks or recreational facilities  within

the  area.  This is true. But the Member  will  be

pleased  to  know that the Housing Board  and  the

Planning   Department   are   looking   into   the

possibility  of providing recreational facilities,

including  a swim-riling pool, on the vacant  land

opposite  the  Tanjong Rhu Housing  Estate  across

Mountbatten Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Member for Jurong who complained of

the location of schools in respect of resettlement

areas.  This  is  really  not  a  matter  for   my

Ministry, bat one for the Ministry of Education. I

understand   that  the  location  of  schools   is

determined,   amongst  other   factors,   by   the

availability  of suitable sites  and,  as  far  as

possible,   proximity  to  pockets  of  population

centres. Resettlement in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



selected areas has resulted in changes and  shifts

in  pockets  of  population, and it  will  not  be

possible   to   build  a  new  school   in   every

resettlement  area, especially if schools  already

exist   nearby.  But  in  the  planning  of  large

resettlement  estates,  school  sites  have   been

provided,  for instance, the Tai Chong  School  at

Choa  Chu  Kang Road, the Loke Yang Public  School

and Kay Hwa School, First Branch, at Lim Chu Kang.

A   committee  has  been  established,  comprising

officials  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,   the

Ministry of Education and officers from the  Urban

Renewal  Department  and Planning  Department,  to

look into this question more comprehensively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang hoped that

Woodlands  would be a better place than Queenstown

or Toa Payoh. I think his sentiments are shared by

the  Member  for Telok Blangah. The Housing  Board

has  had more than 10 years of experience and  has

continually  striven  by trial  and  sometimes  by

error  to  improve the standard of public housing.

For  example, the Queenstown flats are better than

those  in Bukit Ho Swee. But the Member for  Bukit

Ho  Swee is not to blame. And perhaps Toa Payoh is

better  than Queenstown. The Bukit Ho Swee housing

estate  was built in a hurry after the  big  fire.

Hence  the  poor conditions in some parts  of  the

estate.  But the Member for Telok Blangah and  the

Member for Bukit Panjang can rest assured that the

flats  in  Telok Blangah, which incidentally  will

look  over the sea, and Woodlands, which will look

over  the  causeway, will be even better than  the

existing ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Not only will there be better flats

by  way of design and comfort, but there will also

be  better  facilities for recreation like  parks,

playgrounds, swimming pools and community centres.

The  buildings  will also be spaced further  apart

from  one another so that there will be more  open

green spaces in between.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang touched on our

water  problem.  He  can  rest  assured  that  the

problem  is  being  tackled  on  all  fronts.  Two

schemes,   the   Kranji/Pandan  and   the   Pierce

extension,  are at present being implemented  and,

when  completed,  should add Considerably  to  our

water  stocks. In addition, a reservoir  at  Bedok

will  be built by the Housing Board in conjunction

with the Public Utilities Board in connection with

the  land  reclamation scheme from Bedok to  Tanah

Merah.   In   order  to  obtain   fill   for   the

reclamation, we have to dig a hole. Why  not  turn

that hole into a reservoir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of water resources in the off-shore

islands   is   also   being  carefully   examined,

including  the possibility of connecting  the  two

ends  of  Pulau Ubin to the mainland  and  tapping

rivers  to fill the reservoir after the sea  water

has been pumped out. But there may he difficulties

-  difficulties  of  sea water seeping  in  again,

difficulties in respect of the shipping  lanes  as

they  may  hive  to be diverted unless  locks  are

constructed,  and the diversion of shipping  lanes

will  require  the  co-operation  of  neighbouring

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May `I now turn to the question of conservation

of  water?  Government has taken action to  remove

gradually   all  standpipes  and  is   encouraging

individual service connections so that in time  of

water  rationing, it will be easier  not  only  to

devise  a fair system of rationing but also  avoid

the  considerable inconvenience  and  hardship  to

poorer persons who have to queue up at standpipes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for desalinisation, the costs are at the

moment  prohibitive. As for using  sea  water  for

flushing  toilets,  there are  also  difficulties.

Firstly,   corrosion   of  pipes   and   fittings;

secondly,  the cost of construction  of  a  second

system  of  pipes for distribution; and,  thirdly,

the  question of disposal of the waste  after  the

sea  water has been used. A separate sewage  plant

will  have to be built unless the waste is  to  be

dumped  into the sea to pollute our sea shore  and

the waters surrounding us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial water is already being used at Jurong

where  the  plant has a treatment capacity  of  10

million gallons per day. It is a pity that not all

the  10  million gallons are being used every  day

and  most  of it goes down the Jurong River.  This

capacity  can  be stepped up and the surplus  used

for  flushing  of toilets. But here again  a  dual

system  of distribution would be required. Perhaps

a  pilot scheme can be introduced either at Jurong

or the new towns in Woodlands and Telok Blangah to

use  industrial water for flushing of toilets. The

difficulties  are  not  insurmountable   and   the

possibilities  are being examined by  my  Ministry

together with the Public Utilities Board  and  the

Jurong Town Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa, I believe, suggested

that  it  would be desirable to introduce a  step-tariff  system. If I may explain, this is a system

where  the P.U.B, charges for the first  block  of

units  at a lower rate followed by the second  and

subsequent  blocks at a higher  rate.  This  would

provide  an  incentive  to  consumers  to   reduce

consumption. The Member for Whampoa is  looking  a

little  puzzled. I hope I have not misquoted  him.

Anyway, I think it is a good proposal but requires

examination, as any tariff must be framed in  such

a  manner as to avoid any possible lowering of the

standard of cleanliness and hygiene.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst on the question of water, may I join

the  Member for Bukit Panjang in thanking  members

of  the  public for their co-operation  in  saving

water.  Daily  consumption  has  dropped  from   a

maximum of 130 million gallons to about 95 million

gallons   and  today  hovers  around  100  million

gallons. The efforts of members of the public  are

commendable  and  show  a healthy  and  favourable

response to the exhortations of the P.U.B. If  the

consumption  does  not  increase  considerably,  I

think  we  can hold off water rationing until  the

rains come in early October or November.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah suggested that we form

a  permanent committee to look after the  question

of resettlement. We will consider this suggestion.

But  before  I pass it to my experts, perhaps  the

Member  will  let me know whether  this  permanent

committee  to  look  into  resettlement   problems

should  confine its efforts to cases of Government

resettlement  only,  or is it  to  include  people

resettled by the private sector'?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein complained about Public

Relations Officers. I think it is the practice  of

some  Ministers to hide under the nom de plume  of

their P.R.O. The Member's suggestion is a good one

but there are P.R.O.s who do much more than merely

write letters to the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for houses for civil servants, this is a good

idea.  I  think our civil servants should be  paid

more or given more perks, but the question is: how

do  we  start and how do we allocate these  flats?

`There  are  a few thousand civil servants.  Those

with incomes under $1,500 per month can apply  for

Housing  and Development Board accommodation  now.

The  Housing and Development Board can build flats

for  civil  servants, but unless we are to  supply

houses  to  all  civil servants within  a  certain

category,  how do we allocate these flats?  Do  we

say  first come first served? Do we say  the  most

efficient get priority? How do we decide  who  are

the  most  efficient? Or do we merely  ballot  and

they take their flats by chance? These are some of

the difficulties that have been presented to us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



We have not found a satisfactory solution, but the

matter is being looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is looking unhappy,

perhaps because I have not replied to any  of  his

queries.  The  Member inquired why  there  was  no

reference to rural development in the addendum  of

the Ministry of National Development. The addendum

was  a  brief  one and we could not touch  on  all

points in the Ministry, but I understand that  the

Member wants more money for rural development.  So

do  I. I hope he will help me in preparing a paper

for the consideration of the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure all

Members  will  agree with me when I say  that  the

Republic   of  Singapore  approaches   its   sixth

National Day with increasing confidence.  On  that

note,  I  join  other  Members  in  thanking   the

President for his speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the
