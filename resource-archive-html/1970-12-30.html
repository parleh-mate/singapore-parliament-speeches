<div align="center"><b>OBITUARY ON THE LATE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PRESIDENT YUSOF BIN ISHAK</b></div>



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Govindasamy, Sir, I am sure Members will join me in

formally recording our sorrow at the death  of  our

late  President,  Yusof bin Ishak  Al-haj.  He  has

become  an  institution over the past 11 years.  He

visited  this  House on so many  occasions  at  the

opening of each new session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I last spoke, in this House, of him and his

gracious lady, when moving his re-election as  Head

of State in November 1967 for a third term. Shortly

afterwards he was to fall ill. We did not then know

how grave the illness was. During a sea voyage from

Singapore to Australia in April 1968, the rhythm of

his heart beat was upset and he had to be flown  to

Melbourne  for treatment. We were grateful  to  the

Australian  Government, and the doctors and  nurses

in Melbourne who treated him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prognosis of the Australian specialists was

not  encouraging. But, with skill and devotion, our

doctors  and nurses who took care of him, stretched

what  could have been a matter of a few months into

2 1/2  years. Their professional competence made  this

possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first came to know the late President early in

1951.  He had come to seek my advice over an Utusan

Melayu   editor   who   was  detained   under   the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.  He  was

naturally well-mannered. Over the years, I  got  to

know him as a deeply religious man, but one who did

not  allow  his religion to hinder his relationship

with  non-Muslims,  whether they  were  Christians,

Hindus, Buddhists, Confucians, or atheists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood for our multi-racial policies. A recent

speech he made to start off the fund for a monument

to  the  early pioneers of Singapore was one  which

could  only have been made by a person who believed

in   our  multi-racial  approach  to  solving   the

problems  of our multi-racial society. At the  same

time, he was keen that in this multi-racial milieu,

our  Singapore  Malays should break  out  from  the

bounds  of customs which were preventing them  from

making  the same progress as the other communities.

He  believed in policies to modernise our  society,

including  our  Malays. He believed  that  all  men

should   be   equal,  or  at  least   given   equal

opportunities  to advance themselves through  their

own effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember him as the man I spoke of in the

motion  for his re-election in November  1967.  The

long  illness over nearly three years  reduced  him

slowly  to  an invalid. It was painful and  sad  to

watch  him  go  down  little by little  after  each

relapse of his cardiac and respiratory problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden was heaviest on his wife and children.

As his condition deteriorated, his usually composed

demeanour was affected. He was beset by anxieties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw him last on Sunday night, 22nd November, at 9.30 p.m, at the General Hospital. I had spoken to

him on Saturday, 21st November, over the telephone.

He  told  me  not to see him until  his  attack  of

herpes,  or  shingles,  was  over.  He  sounded  in

greater  pain  than  usual. The  next  day,  Sunday

afternoon, he had a heart



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



failure.  He  was put into an oxygen  tent  at  the

General  Hospital. He must have known that the  end

was  near. After a while, when the doctor had given

an injection to resuscitate him, he came out of his

plastic  oxygen tent. He insisted on shaking  hands

with  the  doctors and nurses who had looked  after

him, and with me. I left after 20 minutes. The next

morning, I was informed of his death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I formally, Mr Govindasamy. Sir, ask that

this  House  join me in sending the widow  and  his

children  our deep sympathies. Their loss  must  be

greater than ours.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> As a mark of respect to the

late  President, I propose to suspend this  sitting

and I shall take the Chair again at 2.45 p.m.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL LIST AND PENSION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I have

the  Acting  President's recommendation to  proceed

with  this  Bill.  Sir, I beg to introduce  a  Bill

intituled  "An  Act  to amend the  Civil  List  and

Pension Act, 1970 (No. 10 of 1970)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Now, Sir,I lay upon the

Table a Certificate of Urgency signed by the Acting

President in respect of the Civil List and  Pension

(Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> The Certificate is in order.

Have  typed  or  printed copies of  the  Bill  been

circulated to Members?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They have been circulated,

Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindasamy, Sir, when the Civil List and Pension Bill was taken through Parliament earlier this year, the doctors who were treating the late President were optimistic that he might be able to serve his full term before retirement. But it was not to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he retired at the time of his death, the late

President would have been entitled to a pension  of

$  17.466 per year, or $1,455 per month. As he  was

60  years of age, he could have taken a gratuity of

$72,777  (one-third  of  his  full  pension  x  12 ½

years), together with a reduced pension of $970 per

month. This formula for computation applies to  all

Ministerial pensions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late President left behind a widow and three

children,  the  youngest of whom is 18.  Under  the

present law, Puan Noor Aishah will only be entitled

to  a  gratuity. This could not have been more than

the  gratuity  the late President would  have  been

entitled to. She is only in the second half of  her

thirties and so has a considerable life expectancy.

My  colleagues and I decided that we  should  amend

the  Civil  List  and Pension Act for  her  special

circumstances,  without making it a  precedent  for

the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this amending Bill, we shall provide her with

a  pension of $2,000 per month for life. As in  all

pensions  to widows, it will cease in the event  of

re-marriage. There will be a further $500 per month

for  her  children,  until  the  youngest  one  has

reached 21, or on her marriage if it is before 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their house has not yet been built on her

piece  of  land, we have made available  to  her  a

government  bungalow she has chosen from  a  number

which  were  suitable. She will pay one-quarter  of

the  economic  rent of the house for  a  period  of

three  years. During this time her own house  could

be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the declining years of the late President, she

carried more of the social responsibilities of  his

office.  I  am  sure  the House  will  be  with  my

colleagues   and  me  in  wanting  to  make   these

provisions for her and her children. This  amending

Bill will give her more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



than  what  the late President himself  would  have

been entitled to. But there are special reasons why

we  feel justified in seeking to make the necessary

provisions set out in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [The Prime Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><h4>ELECTION OF PRESIDENT OF</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br>2.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Article

1  of  the Constitution, elects Dr Benjamin  Henry

SHEARES as President of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April 1968 my colleagues in the Cabinet and

I  have been conscious of the possibility of having

to  call upon one of our citizens, at short notice,

to  undertake  the duties of President.  It  was  a

deliberation spread over 2½ years. After the  death

of  the  late President, we decided to  invite  Dr

Benjamin Sheares to undertake this office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a doctor, eminent in his own specialty. By

disposition courteous, by nature kind, he has  done

a  great deal for the College of Medicine,  and  is

largely responsible for the high standards  of  our

gynaecologists, nearly all of whom he taught. After

he  retired in 1960, he went into private practice.

However,  he  continued  to  help  in  many  fields

connected   with  his  expertise.  He   has   given

generously of his time to public duties,  like  the

Family  Planning  Association. As Chairman  of  the

Medical Specialties Board, he was helping to decide

on   which  medical  specialties  Singapore  should

concentrate  her  resources. He  had  to  recommend

which department had outstanding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



specialists, so that the most modern equipment  and

facilities  could be provided for the  exercise  of

their  talent,  what  special  support  in  nurses,

anaesthetists, radiographers, cardiographers,  and

specialised workers we must train to support  these

specialists in the use of the latest equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he accepted the Government's offer to be

nominated as President, I explained to Dr  Sheares

that  he would have to undertake his duties as from

the  2nd of January, 1971. In less than a fortnight

he   will   be  receiving  the  Heads  of   various

Commonwealth  delegations who will be arriving  for

the  Conference. His first reaction was to ask  for

the  curriculum  vitae  of  the  leaders  of  these

delegations,  and  a  note on  the  countries  they

represent, their history, their political, economic

and social systems. He wanted to know about the men

he  will be meeting and the nature of the countries

they   represented.  Although  he  has   not   been

experienced  in the political or diplomatic  field,

his  readiness to bring a disciplined intellect  to

bear on to a new field augurs well for Singapore. I

am  confident  that  he will develop  a  grasp  and

understanding   of   persons   and   peoples,    of

associations and communities, of nations and  their

leaders,  their national aspirations and individual

ambitions. It will make what could be a perfunctory

duty   into  an  interesting  office,  more  of   a

challenge than a chore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of President require not only

distinction   and   ability,  but   integrity   and

understanding.  He  brings deep  qualities  to  the

office  of President. More than that, he is  modest

and friendly, by nature and habit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife, Mrs Sheares, speaks Chinese, English

and  some  Malay.  She  can  lend  support  to  the

President in his social duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I commend Dr Benjamin Henry

Sheares to the House for election as President.  At

63,   he  enjoys  good  health,  despite  a   major

operation  five  years  ago.  Here  is  a  man   of

outstanding ability. I am sure he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



will  grow with the office, and discharge  it  with

dignity and distinction.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I rise to support the

motion moved by the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election of Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares to the

high office of President is indeed appropriate. Dr

Sheares  will  no  doubt prove  himself  a  capable

person  to  carry out the functions and  duties  of

Head  of State, for not only is he a person of high

academic eminence and attainment, but he is also  a

person with wide experience, a record of service to

the  public,  and has close links with the  people.

There  is no doubt that with such a background  and

experience  as  he possesses, he will  be  able  to

discharge  the duties entrusted to him as  Head  of

State  of the Republic of Singapore with poise  and

grace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  ever  since the demise 0 the  late  President

Yusof,  the  office of the Head  of  State  of  our

Republic of two million people has been vacant  and

the   question  of  the  new  candidate   for   the

presidency has become a topic of the people and the

subject of speculation in various quarters. Indeed,

in  the  same way as a group of dragons  cannot  go

without a leader, no country can go without a  Head

of State, and it has become our first task today to

decide  on  the question of who shall  succeed  the

late President Yusof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the office of President in our

Republic  is somewhat different from that of  other

countries. He represents, both here and abroad, our

Republic and is a symbol of the dignity and  honour

of our people. He is also a symbol of the unity and

the  values  of  our Republic. In  these  turbulent

times  and  in  the course of nation  building  and

development, he will have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



an important role to perform. Therefore, the office

of  President cannot be overlooked. It is indeed  a

very difficult task to choose a suitable person for

this  post. He should be a person of learning, good

conduct and high reputation. He should indeed be  a

1eader  acceptable both here and abroad. To  a  big

country with a lot of people the choice of  such  a

person presents no difficulty. But to Singapore, it

is not easy to make such a choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the Prime Minister and read the

curriculum   vitae  published  in  the   newspapers

recently, I firmly believe that Dr Sheares is  the

best  and the most suitable choice, because he  has

all  the attributes and qualities required for this

high office. He was born and bred in Singapore  and

has been brought up as an outstanding figure in our

Republic. By his own efforts he has made  his  name

known  internationally and has brought great honour

to Singapore. He has also a distinguished record of

service  to our country and our people. He reflects

in  his own life the finest qualities and the  best

spirit  of Singapore. These are dedication  to  the

country,  devotion to society, a  love  of  people,

contribution  to  human  welfare,  and  a  profound

understanding of the characteristics of our  multi-racial country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully support the recommendation by the Prime

Minister of Dr Sheares to this high office. It  is

our hope that he will, in the same kindly spirit of

a  physician and by his own virtues, carry .on from

where our late President has left off, so that  our

new  and  young  Republic will be  able  to  set  a

shining  example  in turbulent Southeast  Asia  and

make  her name felt throughout the world. We pledge

our full support and co-operation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, I

wholeheartedly  endorse the remarks  of  the  Prime

Minister. I have had the opportunity of meeting Dr

Sheares  on  many occasions when he was working  in

the  Outram  Road General Hospital and the  Kandang

Kerbau Maternity Hospital. I was then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



working in the postal services. I have known him as

a  friendly, approachable and understanding  person

who   shows   great  concern  for  other   people's

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young Republic, our country has been

fortunate to have dynamic leadership. In  the  last

decade  we have made good progress in the  economic

and  industrial  fields, resulting  in  our  people

having  the  highest standard  of  living  in  this

region.  At this crucial stage of our progress,  it

is  important that we have a President who can  not

only keep up with the pace of progress that we have

achieved  so far, but can also command the  respect

and  confidence  of  our  people.  This  honour  is

rightly  bestowed upon Dr Benjamin Henry  Sheares.

Sir,  I have great pleasure in supporting the Prime

Minister's   motion  to  elect  him  as   our   new

President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Article

1  of  the Constitution, elects Dr Benjamin  Henry

SHEARES as President of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Sir, the

Member  does not appreciate the difference  between

service   in  School  Cadet  Corps  and   full-time

national  service in the Armed Forces.  Apart  from

differences  in  training systems, service  in  the

Cadet   Corps  is  purely  voluntary.  A  schoolboy

joining the Cadet Corps does so as part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



of  his extra-curricular activities and because  he

finds  service in the Corps interesting and useful.

He is better motivated than other boys and wants to

set an example to them in serving the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have done well in the School Cadet

Corps  should  qualify when doing national  service

for promotion to the officer grade, or at least  to

the  NCO grade. They will then be doing two  and  a

half  years' service, not two years, much less  one

and a half years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow Cadet Corps service to count for

national   service  purposes  would  introduce   an

element  of  self-seeking  calculation  which  will

undermine the whole spirit of the Cadet Corps.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Sir,

that  no pupil below the age of 16 can be asked  to

leave  school  unless  he  or  she  is  guilty   of

persistent bad conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for transfers, no pupil can be transferred

from one school to another by principals except  at

the  express  request  of  parents.  To  date,   my

that their children have been asked to leave school

voluntarily or to seek a transfer because of  their

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can the Minister of State say whether

disciplinary action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of what is the criterion for bad

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> (a) Sir, it is the practice

special consideration to applicants, suffering from

ailments such as paralysis an4 cardiac diseases  in

respect of the allotment of ground and first  floor

flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Board does give priority to applicants

who   are  staying  in  dilapidated  accommodation,

provided a demolition notice has been served by the

Chief  Building Surveyor. As regards people staying

in  flood-prone  areas,  special  consideration  is

given if these areas are being redeveloped, and the

priority,  however, is given to applicants  evicted

by  private  developers as,  in  many  cases,  such

payments from the developers.

have  the  ground  floors used as  children's  play

areas.  Also, 13 more blocks now under construction

children's  play  areas. Further, there  are  other

<div align="center"><b>(Payment of water-meter rent)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for

Law  and  National Development if he will ascertain

from the Public Utilities Board why some owners  of

Housing and Development Board flats are required to

pay water-meter rent and some are not.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, it is correct that under

the  existing water supply regulations some  owners

or  tenants of Housing and Development Board  flats

are  required to pay water-meter rent whilst others

are  not. This has been the practice since  October

1959.  If the water-meter installed in any  service

connection  is the one and only controlling  meter,

no  meter rent is charged. However, where there are

two  meters  installed in series in the service  of

any consumer, the second meter is then called a sub-meter  for which a rent of $1 per month is payable.

Under  the existing water supply regulations, these

sub-meters may be installed in high rise buildings,

both  Housing  and  Development Board  and  private

buildings  and  also where consumers  request  sub-metering   to  ensure  separately  water  supplying

different sections of their service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why not all Housing and Development

Board  residents pay sub-meter rent is  that  those

residents who live on the lower floors of blocks of

flats get their water supply direct from the Public

Utilities  Board mains. The supply to  these  flats

does not go through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



the  bulk  meter  and the roof  tanks.  And  meters

installed  for these individual flats are therefore

not   sub-meters.  Hence  no  rental  is   charged.

However,  I  can assure the Member that the  entire

question  of  imposition of sub-meter rent  is  now

under  review by the Public Utilities Board with  a

view to abolishing the charge for sub-meters in the

case   of  high  rise  buildings.  The  legal   and

administrative  implications  are   being   studied

before a final decision is made and implemented.

(iii) other pulmonary diseases during the last  ten

years; (b) how many granite quarry workers are  now

suffering  from  these occupational  diseases,  and

whether  they are receiving treatment at Government

hospitals;  and  (c) what steps his  Ministry  will

take   to   acquaint  medical  practitioners   that

silicosis is an industrial disease notifiable under

section 58 of the Factories Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, the number of granite quarry workers who have

died  from  silicosis and silico-tuberculosis  over

the  last 10 years (that is, from January  1961  to

30th September, 1970) is eight by silicosis and  10

by silico-tuberculosis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for deaths from other pulmonary diseases, it

is not medically known that silica dust could cause

any other respiratory disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the number of granite quarry workers now

suffering  from  these occupational diseases,  this

could  only  be  estimated from the survey  by  the

Ministry  of  Health's Committee  of  Inquiry  into

Occupational  Diseases conducted in 1965.  In  that

large  survey, out of 1,188 granite quarry  workers

(constituting about 90 per cent of the total number of  granite quarry workers in 1965) X-rayed, 364 or

30.64  per  cent of them showed signs of silicosis.

The survey, however, did not differentiate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



between  cases  of silicosis and cases  of  silico-tuberculosis. These cases have been followed up for

treatment in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. There  are

a smaller number of cases also being treated at the

Outram  Road General Hospital. It must be mentioned

that  there is no specific cure for silicosis,  and

the  treatment available in hospitals is  only  for

symptomatic treatment of the disease. The  emphasis

here  should be the control of the dusty conditions

in  the granite quarries and thereby preventing the

occurrence of the disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has circulated to all

medical  practitioners  in  Singapore  a  list   of

industrial diseases found in the Sixth Schedule  of

the   Factories  Ordinance,  1958,  which   include

silicosis, drawing their attention to section 58 of

the  Factories  Ordinance which  requires  them  to

notify  these  diseases to the Chief  Inspector  of

Factories,  Ministry of Labour, when they  diagnose

them.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, can the

Minister for Health inform this House who pays  for

the treatment -the employers or the state?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, that is a very general

question.  The question of who pays will depend  on

whether  the  workers'  union  has  any  collective

agreement with the particular employer. I am afraid

I  cannot  answer such a general question.  If  the

Member will ask me a specific question, I shall  he

able to answer him.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Sir, can the Minister

inform  this  House  when the  list  of  industrial

diseases was circulated to medical practitioners in

Singapore?  And why is it that up to June  or  July

this  year,  only  three  cases  were  notified  by

medical  practitioners to the Factory Inspectorate?

Are the doctors so ignorant about this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the notification was

circulated  some  time  last  month  or  the  month

before. As to why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



only  three cases were notified, there again  I  am

not  able to answer. Perhaps the Member for Kallang

should  ask  the  medical  practitioners  for   the

answer.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> So the list of industrial

diseases was circulated after the three cases  were

notified  by medical practitioners to the  Ministry

of  Labour. This is such a serious matter that  the

Ministry  of  Health took the trouble to  circulate

the   list   of  industrial  diseases  to   medical

practitioners in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Inche Abdul Aziz, your

question is, why was the list circulated so late!



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Is there any explanation

for it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, there again it is a

general question and needs no explanation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Govindasamy. Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metrication Bill seeks to legalise the use of

the  metric  system and to enable the Ministers  to

change  references  to  non-metric  units  in   any

written  law  to  references in  equivalent  metric

units   and   to  empower  Ministries   to   accept

approximations in conversion. I have already made a

statement in the House at the last sitting  on  the

reasons   why  Singapore  must  proceed  with   the

metrication process. However, it may be interesting

to  Members of the House if I read excerpts of  the

folklore  behind the imperial Weights and  Measures

as  compiled  by Lord Ritchie-Calder,  who  is  now

Chairman of the British Metrication Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot is not, as popularly believed, the size

of  the  human foot. As human feet vary from person

to  person and because of this great variation, one

thousand  years ago 36 barley corns or 36 seeds  of

barley taken from the middle of the ear placed  end

to  end  were  regarded as one foot. And  three  of

these  barley  seeds placed end to end  constituted

one  inch. A yard was the distance from the tip  of

King  Edgar's nose to the tip of the middle  finger

of  his outstretched arm. A fathom was said  to  be

the  length of a Viking's embrace. An acre was  the

amount of land that could be ploughed in a day by a

yoke  of oxen. The amount could vary, depending  on

whether the soil was heavy or light. In those  days

the  larger unit was called the hide; it too was  a

variable measurement, being based on the amount  of

land  a  yoke of oxen could plough in a year.  This

amount, which averaged about 120 acres, was  deemed

enough to support a family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Germany, the length of the road, now known as

the  rod  or  pole or perch, was established  by  a

random sample of 16 men coming out of church:  they

stood  toe-to-heel,  and  the  overall  length  was

accepted as the standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Romans measured out their mile. Their mile

was  a  thousand  paces, equivalent  now  to  1,618

yards. A pace, however, is a variable unit, and  so

the  mile has varied. The British and American mile

was standardised at 1,760 yards, but in a number of

European countries, the mile ranges from less  than

a British-American mile to six such miles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while there was much in the old days to

commend the units based on the human body, however,

the  units based on the anatomy of the human  being

were too variable, and therefore the standards used

varied from country to country. For example, in the

North of Italy in Leonardo da Vinci's time, lengths

were in braccia or arm lengths. Leonardo was a tall

man  and could outreach most of his contemporaries.

If  he was using his own braccia, he must have  run

into difficulties when he had to fit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



something  he  had designed or made  into-something

measured  according  to  other  braccia.  Even  the

standard  braccia  varied  from  city  to  city.  A

Florentine  door  would have been  too  big  for  a

Milanese   door-frame.  Throughout  the  centuries,

measurements proliferated in regions, countries and

localities, and persisted long after their original

significance and utility had been forgot- ten. As a

result,  there were problems, not only  in  fitting

but  also in making sure of honest measure  and  in

avoiding confusion born of misunderstanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metrication Act seeks to standardise weights

and  measures according to an international system.

The system now is based on physical units which can

be measured extremely accurately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, the comments of the Minister for Science

and  Technology  on metrication  in  the  House

during the last sitting on 4th November,  1970,

and  his  own  reference just now to  the  arbi

trary   basis   of  traditional   weights   and

measures  should leave no doubt that  there  is

no  argument about whether we-should go  metric

or  not.  Quoting from Ritchie-Calder whom  the Minister  referred  to  just  now,  the  really

important question is, just when should  we  go

metric?  The  answer to this question  is  also

clear;    namely,   as   soon    as    it    is

organisationally      and      administratively

feasible.  This aspect of feasibility  is  more

than  adequately covered in the report  on  the

proposed  conversion to the metric system.  The

report  refers  both  to  metrication  in   the

public  and the private sectors. It would  seem

most  illogical  for us to continue  using  our

old  system  of  weights and measures.  In  the

case  of  the imperial units, for example,  the

country   where  this  system  originated   has

itself  decided in its own interest  to  change

over  to the metric system. Where our own local

customary  units  are concerned,  it  would  be

most parochial indeed if we were to persist  in

their continued use.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



In  Britain itself it has been clearly seen,  after

initial   resistance,  that   the   advantages   of

metrication  must outweigh national  sentiments  or

traditional  feelings. It is  just  a  question  of

making  a decision and acting logically as a result

of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversion to metrication is just another

process of modernisation and social change which we

have  to  undergo. Our people have shown themselves

very  adaptable to such changes. There is no reason

why,   once   the   necessity  has   been   clearly

demonstrated,  even the private  sector  and  those

involved  in  the  retail trade should  not  adjust

themselves  to  the  new  system  of  weights   and

measures.  To  facilitate this, not only  are  good

publicity and public education required,  but  they

should be started as soon as possible and sustained

over as long a period as is necessary to bring home

the relevant point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. ----[Dr Toh Chin Chye].

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Weights and Measures (Amendment) Bill seeks

to  legalise  metric  units for  use  in  trade  in

Singapore.  The existing imperial units  and  local

customary  units  shall  remain  legal,   but   the

Minister  may  declare, not less  than  five  years

after  the  coming into operation of the  Act,  any

unit  or  standard  to  be  illegal  and  void   in

Singapore.  However, there is a provision  for  the

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



to  exempt  any person or body  of  persons,

department  or agency, from the operation  of  such

notification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also increases the penalties for

offences  against the Ordinance. It  increases  the

effectiveness  of measures against malpractices  by

extending  the powers of inspectors of weights  and

measures  to  assistant inspectors  and  to  senior

officers of customs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It empowers the Minister to declare that the

Weights and Measures Ordinance shall apply  to  the

sale of gold, silver or precious stones, drugs, and

carriage of goods, which are at present not covered

by the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metrication Board, with Mr Baey Lian Peck as

Chairman, has already been formed and the  function

of  the  Board  is  to ensure  that  there  is  co-ordination  between Government Ministries  and  the

private sector during the process of metrication. I

may,   for   clarification,  also  add   that   the

administration   of   the  Weights   and   Measures

(Amendment)  Act comes under the Trade Division  of

the  Ministry of Finance, although for purposes  of

convenience I am moving this amendment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>ENLISTMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the introduction of this Bill on the 4th

November,  I was obliged to make a full Ministerial

statement under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>







Standing Order No. 10 explaining the new enlistment

policy  and the reasons for the changes. I  do  not

propose  to  go  over  the same  ground  except  to

recapitulate some of the main arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change in enlistment policy derives from a

decision  made by Government more than a  year  ago

that  students  who proceed from the Higher  School

Certificate to the university should, in increasing

numbers,   do   their   national   service   before

university education and not after it. It  was  not

desirable  to  introduce this change  in  one  fell

swoop. Instead, deferment will be allowed to H.S.C.

students, but in decreasing proportions over two or

three years. For instance, this year about half  of

the  H.S.C, students  had their  national  service

deferred  until the completion of their  university

education.  Next year, the proportion  would  be  a

quarter,   and  by  1973  everyone  completes   his

national  service before going to  the  university,

except   those  awarded  Colombo  Plan  and   other

overseas  scholarships whose selection  rests  with

the Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should stress here that deferment means

precisely  what  the word purports to  mean.  Those

deferred  will  do  their  national  service  after

graduation.  There is no question of  letting  them

off  for  good. It is a commentary on the character

of   the  Singaporean  that  those  who  had  their

national service deferred were considered lucky.  I

wonder  whether  people would hold  the  same  view

three or four years from now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I propose to deal with three aspects of the

defence policy. The first is why the defence build-up  is  necessary. The second is the  new  pay  and

service conditions for the Armed Forces, details of

which  I promised in my statement last November  to

give  on  this  occasion. Third,  I  want  to  give

details  of  what  is  going to  happen  to  H.S.C.

students next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the necessity of our defence build-up,

I  am  afraid it is necessary from time to time  to

remind  our  citizens of the hard  facts  of  life.

Lately, I notice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



a  tendency  among some citizens to be  complacent.

The reason probably is that things seem to be going

reasonably well in the Republic. Some citizens seem

to   be   incorrigible  optimists  and  erroneously

believe  that  the good conditions  now  prevailing

form  part  of  the natural, normal, and  immutable

state  of  the  universe. The  trouble  with  these

optimists is that at the first sign of danger  they

are liable to lose their nerve and panic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me therefore recount some of the harsh facts

of  life  in our part of the world. We were overrun

by  the Japanese Army less than 30 years ago. Some,

20,000 to 30,000 men were massacred and most of the

population lived under near-famine conditions. From

1948  to  1960, the Malayan Communist Party mounted

widespread   guerilla  insurgency  in   the   Malay

Peninsula  which was suppressed at great cost  with

much  difficulty  and  with  the  full  support  of

British  arms. Between 1954 and 1963, the Communist

United  Front Organisations in Singapore  literally

ran  riot. Between 1963 and 1965, while in Malaysia

we  were  the  target  of  what  was  virtually  an

undeclared  low-level  war  waged  by  the  Sukarno

regime  of  Indonesia.  But  for  British  military

protection, we would surely have succumbed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look around Southeast Asia today, the view

that meets the eye is far from reassuring. In South

Vietnam, unlimited American fire-power through  the

deployment  of the most scientific weapons  systems

on   land,   sea  and  air,  backed  by  unstinting

logistics and communications support, has failed to

crush  an  army  of  peasants  equipped  only  with

rifles. The fighting has spread to Cambodia,  while

the  position in Laos remains as insecure as  ever.

As  a result of the pressure of public opinion, the

American  Government has decided to  run  down  its

combat  operations in the Indo-China peninsula  and

leave the fighting to the South Vietnamese regime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurgency has raised its ugly head in Northern

and   Northeast  Thailand  as  well   as   on   the

Thai/Malaysian border. Our two closest  neighbours,

Malaysia and Indonesia, are faced with acute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



domestic problems. Malaysia is trying to find a new

political  equilibrium and a  new  political  style

after  May  13th last year. Indonesia  has  made  a

return  to political stability and economic  sanity

through  military  government  after  more  than  a

decade of mis-government by the Sukarno regime. The

Indonesians  are making welcome progress.  But  the

difficulties they are facing are monumental. We can

only  hope  that  the Governments of  Malaysia  and

Indonesia succeed in their endeavours, for if  they

do  not,  the troubles that follow may  well  spill

over their borders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British have reversed their earlier decision

of  total  withdrawal east of  Suez.  However,  the

forces  that  they  will station  in  Malaysia  and

Singapore are small, and even when these are  added

to   those  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  they

represent no more than a token acknowledgement that

these  three  Governments have an interest  in  the

peace  and  stability  of  the  region.  They  have

preferred  not  to  close an  important  option  by

pulling  back all their troops. We have to remember

that  these  military forces have a different  role

from what they performed previously when there  was

a firm defence treaty, such as that between Britain

and  Malaysia, supplemented by tacit agreement with

Australia   and   New   Zealand.   These    defence

obligations  were  clearly  spelt  out.  Under  the

understanding   envisaged  under   the   Five-Power

arrangements,  their  only commitment  is  to  hold

consultations in the event of a threat to Singapore

or Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background of general uncertainty in

the  region, and in the absence of any firm defence

commitments from our Commonwealth associates, it is

a  matter of common prudence that we should  strive

to  be  as  self-reliant as we can  in  matters  of

defence.  Here,  I  have to repeat  what  is  often

forgotten  in  popular discussion of  the  subject.

This  is  that there is a long time lag  between  a

decision  taken  to build up a military  capability

and  the  actual  acquisition of  that  capability.

Between  two and four years pass by between placing

an order for military hardware



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



and  actual  delivery. Then it takes more  time  to

train men to use these weapons and equipment and an

even longer period to achieve a high level of skill

and  competence. The time lag varies  according  to

the  sophistication of the weapons systems and  may

range  from  a  minimum of three years  for  simple

military  weapons to seven to ten  years  for  more

advanced  weapons  systems.  This  means  that  you

cannot  wait  until you are in dire trouble  before

you decide to build up your defence forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my statement of 4th November, I promised

improved  pay  and  service  conditions   for   our

soldiers.  I  now mention some of the major  items.

Full  details  will  be published  shortly  in  the

Government  Gazette and in the Ministry of  Defence

Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of improving pay and general service

conditions is to make a career in the regular force

more  attractive so that the defence  service  will

receive  its  fair share of talented and  ambitious

young  men. At the same time, these improved  terms

of  service are an acknowledgement, albeit somewhat

belated, of the loyal and devoted service of  those

regular  officers  of the 1st and  2nd  Battalions,

Singapore Infantry Regiment, who had to bear such a

heavy  responsibility of leadership  in  the  rapid

expansion of our defence forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, the pay of Other Ranks will be

substantially increased. A soldier's  pay  consists

of three components his rank pay, his vocation pay,

depending  on whether he is a rifleman, a  cook,  a

vehicle mechanic, a machine gunner, or whatever  it

is,  and  a  third element, a new one,  called  the

technical  pay  supplement. Because  of  the  great

shortage of technical skills, our Armed Forces have

been  unable to recruit sufficient numbers  in  the

technical vocations at the going rates of pay. Rank

pay and vocation pay in these trades are inadequate

compared  to what the private sector is paying.  So

technical  pay  supplements are  introduced.  These

vary  between $40 p.m, and $400 p.m.  Let  me  give

some examples of the new pay Structure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a private in the army gets a rank pay

of $90, with an annual increment of $5 to a maximum

of $115 p.m. The new pay scale will be as follows:



<pre>

          $90: 95: 140x10-170.

</pre>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A corporal now gets a rank pay of $105x10-175.

The new pay scale will be:



<pre>

          $115: 170x10-$230.

</pre>



This  represents  an increase of $55  p.m, at  the

maximum. Similarly, a sergeant will get an increase

of $80 p.m, at the maximum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrant officers are reasonably well paid; for

instance,  Warrant officer I scale is  $350x20-450.

The new pay scale will be $390x20-470.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vocation pay will not be affected. Examples of

vocation pay are as follows. An army tailor gets an

additional  $5  p.m, to his rank  pay;  a  rifleman

Class  II, $10 p.m.; a mortarman $35 p.m. A  seaman

Class  I  gets an additional $75 p.m, while  a  jet

aircraft fitter Class I receives an additional $200

p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since those rates are inadequate, a new technical

pay supplement is to be paid to vocation grades  in

short  supply.  For  instance, a  corporal  in  his

second  year,  serving  as a  communication  fitter

Class  I,  now gets a total pay of $240 p.m.  Under

the  new  scheme, he will get a total pay  of  $415

p.m., consisting as follows:







<pre>

          Rank pay                $170

          Vocation pay            $125

          Technical Supplement    $120

                                  ----

                         Total    $415

                                  ====

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier who hits the jackpot is the

communication technician Class I. He is normally of

Warrant  officer rank, and his total pay, that  is,

rank, vocation and technical supplement, adds up to

between  $1,015  and  $1,160 p.m.  A  jet  aircraft

fitter  can look forward .to $920 p.m, if he  makes

the top grade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new rates of pay will come into effect as

from 1st January next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



The  revision in rank pay will cost the  Government

$10.3  million  a  year in additional  pay  if  the

establishment of the current year is filled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the retirement and disability

benefits  scheme  as well as the new  Army  Pension

regulations.  Hitherto,  these  were  a  result  of

historical  legacy of the time when  our  Army  was

part  of the Malaysian Army during 1963-65. Because

we had to cope with so many other pressing matters,

revision  of the inadequate retirement and  pension

benefits had to give way to more urgent tasks. This

can  no  longer  be delayed if we want  to  make  a

service  career  in the Army attractive  enough  to

draw and retain good quality officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full details will shortly be published in the

Government  Gazette and explained in a pamphlet.  I

will only give some of the highlights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldiers are engaged on two different terms of

service,  depending on a number of  considerations.

First,  they may be given a limit in the  terms  of

employment for definite periods, say three, five or

seven years, or they may be placed on the permanent

regular  service,  in the same  way  as  the  civil

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a sergeant on short service

engagement as an infantry section leader Class  II,

with   five  years'  service,  receives  a   paltry

gratuity  of $250 on his discharge. Under  the  new

scheme, his gratuity will be $2,565.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldiers on the permanent regular service who

retire on reaching the age of retirement will get a

larger  annual pension than present rates  provide.

For  instance, a major with five or  six  years  in

that rank on completion of 22 years' service in the

Army  will  get a pension of $660 p.m, as  against

$435 p.m, as of now. A Warrant officer I at present

gets  a  pension of only $122.55 p.m, after serving

21 years. Under the new scheme, he will get $214.20

p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a soldier dies in service, even when death

is  not due to service, such as illness or accident

outside  working  hours,  his  survivors   get   an

equivalent of one year's pay or a commuted  pension

or gratuity, whichever is the greater.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



This gratuity is payable whether the soldier is  on

permanent  regular  service or  full-time  national

service,  or a reservist called up for the  reserve

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a soldier in regular service dies as a

result  of  injury received in and attributable  to

service,  a  pension is payable to  his  widow  and

children, in addition to the gratuity of one year's

pay.  Take, for instance, the case of a Lt. Colonel

with twenty years' service drawing $1,850 p.m., who

dies   in   these  circumstances.  Under  the   new

regulations,  if  he  leaves  a  widow  with  three

children under 18, the family will get a pension of

$986.65   p.m.,  in  addition  to  a  gratuity   of

$27,750.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier who i5 disabled as a result of injury

received  in and attributable to military  service,

will receive an annual pension for the rest of  his

life,  depending on the degree of disablement,  the

length of his pensionable service and his pay.  For

instance, a captain with 10 years' service  drawing

a  pay  of  $1,000 p.m, who is totally disabled  in

this  way, will receive a pension of $750 p.m, for

the rest of his life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally children of soldiers whose death or

disablement  is  due  to  military  service,   will

receive assistance in meeting educational expenses.

This  will  extend to meeting the cost of  tuition,

board or living allowance of children, the cost  of

books,  materials, equipment and so  on  to  enable

them  to  complete  not  only  their  primary   and

secondary   education  but  also  their  university

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scholarships will be made available to

commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers

serving in the permanent regular service. Those not

in   the   regular   service,  such   as   national

servicemen,  may  be awarded such  scholarships  if

they   sign   on   for   regular   service.   These

scholarships  will be for study in universities  in

Singapore  and,  in  the  case  of  very   talented

soldiers, in universities abroad. Where the  course

of  study is in Singapore, the soldier will be paid

his  normal Army pay; if in an overseas university,

an  overseas  allowance  is  payable  in  addition.

Allowances vary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



according to rank, the country where the courses of

study are taken, and whether board and lodging  are

provided.   These  allowances  are  in  line   with

Government rates. However, soldiers studying abroad

will  not  be allowed to marry except with official

permission, and then only to Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Award of scholarships will normally be made on a

competitive   basis   among  eligible   candidates.

Selection  will be done by a Scholarship  Selection

Board  chaired  by  the  Chairman,  Public  Service

Commission.  In  return  for  benefits  under   the

scheme, a soldier will be required to enter into  a

bond  and  will  serve  in  the  Armed  Forces   on

completion of his course of study in the  same  way

as  other  Government-sponsored  scholarships.  For

soldiers of exceptional promise who do not have the

qualifications to enter a university,  arrangements

will be made to allow them time off to acquire such

qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards older officers who may not want to do

a   full   university  course,  special  short-term

courses  will  be provided to widen  their  general

knowledge,  to improve their level of articulation,

and  generally to enable them to conduct themselves

with  the  poise  and  deportment  expected  of  an

officer  of the Singapore Armed Forces. In addition

to these general courses, there will, of course, be

specialist  and professional training courses  both

in  Singapore and in the Training Schools and Staff

Colleges of friendly countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to H.S.C, students and their liability

for  national service. Those who have sat for their

examinations last month will be called  up  in  two

groups  next  year - 900 in January and  the  rest,

some 600, in April. Next year the university's term

will  begin  in July and not in May. Of  the  1,500

H.S.C, students expected to pass their examination,

about  1,200  will probably gain admission  to  the

local universities in 1971. It is proposed that  25

per  cent  of those accepted for admission  to  the

local universities be granted deferment. They  will

be  taken  out  of their units in July,  enter  the

university  and  complete  their  national  service

after graduation. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



rest,  those  who remain in the Armed Forces,  will

enter the university in July 1973. The April intake

will  not  have done two and a half years and  they

will  serve  out  the balance of  national  service

during the university long vacation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 25 per cent to be deferred will be selected

by  ballot, except for medical and dental students,

who  will be included automatically in this 25  per

cent.  Medical  and dental students  will  complete

their  -two and a half years' service on graduation

as medical and dental officers in the Armed Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of balloting differs from the method

used  this  year  when  preference  was  given   to

students  with  better examination  performance  as

well as students admitted to preferred courses such

as engineering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my statement of 4th November, I referred to

the  problem  of  getting  sufficient  numbers   of

officers  in  the support arms units, such  as  the

artillery, signals and engineers. Officers in these

units,  in  addition  to doing the  basic  infantry

officers'  course, have to undergo several  months'

specialist training in their particular arms.  With

the  reduction of officers' service from  three  to

two  and a half years, these support arms units may

be  hard  pressed if all national service  officers

leave after two and a half years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to award a bounty to national service

officers  who  volunteer to stay  for  another  six

months.   The  amount  of  the  bounty   is   under

negotiation with the Treasury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of officers' service from three to

two  and a half years for next year's intake brings

up  the  problem of equitable treatment  for  those

enlisted before 1971. It -may be possible to reduce

the  term  of  service  of  some  national  service

officers  and allow them the option of leaving  the

Army  before  the  full  three  years.  It  is  not

possible  to  extend this to all officers,  but  it

seems  to  me  that  on grounds  of  equity,  those

officers who were born before 1-1-49 have the first

claim  for preferential treatment in this  respect.

The subject is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



under  study in my Ministry and a decision will  be

taken shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guiding principle in national service

enlistment  policy should be absolutely  equal  and

fair  treatment  for all persons belonging  to  the

same  category. Whether a boy is the son of a Prime

Minister,  or  of  a banker or a cobbler  makes  no

difference  to  his  service liability.  A  further

ideal  would  be  to observe an unchanging  set  of

selection  criteria  for all  time.  Unfortunately,

this  is  not  always possible as the rate  of  our

military   build-up  must  change   with   changing

circumstances.  This has given rise to  unavoidable

disparity and unavoidable discontent and, as far as

possible,  we  have  tried to meet  the  legitimate

grievances  of those who have felt that  they  have

been  unfairly  treated. The  fact  that  in  large

measure  these people have been victims  of  chance

does  not  assuage their feelings, but I  think  it

will be generally conceded that we have gone as far

as we could



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved terms and conditions of service

which  are outlined will be promulgated shortly  in

official  orders  and Gazette notifications.  These

will  be  supplemented  by  explanatory  pamphlets.

These improved terms are not ungenerous, but  I  do

not  think that we have been over-generous. Members

of  the  Singapore Armed Forces  lead  a  hard  and

strenuous life while training in peace time. In war

time  they risk their lives in the defence  of  our

Republic. We should not do less than what  we  have

to recompense them in the way of material award for

themselves  and  security of livelihood  for  their

wives and children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, after having

heard  the Minister of Defence giving this House  a

very  clear and vivid policy on enlistment, I  find

that  he  has  taken  up  several  points  which  I

intended  to raise under this amendment  Bill,  and

this has now left me with very little ground indeed

to cover. Nevertheless, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



wish  to  proceed ahead. The main  purpose  of  the

Enlistment (Amendment) Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact  section 12 of the Enlistment Act,  1970,  in

order  to  make those persons who are  serving  two

years  in  full-time national service and  who  are

above the rank of lance-corporal and those who have

been selected for officer training, liable to serve

a period of two and a half years. This is a correct

move  and  I shall not be out of step to  touch  on

some  other  aspects of the enlistment policy.  But

should I appear to digress from the main purpose of

debating on the intention of the Bill whilst in the

process  of  putting  my views  across  by  way  of

illustration, I think it merely serves to reinforce

my views which I strongly hold. Sir, I do seek your

indulgence and patience in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister of Defence mentioned pay

increases all round by way of basic pay as well  as

vocational  allowance and other forms  of  monetary

incentives. This, I think, would be most welcome to

all  members of the Singapore Armed Forces. In this

connection, I had occasion at one time to  table  a

question in the House for oral answer by the former

Minister of Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will enable the Singapore Armed Forces

to  be  better equipped in its tremendous  task  of

building up a credible defence capability and  will

benefit  those university graduates who  have  been

selected for officer training and who will now have

to  serve  only  two and a half  years  instead  of

three.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, I would like to touch on some

other  aspects relating to enlistment  policy.  The

Minister  of Defence on 4th November in this  House

clarified  certain  points  and  remarked  on  what

appeared  in the newspapers prior to his speech  on

4th  November. The articles that were  featured  so

prominently   in  the  newspapers  were   so-called

grouses  and I do not know why they were published.

Some  of them were completely unfounded and untrue.

For  example,  I remember reading  in  one  of  the

papers  an  article captioned "S.A.F.T.I, chicken"

which  went  on  to  state that the  meat  .of  the

chicken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



served  in  the  Singapore  Armed  Forces  Training

Institute was as tough as rubber and that it  could

not  be  eaten. I would like to state h-ere that  I

know  as  a  fact that this is not  true.  Such  an

article  appears to me to be more than  mischievous

and I strongly urge the Minister of Defence to take

serious note of this, because I am of the view that

the authors of such erroneous and untrue statements

appearing in certain responsible newspapers,  which

after  all  do  not play a role in giving  accurate

news  to  the public, should be well aware  of  the

fact that Singapore needs time to build up its  own

defence capability. I am not saying that we do  not

have problems. Even those countries with very well-equipped  armies  and  military  might  also   have

problems  of their own. To those writers who  wrote

to   these  newspapers,  whether  intentionally  or

unintentionally, I would suggest to them that  they

redirect  their  complaints  to  the  Ministry   of

Defence. I am not trying to take on the role of the

Defence Minister when I make this statement. What I

mean is that the Ministry of Defence should set  up

a  committee,  though I understand  that  there  is

already a committee known as the Welfare Committee.

The   Minister  may  wish  to  consider  appointing

welfare officers in each unit so that any person or

persons of any rank in a particular unit can go  up

to  them  if  they have a personal problem  or  any

other grievances to bring up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing strikes me most forcefully when I was

fortunate   enough   to  be   a   member   of   the

parliamentary  group that visited  several  of  our

defence  establishments. It was at S.A.F.T.I, that

we  had  the opportunity to come face to face  with

national  servicemen who were university graduates.

From  my personal experience and my encounter  with

them,  I  felt  that quite a good  number  of  them

simply   had  no  heart  to  serve  as  responsible

citizens.  I  cannot understand  this  attitude.  I

would have thought that, being university graduates

with  a higher level of intellect, they would  have

brought up more serious problems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



or  issues  than "We have not got our pay  for  the

last six months!", or minor grievances about toilet

paper and low water pressure. Problems of this sort

could  have  been sorted out with their platoon  or

company  commanders. I hope that  the  Minister  of

Defence will look into this also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it is a fact that there are many other

university  graduates  who have  been  going  about

their   duties  without  the  slightest  signs   of

discontentment.  In  fact,  they  accept   national

service as a challenging task and more as a duty on

their  part as citizens of Singapore. To this group

of people, I would like to pay my tribute publicly.

However,  to the other group of national servicemen

whom  I have mentioned earlier, I would suggest  to

the  Minister of Defence that we should send  these

graduates  for  full combat training.  When  I  say

"full  combat  training", I think the  Minister  of

State  of  Defence knows exactly  what  it  is  all

about. It is, of course, a very tough course. Why I

suggest  this, Sir, is to get this lot of graduates

to  undergo  such  a  course and reorientate  their

minds  to  come up to a level with their intellect.

In  other  words, to give them the necessary  brawn

though they may possess the necessary intellect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been pointed out also that the brunt of

Singapore's  survival  will fall  more  heavily  on

people with brains. Therefore, I think people  with

a  good brain but in a weak physical condition will

be  of no good to us, and full combat training  for

these  people will certainly go a long way  towards

securing a better future for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wanted to touch on the question of giving

more  scholarships to members of the  Armed  Forces

who show special aptitudes in various categories of

skills.  But  the  Minister  of  Defence  has  very

explicitly  enlightened this House  on  how  he  is

going  to give such awards to enable them to render

better   service.   On  that  note,   I   give   my

wholehearted support to this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr

Govindasamy, Sir, I would just like to add  a  note

here,  that I disagree with what my colleague,  the

Member  for  Punggol,  has  suggested  about  using

combat training to reorientate the attitude of some

of  the  graduate national servicemen. I  think  we

have  to  understand that these  people  have  some

legitimate grouses and the Minister of Defence  has

tried  very hard to remedy some of them. I  do  not

think  we  should at any stage give the  impression

that  national service, or any part of it,  is,  or

will be, used as a punitive device for any purpose.

I  think that will defeat the entire purpose of the

programme. By all means, let us use exhortation and

incentive, but do not let us use the stick for this

purpose,  because  what we want ultimately  is  the

correct  attitude  on  the  part  of  everybody  in

Singapore,  whether  graduates or  non-graduates  -

namely,  the  willingness,  the  proper  spirit  to

defend  this republic of ours. Part of the attitude

of  these  graduates lies in our  very  success  in

creating opportunities, which are so many, and  for

those  who  have just come out from the university,

they   are   eager  to  get  into  industry,   into

Government  and so on. They see all  the  promotion

prospects  and  they work hard.  In  the  meantime,

since  some of them have been held back by national

service  while their colleagues have had  a  faster

start  in  industry, they feel that they have  lost

out  in  the process. I would appeal to Members  of

Parliament  here not to think in terms of  national

service  in this fashion, namely, to punish  people

or  even  to use punishment to reorientate people's

attitudes.



<br><br>4.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I strongly

beg  to differ from the Member for Whampoa,  but  I

would  like to clarify. What I suggested was not  a

punitive  measure  -  to punish  anybody.  National

service,  as the Minister of Defence has  just  now

stated,  should be applied equally to all. That  is

why  I suggested that probably full combat training

would do a lot of good to some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



of  our  graduates. After all, as has been admitted

by  the  Member for Whampoa, graduates passing  out

from   the   university  look  forward  to   better

prospects  in  jobs,  etc. I  myself  served  as  a

volunteer  from 1960 to 1963, and in  the  People's

Defence  Force  from 1966 till now,  as  have  some

Members  of Parliament. Perhaps I would suggest  to

my  colleague, the Member for Whampoa, to join  the

P.D.F, as a start.



<br><br>4.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir,

I  did  not  intend  to speak at  this  sitting  of

Parliament  as I have not fully recovered  from  my

recent illness. However, the Member for Whampoa has

prompted me to add a few points in support  of  the

Minister, but I would imagine this support will  go

directly to the Member for Punggol. When the Member

for  Punggol  spoke on the subject, he  spoke  with

authority.  He  is still actively  serving  in  the

People's Defence Force. He has tasted the so-called

"S.A.F.T.I, chicken"  and  not  the   "S.A.F.T.I.

chicken"  in the other connotation of the word.  He

has  tasted army food, slept, trained, laughed with

and enjoyed the company of ordinary soldiers. It is

not  for  me  here  to claim too  much  credit  for

myself, but I am afraid I have to mention one fact,

that  is, I myself am also involved in the training

in  the army. I have the advantage or disadvantage,

the honour or dishonour, of leading some university

graduates and undergraduates in training,  some  of

whom  might be students in the university at  which

the Member for Whampoa is lecturing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent sufficient time with these

privates.  All the grouses they raised to  me  were

nothing new, nothing that we do not know of. We are

just experiencing the teething troubles of building

up  our  defence capability. There  are  a  lot  of

problems that we have to solve, but certainly there

are  bigger problems for us to think about than  to

grumble  about educational allowances  and  so  on.

Sir,  I  believe that if we pay a man $25 more  for

his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



educational allowance, that $25 does not  make  him

shoot  any  better, run any faster  or  fight  more

courageously than an ordinary private. Some of them

are  reluctant leaders themselves. I do  not  agree

that  by  merely giving them more money, they  will

make better soldiers. However, we have to recognise

the  additional years they spent in the  university

and  their thinking capacity. Because of  that,  we

feel  that it is fair to pay them a little bit more

than  a private, a corporal or even an officer  who

is not a graduate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what disturbs me is that the word

"leadership" to a graduate or an undergraduate  has

two   meanings.   I  regard  them   as   leadership

potential, but they regard themselves as  potential

leadership. They are two different things, Sir.  On

the one hand, they claim to be potential leaders of

the  country. But when we call upon them  to  serve

the  nation,  they  say, "No." We  all  agree  that

national service is good. We all agree that  it  is

necessary. But the question they ask is: who is  to

serve, when to serve, and where to serve? Who is to

serve - preferably not they, the graduates. When to

serve  -  preferably not until they get  themselves

firmly  established  in the  commercial  world,  by

which  time  it might be too late for  them  to  be

called  up  at all. And where to serve - preferably

in  the  less  vigorous of the  three  branches  of

national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to be misunderstood on what I

speak  here  today, because I am not  a  university

graduate.  There  is no question of  what  we  call

"sour  grapes". But I would like to  enlighten  the

House, firstly, on my own views on the matter  and,

secondly, on my experience in the Armed Forces.  If

the  university  graduates  are  not  regarded   as

leadership  potential or if  they  are  not  to  be

looked upon for leadership, where else can we  look

for  leadership,  be  it for the  country,  in  the

business  community, in the Government, or  in  the

Armed Forces? If this is their attitude - just  opt

themselves  out  as  far  as  Army  leadership   is

concerned; but if they are put in as bank managers,

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



are  all  for  it  -  then  we  must  correct  that

attitude.  They  may not be conscious  of  it,  but

subconsciously they feel that way, Sir,If  we  do

not  regard  the  university as the incubator  from

which to tap our leadership, where else can we  get

them?  Something must be wrong with our educational

system.  If  we  have  to get our  leadership  from

primary  and  secondary  schools,  because  in  the

universities the graduates just opt out, where will

that lead us, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really regard them as the reluctant leadership.

Surely   they  should  feel  that  they   have   an

obligation to discharge to the community, as I have

said  both inside and outside the House.  The  fact

that they have undergone a course in the university

and have graduated with a B.A, or B.Sc, degree,  or

better  still  a  Master's degree or  a  Doctorate,

shows  that  they have sufficient  grey  matter  in

them. But if they lack this grey matter, nobody  is

to  be  blamed. They should realise that  the  fact

that they can go through all stages of education up

to  university level is only because as a community

in  Singapore we provide them' with the opportunity

to  do  so. In my time, Sir, kindergarten education

was  `either  not heard of or it was  considered  a

luxury.   But   today  you  have  to   go   through

kindergarten,  six  years of primary  school,  then

secondary school and the Higher School Certificate,

and  finally the university. If these persons  were

born in the Congo - I refer to the Congo only as  a

geographical entity and not as a republic or  as  a

sovereign  state - with a land area  50  times  the

size  of  Singapore and Malaysia put together,  and

with  a  population  very much more  than  that  of

Singapore  and  Malaysia put  together,  and  where

there  are  only  23 secondary schools,  a  fact  I

gathered  from  a report - there is no  chance  for

them to be graduates, or even have the advantage of

a  kindergarten  or primary school education.  They

would  be  tilling  the  soil,  cutting  up  banana

plantains, or may be in even worse occupations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if a university graduate in Singapore should

look at his responsibility to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



the community in the perspective that he is what he

is  today  because the community has  provided  him

with  these ,opportunities, then there is no better

way  for  him  to discharge his obligation  to  the

community  than  by doing national  service.  True,

Sir,  a  graduate  can  get  a  better  salary   or

establish  a  better  economic  standing   in   the

commercial world, but if we were to run  our  Armed

Forces  with leadership material coming  only  from

the  primary  schools, then these graduates  having

established  themselves as millionaires  or  multi-millionaires,  after some years of  hard  work,  of

course, might wake up one fine morning to find that

their million dollars might be worth half a cent or

might not be worth anything at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really do not see why these people should

adopt such an attitude towards national service. As

I  have said, I did not intend to speak today,  but

having been provoked by the hon. Member, I have  to

give  my  views  which I would like  the  House  to

share.



<br><br>4.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Govindasamy, Sir, as the Minister has pointed

out  just now, this Bill expresses our stand on the

question of national service the implementation  of

which  has  had satisfactory results.  No  one  can

doubt  that  national service is  essential  to  an

independent   country.  It  is  also  a   necessary

obligation  on  the part of our citizens.  For  the

last  few years most of our citizens have responded

well  and  fully  supported  and  participated   in

national  service.  But  there  are  a  number   of

anomalies  or defects in the system,  and  we  must

always  seek to remedy them whenever we come across

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise four or five points here

and  I  hope  the Minister will explain  them.  The

first  point  is  this. I have received  complaints

from  many parents whose one and only son has  been

called  up  for national service. The complaint  is

that  their only son has a job which pays him  $100

to $200 every month to support his family. In order

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



satisfy  the  requirements  of  the  law,  when  he

reaches  the  appropriate age group he  has  to  be

called up for full-time national service training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindasamy, Sir, of course the Minister realises that there is a large difference between the allowance a national serviceman gets and the salary he earns outside. Every month he only gets about $100 while in national service and deductions have to be made for food. So what he can take home

is  only  a  very meagre sum. I wonder whether  the

Minister can sympathetically consider allowing such

boys to do part-time national service only. In this

way  we  can,  on the one hand, give  him  military

training,  and,  on  the other hand,  we  will  not

disrupt the livelihood of these families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is about

those  university graduates born in  1946  and  who

have already been called up for national service. I

have  received a complaint about such a  case.  The

boy  was  called up and has so far done  about  six

months' training. Last month the Minister announced

a  new policy to exempt those born before 1949 from

full-time national service, and to allow them to do

part-time  national service. I would  Jike  to  ask

whether  those graduates who were born in 1946  can

be allowed to do part-time national service, rather

than full-time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to raise is this.

Our  Government has given the assurance  that  jobs

would be found quickly for those who have completed

two years' national service. But in point of fact I

have  received  many  complaints  from  these   ex-servicemen   in  my  meet-the-people  sessions   in

Sembawang. The complaints are that they have waited

for  as  long as three months and are still without

jobs. Although we have a Director of Employment  to

allocate  jobs and there are many commercial  firms

which  require people to fill their vacancies,  how

is  it that these ex-servicemen still have to  wait

for such a long time? Is it because the Director is

inefficient?  I  would like  the  Minister  to  pay

attention to these complaints.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is in regard to requests from

national   servicemen  to  go   on   honeymoon.   I

understand that the Ministry gives them only  three

days  for  a  honeymoon. I  think  this  is  rather

inhuman.  We should allow the husband and  wife  to

enjoy  a longer honeymoon. Three days is too short,

I   wonder  if  the  Minister  will  consider  this

question sympathetically and grant these people who

are getting married a longer leave, say, a week  or

two weeks; perhaps a month will be ideal.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, may I reply to the points

raised  by  Members in the reverse order  in  which

they spoke?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Member for Sembawang. As

regards  his  point whether the only  son,  who  is

alleged  to  be  able to earn quite easily  between

$100  and $200 a month, should not be exempted from

full-time national service, much as I would like to

oblige him, the answer is no. My advice is for  the

only son to work harder in the army so that he  can

raise  himself to the rank of corporal,  where  his

pay will be more than $200 a month, and in addition

he will get board and lodging worth at least $80 to

$90  a month. So he will be better off in the  Army

if he works hard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards graduates born before 1st January,

1949,  I have already dealt with the matter  in  my

Second Reading speech. I do not have anything  more

to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding jobs for reservists, the majority of

them - I do not have the exact number - I think

five or six thousand reservists who have left

the army, more than 80 per cent of them have

already found employment. Those who cannot find

jobs after three months are usually those who

are quite pernickety. They think they are worth

more than what prospective employers value their

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards extending the honeymoon period, my

advice to national servicemen is to wait until they

complete their national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Stamford has passed some very

scathing remarks about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



graduates  in  the army. I am afraid  1  completely

disagree  with  nearly  all  he  `has  said   about

graduates and undergraduates. He may not  be  aware

of the fact that the number of graduates who become

officers is much larger than that of non-graduates.

In  fact,  as of now, there are something like  150

graduates  who are officers in combat units.  I  do

not    think   this   reflects   a   lackadaisical,

unpatriotic  or negative attitude towards  national

service  and towards national leadership. The  vast

majority   of   graduates  take  national   service

seriously and responsibly, and have responded  very

well to the challenge of army life. There are a few

black  sheep  in  any flock,  but  that  is  to  be

expected.  We must remember that in doing  national

service,  graduates, as against non-graduates,  are

at a disadvantage in two respects. First, they lose

more  in  the army than when compared to what  they

could have earned outside the army. Secondly, it is

only  graduates who were born before  1st  January,

1949, who have been called up, in this respect,  we

may  say that the graduates have been discriminated

against.  But it was necessary for us at that  time

to  get  a large number of officer material and  we

had  to  do  this.  I think the  graduates  have  a

genuine  grievance  when they  are  called  up  for

national  service, and I think it is best  that  we

face up to it and try to redress the situation  and

adjust  the  position as best we  can.  To  make  a

sweeping  condemnation, as the Member for  Stamford

did, is quite unhelpful, unjust and unfair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I entirely agree with the Member for Whampoa that

we  must  not use national service as  a  means  of

punishing people. I am sure the Member for  Punggol

agrees with me that this was not his intention when

he said that we should do away with the distinction

between  service officers and combat  officers.  In

fact,  this category of service officers is  rather

special.  It was created to meet the special  needs

of  a  year  or  two  ago when there  was  a  great

shortage of staff officers both in the field units,

in the Ministry and in the logistics bases. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



had  to  be turned out in large numbers  and  in  a

great  hurry. I think it is bad to have two classes

of  officers, one service and one combat, with  the

service  officer  being at a  disadvantage  in  the

sense  that  he  is  rather  an  inferior  sort  of

individual. I intend to discontinue the practice of

training  service officers. In future all  officers

in  the  army will do full combat training, and  if

they are required to do staff duties, there will be

special  courses  for them to attend  in  order  to

acquire the necessary skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards grievances, all soldiers in all armies

have  grievances, whether in Singapore, in Britain,

in  America or any other places. I suspect even the

Chinese  Communist Army soldiers  have  grievances.

This  is  rather odd because it is unlike the  navy

and  the  air force. Soldiers belly-ache,  soldiers

gripe.  When  we meet them we must always  bear  in

mind that this is in the nature of things, like the

sun rising in the east and setting in the west. You

give  them a hearing and that helps and makes  them

feel better for it. Occasionally troubles come  out

in  the  open  and  if they could be  remedied,  of

course, one remedies them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the water pressure in the - Singapore Armed

Forces Training Institute is low. I suspect this is

because  the  P.U.B, has installed a  rather  small

diameter  pipe. Until larger pipes go to that  part

of  Singapore, the soldiers will always be short of

water. Too bad for them! But that is the way it is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has suggested that we

appoint welfare officers in the units to listen  to

grievances.  Actually, listening to the  grievances

of  soldiers is the job for the commanding officer,

of   a   platoon,  company  or  battalion.  A  good

commander  will  always  listen  to  his  soldiers'

troubles  and tales of woe and tries to  help  them

out  as  best  he can. I do not think we  need  any

special  arrangements  about  this.  This  is   the

responsibility  of  the platoon  commander  or  the

company commander.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards newspaper criticisms, I have been 11

years  in  the  political game and my epidermis  is

quite thick. Nothing any newspaper says about me or

the  Government  or the P.A.P, bothers  me  in  the

least.  I think the Member for Punggol need not  be

so   sensitive   to   newspaper  criticisms   about

S.A.F.T.I, chickens or, for that matter, about  any

other aspects. Newspapers are free to say what they

like. This is a democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Is it true?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If they give wrong

information, it is open to the aggrieved  party  to

correct it. As far as I know, they have always been

quite   reasonable  in  printing  another  person's

version.   So  on  newspaper  criticisms,   may   I

recommend a "thick epidermis"? Of course, there are

legal restrictions on what newspapers can write  on

military  affairs. First, they cannot be  party  to

soldiers  breaking the Queens regulations.  1  have

forgotten  the  number of the  regulation,  but  it

forbids soldiers bringing their grievances into the

open  and  we  have  had  to  introduce  subsidiary

legislation to tell the newspapers they  cannot  do

it,  nor  can  they print sensitive information  on

military    affairs.   Subject   to    these    two

restrictions, the newspapers are free to  say  what

they like, and good luck to them.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present proviso to subsection (2) of

section  11 of the Central Provident Fund Ordinance

(Chapter 150) as it stands allows the Board,  where

it  has  approved  a member's withdrawal  from  the

Fund, to credit interest to his contribution at the

fixed rate of two and a half per cent for the  year

in  which  the withdrawal takes place, in spite  of

the fact that the rate of interest declared for the

previous  year is in excess of two and a  half  per

cent.  As  the Board has declared interest  at  the

rate  of  five  and a half per cent  per  annum  to

members'  contributions  since  1967,  the  present

proviso  has been the subject of much criticism  by

contributors  of  the  Fund, especially  when  they

withdraw  their contributions late in the year.  To

remove this manifestly unfair proviso, clause 2  of

the Bill has been introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause will enable the Central Provident

Fund  Board to compute interest payable to a member

for the year in which he withdraws from the Fund at

the same rate as that declared by the Board for the

previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 (2) of the C.P.F. Ordinance allows a

member  of the Fund who is not a Singapore  citizen

to  withdraw from the Fund after he has left or  is

about to leave Malaya permanently with no intention

to  return  thereto. As Malaya has been defined  to

include  the  States of Malaya, what  is  now  West

Malaysia, and Singapore, it has been felt that this

section of the Ordinance is unduly restrictive  and

does  not  allow  a member of the  Fund  who  is  a

Malaysian  citizen to withdraw from the Fund  where

there  are  good reasons for withdrawal,  that  is,

when  he  wishes  to  go back  permanently  to  his

country of domicile. To overcome this restriction,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



clause  3  of  the Bill has  therefore  been

introduced   to  enable  a  Malaysian  citizen   to

withdraw  from the Fund if he has left or is  about

to  leave  Singapore permanently for the States  of

Malaya,   that   is  West  Malaysia,   under   such

circumstances as are approved by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill is introduced to facilitate

administration of the Ordinance in connection  with

claims  for  withdrawal. Under  subsection  (1)  of

section  13  of the Ordinance, when  a  member  who

continues  to be employed withdraws from the  Fund,

the  contributions paid for the month in which  the

withdrawal  is  authorised and  for  the  following

month  must be paid to him when they are  received,

although  contributions for later  months  must  be

retained in the Fund until such time as the  member

is again entitled to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to subsection (1) of section 13 by

clause  4  of  the Bill will enable  the  Board  to

finalise  claims  for withdrawal  more  quickly  by

giving  it  a discretion to leave all contributions

received  from  the member after his withdrawal  in

his  account  until such time as he  again  becomes

qualified to withdraw.

appear   to  be  satisfactory  from  the   lenders'

viewpoint,  and  after  study  of  other   mortgage

systems    and   consultations   with   shipowners,

international  financial  institutions  and   legal

firms,  a  set  of  mortgage legislation  has  been

drafted  in  the  form of the Bill now  before  the

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective is to formulate a simple and

effective system which will make it attractive  for

banks  and financial institutions to finance  ships

under  the Singapore flag. Like any other  valuable

property, a ship may be pledged as a security for a

loan or some other form of financial consideration,

and  it  is common practice for ships to  be  built

with  concessional financing based on the  mortgage

of  the  ship.  The  interests  of  the  mortgagee,

namely, the lender, are protected through a  system

of registering mortgages, and any interested person

may sight the register book in Singapore on payment

of  a  small fee, or alternatively a certified copy

of the register may be provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to introduce specific provisions

in  the  Ordinance  to deal with  the  mortgage  of

Singapore ships and matters such as the rights  and

powers  of  the  mortgagee  and  the  priority   of

mortgages.  The following important provisions  may

be noted:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a mortgagor, i.e., the ship-owner, is

obliged to disclose in writing to the mortgagee the

existence  of any prior mortgage or other liability

before   executing  the  mortgage.   This   is   an

additional safeguard for the lenders of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a mortgage may be executed on a ship

holding  a provisional certificate of registration.

If  a  bank is prepared to accept a mortgage  on  a

provisional certificate of registration,  there  is

no   reason  to  refuse  the  registration  of  the

mortgage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a mortgage executed outside Singapore

may  be recorded by the Registrar in Singapore.  At

present all mortgages executed outside Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



must  be produced before the Registrar in Singapore for  sighting  and then registered, the

registered time  being the time the mortgage was produced  and approved  for  registration by the

Registrar.  This does   not  appear  to  be  a  practical  procedure particularly in the case of new

buildings, where it is  necessary to register the new ship at the  time of   delivery  and

simultaneously  to  record  the mortgage. Under the new system, a mortgage executed outside Singapore

will be approved and recorded  by the   Registrar   in   Singapore   and   the   ship registration

formalities simultaneously  completed over  the  telephone.  This  arrangement  has  been stressed  by

international financial  institutions and maritime lawyers as being most important.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I must first congratulate the

Minister  on  introducing  this  Bill  which  would

certainly enable Singapore to advance its interests

in the running of a registry of convenience. Having

listened  to the Minister's speech, I was concerned

with  his  remarks  about  the  registration  of  a

mortgage against the provisional registration of  a

vessel.  The problem, in fact, amounts to this.  If

you  have a person making a loan against a new ship

that  is being built as security, the lender would,

of  course, want to be properly secured in  law.  I

notice  that it would be possible for a  lender  to

register   a   mortgage  against  the   provisional

registration of a ship, but the question  is,  what

would  happen  if the provisional registration  did

not   go  through  and  become  a  complete   legal

registration?  Is  the  lender  affected   to   his

disadvantage?  If he is, would it not  be  possible

for  him  to  step into the shoes of the  purchaser

himself    and   proceed   with   the   provisional

registration    and   convert   it    into    legal

registration? If this cannot be done, his  interest

is  not secured as against other legal interests in

the  vessel.  I wonder if the Minister  would  look

into this question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, considering the fact that

the Member for Bukit Panjang is legally trained and

I  am  an ordinary layman, I do not think I  should

attempt to answer his technical question except  to

say  that in drafting this Bill we have taken  into

account  the legal aspects, consulted with  various

ship-owners    in   Singapore   and   international

financial  institutions. I  must  therefore  assume

that  the  point  which the Member has  raised  has

already  been taken into account; but, as mentioned

in  my  speech just now, the present provisions  do

make it necessary for the mortgagor, the person who

owns  the  ship,  to  disclose in  writing  to  the

mortgagee  the  existence of any prior  commitment.

This,  therefore,  should be sufficient  and  clear

enough for the second man who steps in that when he

does  lend  extra money, there is someone  who  has

priority  and rights over his. I will say that  the

Member's  point will be considered and  perhaps  he

will  be  given  a full answer after  it  has  been

cleared with the Solicitor-General's Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a second time and committed

to a committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. [Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>NGEE ANN TECHNICAL COLLEGE (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ngee Ann Technical College was established in

1963  by  the  Ngee Ann Kongsi and  was  registered

under   the   Education  Ordinance  as  a   private

institution financed and administered by  the  Ngee

Ann Kongsi. Since then, three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



teams of experts have been invited to make detailed

studies  on  the functions and development  of  the

College. All of them recommended drastic changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967, following the acceptance by the Ngee Ann

Kongsi  of  the  recommendations contained  in  the

Thong  Saw  Pak  Report,  Ngee  Ann-  College   was

reconstituted by statute (Number 28 of  1967)  with

its management vested in a Council, and the College

was  to  concentrate  on technical  and  commercial

courses  and  phasing  out  the  existing  academic

courses.  The  College officially became  known  as

Ngee Ann Technical College following the passing of

the Ngee Ann Amendment Act in 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recently negotiated a loan of $9

million  with  the Asian Development Bank  for  the

development of the College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-year expansion programme will provide

educational   facilities  to  serve   the   student

population of about 3,000 compared with the present

enrolment of 900.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the rate of expansion in our economic

development  is  sustained at  the  present  level,

there  will be greater demand for skilled personnel

as  well  as  trained executives. It  is  therefore

reasonable  to assume that there will be continuous

expansion of the College after the project period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficulties were encountered in the negotiations

with  the  Asian Development Bank for the  loan  on

account of the peculiar position of the College  in

that  it  did not own the land on which development

was  to have taken place. The granting of the  loan

is  conditional upon the alienation of the land  at

Clementi Road to the College within a period of  90

days from the date of the signing of the agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of section 17 (b) of the

Ngee  Ann  Technical College Act,  the  income  and

property of the College shall, inter alia,  include

such immovable property as the Ngee Ann Kongsi may,

subject to the provisions of section 20 of the Ngee

Ann Kongsi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



(Incorporation) Ordinance, alienate  or  donate  to

the  College. Section 20 provides that the Ngee Ann

Kongsi  will have to apply for leave of the Supreme

Court to alienate or donate land to the College and

that  no  application for such leave shall be  made

without  a  resolution  being  first  passed  at  a

general  meeting  of  the  members  held  for  this

purpose.  When  the  Ngee Ann Kongsi  accepted  the

Thong Saw Pak Report which, inter alia, recommended

that the properties at Clementi Road be endowed  to

the  College, the Committee of Management  of  Ngee

Ann Kongsi in the same year passed a resolution  to

rent  out  the  property at Clementi  Road  to  the

College  at a nominal sum of one dollar  per  annum

and to donate to the College 50 per cent of its net

income  or $100,000 annually whichever is  more.  A

few   days   ago   the  Ngee  Ann  Kongsi   at   an

extraordinary general meeting passed  a  resolution

to  donate approximately 40 acres of land  together

with  the  property  thereon  to  the  College  for

development.  It will now take some  time  for  the

legal process to be completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that further adjustment of the

land may be necessary for future expansion plans of

the  College.  To  avoid  this  tedious  and  time-consuming process of alienation of land to Ngee Ann

Technical  College which was originally established

by  the Ngee Ann Kongsi themselves, it is necessary

to  amend  section  17 of the  Ngee  Ann  Technical

College  Act as proposed in the present Bill.  This

will  enable  the Ngee Ann Kongsi  to  alienate  or

donate  immovable property to the  College  by  the

Management  Committee of the Kongsi notwithstanding

the  procedures laid down in section 20 of the Ngee

Ann  Kongsi  (Incorporation) Ordinance. The  future

development  of  the  College  will  then  not   be

unnecessarily hampered as has happened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Govindasamy,

Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to raise

a question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



I  believe  Ngee  Ann Technical  College  is  still

without  a permanent principal. En view of all  the

extensive   projects  coming  up,  surely   it   is

important  to see that the College finds  itself  a

Principal instead of having the Minister  of  State

for  Education  continuing to act as  Principal  of

Ngee   Ann  Technical  College.  Can  I  have  some

clarification, please?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, first

of  all, a point of clarification. The Minister  of

State  for  Education does not act as the Principal

of  Ngee  Ann  Technical College. He  is  only  the

Chairman of the Executive Committee. In the absence

of the Principal, he carries out his duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the College has advertised, not less than

four times, both locally and internationally, for a

suitable candidate to head the College but  without

much success. I am, however, pleased to report that

certain  headway  has  been  made  in  getting  the

services  of an expert, through the loan agreement,

to  serve during the project period as Principal of

the College.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> May I ask the Minister of

State  what  accounts for the lack  of  success  in

getting  a  Principal? Is it because the salary  is

low  or  because  we  have not cast  the  net  wide

enough?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> The net has been cast as wide

as  possible. The post of Principal of the  College

has   been  advertised  in  all  the  international

journals  and  in  the newspapers of  many  leading

cities as well as locally. The remuneration of  the

Principal  must be comparable to that of the  other

institutes  of  higher  learning.  It   cannot   be

artificially  raised  just  to  attract  the  right

person. This would he a very shortsighted policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now adequate medical knowledge of the

effects  of nicotine on health to arouse  worldwide

concern over the hazards of cigarette smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore are attempting to build a healthy

and  rugged  society. We are sparing no  effort  to

create  a clean and pollution-free environment  for

our people. It would be logically odd if, after all

the  trouble we have gone through to ensure a clean

environment,  we  ignore the hazards  of  cigarette

smoking  and thus fail to safeguard the  health  of

our  community, particularly that of the young  who

form the bulk of our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health will explain later in more detail how smoking can cause harm to the health of a person. But, briefly, I was told that nicotine, which is the most important ingredient in tobacco, once left loose into a person's system stimulates and depresses the nerves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoker's blood pressure goes up and his heart

rate   increases.  Research  has  established  that

cigarette smoking is the main cause of lung cancer.

A  host  of  other diseases are also  known  to  be

caused  by  cigarette smoking --chronic bronchitis,

peptic  ulcers, high blood pressure, heart diseases

and what have you. It has been statistically proved

that where all other things are equal, a non-smoker

enjoys a longer life-span than a smoker.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, by the passing of the Prohibition of

Smoking  in Certain Places Bill, we have  tried  to

"purify"   cinemas,  theatres  and  other  specific

public  places so that the enjoyment  of  the  many

will not be marred by the few who are smokers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must safeguard our young population against

persistent advertising by cigarette and advertising

firms  inducing  people to smoke  and  to  try  new

brands  of  cigarettes, often  on  the  untrue  but

persuasive assumptions and implications that people

must  get the "taste", that cigarettes are  equated

with  success in life, that smoking is one  of  the

best things in life, that smoking certain brands of

cigarettes  is synonymous with social exclusiveness

and prestige, and other equally misleading slogans.

Such  blandishments, if not checked  in  time,  can

induce  many of our young people to take up smoking

in order to belong to the in-group. The first false

step  often results in the young person becoming  a

habitual smoker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case against cigarette advertising,

irrespective  of  what benefits  cigarette  smoking

itself may bring to any particular person or groups

of  persons,  is overwhelmingly strong.  We  cannot

stop  anyone from smoking. But we can and  we  must

stop the use of our mass media to glorify smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be interested to learn that the

World  Health Organisation at its 23rd Assembly  on

15th  May, 1970, adopted a report prepared  by  two

consultants,  namely, Dr M.  C.  Fletcher  of  the

United Kingdom and Dr D. Horn of the United States

on Smoking and Health. The two main recommendations

of  the  report  were that cigarette advertisements

should  be  reduced  with a view  to  its  eventual

elimination, and that cigarette packets  should  be

printed  with  a  label warning of the  dangers  of

cigarette  smoking.  The World Health  Organisation

has  instructed its Director-General to submit  the

report  together  with its recommendations  to  all

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some countries have already taken steps to curb

advertisements on cigarettes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



In  Italy  all  advertising  of   tobacco

products  is prohibited by a law enacted  in  April

1962.  In  Britain, a similar ban  was  imposed  on

television  and  radio since August  1965.  In  the

United  States there is a law enforced since  April

this   year,  which  requires  that  all  cigarette

packets  be  printed with a label  warning  of  the

danger  of  smoking,  and from 1st  January,  1971,

there  will  be  no  cigarette advertisements  over

television  and  radio in the United  States.  Thus

more  and more countries are taking steps  to  stop

the use of mass media for cigarette advertisement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, we in Singapore will be

shirking  our social responsibility if we  continue

to  allow  television and radio, the most effective

mass  media  in  our republic, to be  used  by  the

tobacco industry to pass on messages extolling  the

virtues of cigarette smoking. Hence, from June this

year,   the  Broadcasting  Department  has   ceased

signing  contracts  for  cigarette  advertisements.

Beginning from 1st January next year, there will be

no cigarette advertisements over our television and

radio;   instead,  filmlets  and  messages  against

smoking will be screened and broadcast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cigarette industry in Singapore spent about

$3.6    million   on   all   forms   of   cigarette

advertisements, of which television and  radio  got

about $1.2 million last year. It is obvious that if

a  similar  ban  is not imposed on the  other  mass

media  in  Singapore, the $1.2  million  which  was

spent on television and radio will eventually  find

its  way into the other media. This will make  them

more  vicious  and  intensive  in  their  work   of

persuasion  and thus have the effect of  cancelling

out  all  our  efforts  in imposing  the  ban  over

television  and  radio. It  is  thus  necessary  to

introduce  this  Bill  in order  to  make  the  ban

applicable  to  all  mass  media  in  Singapore   -

newspapers  and  magazines  which  are  printed  in

Singapore, billboards, films, posters, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, there must be exemption for

foreign magazines for obvious reasons. Firstly,  we

cannot    control   the   editorial    policy    of

international magazines, and, secondly, we  do  not

want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



to  isolate  ourselves from external  thoughts  and

literature.  In any case, the circulation  of  such

magazines is probably small and largely confined to

those   who  are  resistant  to  most  methods   of

persuasion.  Clause  7 (2) (a) gives  exemption  to

this type of international newspapers and magazines

which  are  printed or published outside Singapore.

On  the  other  hand,  we are not  going  to  grant

exemption to supplements of local newspapers,  even

though   the   supplements  are   printed   outside

Singapore. I therefore propose to introduce at  the

Committee  stage a new clause to make it absolutely

clear that supplements of local newspapers are  not

to be exempted under clause 7 (2) (a) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspapers and magazines printed in Malaysia will

have to be given special treatment because our  two

countries  lie  so close to each other.  I  do  not

think  publications from Malaysia should  be  given

the  same  exemption which we  are  giving  to  the

international  magazines. We therefore  propose  to

take  administrative  action to  prevent  Malaysian

newspapers   and  publications  from  coming   into

Singapore  if  those  newspapers  and  publications

contain cigarette advertisements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first ever legislation of this kind to be

introduced in this part of the world, we cannot  be

sure of how it is going to turn out. We may have to

modify  and readjust later on, it is to be expected

that the cigarette industry, with enormous funds at

its disposal, will try to find other ways and means

of   marketing  its  products.  We  are   therefore

watching  them very closely, for they may  probably

try to circumvent the law by putting more money  in

mass  media originating from outside this  country.

If  that does happen, we will have to introduce new

measures  to meet this new challenge. We  will  not

hesitate  to introduce new provisions to give  more

teeth to the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I rise to give my fullest support

to  this  Bill on the prohibition on advertisements

relating  to smoking, which is now being moved  for

the  Second  Reading by my colleague, the  Minister

for Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this Bill concerning advertisements

falls  within the jurisdiction of the  Ministry  of

Culture,  the  Ministry of Health  has  a  definite

interest and a stake in its enactment, for there is

now  conclusive  medical evidence  of  the  serious

effect  of smoking in promoting the development  of

pulmonary and cardiac diseases, such as lung cancer

and  coronary  thrombosis. Many  scientific-studies

conducted   over  the  last  20  years   have   now

demonstrated   quite  conclusively   that   smoking

increases  the  morbidity and mortality  from  such

diseases.  Thus,  being  aware  of  these   serious

medical    findings,   many   health   authorities,

institutions  and agencies all over the  world  are

becoming very concerned and are now advocating  the

adoption  of measures by governments to  discourage

and  minimise smoking. One of the measures strongly

advocated  is  the  ban  on the  advertisement  and

promotion  of cigarettes, cigars and pipe  tobacco.

For  example, as was mentioned by my colleague, the

Minister   for  Culture,  the  23rd  World   Health

Assembly   held   in  Geneva  in  May   this   year

unanimously passed resolutions recommending  member

countries to adopt measures to discourage  smoking.

One  of these is the reduction of advertisement and

promotion of cigarettes with a view to its eventual

elimination.  More recently, the Royal  College  of

Physicians in the United Kingdom has called  for  a

total ban on all tobacco advertisements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to give some facts and figures

of  these medical findings to illustrate why  there

is  this  grave  concern about the  ill-effects  of

smoking by health authorities all over the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me refer to lung cancer -I am glad the

Member for Paya Lebar is listening intently, it has

now been established that the risk of dying from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



lung  cancer  is increased 15 to 30  times  amongst

heavy  smokers  as  compared with non-smokers.  The

findings show that anyone smoking 24 cigarettes  or

more  a day has a one-in-nine-chance of contracting

lung  cancer compared with a possibility of one  in

284  for a non-smoker. It has also been shown  that

amongst  smokers, the incidence of the  disease  is

increased  directly in relation to  the  number  of

cigarettes smoked. T he risk of lung cancer, on the

other  hand,  is  reduced  when  smokers  give   up

smoking. It is estimated that 75 per cent  or  more

of  lung  cancer  cases  is preventable  if  nobody

smokes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, cancer is the number one cause of

death  and  lung  cancer is the commonest  form  of

cancer  encountered here. Our statistics show  that

the  number  of  deaths from lung cancer  has  been

increasing   in   the  last  20   years   and   has

approximately doubled every five years since  1950.

Once a person contracts lung cancer, his chances of

survival  beyond five years are more or  less  nil,

and it is certainly a most painful way of dying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies have also shown a steady increase in

mortality   from  bronchitis  and  emphysema   with

increasing  cigarette consumption. Amongst  smokers

of 20 cigarettes or more a day, the mortality is 15

times  that  of  non-smokers.  The  mortality  from

bronchitis  has  also been shown to  decrease  when

smokers stop smoking. Mr Govindasamy, Sir, perhaps

this will encourage those Members who smoke to stop

smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every aspect of lung function is impaired by

smoking.    Abnormalities   demonstrated    include

narrowing of the air passages and impairment of gas

interchange in the lungs. The prevalence  of  cough

and  expectoration is closely related to the number

of  cigarettes smoked, and these symptoms  promptly

subside in those who stop smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to ischaemic heart diseases.

Medical findings show that mortality from ischaemic

heart  diseases  is  two  to  three  times  greater

amongst smokers than non-smokers. This mortality is

higher amongst heavy smokers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



and  those who start smoking at an earlier age.  It

is  lower  amongst smokers who discontinue  smoking

than  amongst those who continue the practice. This

increased  risk  of mortality from ischaemic  heart

diseases  is  also  greater  amongst  the   younger

smokers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking also aggravates the pain of peptic ulcer

and delays the healing of the ulcer. The death rate

from  peptic ulcer is increased three to four times

by smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these specific diseases which I have

mentioned,  it  has been established  that  smoking

increases   the   mortality  from  numerous   other

diseases  as  well  as  increasing  morbidity   and

disability whether this is measured by working man-days lost, by days spent ill in bed, or by days  of

restricted activity due to illness. In one study in

the United States of America, the excess disability

attributed  to smoking represented 28 per  cent  of

the days of disability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I have been instrumental in creating a

bit  of  a  morbid atmosphere in the  House  by  my

revelations  of  these medical  facts  and  figures

relating to smoking, I beg your pardon. But I  feet

duty  bound  to  acquaint Members with  these  very

serious medical findings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with this massive scientific and conclusive

evidence,  any government worth its salt must  feel

duty  bound  actively to discourage this  hazardous

habit  of  smoking  by  taking  positive  steps  to

discourage   those  who  have  not   started   from

embarking  on  the practice and to encourage  those

who  have  started to stop. The first step  towards

this  direction  is to ban cigarette advertisements

which   form  the  major  promotional   effort   in

increasing cigarette smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By banning advertisements on cigarettes,

Government  is fully aware of the fact that  it  is

going to lose immediately a substantial portion  of

revenue  from  such  advertisements  on  radio  and

television. Further, in the long term, its  efforts

aimed  at reducing smoking will also result in  the

reduction of revenue from duty on tobacco. However,

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



is  a  relatively  small price to  pay  and  if  it

results  in the reduction or prevention of increase

in  smoking, this will be more than offset  by  the

savings in health and medical expenditure from  the

reduced  morbidity and mortality. The reduction  in

deaths  and  disability  amongst  the  economically

active   population  will  certainly   have   great

economic  benefits to the country. In one study  in

the  United  States  of America, excess  disability

attributed  to  cigarette  smoking  in   one   year

included  77  million  working  man-days  lost,  88

million  days  of  illness spent  in  bed  and  306

million man-days of restricted activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from economic considerations, there is the

over-riding  humanitarian and ethical duty  on  the

part  of  the Government to protect the young,  who

are  unwary  and impressionable, from falling  into

the  habit  of  smoking. Adults  who  have  already

formed the habit of smoking may have difficulty  in

giving  it  up. Thus, measures aimed at  motivating

adults into giving up smoking would undoubtedly  be

less  successful  than those aimed at  discouraging

non-smokers  from embarking on the  harmful  habit.

Most  of  the younger generation have  not  as  yet

embarked  on  the smoking habit. It  is  imperative

that   they  be  discouraged  from  starting.   The

Government  certainly  owes  this  to  our   future

generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisements on cigarette smoking are usually

based on emotional appeals and the exploitation  of

human  weaknesses. They usually seek  to  associate

cigarette   smoking   with   manliness,   virility,

prestige  and  social acceptance  and  so  on.  One

catching advertisement that seeks to appeal to your

manliness  and  virility,  which  I  am  sure  many

Members  are familiar with, is the one which  tells

you that if you smoke the cigarette you will be  in

Marlboro  country.  Another familiar  advertisement

tells   you  that  if  you  want  to  be   socially

acceptable and be in the in-crowd, you should smoke

Dunhill.  Yet another calls upon you to  enjoy  the

coolness of a mountain stream by smoking Consulate.

As such,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



the   young  and  impressionable  are  particularly

susceptible  to  them. Thus, it is  necessary  that

they  be  prohibited if only to protect  them  from

this   incessant  and  insidious  form  of  harmful

propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Government is fully conscious of

the    fact    that   merely   banning    cigarette

advertisements by itself is not sufficient to bring

about  a  reduction  in  cigarette  smoking  or  to

discourage  the  young from starting.  Thus,  other

positive  efforts  have to  be  made  to  tell  the

people,  particularly young people, about  the  ill

effects  of  smoking  and to discourage  them  from

taking it up. The Government has decided to mount a

campaign  to  make  school children  aware  of  the

health hazards of smoking and this will be done  in

conjunction with the health education that will  be

introduced in the curriculum of schools. It  would,

therefore, be illogical and rather ironical if  the

Government were, on the one hand, to adopt positive

measures  to discourage smoking but, on the  other,

allow     advertisements    promoting     cigarette

consumption  to  carry on. In fact,  when  the  law

prohibiting  smoking in the auditorium  of  cinemas

came  into  force in October this year  and  before

this  present  Bill was introduced  in  Parliament,

there  were complaints from the public which  found

expression in letters to the press pointing out the

illogical  and  ironical  situation  where   cinema

patrons were not allowed to smoke while watching  a

show, on the one hand, and, on the other, cigarette

advertisements encouraging patrons  to  smoke  were

allowed to be shown on the screen. Sir, one  writer

ended  his  letter  to  the  press,  no  doubt   in

exaggerated  terms, by stating, "To add  insult  to

injury they [meaning the authorities] are indulging

in  the  cruellest form of mental torture. So  stop

cigarette advertisements in the cinema halls before

disaster strikes."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, whatever the arguments pro and con its

effectiveness,   the  banning   of   advertisements

relating  to smoking is the inevitable and  logical

move  consistent  with the Government's  policy  of

actively  discouraging  smoking,  thereby  reducing

unnecessary deaths, ill-health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



and   suffering.  As  far  as  the  Government   is

concerned, it has no illusions whatsoever that  the

campaign  to discourage smoking is going  to  be  a

long and arduous one, just as our campaigns against

litter,  filth and pollution. We know that we  will

be engaged in a relentless battle against ingrained

habits, human weaknesses and susceptibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to add a cautious note.

With  the  passage of the Bill,  the  ban  will  be

implemented.  It is anticipated that attempts  will

be made to exploit every possible loophole to evade

some of the provisions of the law. Of course, human

ingenuity is always there to contend with. A  close

watch  will,  therefore, be kept by  Government  on

attempts  to  circumvent the law. If  it  is  found

necessary,  the  provisions  of  the  law  will  be

reviewed  regularly and changes made when necessary

in  order  that  the loss of revenue by  Government

from  the ban will not result in monetary  gain  to

others  and,  above  all, to ensure  that  all  the

efforts  we  put  in  to  discourage  and  minimise

smoking will not be in vain.



<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

introduction of this Bill is, in my view, conducive

to the promotion of better health and hygiene among

our   people.   However,  I  do  not  consider   it

comprehensive  enough. In  my  view,  it  has  been

introduced  on a piecemeal basis. Nevertheless,  it

is  still  a  progressive piece of legislation.  It

will cause some loss of revenue to our country,  as

has  been  pointed out by the Minister for  Health,

particularly revenue from advertisements over radio

and  on  TV, and  advertisements  put  up  on  our

overhead bridges. This is the price we have to pay,

but  it is worth while. There is no doubt that this

Bill will bring great benefits to our society as  a

whole. One of them is that our T.V, viewers will be

left in peace to enjoy their programmes without the

harassment    and   embarrassment   of    cigarette

advertisements.  This  is,  of  course,   a   minor

benefit. But there are major benefits. This Bill is

closely related to an earlier Bill, that is, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



Prohibition of Smoking in Certain Places Bill.  One

of  the  provisions in the present  Bill  prohibits

advertisements on smoking through pamphlets,  price

lists,  packets and other forms of publicity  which

aim  at promoting smoking among the members of  the

public.  This  Bill shows that our Government  does

not endorse public encouragement of smoking amongst

our  citizens, particularly our young people.  This

Bill  will be conducive to the cultivation of  good

habits or at least the discouragement of bad habits

amongst  our  people, particularly the young  ones.

This is a Bill with good intentions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the implementation of this Bill, other

benefits  will come too. The Bill will prevent  our

young  people from succumbing to temptation through

indulgence  in smoking. If there are no inducements

or encouragement from cigarette advertisements, our

young people will not succumb to temptations. There

are  Members in this House, including Ministers and

Parliamentary  Secretaries, who  are  smokers,  but

they  are  probably  indulging in  this  bad  habit

because there was no such Bill in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this Bill will help bring about a more

robust physique and better health among our people.

It will definitely reduce the hazards of smoking to

which  smokers  are  exposed,  that  is,  from  the

medical  point of view as mentioned by the Minister

for Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill will also help the growth of a

less polluted environment. This Bill works in close

conjunction  with  our campaign against  pollution,

particularly air pollution. According  to  experts,

smoking  of  cigarettes  will  also  add   to   air

pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of all I have said, there are

certain  loopholes in this Bill  which  I  wish  to

point out. For example, there are certain loopholes

in  the provisions for exemption which may be  open

to manipulation by certain people whereby they will

be  able  to  bring  home the  message  of  smoking

pleasure  by  some other means. I therefore  invite

the  attention of the Minister concerned to several

points.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as regards imported publications such as

Life,  we  must note that there are many  cigarette

advertisements   in   them.   If   these   imported

publications are distributed free to the public  by

cigarette dealers or tobacco companies, will it not

defeat  the purpose of this Bill? Has our  Minister

any plans to deal with such a situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, if our people turn on to the T.V.

programmes  and  radio broadcasts  of  neighbouring

countries    which    do    not    ban    cigarette

advertisements, our people will still be exposed to

such  advertisements. I wonder whether the Minister

has any plans to prevent or to reduce the influence

of    cigarette    advertisements   from    foreign

broadcasts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, I would like to indicate my support

if  there  is  a  campaign to  educate  the  people

against smoking. If we can start a campaign of this

nature,  I  am  sure that popular support  will  be

forthcoming.  And  it  is my  hope  that  when  the

campaign  is launched, those Members of  Parliament

who  are smokers will take the lead and set a  good

example by giving up smoking.



<br><br>7.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Sir, we have heard

interesting  speeches by the Minister  for  Culture

and the Minister for Health. Some intriguing points

were  made by the Minister for Health when he  said

that  we should not be over concerned with the loss

of  revenue from duty on tobacco and cigarettes and

also  loss of revenue from advertisements  on  T.V.

and  over  the radio to the Ministry of Culture.  I

must  say  that I support the passing of this  Bill

and,  finally, the total elimination  of  cigarette

smoking.  But can the Minister clarify whether  the

Government  would accept donations  from  cigarette

manufacturers  for  the  promotion  of  sports  and

whether the Ministry of Culture would publicity  on

T.V, and over the radio if, say, the Minister  for

Social  Affairs,  who  heads  the  National  Sports

Promotion  Board,  were to receive  such  donations

from  cigarette  manufacturers and whether  or  not

publicity in the news-papers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



would be allowed? What is the general  line

of policy the Government will adopt in this regard?



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I would like to touch

on  one  or two points which are possible loopholes

for   cigarette   and  tobacco   manufacturers   to

circumvent.  The first point is that  from  the  $3

million  or  more saved, it is pretty certain  that

the    cigarette   and   tobacco   companies   will

manufacture  articles like ashtrays  and  cigarette

lighters outside Singapore for distribution to  the

public.  They will also make articles like  diaries

and  pencils  for free distribution and  invariably

most of these articles will fall into the hands  of

young  children,  particularly school  children.  I

think  this  will indirectly promote the  sales  of

cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possible loophole is that there is no

provision   to  prevent  a  tobacco  company   from

encouraging  people to purchase certain  brands  of

cigarettes by offering indirect inducements like if

you  return 10 empty packets of a certain brand  of

cigarette,   you  wilt  be  entitled   to   certain

articles. This may be a possible loophole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to support the

passing of this Bill.



<br><br>7.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, it is very interesting

to  know that before this Bill is passed into  law,

everyone  starts  looking for loopholes  in  it  to

circumvent it. This is quite natural to people. All

I   can  say  is  that  we  are  watchful  for  any

circumvention of the law. We will try to  implement

it  in  a way that is best in the interest  of  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has said that the

provisions   in  the  Bill  are  not  comprehensive

enough.  I  wonder  whether  he  can  suggest  more

comprehensive measures which we can take, short  of

prohibiting people from smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards foreign magazines, I think we all

agree  that we should not cut ourselves  away  from

the   trends  and  information  imparted  by  these

magazines. Although it may be possible for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



cigarette  companies to buy a few hundred  thousand

copies   of   Life   magazine  carrying   cigarette

advertisements and distribute them free to  people,

I  do  not think cigarette companies can afford  to

spend  so  much  money in buying  up  thousands  of

copies of international magazines such as Life  and

Time  for free distribution to the public.  But  if

that does happen, we can think of ways to stop it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards advertisement commercials on

television  coming in from Malaysia,  I  would  say

that it is something that we cannot help. We are an

open  city  subject to influence from  many  forces

from  outside. It is not possible for us to isolate

ourselves from these influences. All we can  do  is

to strengthen the resistance of our young people in

this respect so that they can differentiate between

what is good and what is bad. We can also introduce

filmlets, announcements and stills against  smoking

on  T.V, and over the radio instead of commercials

on  cigarettes. I think this would help  to  cancel

the  effect  which  will come  over  the  air  from

outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang has asked whether the

Government or the sports organisations are  allowed

to  accept donations from cigarette companies  such

a~  Rothmans  or the Singapore Tobacco  Company.  I

have  the  assurance  of the  Minister  for  Social

Affairs  that  these donations  are  acceptable  to

them.  But  I  think we must make a  difference  in

this.  We are banning advertisements on cigarettes.

But  if  the  cigarette companies  are  willing  to

donate  funds for sports organisations, I think  we

should  have  no  objection because  the  publicity

would not actually be given to cigarettes but would

be  given  to the companies which are donating  the

money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards ash-trays, diaries and articles which

the  cigarette  companies may try to distribute  to

the  people,  I  think these are matters  which  we

cannot  help. But as I have said, we are keeping  a

watch   on  these  matters,  and  if  they   become

uncontrollable, we will try to think of some  means

to control them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

I have given notice to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of clause 4 postponed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 6 ordered to stand part of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, line 31, to leave out "any newspaper"

and insert "a newspaper (other than a newspaper

specified by the Minister by notification in the

Gazette)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (a) of sub-clause (2) of' this clause

gives   exemption   to  foreign   periodicals   and

newspapers which are published and printed  outside

Singapore. In other words, foreign newspapers  like

The  Times of London or The Times of -New York  and

foreign  magazines  like  The  Economist,  the  New

Statesman and -so on can be imported into Singapore

with  cigarette  advertisements  in  them.  I  have

already  explained  that we  cannot  control  their

editorial policy and, what is more important, we do

not  want  to  cut  ourselves off,  culturally  and

intellectually,  from the rest  of  the  world.  So

exemption has to be given to these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



foreign publications. But there are other types  of

publications printed outside Singapore which we  do

not  want  to  exempt. They are the supplements  of

local  newspapers. In present day practice, a local

newspaper  can arrange to have a supplement  edited

and  printed  outside Singapore and  imported  into

Singapore  for distribution with the  newspaper.  A

doubt  will  therefore arise whether or  not  these

supplements should qualify for exemption under this

clause.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that this amendment which we are now

putting in, together with the new clause which I am

going  to  introduce later on, should  be  able  to

clear  this doubt by drawing a distinction  between

the supplement of a local newspaper printed outside

Singapore  and an independent foreign  publication.

The amendment also gives powers to the Minister  to

single out the newspaper supplement that is not  to

enjoy  the  exemption.  This  should  be  the  most

effective  way to end all arguments on  whether  or

not a particular publication should be exempted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up, and read the First time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the

clause be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 7 of the Bill, there is provision

for  exemption and paragraph (a) of sub-clause  (2)

of  clause 7 specifically stipulates that the  Bill

should  not  apply  to any cigarette  advertisement

contained   in  any  newspaper  (other  than   that

specified  in  the  Gazette) which  is  printed  or

published  outside Singapore and  is  brought  into

Singapore  for sale, free distribution or  personal

use.  When  this stipulation was written  into  the

Bill,  it was envisaged that magazines of  a  truly

international character should not be debarred from

being  distributed in Singapore,  as  such  foreign

magazines help to enrich the intellectual  life  of

Singapore.  As I have already mentioned  just  now,

there  are magazines which are distributed as  free

supplements to some local newspapers but which  are

printed outside Singapore and which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



qualify  for  exemption. As these  supplements  are

given away free and distributed together with local

newspapers, their circulation is as big as that  of

the local newspapers to which they are attached. If

this is not checked, the purpose of the law will be

defeated  because other newspapers  which  have  no

supplements to distribute will then try to  produce

them  and have them printed outside Singapore  with

cigarette advertisements and brought into Singapore

for distribution as their supplements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new clause to the Bill, when read with clause

7,  makes a distinction between publications  which

are  printed  outside Singapore but are distributed

free  as supplements to local newspapers which  are

not  exempted, and publications which  are  printed

outside  Singapore  but are sold  independently  in

their own rights and which are exempted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this new clause is necessary and I

beg to move that it be added to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to introduce several

amendments  to  the  Mutual  Benefit  Organisations

Ordinance, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Ordinance, section 5 gives the

Registrar  power  to  refuse  registration   of   a

proposed mutual benefit organisation only  if  such

organisation  bears a name which is identical  with

another registered organisation. This section  will

be repealed and a new section re-enacted to empower

the  Registrar  to  refuse  to  register  a  mutual

benefit organisation, inter alia, if he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



of  the opinion that the scheme for the benefit  of

its  members  as provided for in the rules  of  the

organisation  is  undesirable  and   not   in   the

interests of would-be members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15 of the Ordinance, which exempts mutual

benefit organisations from the Societies Ordinance,

will  be  repealed as the Societies Act, 1966,  has

expressly  provided for registered  mutual  benefit

organisations to be exempted from the provisions of

the said Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 22A is being introduced to enable a

mutual  benefit organisation to utilise its reserve

funds  for purposes approved by the Minister. Under

the  existing Ordinance, subsection (2) of  section

22  allows  the reserve fund of any mutual  benefit

organisation to be placed only in the  Post  Office

Savings Bank, on deposit with a bank of the Malayan

Exchange  Bank  Association  in  the  name  of  the

organisation, or be invested in trustee securities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also seeks to introduce a new section

27A  to  empower  the Minister to freeze  the  bank

accounts of a mutual benefit organisation if he  is

satisfied that there is a likelihood that the funds

of  the organisation may be misused. This power can

only  be  exercised after the Registrar  of  Mutual

Benefit  Organisations has given notice in  writing

to  cancel  the  registration of a  mutual  benefit

organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 27B is also being introduced for

the purpose of empowering the Registrar or a police

officer  to  seize the account books,  records  and

documents of a mutual benefit organisation  at  any

time  after  the  Registrar  has  given  notice  in

writing  to  cancel the registration of the  mutual

benefit  organisation.  This  is  to  prevent   the

falsification  of the account books, documents  and

records   of  a  mutual  benefit  organisation   by

dishonest and unscrupulous officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, section 39 (2) is being amended to

increase the fine on conviction of an offence under

section 39 (1) from the maximum of $100 to $200.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



This   increase  in  penalty  will  be  a   greater

deterrent  as past experience has shown  that  most

mutual benefit organisations do not appear to  take

heed  of  warning given by the Registrar of  Mutual

Benefit  Organisations that court proceedings  will

be instituted against them knowing that the maximum

fine which may be imposed is only $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<div align="center"><b>(PRESERVATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF AMENITIES) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill now before this House

are  in  accordance with the Government  policy  of

beautifying Singapore and making it into  a  Garden

City.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of the Bill are twofold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Bill seeks to restrict the felling

and cutting of any tree with a girth exceeding five

feet  when  measured  two  feet  from  the  ground.

However, this restriction is not as wide as may  be

imagined,  as it generally applies only to  a  tree

growing  on vacant or relatively undeveloped  land.

Although  the  Minister  is  given  the  power   to

designate other lands to which the restriction  may

apply,  this power will be used only in exceptional

circumstances.  It  is certainly  not  the  general

intention  that  the  owner of a  private  dwelling

house  should be prohibited from cutting or felling

a tree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



growing  in his private garden. It should be  noted

that three conditions must be satisfied before  the

restriction as to felling or cutting can apply:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The tree must be more than five feet in girth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The tree must be growing on vacant land as

defined  in the Bill or otherwise on  any  land

designated by the Minister by order published in

the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The felling or cutting of the tree does not

fall  within the two specified exceptions, that  is

to  say,  the  prevention  of  imminent  danger  or

compliance with any statutory obligation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to these conditions, the

restriction is in effect quite narrow in scope  and

is  really directed against private developers from

indiscriminately destroying the large trees growing

on  undeveloped land. It may be added that even  if

the  restriction  applies  to  a  particular  tree,

permission can be granted to fell or cut  it  where

there are satisfactory reasons for doing so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill provides for the service of a

notice  on  the occupier of any land  adjoining  or

abutting  or  near  to  a  designated  public  road

requiring  him  to  clear  the  land  of  weeds  or

overgrown  grass or to plant such trees and  plants

as  are  specified  in the notice.  This  provision

again does not extend to the occupier of every land

but  can only apply to the occupiers of those lands

which are adjacent or near to such public roads  as

the  Minister  may  designate.  The  provision   is

considered  necessary in order  to  strengthen  the

hand  of  the authorities in the task of preserving

and  enhancing  the amenities of  lands  which  are

close  to our main highways. Provision is made  for

an  occupier  on whom a notice has been  served  to

appeal  to  the  Minister. However,  non-compliance

with  a notice does not attract any penal sanction,

but instead the Superintendent of Trees and Plants,

who is to be appointed under the Bill, is empowered

to  take the necessary measures to comply with  the

terms  of  the notice and to recover the costs  and

expenses of such measures



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



from  the occupier. It will, however, be an offence

for  any  person wilfully to damage or  remove  any

tree  or  plant which has been planted pursuant  to

any notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen, therefore, that the Bill does not

interfere  unreasonably  with  the  right  of   the

individual to regulate his own house or garden, and

Members may be assured that the provisions  of  the

Bill will be administered reasonably, having regard

to  the  interests of the community as well as  the

individual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>7.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Govindasamy,  Sir, I believe that Members  in  this

House  are aware that over the past few years  many

trees  have been cut down because of urban  renewal

or other forms of development that have been taking

place  in  Singapore. As a result,  the  number  of

trees in the city is decreasing from year to year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are living in the tropics. It is,

therefore, essential that we have enough trees  and

plants  because they will regulate our  rather  dry

and  hot  climate. Their presence will freshen  the

air,  thereby  promoting better  health  among  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Bill is a follow-up of

our  campaign  to keep Singapore clean  and  green.

This  Bill  will protect trees and  plants  in  our

Republic.  Over  the past few years  we  have  been

launching  campaigns to keep Singapore  green,  and

these  have been receiving great support  from  our

people,  for  example, in my Sembawang constituency

where there has been a tremendous response from  my

constituents.   Over  the  past  few   months   the

Citizens' Consultative Committee in my constituency

and  the  Management  Committees  of  the  People's

Association  have  concertedly  launched  a   tree-planting  campaign. As a result of  these  efforts,

many shops and private houses have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



trees  and  plants around them. In  public  places,

too, trees have been planted, thereby enhancing the

beauty of the surroundings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindasamy, Sir, because of this "Keep Singapore Green" campaign, we have a shortage of horticulturists and of young plants. A lack of experienced personnel to look after the plants has caused a lot of these plants to wither and die. Furthermore, a lack of personnel with expertise in

planting  trees has also given rise  to  the  wrong

method of planting them. It is agreed that we  have

a  shortage of horticulturists to advise others  on

how  to plant trees and flowers, and I do not  know

whether  the  Government or the Minister  concerned

has any plans to train more people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also noted that in certain crowded areas,

such as Bras Basah Road, the traffic conditions are

generally appalling during peak hours, resulting in

traffic jams. In spite of the shortage of space  in

such areas, trees are being planted. They take up a

lot of space in a very crowded area. One tree takes

up  at  least  10  square feet of  space,  and  the

presence of trees in these crowded areas will  only

aggravate traffic conditions. I wonder whether  the

officers  concerned  have given  due  consideration

before  planting  trees in  these  busy  areas  and

public roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no doubt trees are being planted with good

intentions,  as they will beautify our  environment

and refresh the air. With the success of this "Keep

Singapore  Green" campaign, we have no  doubt  that

Singapore  will become a garden city  in  the  true

sense  of the word. In this way we will be able  to

attract more tourists to our garden city. They will

go   back  to  their  own  countries  and  give  us

favourable  publicity. The "Keep  Singapore  Green"

campaign  will  therefore contribute  in  no  small

measure to our economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am glad to see that the Member for

Sembawang   is  also  interested  in  keeping   his

constituency  clean and beautiful.  If  he  or  any

member  of  his  constituency, or of his  Citizens'

Consultative  Committee, or of the People's  Action

Party branch in Sembawang is interested in training

courses  on  planting trees, then  he  should  make

application to the Ministry of National Development

which  runs such courses for the benefit  of  those

who do not know much about shrubs or flowers. These

courses have been running for more than six  months

now,  and perhaps this is the first time the Member

has heard about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the trees in Bras Basah Road, I would

advise  him  to stick to his problems in  Sembawang

and  leave the problems in Bras Basah to the Member

for  Bras  Basah. There have been trees planted  on

one  side  of  Bras Basah Road but  they  have  not

hindered traffic. They are not really huge or large

trees;  they are pom-pom trees planted on one  side

of  the  road. If they grow too big,  they  can  be

chopped off or trimmed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time-and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>7.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law, as it stands, only provides for the

establishment of public parking places and does not

empower  the appropriate authority, in  this  case,

the Car Parks Division of the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



National Development, to exercise any control  over

car parks managed under private ownership. More and

more  private car parks are being established;  two

large such parks came into operation recently - one

at Collyer Quay with about 600 parking lots and the

other  at  the People's Park Complex at New  Bridge

Road with about 500 parking lots. With the increase

in  the  number and size of such car parks,  it  is

desirable  that  proper control be  exercised  over

their  operations. Clause 7 of the  Bill  therefore

seeks to re-enact section 6 of the Ordinance so  as

to  empower  the  Minister to make  rules  for  the

control, regulation and supervision by registration

of private car parks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to empower the Superintendent

of  Car Parks to enter into agreements to take over

the  control  and management of private  car  parks

upon  requests being made by the owners.  Enquiries

have,  in fact, been received by the Division  from

some  developers  concerning the  taking  over  and

management  of  their private  car  parks.  It  is,

therefore, proposed to add a new section 3A to  the

Ordinance  to enable the Minister to authorise  the

use  as  a  parking place of any  private  land  or

premises  with  respect to which an  agreement  has

been  made between the Superintendent of Car  Parks

and  the owner or occupier thereof for the  use  of

such  land or premises as a parking place. This  is

provided for in clause 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other amendments to the Ordinance have been

incorporated in the Bill to make the administration

of  parking places more effective. Among  the  main

amendments  is  the  inclusion  in  clause   7   of

provisions to enable the Minister to make rules  in

respect of the levy of surcharges and penalties for

non-payment of parking charges and to provide for a

maximum fine of $250 for any contravention  of  the

rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 9, to leave out "arrangement" and

insert "agreement".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one would not speak of an arrangement

between  the  Superintendent of Car Parks  and  the

owner  occupier of a private car park. I think  the

word "arrangement" would more properly describe the

relationship  between a man and  his  mistress.  So

with  the  consent of the House, I would prefer  to

insert  the word "agreement" there in place of  the

word "arrangement".

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Customs Ordinance,

No.  44  of  1960,  to  give  more  flexibility  in

administration, update sections of the law and also

clarify  the limitations of the customs  provisions

in relation to the free trade zone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the important amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend section 2 of

the  Ordinance by repealing the existing  provision

which  provides that the Ordinance shall not  apply

to Pulau Sebarok or Pulau Bukom Besar in respect of

petroleum,  and re-enacting the clause  giving  the

Minister more flexibility. More oil refineries  are

being  developed on off-shore islands and  the  re-enacted  section 2 (a) would allow the Minister  to

specify  any  off-shore island  where  the  Customs

Ordinance shall not apply in respect of petroleum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 also clarifies that the Ordinance shall

have  no application within the free trade zone  in

respect of acts lawfully done. This avoids the need

to  list  out  and add to or delete from  the  list

preventive   and   prohibitive  sections   of   the

Ordinance  applicable to the  free  trade  zone  as

required presently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 5 seek to amend sections 4 and 5 by

transferring   the  authority  for  the   statutory

appointments  of  Comptroller, Deputy  Comptroller,

Assistant  Comptrollers and Customs  Officers  from

the  President  to the Minister for  administrative

simplicity and to bring this provision in line with

similar provisions in other revenue Ordinances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 seeks to amend section 11 o1 the

Ordinance to empower the Minister to levy  duty  on

locally-grown  tobacco  as  Virginia-type  tobacco,

suitable  for cigarette making, is currently  grown

locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to empower the Minister to exempt

the  payment  of such fees or charges  leviable  on

items   other  than  goods.  Section  13   of   the

Ordinance,  as  it now stands, gives  the  Minister

powers  only to exempt payments of customs  duties,

taxes,  fees or charges payable on goods.  However,

there  are  fees payable other than on  goods,  for

example, warehouse fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 proposes to extend the scope of the tax,

currently  limited to vehicles using heavy  oil  or

diesel oil, to cover



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



liquefied  petroleum gas and other  gases  to  take

account   of   technological   changes   and    new

propellants for vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 34 of the Ordinance regulates the

liability  of the master or agent of  a  vessel  in

respect  of  short-shipments, short-landings,  etc.

Clause  12  seeks  to supplement  this  section  by

extending  liability to cover  goods  landed  until

they  are  lawfully removed for  export,  or  enter

customs territory or are received for storage in  a

free  trade  zone. This removes  any  doubt  as  to

liability of administrators of free trade zones and

will  not affect shipowners who may insure  against

such liabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 seeks to reduce the period during which

draw-back claims may be made from 12 to 6 months of

the  date of payment of duty to bring this  section

in line with other sections of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 makes the preparation of palm trees for

tapping an offence. At present only tapping  is  an

offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As section 84 of the Ordinance now stands,

provision exists for adjustments in prices of  sums

equal to increases or decreases in existing customs

duties  levied  or  payable  after  a  contract  is

signed.  Clause  22  seeks to cover,  in  addition,

price changes arising out of the imposition of  new

duties or the abolition of duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 seeks to provide a new general section

giving  the  Comptroller the right to  require  and

take  securities for payment of duty  and  for  the

collection  of revenue. At present the  requirement

for  security is only for certain sections  of  the

Ordinance.   The  new  provision  allows   enhanced

safeguards particularly where high duty  goods  are

involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Containerised cargo moving through Singapore is

expected  to  increase and clause 28  empowers  the

Minister  to  make  regulations  on  documentation,

storage,  movement and examination of containerised

cargo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause also enables the Minister to require

customs  stamps to be used for the payment of  duty

on cigarettes.

on  the  Stock Exchange have attracted both  public

comment  and  criticism since 1968. In fact,  there

has   been,   in   this  House  and   outside   it,

considerable pressure put upon the Government  from

time to time to intervene in the public interest to

protect  investors  from unscrupulous  manipulation

and rigging on the Stock Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent developments on the Stock Exchange which

have  resulted  in the Committee  of  the  Exchange

suspending  or limiting trading in certain  shares,

as  well  as  the  timely study of  the  Securities

Market  in Singapore and Malaysia by Mr George  M.

Ferris, Jr. (which is commonly referred to as  "the

Ferris  Report")  have  focused  attention  on  the

shortcomings  and  deficiencies of  the  Securities

Market in Singapore and have raised the question as

to  what form of legislative intervention is needed

to  remedy  these  shortcomings  and  deficiencies,

particularly  as they affect the protection  to  be

afforded to the investing public. For there can  be

no   doubt  that  some  form  of  intervention   is

necessary to ensure that the Securities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



Market  operates in a fair and open manner  and  to

prevent,  as  far  as  possible,  certain  persons,

especially  those  with "insider"  knowledge,  from

manipulating the market by illegal means for  their

own profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even without the occurrence of the above-mentioned events, it is probably inevitable that

the  Securities  Market  in  Singapore  could  not,

having  regard to the accelerated pace of  economic

and  industrial development and the need to attract

private  capital investment to support and  quicken

this  development, have continued for long  in  its

traditional laissez-faire state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of Singapore in this respect would

not, it is thought, have been unlike the experience

of  the  more economically advanced members of  the

Commonwealth, for example, Australia and the United

Kingdom,  where the need to exercise some  form  of

control  over  the  Securities Market  has  in  the

period  1958-1970 found legislative  expression  in

various Acts of Parliament in those countries.  The

decision of the Government to legislate to regulate

the  Securities Market in Singapore can, therefore,

be regarded as part of a Commonwealth-wide approach

towards  investor protection. The form  of  control

adopted  in Australia and the United Kingdom  takes

substantially  the same pattern and  it  is  to  be

noted that in each of these countries the system of

self-regulation  by  the Stock  Exchange  has  been

preferred  to that of regulation by an  independent

statutory  body  along the lines of the  Securities

and  Exchange  Commission in the United  States  of

America.  And  it is this pattern  which  has  been

incorporated in the present Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching the decision that self-regulation

was,  at  least under present conditions prevailing

in the stock market, preferable, the Government was

influenced  by  the consideration  that  the  Stock

Exchange of Malaysia and Singapore is in a position

to exercise close and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



effective  control  over  the  securities  industry

generally.  It was also encouraged to believe  that

the  Committee of the Stock Exchange was  seriously

attempting,  within the limits of its capacity,  to

exercise this control with rigour. This has to some

extent been evidenced by the new Rules and Bye-laws

which  the  Committee have adopted, as well  as  by

action   taken   by   the   Committee   to    deter

manipulation. These Rules have incorporated some of

the  recommendations of the Ferris  Report  and  in

some respects the new Rules have gone further along

the  road  to secure investor protection  than  was

contemplated  in the Report. No doubt future  Rules

will  incorporate some of the other recommendations

made  by  Mr  Ferris. Indeed, I  am  persuaded  to

believe  that  the spirit of cooperation  that  has

been shown by the Stock Exchange Committee with  my

Ministry  in  attaining  the  common  objective  of

investor  protection will continue long after  this

Bill has passed into law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, it is proposed that meetings

will  be held periodically between members  of  the

Stock Exchange Committee and Government officers in

a  Standing  Committee whose function  will  be  to

review  problems  arising in the implementation  of

this   proposed   legislation  and  the   Companies

(Amendment) Bill as well as the application of  the

New  Rules  of  the  Stock Exchange,  and  to  make

recommendations on amendments which experience  may

show  to be necessary. The Committee can be assured

that  the  full support of the Government  will  be

given  to  it in the application of the  provisions

contained  in  these  two  Bills,  particularly  in

regard  to  those provisions dealing with  unlawful

share  trading  and disclosure by shareholders  and

directors of companies and auditing of accounts  of

dealers in securities. Since the Committee, in many

instances,  will  be the first to become  aware  of

possible breaches of the provisions in the proposed

legislation, it will be one of the functions of the

Committee to consider these breaches and, if necessary,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



to  bring  them  to  the  attention  of  the

Government for appropriate action to be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that there is a unified Stock

Exchange as between Singapore and Malaysia.  It  is

the wish of, I am sure, the Malaysian Government as

well  as  of  the  Singapore Government  that  this

unified Exchange should continue for the benefit of

both countries. Members will be reassured to learn,

therefore,  that  the  Malaysian  Government,  with

which  we  have been in consultation, has indicated

general agreement with the principles written  into

this.  Bill and the Companies (Amendment) Bill.  It

is  most  desirable  that the legislation  in  both

countries  should, in some respects, be uniform  on

these  subjects  and I am happy  to  say  that  the

Malaysian    Government    is    considering    the

introduction  of  complementary  legislation.   For

without it, neither Bill will be fully effective in

its operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the decision not to introduce into

Singapore direct centralised control does not  mean

that   other   forms  of  statutory   control   are

undesirable. This is far from being the  case,  and

this  has raised the question as to which forms  of

control  are  best suited to local conditions.  The

Bill  has answered the question by introducing  the

following forms of control over the Stock  Exchange

and its members and other dealers in securities:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Ministerial approval will be needed to

establish any new stock exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any future alteration of the-existing rules

of  a  stock  exchange  may be  disallowed  by  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The maintenance of proper trust accounts by

brokers  and  other dealers in securities  and  the

auditing of the same will be given statutory  force

and  the  Minister  may  in  special  circumstances

appoint a special auditor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The establishment of a fidelity fund by the

Stock  Exchange  has  been placed  on  a  statutory

footing  and persons who suffer loss as the  result

of  defalcations by brokers may be compensated  out

of the fund.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Dealers, who are not stockbrokers, will also

be required to keep accounts and records and make a

deposit of $100,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) All dealers in securities, including

stockbrokers,   will  be  licensed   to   deal   in

securities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Specific offences are created to deal with

dishonest trading in securities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Bill covers the whole of the securities

industry  in  Singapore, I would like  to  make  it

clear  that  the Bill does not attempt  to  prevent

speculation as such. Some speculation attends every

anticipation or expectation of short or  long  term

price trends which induces trading activity on  the

Exchange.   It  is  and  always  must  remain   the

responsibility of the individual investor to decide

as   to   the   advisability  of   any   particular

investment. What the Bill does do is to attempt  to

see  that  the stock market operates in a fair  and

open  way  and  that people do not  manipulate  the

market  by illegal means for their own profit.  The

Bill,  together  with  the  New  Rules  that   have

recently  been  passed  by  members  of  the  Stock

Exchange, will, it is considered, go a long way  to

achieve these objectives. However, I would like  to

emphasise  again that the Bill does not merely  pay

lip-service  to but acknowledges the  principle  of

self-regulation  of the Exchange by  the  Committee

and  is  not intended to interfere with the day-to-day  control  by  the  Committee  of  normal  share

trading  on  the Exchange, nor with the traditional

form  of control that the Committee exercises  over

members  of the Exchange except on such matters  as

the  licensing  of  dealers in securities  and  the

reduction  to  statutory  form  of  existing  Stock

Exchange  Rules  with regard to the maintenance  of

brokers' trust funds and the fidelity fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of the proposals contained in the Bill

as it affects investor protection is therefore much

wider  than that contemplated in the Ferris Report.

This is probably inevitable since Mr G. M. Ferris,

in  his  study  of  the  securities  industry,  has

concentrated, in the main, upon ways in  which  the

Stock  Exchange  of  Malaysia and  Singapore  could

strengthen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



the basic structure of the member firms of the

Exchange,  could dampen down excessive  speculation

and  could improve trading facilities. However,  he

has  made  useful recommendations  with  regard  to

investor  protection  on such  matters  as  listing

requirements    of   companies   minimum    capital

requirements   of  member  firms,  etc.,   surprise

financial   audit   of  member   firms,   excessive

speculation  and disclosure of information  to  the

public some of which have been incorporated in this

Bill or the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1970, while

others  have been or will be incorporated in  Stock

Exchange Rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, for the first time in Singapore,

proposes to license dealers in securities and their

employees who are engaged in negotiating investment

in  securities.  The  Government  believes  that  a

system  of  control  by  licensing  of  dealers  in

securities  is necessary at this time and  this  is

particularly  so as regards dealers  in  securities

who  are  not  stockbrokers. For while stockbrokers

have  always  been  subject to certain  traditional

forms  of  control  by  the stock  exchange,  other

dealers  have not been subject to any real form  of

control.  The provisions in the Bill should  ensure

that  only persons of good character and in a sound

financial position will be permitted to be licensed

as  dealers  in securities under the Act.  Licensed

dealers will be required to keep trust accounts and

have  them  audited. This will not prove burdensome

to  stockbrokers,  for under Stock  Exchange  Rules

they have been required to maintain trust accounts.

Again,  licensed  dealers who are not  stockbrokers

will be required to enter into a fidelity bond. The

reason   for   this  is  that  the  fidelity   fund

provisions  in the Bill apply only to  stockbrokers

who  are members of the Stock Exchange. With regard

to  the  latter,  they  will find  little  that  is

unusual  about  those  provisions,  for  under  the

existing  Stock Exchange Rules a Fidelity Guarantee

Fund  was created to compensate persons who  suffer

loss  by  reason  of the default  of  members.  The

provision  in  the  Bill  therefore  merely   gives

statutory force to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



establishment of such a fund. The amount of capital

in  the  existing fund will form the basis  of  the

fund established under this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant feature of the Bill is to be

found  in Part VII, where new offences are  created

in  relation to market dealings. The first  offence

relates   to   creating  a  false   or   misleading

appearance  of  active trading in  securities;  the

second  to market rigging activities; the third  to

the  use  of fictitious transactions to affect  the

stock   market;   and  the  fourth   to   knowingly

circulating   false   rumours   with   respect   to

securities.  A  maximum  penalty  of   $30,000   or

imprisonment for five years is provided  for  these

serious offences. It may not often be necessary for

prosecutions  to be launched under these  sections,

as  in  the  United States similar provisions  have

been  used  with  great  effect  to  inhibit  those

wrongful  practices which do so much to  destroy  a

true  market in securities. The Government believes

that it is important that Parliament should clearly

state  its  abhorrence of such practices  and  that

every  effort  should be made  to  stamp  them  out

before they become widespread.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not propose to dwell upon the other

provisions of the Bill, as these are dealt with  in

some  detail in the Explanatory Memorandum, or will

be clear in the explanations on the amendments I am

introducing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding, however, I would like to clear

up  a misunderstanding that has occurred due to  an

erroneous  reference  in the Explanatory  Statement

dealing  with  clause  13. It is  not  Government's

intention that a remisier should deposit $30,000 or

$100,000   as   security  with  the  Registrar   of

Companies.  This  provision  will  apply  only   to

dealers who are not stockbrokers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend this Bill to the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>8.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Sir, very briefly, I

would like to welcome the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



introduction  of  this Bill. I  think  it  is  both

timely and necessary, as the orderly development of

financial   institutions   is   indispensable   for

economic  development.  I  welcome  especially  the

Minister's  assurance of the  co-operation  of  the

Government  of  Malaysia in this  regard.  This  is

because of the inter-relationship of the two  Stock

Exchanges of the two countries, and in a matter  of

enforcement I hope that similar co-operation  would

be forthcoming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering whether the penalties which are

specified   in   the  Bill  are  adequate   enough,

especially $30,000 as the maximum penalty. The gaol

sentence of five years, I think, would be adequate,

but in view of the fact that the ill-gotten rewards

of  market  rigging  can be very  considerable,  in

hundreds  of thousands if not millions of  dollars,

the maximum penalty of $30,000 would seem to me  to

be very trivial.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, it gives me considerable

pleasure  to rise in support of the Bill  currently

before  the House, because in the past two years  I

have  on  two occasions raised questions concerning

the  Stock Exchange in this House. In 1968, I urged

the  then  Minister  for Finance  to  consider  the

setting up of an independent commission in order to

supervise  the  Exchange. Although the  scheme  now

proposed is very much different from what I  urged,

I  am  nevertheless  satisfied that  the  stringent

provisions and requirements will put to a  stop  to

all the malpractices that have been going on in the

Stock  Exchange, very much at the  expense  of  the

small  man  - people who put their life savings  in

the Stock Exchange and one fine day wake up to find

that  their  savings are all gone. It is  all  very

pathetic. That is a situation that could  not  have

been allowed to perpetuate for too long, bearing in

mind  particularly the socialist policy adopted  by

this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity of

congratulating  the Minister on  bringing  about  a

very timely piece of legislation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



It  is  particularly encouraging to note  that  the

Minister   will  be  forming  a  special   Standing

Committee to watch over the implementation  of  the

Ordinance.  This  is,  to my  mind,  a  very  clear

demonstration  of the flexibility of  the  Minister

and  his willingness to co-operate with the private

sector  in  ensuring  that the measures  introduced

will  be  a  success. I have no doubt that  in  the

course of implementation, if it is found that there

are   areas   which   are   not   practicable    or

satisfactory, the Minister will be prepared to make

suitable amendments.



<br><br>8.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The Member for Whampoa mentioned

the  penalty of $30,000 as being perhaps too  light

for  offences  of  this  nature.  As  this  is   an

alternative  to a prison sentence, I would  suggest

that where the penalty is considered inadequate the

court might very possibly impose the other penalty,

a  prison  sentence of five years. I  am  sure  the

Member  will consider this prison sentence adequate

for even a crime of rigging and manipulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the comment of the Member for Jalan Kayu on

the   nature  of  the  organisation  which  we  are

proposing  to  set up, he mentioned an  independent

commission. I think this was considered but it  was

thought  that,  having regard to the administrative

difficulties,  the  problem  of  finding   adequate

persons  to staff an organisation on the  lines  of

the   Securities   and  Exchange  Commission,   the

solution we have arrived at - in trusting to  self-regulation by the Stock Exchange - is the best that

can be adopted in the circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Hon Sui Sen].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to make it

clear  that  "stock  brokers" and  "stock  brokers'

representatives", that is to say, remisiers, do not

fall  within the definition of "exempt  dealer".  A

stock  broker  is  a dealer and  a  remisier  is  a

dealer's  representative for the  purpose  of  this

Bill.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, managers of unit trusts buy and sell units

which  are deemed to be securities for the  purpose

of  the  Bill  directly  and not  through  dealers.

Hence, they would fall within the definition  of  a

"dealer".  It  is not proposed, however,  that  the

provisions  of  the  Bill  should  apply  to   this

category   of   persons   as   their   duties   and

there  is  another  category  of  persons,  namely,

business of dealing in securities as defined in the

Bill.  It  is  not  proposed,  however,  that   the

provisions   of  the  Bill,  which   are   designed

primarily  for  stock brokers  and  other  dealers,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition of "securities" includes the

shares  of  private companies as well as  those  of

public  companies. II has been represented that  it

would be unduly restrictive to apply the provisions

of  the  Bill  to  dealings in  shares  of  private

companies. It is considered proper that  shares  of

private  companies be excluded from the  definition

of  securities, as the primary purpose of the  Bill

is  to  regulate dealings in the shares  of  quoted

public   companies.  The  amendment  would  exclude

shares of private companies from the definition  of

dealer and is a stock broker".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment, together with

the  next  amendment,  is to  make  it  clear  that

dealers'  licences  will be  issued  to  individual

partners  or directors of member firms of  a  stock

exchange,  and  not  to the  firms  as  such.  This

follows the practice in other professions, such  as

law  and medicine, in which licences are issued  to

individuals  and not to partnerships or  companies.

In  the  case of a corporate dealer who  is  not  a

member firm, however, a licence may still be issued

to a corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment should be taken together with

the previous amendment, the purpose of which I have

already explained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment increases the deposit to be

made  by a dealer, who is not a stock broker,  from

$30,000  to  $100,000. It is considered appropriate

that the deposit should be so increased in view  of

the fact that dealers who are not stock brokers  do

not  have to comply with the stringent requirements

of  the  rules of the Stock Exchange or to  observe

the financial discipline to which stock brokers are

subject.   It  is  not  envisaged,  however,   that

licences  will be granted to more than a  few  such

dealers who are not stock brokers.

+ The provisions, appearing in the Order Paper Supplement, read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Any person who is aggrieved by any decision of

the Registrar under this Part may appeal to the

Minister and any person who is aggrieved by a

decision of a Court under section 15 and this Act

may appeal to the High Court so long as the appeal

in each case is made within thirty days of the

decision of the Registrar or the Court, as the case

may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In any appeal under this section the

decision of the Minister or the Court as the case

may be, shall be final and shall be given effect

to by the Registrar.".

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment alters the procedure for

appeal in the event of an application for the issue

or renewal of a licence being refused by the

Registrar of Companies. An aggrieved applicant will

now have to appeal to the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



whose  decision shall be final. If, however, during

the  currency of the licence the Registrar  decides

to  revoke the licence, he can only do so with  the

leave  of  a  District Court. An appeal  against  a

decision of a District Court shall lie in the  High

Court.

set out in the Order Paper Supplement.

*  The provisions, appearing in the Order Paper Supplement, read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A dealer shall within six months of the end of

the financial year lodge with the relevant

authority an auditor's report containing

information on such matters as are prescribed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If a dealer fails to comply with the provisions

of subsection (1) of this section the relevant

authority shall forthwith report the matter to the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of subsection (1) of this

section "financial year" in relation to a dealer

means the period of twelve months ending on the

date on which his accounts were closed for the year

ending on the 31st day of December, 1970.".

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to reduce

the  period allowed for the lodging of an auditor's

report from nine months to six months after the end

of  a  financial year. It also allows stock brokers

to carry on with their existing financial years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause, as originally drafted, would have had

the  effect of compelling stock brokers to adopt  a

uniform financial year. This is unnecessary for the

purposes of the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment is to allow the

Stock  Exchange to maintain two bank accounts,  one

in  Singapore and another in Malaysia in respect of

the fidelity fund. The fidelity fund can be applied

to  meet the liabilities of any member firm of  the

Exchange irrespective of whether the member firm is

based  in  Singapore or Malaysia. It is  considered

expedient   that  the  Exchange  should,   in   the

circumstances, be free to operate bank accounts  in

both territories.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the

clause be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 12 of the Bill, the Registrar of

Companies has the power to grant or renew a licence

subject  to such conditions or restrictions  as  he

thinks fit. Under clause 15 the Registrar may  also

take steps with a view to revoking a licence. It is

important,  therefore, that  the  Registrar  should

also  have  the  necessary authority  to  ascertain

whether  the holder of a licence has complied  with

the  provisions of the law and also whether he  has

complied   with  any  conditions  or   restrictions

subject  to  which  his  licence  was  granted   or

renewed.  For this purpose New Clause (A) [the  new

clause  72]  empowers the Registrar to inspect  the

books  and  documents  of,  and  to  require   that

information be supplied to him by, the holder of  a

licence.  In addition, the Minister may appoint  an

inspector  to  investigate  any  matter  concerning

trading or dealings in securities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new clause 72 confers on the Registrar

certain  powers  to ensure that  the  holder  of  a

licence  abides by the provisions of the Bill.  The

new clause 73 lays down what action can be taken if

it  appears to the Registrar that the holder  of  a

dealer's licence is or is likely to be in breach of

the   law.  The  clause  provides  that   in   such

circumstances   the   High  Court   may,   on   the

application of the Registrar, make one or more of a

number of orders. Before making any order, however,

the Court shall satisfy itself that the order would

not unfairly prejudice any person. Contravention of

any  order so made is an offence punishable with  a

fine  of  $3,000  or imprisonment for  a  term  not

exceeding   one   year  or  both  such   fine   and

imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

"

Production and       (1) If, on an application made to a

inspection       judge of the High Court in chambers  by

of               the  Registrar,  there  is  shown to be

books            reasonable  cause  to  believe that any

where            person   has   committed   an   offence

dealing          in  connection   with   trading  or  in

offence          securities  and  that  evidence  of the

suspected        offence is to be found in any books  or

                evidence of the offence; or



                    (b) requiring  the  dealer  or  such

                of business  of the  person  named  in the

                order  unless  the Court is satisfied that

                the books or papers  are  not required  in

                the  conduct of the business or that there

                are special reasons requiring the books or

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the

clause be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas the provisions of Parts II to V of the

Bill   apply   largely   to   dealers   and   their

representatives, the provisions of Part VII of  the

Bill-Trading in securities-apply to any  member  of

the public. In the same manner that the new clauses

72  and  73  provide  for offences  by  holders  of

licences,  the new clause 74 provides for  offences

by  members of the public. If it appears to a Judge

of  the  High  Court,  on  an  application  by  the

Registrar, that any person has committed an offence

under  Part  VII  of the Bill, the  Judge  may,  by

order,  cause the books of a dealer to be inspected

if he considers that relevant evidence can be found

in  the dealer's books. The new clause 74, like the

new  clauses  72  and  73,  is  necessary  for  the

efficient  administration and  enforcement  of  the

provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>8.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Sir,

I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Companies (Amendment) Bill, which is a

necessary adjunct to the Securities Industry  Bill,

deals with four main topics in the field of Company

law, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) disclosure of substantial share-holdings in

companies listed on the Stock Exchange;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) disclosure, by the directors of a company,

of   information  to  be  included  in   the

directors' report;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) company investigations; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) offences for spreading false or misleading

statements by the officers of a company.



<br><br>The  provisions  of  the  Bill  would  considerably

strengthen the Companies Act which already contains

extensive provisions on investor protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the first topic, clause 6 of

the  Bill  introduces  a new  Division  3A  to  the

Companies  Act. The provisions of the new  Division

require  that  the  acquisition  or  existence   of

substantial  shareholdings - which is  defined  for

this  purpose as 10 per cent or more of the  voting

shares  in a company - should be disclosed  to  the

management and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



other  shareholders. A substantial  shareholder  is

required  to give notice in writing to the  company

of full particulars of his holding, and the company

in   turn  is  required  to  keep  a  register   of

substantial  shareholders which  will  be  open  to

inspection  by  shareholders  and  members  of  the

public.  These  provisions apply  to  all  persons,

whether resident in Singapore or elsewhere, and  to

all  holdings, whether direct or indirect. So  that

foreign  investors will know of their  obligations,

nominee  companies  and trustees  are  required  to

inform  persons for whom they hold  shares  of  the

requirements of the legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a company or a substantial shareholder fails

to  comply with these requirements, the company  or

the  substantial shareholder, as the case  may  be,

shall  be  guilty  of an offence and  liable  to  a

penalty  of $3,000 and, in the case of a continuing

offence, to a further penalty of $500 for every day

the  offence continues. It is further provided that

if  a  substantial shareholder fails to comply with

these   requirements,  the  Court   may,   on   the

application   of  the  Minister,  make   an   order

restraining  dealing in the shares  or  direct  the

sale  of  the shares or direct the company  not  to

register a transfer of the shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, which introduces a new section 6A in

the  Companies Act, defines an "interest in shares"

for  this  purpose. The degree  of  detail  in  the

definition  gives an indication  of  the  scope  of

clause 6 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reasons for requiring disclosure of

substantial  shareholdings in the  case  of  listed

companies  are  that shareholders are  entitled  to

know -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether there are in existence substantial

holdings  of  shares which  might  enable  a

single individual or corporation, or a small

group,  to  control  the  destinies  of  the

company; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if there are such substantial holdings, who

the persons are on whose exercise of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voting power the future of the company may

depend.



<br><br>Disclosure  of  substantial  shareholdings  is  now

required  in  the  United States  of  America,  the

United Kingdom and in certain states in Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7, which introduces a new section 132A,

makes  an officer of a company, who takes advantage

of special confidential information to enter into a

transaction  with  another person,  liable  to  any

person who can show that he suffered loss by reason

of  a  fall in value of the subject matter  of  the

transaction. The new section will cover cases where

an   officer  of  a  company  buys  or   sells   in

anticipation   of  a  favourable  or   unfavourable

announcement  or  in cases where  the  confidential

information is not intended to be released or is to

be released at a later date. Clause 8, which amends

section  132  of the Act, makes it clear  that  the

section  deals  with misuse of  information  by  an

officer  and not, for example, with cases where  an

authorised  disclosure of information has  resulted

in detriment to the company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next main topic of the Bill is the disclosure

by  directors of information to be included in  the

directors' report. Clause 11, which amends  section

169   of  the  Companies  Act,  requires  that  the

directors' report shall, in future, include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) details and purposes of any share issue

during the financial years;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) interests acquired by directors in any

shares  or  debentures during the  financial

year;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the number and amount of shares acquired by

directors, whether in the company  or  in  a

subsidiary or a holding company, details  of

which  appear in the Register of  Directors'

Shareholdings;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) details of the financial affairs of the

company  and of the accounts of the  Company

as well as any contracts made by the company

with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;director or any firm in which a director is

a  member  or  with  a company  in  which  a

director has substantial financial interest.



<br><br>Under  clause 10, which amends section 134  of  the

Act,  criteria  that  have  been  applied  to   the

registration of substantial shareholders are,  with

modifications,   applied   to   the   Register   of

Directors'   Shareholdings.  Also,  the  obligation

imposed  upon  directors to inform the  company  of

shareholdings in the company is extended  to  cases

in   which   directors   have   a   contingent   or

reversionary  interest  in  shares  or  any   other

interest in the company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of Members to

the provisions of clause 12 of the Bill which gives

the Registrar of Companies the power to relieve the

directors   of  a  particular  company   from   any

requirements  of the Act relating to the  form  and

content  of accounts or to the form and content  of

directors' reports. This clause, in recognition  of

the  fact  that it may not be appropriate in  every

case  for the information to be disclosed or to  be

disclosed  in  the  required  manner,  allows   the

Registrar  of  Companies  to  substitute  different

requirements   where   such   a   course    appears

appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 increases the penalty where a director,

with fraudulent intention, fails to comply with the

provisions  of  the Act dealing with disclosure  by

directors and the keeping of accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third main topic of the Bill is concerned

with  amendments to Part IX of the Act dealing with

company  investigations. Clause 17,  which  repeals

and   re-enacts  section  208  of  the   Act   with

modifications,  enables  the  Minister  to  require

information as to persons interested in  shares  or

debentures of a corporation, including a banking or

insurance  corporation, without  the  necessity  of

appointing  an  inspector.  The  new  section   208

confers  wide powers to investigate holdings  where

the  Minister thinks fit so to do. Clause 15, which

amends   section  194  of  the  Act,  defines   the

"affairs"  of  a  company for the  purposes  of  an

investigation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



under  Part  IX  of the Act. Clause 16  permits  an

inspector,  with  the consent of the  Minister,  to

extend his investigation to a related company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 18 and 19 deal with the fourth main topic

of   the  Bill,  namely,  offences  for  false   or

misleading statements and false reports by officers

of  a company. The existing provision under section

364  of the Act is extended, under clause 18 of the

Bill, to the authorising of the making of false  or

misleading  statements  or  wilfully  omitting  any

thing  without  which the document  is  misleading.

Clause 19 introduces an important amendment in that

it  provides  for  the first time  for  a  specific

offence for an officer of a corporation to make any

false  or  misleading  statement  or  report  to  a

director,  auditor,  member,  debenture-holder   or

trustee for debenture-holders or to the auditor  of

a  holding  company  or  to  a  stock  exchange  in

Singapore   or   elsewhere.  In   the   past,   the

obligations  under  the  Companies  Act  have  been

mainly  confined  to  obligations  in  relation  to

documents  filed with the Registrar or to  be  laid

before   the  company  in  general  meeting.   This

provision  acknowledges that certain office-holders

and  stock  exchanges also have a real interest  in

not  being  deceived  as to  the  position  of  the

company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Companies Act is modelled on the

Australian and United Kingdom Companies  Acts  and,

therefore,  reports  by expert  committees  on  the

provisions  and  the  working  of  these  Acts   in

Australia  and  the United Kingdom  are  of  direct

relevance  to our own Company law. The  inspiration

for  the amendments proposed in this Bill has come,

in  the main, from the recommendations made by  the

Jenkins  Committee in the United  Kingdom  and  the

Eggleston Committee in Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>9.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Sir, firstly, I am sure you will

bear  with me, and this House also, over a point  I

wish to raise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



regarding  a mistake in English in a small  portion

of one of the clauses of this Bill. I refer to page

15, from line 4 onwards:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An officer of a company who, in any transaction

to  which this section applies, makes use  for  his

own benefit or behalf,'.



<br><br>There  is  an obvious grammatical error  here.  It

should be "makes use for his own benefit or on  his

own  behalf,". I think this House should  see  that

the standards of legal draftsmanship are adequately

high   and   that  there  should  be  a  linguistic

impeccability  where the drafting of  our  laws  is

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I would urge the Minister to

make  an  appropriate amendment to this portion  of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, although I hasten to deny any

expertness where matters related to this  Bill  and

the Securities industry Bill are concerned, yet, as

a  layman,  I would imagine that the provisions  of

these   two   Bills  would  require   an   adequate

enforcement  machinery. If  this  is  so,  can  the

Minister  say whether there is this machinery  and,

if not, whether steps will be taken to provide it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am much obliged to the

Member  for  pointing  out the  deficiency  in  the

drafting  of the Bill in page 15, line  6.  At  the

appropriate  time, I will, with the general  assent

of  the  House,  move the amendment  which  he  has

suggested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's second point on

enforcement machinery, the position is that as  the

new  provisions have not yet been passed I have not

set up any machinery as yet. But on the passing  of

the  Bill,  I will certainly set up the appropriate

machinery  to see that administration of  the  Bill

will be adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Hon Sui Sen].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, lines 31 and 32, to leave out "has an

interest under the trust" and insert "knows or  has

reasonable  grounds for believing that  he  has  an

interest  under the trust and the property  subject

to the trust consists of or includes those shares".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is of a drafting nature and

is  designed  to  remove doubts in or  improve  the

wording  of  the  proposed new section  6A  of  the

Companies Act. The words "has an interest under the

trust"  have  been  most  specifically  drafted  to

convey  the  idea that a person must know  or  must

have  reasonable grounds for believing that he  has

an  interest under the trust before it can be  said

that  that  person has an interest in  shares,  the

subject of the trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, lines 34 to 41, to leave out subclause

(3) and insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(3) Where a right (being a right or an interest

described in the definition of "interest" in

section 84 of this Act) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) was issued or offered to the public for

subscription or purchase, or where the public was

invited to subscribe for or purchase such a right,

and the right was so subscribed for or purchased;

or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) was issued for the purpose of an offer to the

public by and is held by the management company

within the meaning of that section,



<br><br>that right does not constitute an interest in a

share.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is proposed to remove a doubt

as  to whether a right, being an interest in shares

as  defined  in  section 84 of the  Companies  Act,

which was issued for the purpose of an offer to the

public and which is held by a management company as

defined  in that section, is an interest in  shares

under  this  section. This would cover a  right  to

units under a unit trust scheme and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



is  relevant as regards the application of the  new

section 69A dealing with substantial shareholdings.

As at present drafted, it is not clear that such  a

right does not constitute an interest in a share.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>9.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 4, to leave out "likely" and

insert  "is under an obligation whether  formal  or

informal".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the use of the words "likely to act" in

relation  to control of a corporation by  directors

where the corporation has an interest in the shares

would lead to difficulties in interpretation. It is

considered  that the substitution of the  words  is

under an obligation whether formal or informal"  is

more  specific and will remove the difficulties  in

interpretation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further amendments made:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 26, to leave out "likely" and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this again is a drafting amendment designed

to  relate the provisions in this section to  those

of  the Securities Industry Bill. The definition of

a "stock



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



exchange" in the Securities Industry Bill  includes

but  is  not  confined  to the  Stock  Exchange  of

Malaysia   and  Singapore.  The  effect   of   this

amendment  would be to extend the  meaning  of  the

word "company" to a company whose shares are listed

in any approved stock exchange.

obligation of a substantial shareholder  to  notify

the  company  of  his interests and  the  name  and

address  and  full  particulars of  his  interests,

including  the name of the person who is registered

as  the  holder.  The amendment to this  subsection

shareholder in the voting shares in that company.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to add a

new  subsection (3) to the proposed section 69E  to

make it clear that the change in the interests of a

substantial shareholder in the voting shares  in  a

company   takes   place   where   the   substantial

shareholder  acquires or disposes of voting  shares

in   the   company,  and  thus  ensures  that   the

substantial  shareholder is under an obligation  to

notify  the  particulars  of  this  change  in  his

interests.

<br><br>9.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. Wong Lin Ken):</b> Sir, I beg to move, `That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in the Parliamentary

sitting  of  4th November this year, my  colleague,

the  Minister  of  Defence,  had  announced  in   a

Ministerial  statement that it is the intention  of

the  Government  to allow children of  parents  who

wish to send them abroad for secondary education to

leave the country. However, the Government requires

adequate  safeguards  from such  parents  that  the

children  will  be  sent home  to  discharge  their

national   service  obligations  to  the   country.

Passports will not be issued unless parents provide

adequate  security in cash bond or  bank  guarantee

that when their children reach their 18th birthday,

they  will  return  to Singapore  to  do  full-time

national  service. If the children fail to  return,

the bond will be forfeited, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



Government will take steps to bring them home.  In

the new enlistment policy, no distinction will  be

made  with respect to students at home and abroad,

when  they  reach  the  age  liable  for  national

service.  Neither will deferment nor exemption  be

granted on the grounds that they have been  placed

in  institutions of higher learning except for  25

per  cent  of the H.S.C, students who may  proceed

next  year to the local universities on the  basis

of  ballot. My colleague, the Minister of Defence,

has  already explained the rationale for  the  new

enlistment policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be recalled that there was public outcry

that  the  rich had sent their children abroad  to

dodge national service. Since July this year,  the

Immigration Department has not issued passports to

boys  below  l6« years for purposes  of  secondary

schooling  abroad.  The  result  has  been  public

criticism against the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has reviewed the policy of total

refusal  of granting of passports and has come  to

the  view that it is unduly restrictive. There may

be parents who quite honestly believe, although  I

think  they  are quite mistaken in  their  belief,

that  their  children will be better  equipped  in

life  if they receive their education abroad  than

at  home. There is also genuine public demand that

those who can afford to send their children abroad

for  secondary education should not take advantage

of  their  wealth to provide their  children  with

opportunities  to  avoid  their  national  service

liability. The Government endorses this position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is equally inequitable to impose a

total  ban on the issue of passports as  to  leave

unremedied an avenue by which those who so  desire

can  utilize their wealth to enable their sons  to

dodge national service. A rational solution to the

problem  must allow those who wish to  send  their

children abroad the opportunity to do so but  also

impose   a  penalty  on  those  who  exploit   the

opportunity to save their children the  burden  of

national service, which should be borne by all,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



without distinction as to social classes For  this

reason, the Government has planned to introduce  a

scheme  of bonding students on overseas schooling,

the  operation of which makes it possible to  lift

the  restriction on the issue of passports and  to

provide  sanctions  against those  whose  ulterior

motive is to avoid national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Passports Ordinance (Chapter 103), which the

Passports  Act,  1970, seeks  to  replace,  is  an

archaic    piece   of   legislation,    originally

introduced  half  a, century  ago.  It  does  not

provide  a statutory basis to enable the  Minister

in  charge  of  Immigration  to  make  regulations

governing   the  issue,  renewal  or  refusal   of

passports,  particularly to meet the  requirements

of the bonding system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Passports Ordinance (Chapter 103) cannot be

neatly  amended  to  provide  for  such  statutory

power.  For  this technical reason, the  Passports

Act, 1970, has been introduced. Advantage has been

taken  to  remedy certain defects, in the existing

Ordinance. At present, the Minister in  charge  of

Immigration may invalidate, cancel or withdraw  a.

passport  already issued to a person, but  neither

an  immigration  nor a police  officer  has  legal

power  to  recover  the  passport  if  the  holder

refuses  to  surrender it. In such an  event,  the

holder  can  still use the passport,  despite  the

fact  that  the  Minister has declared  it  to  be

invalidated   or   cancelled.  Legal   power   for

impounding   or  re-possessing  a   passport   is,

therefore,  essential if the  order  made  by  the

Minister to invalidate or cancel a passport is  to

be made effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present Bill, the Minister will be

empowered  to remedy this deficiency. In addition,

the  Bill  incorporates the  various  actions  for

which   the   Minister  may,  at   present,   make

regulations  under  section  2  of  the   existing

Passports  Ordinance. When regulations  are  made,

they   will  be  published  in  the  Gazette   and

presented to this House in accordance with  clause

3 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides for all fines

imposed, and all monies forfeited,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



and  recovered under the Passport Regulations  made

under  this  Bill, to be paid into the Consolidated

Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides that a passport or

any visa, renewal or endorsement, issued or granted

immediately prior to the commencement of this  Act,

shall continue in force, unless cancelled under the

provisions of any regulations of the proposed  Act.

Finally,  clause  6 repeals the existing  Passports

Ordinance (Cap. 103).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that the Passport Regulations made

under this Bill will come into operation early next

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier I have explained that the immediate

objective of introducing this Passports Act  is  to

empower  the  Minister in charge of Immigration  to

set  up a scheme for bonding boys sent overseas for

secondary education. It is obvious that the  scheme

must necessarily be tailored to meet the enlistment

policy of the Ministry of Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bonding scheme, all male citizens born

on  or  after  1st January, 1949,  and  liable  for

national   service,   will  be   subject   to   the

requirement  of  a  bond if they  wish  to  proceed

overseas  for  studies, if they  have  not  already

completed their national service obligation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those above the age of 16« years will be granted

an  exit  permit,  subject  to  their  parents'  or

guardians'  furnishing  a  cash  bond  or  banker's

guarantee,  that  these boys will return  to  serve

national  service on their reaching the age  of  18

years, or the scheduled date of completion of their

respective  stages  of studies,  whichever  is  the

greater.  The  amount  of  cash  bond  or  banker's

guarantee  is  graduated according tolines  of   the

graduated scheme have already been worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme, guarantors are divided into

three  categories.  Under  category  "A"  are   the

employees   of  government,  statutory  bodies   or

educational  institutions. The amount of  guarantee

required is $20,000 or the total



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



gross  income declared in the income tax return  of

the preceding year, whichever is the greater.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under category "B" are employees in the private

sector,     excluding    managerial,     executive,

professional  and related personnel. The  guarantee

required  of them amounts to $30,000 or  the  total

gross  income declared in the income tax return  of

the preceding year, whichever is the greater.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category includes all others excluded

in the other two categories. The amount required of

these  persons is $50,000 or the total gross income

declared  in the income tax return of the preceding

year, whichever is the greater.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department will issue passports

to male citizens above l6« years on presentation of

valid  exit  permits. It will  issue  passports  to

boys,  11  to l6« years old, on the same conditions

as those required of boys above 16« years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those in the two age groups now studying

abroad will be bonded in the same way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonding scheme will exempt those awarded

scholarships by the Public Service Commission,  the

Government, and statutory boards, and those awarded

prestigious  scholarships endorsed  by  the  Public

Service Commission, e.g., the Rhodes and Fullbright

awards.  Exempted  also are  those  who  leave  the

Republic  for not more than six months for holidays

and other purposes, those who have discharged their

national   service  obligations,  and   those   not

required   for  full-time  or  part-time   national

service for a variety of reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Appeals Committee will be set up with powers

to deal with appeals made by parents whose boys are

already abroad, should they feel they are unable to

meet the guarantee requirements. The Committee will

be  empowered to waive in full or in part the bond,

depending on the merits of each individual  appeal.

The  Appeals Committee, however, will not  consider

current applications for overseas schooling.
