<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>ATOMIC WAR-HEADS AND ROCKET SITES IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether the Government will ascertain from the  United

Kingdom Government if any atomic war-heads are  stored

in  Singapore and whether there are any atomic  rocket

sites  in  Singapore, and the extent of the  potential

danger to the people through accident.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I have

sought  the  information asked for by the  Member  for

Anson  from  the U.K. Commissioner. He has written  to

say  that this question relates to matters of  defence

which under the Constitution is the responsibility  of

the  British  Government, and  that  it  is  not  the

practice  in  the United Kingdom, in  answer  to  such

questions  to confirm or deny the presence of  nuclear

weapons at particular places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point worth noting is that under the Communist

proposals for full internal self-government  with  the

Internal  Security  Council  abolished,  defence   and

foreign  affairs will continue to be in the  hands  of

the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after independence through merger, defence

will  be in the hands of an elected government of  the

new  and larger Federation, and members of the Central

Parliament will be able to ask questions on matters of

defence with more authority.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Does the Prime Minister

recognise that it is not a question of locality, but a

question of our entire State? The issue whether  these

atomic  war-heads are in this State affects the safety

and  the  survival  of our people. Surely,  from  that

point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



of  view, we are entitled to have some information  in

order to make some preparation for possible accidents.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson is now

embarking   on  a  debate.  The  Prime  Minister   has

indicated  his  responsibilities, and I  do  not  know

whether he wishes to add to that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can only say

that  there  are illustrious examples  in  the  United

Kingdom in the Committee of One Hundred. If the Member

for  Anson feels sufficiently strong about this matter

of  war heads being stored, as he suspects, either  in

the  Naval  Base  or  Changi,  or  wherever  else  the

launching pads may be, he is not without precedent  in

this  matter. The Government has always been more than

ready  and  willing to allow all methods  of  peaceful

persuasion and demonstration.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I seem to have been

misunderstood. I am inquiring from the Prime  Minister

whether  he  has  considered the aspects  of  possible

accidents  which  will  affect  the  safety  and   the

survival  of the people and, from that point of  view,

seek information of a general character indicated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> In my somewhat rudimentary

knowledge  of  the  law  of  nuclear  physics,  I   am

convinced  that  accidents  arise  not  in  the   bomb

accidentally  being  exploded in the  storehouse,  but

more,  I believe, in a war being launched accidentally

through  misjudgment of each other's determination  to

resist.  In  that eventuality, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

Member  for  Anson's  safety and  mine  are  similarly

imperilled and I can only say that if we do not  sleep

well  o'nights,  then we shall all be  very  sick  men

indeed. It is a very sick world, Mr Speaker, Sir, and

I  do not wish to inflict upon the people of Singapore

the  deep  horrors of gradual extinction in a  nuclear

fallout   or  of  total  annihilation  in  a   nuclear

holocaust -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What are you doing?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

suggested  to  the  Member for Anson  the  illustrious

examples  of great philosophers like Bertrand  Russell

and  other  equally eminent and philosophic gentlemen.

All that is required is sufficient verve, vitality and

persistence  through methods of democratic  persuasion

to bring home the misfortunes of having to be involved

with deterrent weapons of destruction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CIVIL DEFENCE PROVISIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN TIME OF WAR</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether the Government will consider the feasibility

of Civil Defence provisions for the people in time of

war.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, token provision exists in

the current Estimates to resuscitate the Civil Defence

Corps  should the necessity ever arise. Civil  Defence

provisions  however,  are  only  envisaged   for   the

conventional type of warfare in what is now  popularly

called localised wars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am informed that the dropping of a nuclear bomb in

the megaton range on any city would wipe out the whole

population and devastate the whole area. Against  such

a   catastrophe,   civil  defence  measures,   as   is

understood, would be quite unrealistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is reported that some enterprising

contractors  in  California, U.S.A.,  have  made  good

sales   of   "fall-out"   shelters.   The   Government

understands, however, that these contractors  are  not

sponsored by the U.S. Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In the light of the knowledge the

Prime Minister has of the potential calamity for  this

area, would he indicate whether Government would  give

its support for an anti-nuclear movement here?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I have always been a great

supporter  of all movements to ensure the preservation

of  mankind. But I would like to draw the attention of

the Member for Anson to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



the   fact   that  the  danger  is  not   particularly

concentrated  in any particular spot in the  world.  I

see  no  particular  incidence of  annihilation  being

increased  as  a  result of our being  in  a  somewhat

obsolete  military  base meant for localised  wars  in

this  area of the world. I am told that from  time  to

time  the  Russians send off notes to not so  friendly

nations of their retaliatory and complete annihilative

powers,  and several governments have been in  receipt

of  them, governments such as Pakistan and Turkey, who

allow   American  bases  and  launching  pads  to   be

installed  in their territories. However, I note  that

in  none  of  the Russian notes to the United  Kingdom

Government  has  the Russian leader,  Mr  Khrushchev,

singled  out Singapore for special attention. However,

that  is  not to say that I am not aware of  the  real

danger  of either slow death through a nuclear fallout

or  complete  destruction of the world  in  a  blazing

holocaust if somebody accidentally misjudges the other

side's  temper  and presses the button  at  the  wrong

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, could we have a reply to

my  question?  Recognising the potential calamity  for

this  area, would the Prime Minister indicate  whether

the  Government would give its support  for  an  anti-nuclear  movement  in  this  State?  It  is  a  simple

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> The first question was whether

I,  as  Prime  Minister,  would  support  and  I  have

indicated  that I give support for all  movements  for

the  preservation and upliftment of mankind. Now,  the

question  is  whether the Government  would  give  its

support. Without having consulted my colleagues,  Sir,

I  give the Member for Anson the full assurance  that,

as  we  are all human beings on this side of the House

who  would like to see the survival of the human race,

including  human beings on the opposite side  of  this

House,  we  will support all movements which  seek  to

preserve the human race, defective though it  may  be,

from total annihilation. If the Member for Anson could

only indicate the time and place at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



which  his equivalent to the Committee of One  Hundred

would  take  action,  we would  ensure  that  adequate

publicity  is  given to him through television,  radio

and other means.

<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SCHEME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Labour

(a)   whether   the  joint  discussions  between   the

Government,  the  Unions and the employers, with  the

view  to  agreement on unemployment insurance  as  the

first  step  to  a more comprehensive social  security

scheme,  have  taken place, and what  is  the  outcome

thereof;  and  (b)  whether he  will  make  a  further

statement  of Government's intentions with  regard  to

the  introduction of social security  measures  during

this session.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

been  asked by my colleague, the Minister for  Labour,

to  reply  to  this question. The reason is  that  the

Government held a series of meetings in December  1960

and  January 1961 with certain Trade Union leaders  to

discuss, among other things, the introduction  of  an

unemployment  insurance  scheme  in  Singapore  and  I

represented the Government on that occasion.  In  all,

five  meetings were held and an agreed report prepared

for submission to the Cabinet. The Trade Union leaders

concerned in this series of meetings were Messrs.  Lim

Ching  Siong, S. Woodhull, D. Puthucheary  and  S.  T.

Bani.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report has not been released earlier for

publication at the request of the Trade Union leaders.

I  intend, however, to quote the section of the report

dealing  with  unemployment insurance, as  this  would

give  a  clear indication of the Government's attitude

towards  the  subject of unemployment insurance.  That

section of the report reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Unemployment insurance



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government side pressed the case for

unemployment insurance on the basis of a 1½ per  cent

contribution  by  employer  and  employee.  With   an

unemployment  rate of 8 per cent, this  would  ensure

unemployment benefits of about 40 per cent  of  wages

earned  during  work. If the rate of unemployment  is

less,  the  rate of benefits could be increased.  The

Government proposed that the unemployment  scheme  be

introduced and be restricted, in the first  instance,

to  those  industries  demarcated  for  stability.  A

tripartite committee consisting of representatives of

the  Government,  the  T.U.C. and  Employers  should

manage  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Fund  and  have

powers  to  vary the rates of benefits in  accordance

with   the   financial  state  of   the   Fund.   The

Government's  contribution would be to  pay  for  all

benefits   during  the  first  sear  of  the   Fund's

operation  to allow the Fund to accumulate sufficient

money  from which it could earn interest to  pay  for

administrative  expenses. A  detailed  administrative

scheme  had  been  prepared by the Central  Provident

Fund  and there are no administrative policy or other

barriers  to  the  immediate  implementation  of  the

Unemployment Insurance Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T.U.C. members supported the unemployment

insurance in principle, hut requested that the matter

be further considered by the T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of discussion, the Government side

stressed that redundancy schemes, severance  pay  and

even   unemployment  insurance  are  no   more   than

palliatives to a disease. These measures are intended

to  reduce  the  sharp  edge of suffering  caused  by

unemployment  of workers. Further, where  the  worker

finds  it  difficult to get another job, retrenchment

often  sparks  off  determined  opposition  from  the

workers, leading to strikes. The proposals considered

and  recommended would reduce the distress caused  by

unemployment.  But it is not the basic  solution:  in

fact,  in themselves, they will do nothing to  reduce

unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only solution lies in creating conditions

whereby  the  economy could expand at a  sufficiently

fast  rate so that there will be more jobs  than  men

available.    When   this   position   is    reached,

retrenchment  and  redundancy  do  not  present   any

problem   to   the   worker.  Further,   under   such

conditions, the way would he open for the worker to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



obtain   regular   increases  of  pay   through   the

collective  bargaining power of  the  unions.  It  was

recognised  that the maintenance of stability  in  the

industrial   sector  would  he  one  of  the   factors

conducive to industrial growth and economic expansion,

and  for  this  reason, both the  Government  and  the

T.U.C, representatives in the Sub-Committee are agreed

that  everything  that could contribute  to  stability

should  be  pursued, and that any  measures  that  are

inimical to it should be refrained from.'



<br><br>That is part of the report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, although these trade unionists stated that

they  supported the unemployment insurance  scheme  in

principle, they had taken no step whatsoever to obtain

support  from  the  workers for  the  principle  of  a

contributory unemployment insurance scheme.  In  fact,

in the course of discussions on the subject, they made

it quite clear that they did not want such a scheme to

be introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will note that these leaders had  given

an undertaking that they would refrain from any action

which  is  inimical to stability and do everything  to

promote  stability  which is necessary  in  industrial

expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another section of the report puts the matter even

more clearly when it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It will be the responsibility of the T.U.C, to

ensure  that  industrial peace is maintained  for  the

period of the agreement.'



<br><br>It  is  now evident to everyone that these trade union

leaders  had not the slightest intention of  honouring

their  pledge  to  the Government. Far  from  ensuring

industrial peace, recent events -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. The questions are

simple and they are not being answered. Instead we are

having  polemics  in  respect of political  opponents.

Could the Minister be requested to confine himself  to

the question?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The rule governing all questions is

that  an  answer  must  be within  the  scope  of  the

question  asked. If it goes beyond the  scope  of  the

question  asked,  then,  of course,  the  Minister  is

always  entitled  to  make  a  ministerial  statement.

Whether  he  makes  it now, or after  questions  is  a

matter of convenience, I leave it entirely to him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



Strictly, he should make the statement after questions

so  that,  if he then thinks fit and the statement  is

controversial,  he can always move the adjournment  to

have the statement debated.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> On another point of

order.  May  I  ask  whether it is permissible  for  a

ministerial  statement to include subjects  which  may

rightly be considered to be anticipating a debate on a

subject that is on the Order Paper - that is, my  motion

on industrial unrest?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think what the Minister has

said has any strict relation to the motion, mentioned,

which is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House views with grave concern the

mounting  of  industrial  unrest  and  calls  on   the

Government  to  take all reasonable  steps  to  ensure

industrial peace...'.



<br><br>I  think the Minister is recounting what happened at a

meeting  of  trade unionists and indicating  how  they

had - as alleged by him - not kept their undertaking given

to  Government. But as the feeling of the Assembly  is

such,  I  think  I ought to apply the Standing  Orders

very  strictly  and ask the Minister  either  to  keep

strictly  to  an answer to the question, or  bide  his

time  and  wait until after questions to continue  his

statement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am keeping

strictly to the question. Questions of this kind  have

been coming in regularly from the Member for Anson and

I wish to dispose of this issue once and for all. What

I  am  saying  will lead to the conclusion  explaining

just  why  and how negotiations with the  trade  union

leaders  for  the  implementation of social  insurance

came to nothing. Sir,I have to go into this matter in

some  detail  to  justify  the  conclusion  that   the

Government  has  been completely  reasonable  all  the

time,  but meeting with bad faith from the other side.

This is strictly relevant to the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if I may be permitted to continue. The

trade  union  leaders  say they  support  unemployment

insurance in principle but in practice they oppose it.

Exactly in the same way, they say they support  merger

in principle but in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



practice  oppose it. Similarly, they support  Malaysia

in  principle but oppose it in practice. Hon.  Members

are only too familiar with this kind of double-talk on

the  part of the Communists and their stooges  in  the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> P.A.P. side.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must now rule the Minister

completely  out of order because answers to  questions

must  be  strictly  statements  which  do  not  invite

debate,  and  the  Minister  is  obviously  making   a

statement which does invite debate. So if he  proceeds

in  that strain, I must stop him if he considers  that

that  is  the answer to the question. I have indicated

that  if  he  wishes to pursue that line of statement,

then he must wait and make a ministerial statement  at

the end.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, if you had only

borne  with  me for just two more seconds,  you  would

have  seen  the relevance. As I was saying,  in  these

circumstances,  it  is quite futile  to  have  further

discussions   with  those  union   leaders   for   the

implementation of unemployment insurance, let alone  a

more expensive social security scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may mention that I have had informal discussions

with representatives of the employers' association  in

Singapore   and  they  have  agreed  to  support   the

contributory unemployment insurance scheme should  the

Government  introduce  such  a  measure.  It  is  only

certain  trade union leaders who oppose  this  scheme.

Why  do  they  oppose it? The reason to  me  is  quite

simple.  They  do not want stability and  progress  in

Singapore. They oppose unemployment insurance  because

this will reduce tension on the industrial front,  and

with a reduction of tension and discontent it will  be

difficult  for  them  to foment  trouble.  If  further

evidence  of  their  evil  intentions  is  needed,  my

colleague, Mr Devan Nair, will only be too pleased to

provide  them. He told me of the advice which Mr  Lim

Ching Siong had given -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must now stop the Minister. I

must rule all this out of order and if he proceeds  on

that  line, he must stop giving his answer. I  suggest

that he wait till after Question Time.

<div align="center"><b>(Terms of settlement of strike)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Labour

whether he will indicate the broad terms of settlement

of  the strike of the employees of the Oversea-Chinese

Bank in January this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the strike arose as a

result   of  an  allegation  by  the  Singapore   Bank

Employees   that  the  management  had   admitted   to

subverting its members by offering and making payments

to  some  clerical employees of the Bank in accordance

with the Bank's own interpretation of the recent award

of the Industrial Arbitration Court, although the Bank

knew that the Union had challenged the correctness  of

the  Bank's interpretation and had declined to  accept

such  payments pending a conclusive interpretation  of

the award by the Industrial Arbitration Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations for the settlement of the strike did

not  take  place in the Ministry of Labour or  in  the

presence   of  Ministry  officials.  A  Press   report

indicated that there had been an expression of  regret

by  the  management  of  the  Oversea-Chinese  Banking

Corporation for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



payments  made  to  some  union  members  against  the

Union's  stand. My Ministry also understand  that  the

Union successfully contended that, as the strike was a

justified  one,  the  management of  the  Bank  should

compensate  the members for their loss of  pay  during

the  strike  and  that the Managing  Director  of  the

Oversea-Chinese  Banking  Corporation,  Mr  Tan  Chin

Tuan, make a confidential payment of, a sizable sum of

money  to  the Union for distribution to its employees

in settlement of the Union's claim.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Labour

what is the average hourly earning for all workmen  in

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr

on  what basis the Member for Anson alleged that there

was  a drop in the earnings of wage-earners. From  the

statistics,  it would appear that for the  year  1960,

the  average  hourly  earning was  81  cents.  So  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The photographs listed by the Member

for  Anson have been incorporated in the book for  the

same  reasons  as the other photographs  in  the  book

which the Member has not listed in his enquiries.  The

photographs either illustrate or amplify the  text  of

the  book.  For  example,  on  page  10  there  is   a

photograph  of  the  Member for Anson  at  the  Baling

Talks.  He  has  quite  rightly  not  questioned   the

propriety   of   its   inclusion.   Like   the   other

photographs,  it helps to illustrate  or  augment  the

main  theme of the book, that is, the struggle between

the  non-Communist socialists on the one hand and  the

Communists and pro-Communists on the other to win the.

hearts  and minds of the people in Malaya. The  Member

for  Anson  will  agree that all the photographs  have

been aptly chosen, including the one of himself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Minister for Culture is less than

frank.  That photograph of myself at Baling is not  of

my-self but Tunku Abdul Rahman and the others.  Though

that  might be appropriate in a book about Communists,

how  is  it  appropriate to have  photographs  of  the

P.A.P. inaugural meeting, the Prime Minister having  a

talk  with  his  private clients? Would  the  Minister

please indicate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, as regards the photograph of

the  P.A.P. after winning the elections, in  fact,  I

happened to look at the Annual Report which came after

the  Member  for Anson had become the Chief  Minister,

and  there is one there showing him having an informal

luncheon in one of the big hotels here, which I  think

is  appropriate  since he was then the Chief  Minister

and his Party had come to power, and it is part of the

history  of  the Island. So for the same `reason,  the

fact that these pictures relating to elections and  so

on  are included in the book is that they form part of

the  history  which  led to the events  and  conflicts

described in the book.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards "clients", Sir, I am not quite sure to

whom the Member for Anson is referring.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, at

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson must wait

until  he  is  called, to give the Chair a  chance  to

consider the answer. Now, Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

refer  to  the photograph opposite page 83  where  the

Prime  Minister is alleged to have gone  to  Perak  to

defend  members of a union at a trial in  Bagan  Serai

which  arose from a transport strike. Is this part  of

the  history  of  Singapore?  Are  we  going  to  have

memorabilia of Mr Lee Kuan Yew?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I have a feeling that the Member for

Anson  has  only been looking at the pictures  without

reading  the text of the book. If he had read  through

the text, he would have found



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



that  the  gentleman referred to is mentioned  in  the

text of the broadcast. And, therefore, it is necessary

in  a  book  of this kind not only to tell  about  the

<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SCHEME</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to

the  questions asked by the Member for Anson, I  spent

some   time  in  explaining  the  background  of   our

relations with the pro-Communist trade union  leaders.

Although we had discussions with them - we spent  a  lot

of  time  working out the details of this unemployment

insurance scheme - I harboured the doubt at that time, a

doubt  which subsequently turned out to be  completely

justified,  that  these persons were  not  honest  nor

sincere in their dealings with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went on to say that the main consideration of

Communist  leaders  in a trade union  movement  is  to

maintain  a  hold on the union leadership.  From  this

point  of  view, they will stop at nothing to  achieve

their  objective.  They  have  tried  to  hot  up  the

situation,   create  an  atmosphere  of  tension   and

uncertainty,  because  it  is  under  such  conditions

approaching  a revolutionary situation that  a  combat

Marxist-Leninist Party can deploy its  cadres  to  the

most effective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



purpose.  Therefore, in their policy  towards  unions,

the  benefits  that the workers would obtain  are,  of

course,   important.  These  are   important   matters

because,  without getting benefits, the  workers  will

soon drift away from them. But they will never try  to

seek a permanent settlement with the employers on  the

best  terms possible for the workers, because,  by  so

doing,  they  will  reduce discontent  among  workers,

cause  them to be satisfied, and in this manner become

complacent  and apathetic towards union matters.  Now,

Mr  Devan  Nair told me of the advice which  Mr  Lim

Ching Siong had given him when they were colleagues in

the  T.U.C. - that Mr Lim Ching Siong advised Mr Devan

Nair  against fighting for salary scales. He said that

with  salary  scales, workers would be satisfied  with

the  conditions, lose their revolutionary fervour  and

thereby  weaken  the hold of the union  upon  members.

Because  once you have a salary scale, everyone  would

know  that  an  increase in wages comes  automatically

year  by  year, and therefore there would be less  and

less occasion for the union to rally round its members

to  fight for improved conditions. Mr Lim recommended

that  it  was  better  to fight  for  periodic  salary

increases  and  prevent the members from  being  fully

satisfied at any time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with such a background of the policy and

tactics  of  the  trade  union leaders,  it  would  be

clearly    foolish   to   introduce   a   contributory

unemployment insurance in the teeth of opposition by a

substantial number of trade unionists. What we must do

now is to tell the workers how they are being used  by

their  leaders as so many pawns in the major political

game for the benefit of the Malayan Communist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When workers cease to be manipulated by the pro-Communist groups as they realise the truth, then and

only  then  can  we  proceed to introduce  progressive

social  security measures for their benefit. It  is  a

sorry  state  of  affairs in Singapore when  so-called

champions  of  workers resist the  introduction  of  a

progressive    measure   such   as   a    contributory

unemployment insurance scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary

wish to have a debate on the statement, I am sure  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SCHEME</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Debate on Ministerial Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker. Sir,

the question arose in all good faith as a result of  a

question I had asked, which was tabled and answered on

the  29th  November - 3½ months ago in this very  House.

The  question  then  was to the  Minister  for  Labour

asking whether the Government would consider tabling a

White  Paper on the Report of the Committee on Minimum

Standards of Livelihood (Cmd. Paper No. 5 of 1957) and

the  Report to the Government of Singapore  on  Social

Security  Measures (Cmd. Paper No. 56  of  1957),  and

whether  the  Minister for Labour would indicate  what

measures Government had in mind for the session in the

fields   of  social  security  and  Unemployment.   We

received a reply from the Parliamentary Secretary -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps I had better explain the

procedure because I see that the Minister for  Finance

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



making  notes.  He  will not have  an  opportunity  of

replying. Another Minister will have to do that. There

is  no  opportunity  to reply  in  a  motion  for  the

adjournment. I just want to make it quite clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The reply to this question was made by

the   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Labour. Sir, though we do not have the Hansard,  I  am

taking  the  liberty of quoting from  the  preliminary

draft   which  is  sent  to  Members  in   which   the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour  on

the 29th of November last said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The unions and employers will be asked for joint

discussions  and  the Government hopes  that  after  a

thorough  exchange of views, agreement can be  reached

on  unemployment insurance as the first step to a more

comprehensive social security scheme.'



<br><br>In answer to a further question, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as consultations between

union  leaders and the Government are concerned,  they

have   taken   place,  but  not  discussions   between

Government and the employers yet.'



<br><br>In  answer  to  a further supplementary  question,  he

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As I have said just now, Mr Speaker, Sir,

Government hopes, through discussions with the parties

concerned, i.e., employers and unions, that it will be

able  to  find  a  basis  of  introducing  the  social

security scheme.'



<br><br>And when I inquired when it was anticipated that these

discussions would be held, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Of course. Mr Speaker, Sir, as soon as the

Minister  feels  it is convenient to  look  into  this

matter.'



<br><br>So,  Mr  Speaker, it was not with a view to  inviting

any  controversy  but with a view to  eliciting  facts

which we were legitimately entitled and led to by  the

replies  from  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister for Labour. Now I gather - and I trust that  it

is not correct - that the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for Labour has led this House up the  garden

path  with completely false statements. I should  hate

to  think that was true, Mr Speaker, but in fact that

is  a necessary inference from the statements that you

heard from the Minister ;for Finance who told you that

through 1960 and January 1961, that is, up to 14



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



months ago, discussions had been held; but since  then

conscious  of the attitude of the dreadful  devils  in

the  trade union movement, Government intends to  take

no  further steps except in order to make it known  to

the  people.  The  plague carrying rat  was - since  the

Prime   Minister   seeks  to  remind   me - specifically

directed to a gentleman by the name of Mr Devan  Nair

who  then assisted the Prime Minister who led  a  most

vicious campaign of an extraordinary character, as  it

was  unconstitutional in fact.  That  was  the  plague

carrying rat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if we may go back to a very serious matter, Sir,

the social security for [Interruption] - must the Prime

Minister press me to be discourteous directly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if we may go back. We are dealing with a

vast  number  of  our people, Sir, possibly  a  larger

number - and we are entitled to have at least the facts.

If  the  Government did in truth take a decision  last

year, that we are not going to pursue this matter  any

more,   then  how,  Sir,  I  ask,  is  it  that   they

authorised - because  I  am  quite  sure,  knowing   the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Labour,

that he would not take it upon himself to make a false

statement.  He  is incapable of evolving  one  of  his

character.  How  did they authorise the  Parliamentary

Secretary to make an extraordinary statement  to  this

House  that discussions would be held with the parties

concerned,  i.e, employers and unions, and  Government

hoped  that  it  would be able  to  find  a  basis  of

introducing  a  social security scheme?  There  is  an

expression of a firm intention and an expression of  a

legitimate hope, and that it would take place as  soon

as the Minister finds this convenient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am interested in the facts. I do want to know

from  the Minister whether, in fact, he now repudiates

the  statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister  for Labour; whether he  repudiates  the

information that Government has any hope of  achieving

social  security measures; whether he  repudiates  the

suggestion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



that  there will be discussions between the Government

and  employers, and whether we are in fact to give  up

all  hope  that there will be social security measures

so  long  as this Government is in office, because  as

far  as  I  can gather, he says that when  we  are  in

heaven,  we can all have manna. Well, thank  you  very

much.  But what about now? Are we to give up all  hope

now? Sir, it is not for me to defend those who were in

part  responsible  for  some  of  the  most  agonising

moments  during the time when I was sitting  opposite.

But  I would like to say this. Though I recognise that

there  are  in truth and in fact persons in the  trade

union  movement who are prepared to take advantage  of

the workers for political purposes -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> The Communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have never had proof, Sir. If I did,

I  give  you my word that I would have put  them  into

Changi  Gaol  without  hesitation.  But  I  never  had

adequate proof from those on whom I had to depend  and

that  was my Chief Secretary who was in charge of  the

Police  and who received the reports. I had  no  proof

that Lim Ching Siong was a Communist at any time,  and

I  made direct inquiries. So if the interruptions  can

now be left aside. Let us go back to the main issue. I

consider  it cynical and pathetic on the part  of  the

Government to make the suggestion that there are trade

unionists who do not seek the welfare of the  workers.

That  I  do not believe. That they may seek the  wrong

methods,  Sir, I do believe. That there are  some  who

seek  the  wrong methods, it is perfectly  true.  That

there  are  some who seek to take advantage and  bring

about momentary chaos, it is perfectly true. But  that

there is any trade union at all amongst the leaders of

the trade union movement, whether of individual unions

or  the  movement  as a whole, who  do  not  seek  the

general welfare of the people is rubbish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> They captured your Party!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is rubbish. They have captured my

Party, but nobody can capture me!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> They captured your Party in K.L.!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> In K.L.!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I do hope that this frivolity,

which  seems  a  disease which follows the  Government

everytime it is in a position of acute embarrassment..

will  at  least pass in order to let us  discuss  with

gravity  a very grave issue. And that is the issue  of

social  security for our people. If in  truth  and  in

fact  there is a plan whereby we can be of assistance,

and  the  Government  has  a  plan  and  there  is  no

administrative  difficulty,  then   I   do   ask   the

Government - why do they not present it to the  Assembly

and  let us see for ourselves, instead of having vague

allegations from the Government Benches about the evil

fork-tailed  gentlemen who sit opposite?  Let  us  see

them  proved  that they are fork-tailed  gentlemen  by

rejecting  the provisions of measures and' laws  which

are  for the welfare of our people. It does matter  to

me whether, in fact, the social security measures the

Government  has in mind would be adequate.  I  say  we

must  take  a step forward now. I do plead  that  this

issue  be  treated with gravity, that the  internecine

warfare  between the husband' and the  wife  who  have

recently divorced does not obscure the welfare of  our

people, and that this issue be treated, on its merits.

And if there are measures which can be implemented now

for the welfare of the helpless unemployed, then those

measures  should be introduced and the Opposition  and

the  people  of  Singapore be given an opportunity  to

indicate  whether,  in  fact, they  will  support  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just

want  briefly to deal with one or two points that  the

Minister  for Finance has dealt with in his statement.

First of all, lest there should be misunderstanding, I

wish to make it clear that, as far as I myself and  my

colleagues in the trade union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



movement  are concerned, we will not only  support  in

principle any social security scheme -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Contributory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But also in practice. As to the merits or

demerits  of  the  proposal made by the  Minister  for

Finance  during the discussions that were  held  early

last year, I shall deal with them in due course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> When? After you have consulted

the Boss?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, first of all, it is necessary to

understand   what   was   the  background   when   the

discussions  on  the so-called social security  scheme

were conducted. Sir,I am sure that it is vivid in all

our memory that sometime at the beginning of 1961, the

Minister  for Finance sent a memorandum  to  the  then

T.U.C. entitled, I believe,"Industrialisation". This

memorandum was considered by the T.U.C. and the  reply

to  it was also published in the local papers. It  was

in  the  process of a sub-committee meeting which  was

subsequently  set up to consider these  two  memoranda

that  the  question  of a social security  scheme  was

first  raised by the Government. Sir, the  members  of

this  Committee,  besides the four  of  us  named  who

represented  the trade unions, were the  Minister  for

Finance  on  the  Government side,  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Finance and  Mr  James

Puthucheary,   the  ther  Manager  of  the   Singapore

Industrial Promotion Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Now adviser to the Barisan

Sosialis!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the discussions were started

primarily to agree on a stable sector, i.e., a  sector

where  long-term collective agreements could be  drawn

up  and where the Government thought industrial  peace

must prevail. To make this proposition attractive, the

Minister proposed a social security scheme. The  basic

quality  of this social security scheme' was  that  it

should  be confined only to this sector. This  sector,

the  so-called stable sector, referred to all pioneer.

industries and certain other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



industries which had limited export markets.  Sir,  we

who were in the Committee were representing the T.U.C.

of  which  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Culture was Secretary-General and Mr Devan Nair,

Mr  Ow  Kheng  Tor  and the Member for  Kallang  were

Secretaries. Here, I would like to make it clear  that

if  the four of us expressed our dissatisfaction  with

the details of the social security scheme proposed  by

the  Minister,  it was not because the Communists  did

not  like  the social security scheme, but because  it

was  the  decision of the T.U.C. in which, as  I  have

said, there were notorious P.A.P. henchmen, like  some

I  have mentioned. As I have said, Sir, it was in this

context  that the social security scheme was proposed.

Our  attitude  was that we supported  this  scheme  in

principle.  We  supported the need to  have  a  social

security scheme. In the first place, we said  it  must

be  an  extensive scheme so that all  sectors  of  our

economy  were covered. Secondly, we said that  in  our

view, the workers were overburdened with contributions

to  the  C.P.F. and other local provident fund schemes

which various employers were having. Therefore, if the

workers were expected to contribute, then it would not

be   acceptable  to  the  unions.  We  suggested  that

contributions to this scheme be made by employers  and

the  Government. Sir, unfortunately, I do not have  at

the  moment the records of these meetings.  I  do  not

have the papers with me, but I am sure if the Minister

for  Finance would like to be fair he would agree that

towards the end -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, on a point of elucidation

before the Member sits down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Could he just tell us at what

particular meeting, because there were records kept of

every meeting which took place, at which he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



made  the  suggestion  that  the  Government  and  the

employers  should  contribute and the  workers  should

not. Could he indicate which meeting?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I cannot remember offhand on what date and

at what time the suggestion was made, but -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> You never did.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - as I have said, the Committee was composed

of seven people and I am quite certain I could get six

people  to  swear on oath and say that  this  was  the

case.  The  Minister for Finance knows full well  that

this  .was one of our primary objections to the scheme

that   he  had  in  mind.  I  am  sure  that  if   the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture

refers to the minutes of the T.U.C., then he ought  to

get  sufficient evidence to give to the  Minister  and

the Prime Minister for checking the statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance was trying to give the

impression   that   there  was   the   Government - all

reasonable and nice and on the side of the workers - who

wanted to introduce a good scheme for the workers  and

that  we opposed it. This, in fact, is inaccurate.  At

the  moment, whether or not it is possible to  discuss

with  the  unions a social security scheme depends  on

the  attitude  of  the Government to the  unions.  The

discussions  of this Committee were held,  I  believe,

sometime  in  January 1961. As we know, a  few  months

after  January 1961, the T.U.C. was dissolved. I think

it  is  wrong  for the Minister to suggest  that  this

Committee  met  and  agreed  to  support  the   social

security  scheme in principle and that he  had  waited

long, because the T.U.C. was not given the opportunity

to sort out things and carry out the work for which it

was  reconstituted in early 1960. Sir, at the  moment,

whether  it  is  possible  or  not  depends   on   the

Government.  We have all the time maintained  that  in

order  to  have a stable sector to work out  long-term

agreements  and  to  have, in the first  place  proper

consultations with The Government, it was necessary to

have an effective central



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



organisation, if  a  central  organisation  does  not

exist, or if a central organisation which is effective

and  has enjoyed the confidence of the majority of the

unions does not exist, it is not the fault of those of

us  in  the Barisan Sosialis and it will be wrong  for

the  Government  to  say that the  decisions  of  this

Committee  were not carried out. As I have  said,  the

T.U.C., the then central organisation was not given  a

chance to iron out its problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to say that to have industrial peace and

stability,  the cooperation of the employers  and  the

unions  and a Government that is neutral in industrial

relations is needed. If the government of the  day  is

biased against the majority of the unions which do not

toe  the  P.A.P. line  and  wants  to  seek  to  make

political capital out of every trade dispute, I do not

see how industrial stability can he brought about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those of us in the Barisan Sosialis who were

members of the T.U.C. which has been dissolved made it

very  clear  that  if  they  wanted  the  Government's

industrialisation programme to succeed, then they must

necessarily  strengthen  the  hands  of  the   central

organisation by providing for the unification  of  the

trade union movement. We all know what has happened to

the  Trade  Unions  Bill that was  introduced  by  the

Government,  the Bill that was supposed to  have  laid

the   basis  for  reunification  of  the  trade  union

movement. Sir, if today the Government accuses  us  of

not  wanting industrial stability, then I  say  it  is

completely  absurd.  In the first  place,  the  T.U.C.

that  was  reconstituted was not allowed to function.

In  the second place, the Trade Unions Bill, which was

supposed  to have laid the basis for the strengthening

of  the  trade  union movement, was  not  allowed  to

become law. Thirdly, Sir, the application made by  the

new   central   organisation  formed  has   not   been

considered, although, I believe, more than six  months

have  passed.  I tell the Government frankly  that  if

they  want  industrial peace and stability,  let  them

not,  sit  inside  this House and cry "Communism!"  If

they want industrial peace And stability, let them, in

the  first  place, stop playing politics in industrial

disputes,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



and,  secondly,  let  them  be  democratic  enough  to

register  the  S.A.T.U, and let  there  be  facilities

provided -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> For all Communist-organised

movements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - to effect the unification of the trade

union movement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Is that all?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It was indeed a very, shocking

revelation  on  the part of the Minister  for  Finance

when  he said in this House just now that although  he

held  discussions with representatives  of  the  trade

unions  who  at that time were members of  his  Party,

some  of  whom at that time were Political Secretaries

drawing  wages  out of public funds, he harboured  the

doubt  that these persons were not earnest and sincere

in  their .dealings with the Government. Yet when  the

Opposition on every previous Budget Day, had  occasion

to  criticise  and  challenge the Government  for  the

misuse of public funds in giving appointments to their

political  comrades as Political Secretaries - in  fact,

the  person  named by him, Lim Ching  Siong,  was  the

Political  Secretary to him - he stood up in this  House

and  defended  him and said that he was  a  very  good

young  man.  Today, from his very lips,  although  we

have  been  hearing that from the 12 "confessions"  of

the  Prime Minister during the trouble they had at the

time  of  the  split in the P.A.P., he  said  that  he

harboured  the doubt that they were not sincere,  that

they  were  not honest. Then why, keep on paying  that

particular man about whom he harboured doubts,  $1,100

a  month  out of public funds just for the  P.A.P. to

play  party politics? Here again, Sir, the  P.A.P. in

trying  to  play  party politics  thought  they  could

capture  the T.U.C. The matter of the T.U.C.  has  been

brought  up by the Member for Thomson. He repeated  it

many  a time. He said the T.U.C. was disso1ved. If  it

were  dissolved,  how could it be in existence  today?

The  Parliamentary Secretary has said the T.U.C. is

still a registered trade union. Where is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



dissolution?  The secret is not far to  seek.  It  was

because  the  P.A.P. when it came to  power  tried  to

corner  the  trade  union  movement  and  change   the

constitution of the T.U.C. to such an extent that  its

Secretary-General can remain in power for  five  years

and  he has the power to appoint stooges of his Party.

But now -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Cairnhill

is  now embarking on quite a different debate. We  are

now  on the topic which was raised by Question No.  4,

and that is the unemployment insurance scheme.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, four of the

Assistant  Secretaries  appointed  by  the  Secretary-General  of the T.U.C. have been named by the Minister

for  Finance  in  his charges. He said  that  whatever

plans the Government proposed for social security were

damaged by these four persons. So what I am trying  to

point  out is that - these four persons, plus  another

six,  were the accredited agents of the P.A.P. at that

time.  It was because there was a split in the  P.A.P.

that  they  said  the T.U.C. should be dissolved.  The

Minister  for Labour and Law said that the  amendments

to  the  Constitution of the T.U.C. could  never  have

been  registered.  So  it meant that  since  1960  the

T.U.C. had   been  functioning  under   an   amended

constitution which had never been registered. That  is

the  P.A.P. type of government. Just because it  is  a

P.A.P. organisation, go ahead, never mind  about  the

law.  That is not the way to instil confidence in  the

Government  or in the Party. Now, four  of  them  have

been named to be the people who were not sincere,  who

were not earnest, who had no desire whatsoever to work

for  industrial peace with justice. But  hon.  Members

will remember that at that particular time - I mean  in

January  1960 - it  was,  if  I  remember  rightly,  the

Minister for Finance who, in order to regain  some  of

the  lost prestige of the P.A.P., introduced  a  Four-Year Development Plan and then not -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated that we must

try  and keep to the topic which we are discussing.  I

think the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



Member  has  made his point. Let us come back  to  the

unemployment insurance scheme.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I brought this

Four-Year  Development Plan in because the Member  for

Thomson  said it was as a result of the discussion  on

the  Four-Year Development Plan that this  matter  was

mooted with the four trade unionists. Anyway, he  that

as it may, we want to say to the Government that if it

sincerely believes that a social security scheme is in

the  best interests of the workers of Singapore,  then

introduce  it.  We  are for it. Do  not  try  to  make

excuses  and  try  to blame Party  comrades  who  have

defected.  The  Minister for Finance has  always  said

that he has sonic sort of a scheme. I would ask him to

make known his scheme in this Assembly and have a full

debate.  I  would  like to say that a social  security

scheme  cannot  be  non-contributory.  It  has  to  he

contributory.  When  the Central  Provident  Fund  was

introduced  by  the previous Government,  the  workers

were  up  in arms because it was contributory but  the

workers  are people who can listen to explanation.  It

was  explained to them that the Central Provident Fund

was  meant  for their good and then they accepted  the

part  they had to play in contributing 5 per  cent  of

their  wages.  In the same way, if it  could  be  made

known to the workers that a social security scheme  is

in  their best interest and that, in order to run  it,

it  has  to be contributed to by the workers  and  the

employers and subsidised by the Government, I  do  not

think  the  workers  will  object.  I  would  ask  the

Government  not to delay any more. Bring a  scheme  to

this  House  and  the Opposition will  give  it  their

fullest support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, we have heard three

speeches  from  the  Opposition, and  if  everyone  is

looking  for  proof that parliamentary  democracy  can

lead to utter confusion, we have just had it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson leads his from time to time

allies  in  the Barisan Sosialis into an  embarrassing

position.  He has just led them into on;  by  starting

this debate which has made it necessary for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



the  Member  for  Thomson to try  and  soft-pedal  and

explain away a few foolish things for which they  were

responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me put the picture in perspective. Nobody

in  his right mind is in the least bit concerned  with

social  insurance in the immediate present. It is  not

included in any resolution passed by any union. It  is

not  on  the platform of any political Party  at  this

particular juncture. Nobody is shouting these slogans.

The  Member for Anson is out of tune. He ought to read

the  resolutions-passed by the Barisan Sosialis  at  a

meeting  of the S.G.E.U. and at other meetings,  "Down

with  phoney  merger!  Down with Malaysia!"  That  not

being  successful, they go to Toa Payoh and say, "Down

with  the  wicked  landlord, namely  the  Housing  and

Development Board!" They want big emotional cries that

will  get the people up in a bloody frame of  mind  to

man   the   barricades.  Not  all  this  soft   social

democratic  talk of security and comfort in  old  age.

sickness and unemployment. The Member for Anson is out

of line, out of tune.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill often plays various roles

at  various  times. But I think the  role  he  is  now

playing as: the occasional jester in this Assembly  is

one which could amuse sometimes. It could be boring at

other times. In this particular instance, I would  say

he is just being mischievous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Member for Anson asked a question with a

laugh,  all this business of being sincere and  honest

in  wanting  to get information. He wants  to  be  the

champion  of the workers. He wants to be the chap  who

gets  them  benefits. It is a pity  he  never  pressed

harder  for  equal  rights for women.  He  would  have

claimed  the benefit for what the Minister for Finance

has  been  castigated for having done.  But  since  he

cannot claim it, he arrogated the credit to the Member

for Mountbatten. He thinks that social insurance is  a

good  issue - something for nothing, all got for by  the

Member for Anson. He gave the Minister for Finance the

opportunity   to  put  in  perspective   the   picture

regarding  social insurance. If it must be  unpleasant

to the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



Thomson  to hear his recital of foolishness,  then  it

cannot be helped. What the Member for Thomson and  his

colleagues are interested in is the line about  merger

and  anti-merger, Malaysia and anti-Malaysia, not  all

this frivolous and less important issue such as social

security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, first, let me dispose of the facts. I am

indebted  to the Member for Anson because I  think  it

might  be  useful  to clear the air. He  elicited  for

honest  information  and he is  going  to  get  it  as

honestly  as  we  can  give it to  him.  There  is  no

contradiction between what the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Labour said and what the Minister

for  Finance  said.  What the Parliamentary  Secretary

said is a projection into the future in expectation of

what his Minister is going to do at the right time, in

the  right  place  and under the right  circumstances.

What  the Minister for Finance undertook on behalf  of

the Minister for Labour to explain today is why up  to

now   our  efforts  to  have  a  comprehensive  social

insurance scheme have failed. It is as simple as that.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The assurance was given 3½ months ago.

I would like to ask The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew): was any effort

made  during  these  3½ months to  hold  the  proposed

talks?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I do not know if the Member for

Anson  is  as  naive as he makes out to be  in  asking

these  questions. Perhaps he is, and on that basis,  I

will  give  him the answer. Does anybody in his  right

mind  believe at this moment that there  is  any  more

fundamental  issue to be settled than the survival  of

the whole of Malaya arising out of merger?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The survival of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> The P.A.P, can come and go, and

Ministers  can  come and go. But the reunification  of

these  two  territories to form a  stable  and  viable

State  is  an  absolute must. Out of  that  will  stem

stability. Out of that will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



stem economic girth and width. Out of that will stem

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I will give him an opportunity

but  let me first answer the Member for Anson's point.

First,  we settle the political situation and then  we

settle  all  the other things. The Member for  Thomson

understands  that. All these discussions and  all  the

effort   made   do   bring  about  stable   industrial

conditions  with  justice to the workers.  It  is  not

going to be abandoned. Solid work has been put into it

by officials, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.

The  then Chairman of the Central Provident Fund,  Mr

James  Puthucheary, who is, in his lucid  moments,  an

extremely  intelligent  and an  able  exponent  of  in

dustrial  peace, stability and expansion,  worked  out

together    with    the   Minister   a   comprehensive

contributory insurance scheme which was discussed  and

which he tried very hard to get accepted. But Mr  Lim

Ching Siong - and his other supporters who really do not

matter;   they   are  there  because  it   helps   the

facade - represents the militant Communist group. If  he

says  yes,  it is yes; if he says no, it  is  no.  The

Member  for Thomson knows that. Let us cut  away  this

pretence.  Is  he really going to say to the  workers,

"Chin  ai kok wei."? He does not know what to  say  to

them.  Who makes this appeal? Who is in a position  to

pull the heart strings and say, "Boys, let us gird and

rush."  Not  Mr  Sandra  Woodhull, the  Member   for

Thomson -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Mr Devan. Nair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Devan Nair at least does not

depend on the strength of others. He believes in what

he believes in and he fights with his own strength and

he is prepared to die for his beliefs.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Let me finish. E will give the

Member for Anson ample opportunity. I want to meet his

point. First, we dispose of this mockery about social

security. He was not here when I mentioned it. We are

not interested in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



it.  The  Barisan Sosialis are not interested  in  it.

There  are many other more urgent problems - merger  and

Malaysia. That will put them in a real big -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Fix.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I do not know whether one calls

it  a  fix.  But  anything that brings about  national

unity and solidarity and dilutes their strength  in  a

larger whole is a setback for them, and this is  going

to  be a setback of large dimensions for a long,  long

while.  We  settle  the basic and fundamental  issues.

Having  settled the basic and fundamental  conditions,

we  will  proceed with social insurance and a  lot  of

other  things  which  will  ensure  that,  within  the

democratic  processes, we can allow a  great  deal  of

ballyhoo  by  members  of the  trade  union  movement,

because sufficient balance and sufficient raps are  on

to prevent the economy from being thrown out of gear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr James Puthucheary worked this out with the

Minister  for  Finance - and I am now reading  from  the

minutes of a meeting held on 30th December at 11  a.m.

in the Conference Room of the Minister for Finance:



<pre>



          `Present

  The Minister for Finance.

  The Manager, Industrial Promotion Board.

  The Chairman of the C.P.F. (Mr J. J.

    Puthucheary).

  Mr Lim Ching Siong.

  Mr Woodhull.

  Mr Dominic Puthucheary.

  Mr S. T. Bani'.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> 1960. This constituted part of a

series  of meetings in which we were either  going  to

have  firm  and  categorical lines set  on  industrial

peace  and stability or the parting of the ways.  They

knew  it. That is why they kept minutes. That  is  why

every  word in the minutes was challenged before being

agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You did not bother to correct them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Yes, corrected often. They know

that these minutes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



would  be agreed and could be quoted, and I now  quote

from paragraph 7:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At that time, one of the key problems for

industrial  peace and stability was the  question  of

redundancy which led to unemployment and which  often

became  the source of strikes. Therefore, a  solution

must  he  found to resolve redundancy in  a  peaceful

way, satisfactory both to workers and employers.'.



<br><br>Now  on redundancy, Mr Woodhull pointed out - from that

minutes now - that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Unions accepted retrenchment if the employers

could  prove that such a situation existed. Agreement

procedure  proposed  by  the Singapore  Trades  Union

Congress  would serve as a framework for negotiations

when redundancy materialises. The fear of unions  was

that  employers would use redundancy us a  cover  for

dismissing  workers and subsequently  taking  on  new

hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that in the view of Dr Winsemius, the employer must have the right to hire and fire if maximum efficiency in industry is to be achieved. Dr Winsemius even rejected the principle of first in last out as it was not conducive to efficient production. Mr Woodhull pointed out that if it was genuinely agreed that the quality of labour in Singapore was high so that the dismissals on the

grounds  of inefficiency might not be justified,  the

Minister replied that the point made by Dr Winsemius

was  that any means which led to increased output and

efficiency   should  he  accepted  and   adopted   if

Singapore  products were to he sold competitively  on

the world market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redundancy led to strikes because unemployment was

the  fear. Therefore, unions that dug their  toes  in

had   to  fight.  Therefore,  unemployment  insurance

[which is the heading of the next paragraph] was  the

cornerstone to the then issue of industrial peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister reiterated his belief that until industrial expansion took place, Unemployment insurance had to he introduced to reduce the fear of retrenchment arising out of redundancy. The Manager of the Industrial Promotion Board further pointed out that no trade union had sufficient expertise to give technical opinion on redundancy, even if unions agreed in principle that retrenchment should take

place  when redundancy was proved, as stated  by  Mr

Woodhull.  It was agreed that the Manager. Industrial

Promotion Board, should convene a meeting between the

Singapore   Manufacturers'   Association   and    the

Employers'  Association and the Singapore  T.U.C. to

discuss redundancy in industries.'.



<br><br>And then the Minutes go on to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Though the Trades Union Congress

representatives' -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



really  it  was Mr Lim Ching Siong, because  from  my

report of what took place, he set the pace. He is  the

open  front  leader.  He decides  the  line,  and  the

argument,  of  course, can be put by  the  Member  for

Thomson.  The Member for Thomson is not in a  position

to  take  a firm line. But a line has to be taken.  He

welcomes all this on principle. But who sets the  line

on any issue at any particular moment? The Member will

recall what Mr Lim himself told me once upon a  time,

"Better  settle  with Lim, you know, to  see  what  he

says." That is an honest to God's position, is it not?

He is the open oracle of the open front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Though the Trades Union Congress representatives

supported  unemployment insurance in  principle,  they

pointed  out  that workers would oppose  it  basically

because  of  its contributory nature. Therefore,  they

had  suggested  in  the  memoranda  that  unemployment

insurance   he   treated  separately  from   long-term

agreements.'.



<br><br>They were not prepared to discuss it. That is what  it

came to - to be treated separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister said that he was anxious that a start

he made with unemployment insurance which would be the

first  benefit  to  a wider social  insurance  scheme.

Sickness  benefits  would follow  next.  The  Manager.

Industrial  Promotion Board, stated  that  if  unions'

views  were agreed to by the previous Government,  the

Central   Provident  Fund  would   never   have   been

started.'.



<br><br>That is a fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, it is pointed out that unemployment

insurance should not be imposed on workers.'.



<br><br>That is the important thing. The Member for Anson  has

indeed this desire to play the united front line  with

the   Barisan.  "I  do  not  know  whether  they   are

Communists.  Please  let me have proof."  Well,  I  am

going  to  read  what  he  said  about  them - the  same

persons.  You know, they are friends, good and  honest

men;  their  methods are bad but their intentions  are

good.  I thought he said exactly all the opposite  and

contrary  things  when I was sitting  over  there  and

listening  to him, and he was delivering to  me  pious

homilies on how to be a good democrat. Perhaps one  of

the  reasons why I am still a democrat may be  because

of  the exhortations that I have received from time to

time from him,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



amongst  others.  They pointed out  that  unemployment

insurance  should not be imposed upon  workers.  There

the  matter  rested. We can impose  it.  But  to  what

purpose?  To  strikes, to agitation?  Conditions  will

alter;  everybody knows that. Events have been set  in

motion.  Since  the fateful meeting on July  the  20th

last year, when the line `was drawn between those  who

were  prepared to dig their toes in and  stand  up  to

what  they  believed to be right and  those  who  were

masquerading or just did not have the guts. A chain of

events  have been set in motion that must  find  their

logical   and  inevitable  conclusion,   and   a   new

equilibrium  will be established. We are now  in  this

period of flux. Hence there is no need to get agitated

about  S.A.T.U. or the National Trade Union  Congress.

These  are matters of relative unimportance, not  that

they  are  unimportant but are relatively unimportant.

There  are  bigger  issues that  the  Communist  front

organisations  are  more concerned  with.  Any  -brief

scanning of their mass of resolutions which they  pass

from  time  to time is really a simple way of  saying,

"Look, let's get excited about these things." This is

one  of  the first things. The Member for Anson should

learn.  He should pick up the Chinese newspapers,  If

he  cannot  read them, he can pick up the Ministry  of

Culture's day-by-day Press Digests, which are supplied

free  of  charge  to  all Assemblymen,  and  scan  the

resolutions.  There  he will find  out  what  are  the

things  that really agitate them. And this is not  One

of them. They do not want social insurance. We are now

invited  by  the Member for Cairnhill,  willfully  and

mischievously, to push it through so that  there  will

be  strife  and  trouble. The  Member  for  Anson,  of

course,  just  does not understand these  things.  He

does  not  understand the mechanics of  the  thinking,

either  the legal or the emotional mechanics,  on  the

ground. He just thinks it is a wonderful thing to pose

on  behalf  of the workers and say. "I ask for  social

insurance  benefits.  I  ask for  dissolution  of  the

British  bases,  and disbandment of the  bomb,"  quite

forgetting   that  40,000  workers  may  suddenly   be

unemployed and may clamour for his blood. Even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Sandra  Woodhull goes slow on  bases.  These  are

things  that require a certain amount of contemplation

and  the  weighing of the pros and the cons.  And  the

line  on  bases  is "go slow". They are  not  worried

about bases.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I do not follow their line.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> That is the tragedy. That is why

I  only say, from lime to time they get him to follow-travel  with,  because there must be a consistency  of

intention  and purpose. Erratic fellow-travellers  can

be a source of great embarrassment, and even danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now tell the Member for Thomson that the

Government is not worried about unions toeing - or  not

toeing the P.A.P. line. What the Government is worried

about   is   that  unions  should  be  subverted   and

manipulated  by  a  few  individuals.  He  knows   the

mechanics, and so do I. Let us be frank. When  it  was

against  a  lot  of  inept, lazy types  that  used  to

associate with the Member for Cairnhill, it was  easy.

We - I mean he and I - knocked out Mr Seah Peng Chuan and

all  his  other  underlings in  the  S.T.C.  Employees

Union.  That is that, 100 per cent. Men got  benefits;

men  solidly  on the side of the P.A.P.  But  when  he

tried the same tactics, this time not against lazy and

corrupt  Seah  Peng Chuan but honest men like  Mahmood

bin Awang, who went to prison -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He was a Communist, you know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> No, he was never a Communist.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> He lost in Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> You are wrong. He never was a

Communist. I represented him.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Sometimes I do like the Speaker

being  ignored, but the Prime Minister should  address

the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> The Member for Thomson is wrong.

His recollection is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



defective  on the point. Mahmood bin Awang never  was,

and  still is not. He is a good Muslim amongst others.

Mr  Devan Nair was. He now is not. He is prepared  to

fight   for   his  beliefs,  because  he  thinks   the

Communists are wrong. When he had to meet a  different

situation,  lie  found  himself  far  from   able   to

manipulate  the workers. He was out of  the  Singapore

Traction Company Employees Union. It is not so simple,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  to go around and  just  tell  the

workers,  "The  P.A.P. is anti the workers."  It  just

does not sell. It is as foolish as those slogans which

we  allow even today on the lamp-posts - Siau mieh  hwa

wen   chiao   yu   (P.A.P. out  to  destroy   Chinese

culture) - if you do not mind. Stick it up. Who believes

it? The ground is cold. They went to Toa Payoh, and an

American  T.V. - was it American T.V.? - went  down.  Here

were  the great revolutionary leaders. They were going

to  decapitate the heads of the wicked landlords,  the

Housing  and  Development Board,  for  exploiting  the

farmers. What did they get? A cold reception,  was  it

not? 150 local residents and all the others brought in

from  outside - a sum total of 500 or 600. In the really

united  front  days  of 1955-56,  they  were  fighting

really  stupid opponents - colonial Governors,  two  ex-Chief  Ministers. We never called a meeting on  issues

like  dispossession  of farmers  and  squatters.  Just

minor issues, you know, like women -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Could I just bring the Prime

Minister back to the topic-unemployment insurance?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He loves his voice,



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I had no intention of

speaking,  but by your ruling in making it  impossible

for  the Minister for Finance to reply, the burden has

been cast upon me. But let me explain to them - the real

united  front  action, anywhere  you  went,  5,000  to

10,000 to 15,000 turned up. Real excitement, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In Anson?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> This is just once.

[Interruption] No, we are talking of united -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There seems to be a very nice

conversation  going  on between the  Government  Front

Bench  and  the Opposition Benches there. Perhaps  the

Prime  Minister could try and come back to the subject

of unemployment insurance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The point I want to make quite

simply  is  this, Mr Speaker, Sir. The  mechanics  of

government mean, do not throw into your enemy's  hands

long  big sticks to beat you with. And to push through

a  comprehensive contributory social insurance  scheme

would  be  to  give a big stick to your enemy.  First,

establish  the conditions - and they will be established

in the not too distant future. Members on the opposite

side know that. There are no pretences when we meet in

the  C.P.A. Room. We always commiserate with them  for

their   misfortunes.  They  find  our  sympathies   so

touching  that they have betaken themselves away  from

the  C.P.A.  Room. And we are not going to  make  that

mistake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me remind the Member for Anson of the real

issues.  What  he said first was about plague-carrying

rats.  He has a facile memory when he said it was  Mr

Devan  Nair  who,  of course, had  the  misfortune  of

having to deliver a report to the P.A.P. conference of

what  happened in Kuala Lumpur and therefore  incurred

the displeasure of the Member for Anson. But Mr Devan

Nair  is an honest man and he has got to say that  the

Member for Anson -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is not true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> - did not have the guts to stand

up  for  what he believed in, like freedom of  speech,

support  of  the P.A.P, right to put  in  a  paper  on

Malaysia. The Pilot Committee kept quiet in  the  open

session  when  the  paper was ruled out.  He  absented

himself  when  his Party voted against Malaysia,  when

the President voted for Malaysia. We do not mind that,

Mr Speaker, Sir. We have no desire to -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> These are misinterpretations - a point

of  order, is it not? If so, I would like to  rise  on

one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister has sat down on, a

point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Elucidation - I am much obliged, Sir.

First  and  foremost, it is not true that I  ran  away

from  Kuala  Lumpur.  I  had a case  in  Brunei,  Sir.

Secondly, he himself is aware that when I referred  to

plague-carrying rats, he was in this Assembly and  Mr

Devan Nair was up there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> So was Mr Lim Ching Siong.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And Mr Lim Ching Siong, who was

included. The Prime Minister himself was the leader of

that  plague-carrying campaign. But, Sir, can we  come

back  to the issue? Are we to understand that when  3½

months ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Labour told this House that unions and  employers

would  be  asked for joint discussions, and Government

hoped   that  after  a  thorough  exchange  of   views

agreement  could be reached on unemployment  insurance

as  a first step to more comprehensive social security

schemes,  he  was actually misleading this  House  and

there  was  no  intention whatsoever of holding  these

discussions  in  the near future, and  they  may  take

place,  if  at  all, in the never,  never  land  after

merger? Is that the position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I thought there was going to be

a momentous clarification. But I am sorry that we have

now come back to the same thing about the Government's

intention. We have every intention at the right  time,

in  the right place and in the right circumstances  to

do  it, and it will be done. A lot of effort has  gone

into this, and the Minister for Finance, who has spent

a  lot of time on it, has every intention to take  the

credit  of  getting through this House a comprehensive

Bill for social insurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> When?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

explained the moment - and that is when the situation in

the  unions has been clarified and settled,  and  that

will  be  in due course. I have no doubts about  that.

Neither  has  the Member for Thomson any doubts  about

it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, if I may have the temerity to remind the

Member for Anson of what he said. I have the privilege

often of having heard him say these things and so from

time  to  time  I am reminded when he speaks  in  this

House  of  the  cynicism  to which  sometimes  we  are

involuntarily reduced. I mean if he finds us in  mirth

and  merriment it is because otherwise we would be  in

tears, tears at the utter faithlessness of man to  his

basic beliefs and convictions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> How about your own

speeches?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Yes, I stand by them, every one

of  them.  I  ask for them to be quoted. Mr  Speaker,

whatever  my  many shortcomings, I never inflict  this

House with mc quoting myself. I never like to do that.

It  is  unpleasant. It is a matter open for the Member

for  Nee  Soon.  Part of his political  education,  he

said, was the reading of my speeches, and I am glad if

he finds them of any benefit in the instruction of his

political  beliefs. He can quote  them.  But  I  would

rather  not  inflict Members of this  House  with  the

virtues  or defects of what I have said in  the  past.

But  this is what the Member for Anson said.  You  can

well  remember,  Mr Speaker, Sir. This  is  from  the

Hansard  of the First Session, Vol. 1, No.  16,  dated

12th October, 1955, col. 835. There is the Member  for

Anson as he then was, the Chief Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The only danger to trade unionism' -



<br><br>and  I can remember those words reverberating in  this

Chamber,  because whatever his weaknesses, a  resonant

voice is not one of them -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`comes from the dishonest professional agitators Who

have never been labourers in their lives,' -



<br><br>The Member for Anson had been in the coal mines or

salt mines of Japan. He got four medals for it, as the

Minister for Finance had said -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`but take paid posts as agitators in P.A.P, trade

unions. As for murdering trade unionists, Sir, I  will

just  draw your attention to it to indicate the extent

to which these plague-carrying rats' -



<br><br>That  is plural, Sir. And then the gallery I remember,

seven years ago -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Devan Nair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Not Mr Devan Nair. The bossman

is the Chinese, not the Indian trade unionist. Let us

be frank and honest. Mr Lim Ching Siong, Mr Fong

Swee Suan. Mr Devan Nair was the intellectual -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, there are a few more, after

which I shall be happy to leave the Floor to the

Member for Anson because he has a lot to clarify.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is only a question of whether

the Prime Minister will give way or not. If the Prime

Minister does not give way, then the Member for Anson

must sit down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I have every intention to give

way, Sir, but first I want to read out two passages

because he will have to clarify both of them at the

same time. They need some clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I rise on a point of order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Prime Minister informed this House

that  Mr Lim Ching Siong was in the gallery. Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong was holding his hand by his side  on  the

Front  Bench  of  the Opposition. That  is  the  Prime

Minister's memory!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I am obliged and indebted to the

Member  for Anson: Yes, he was present. Mr Fong  Swee

Suan,  Mr Devan Nair, I think Mr Woodhull  was  also

there.  Woodhull, Fong Swee Suan, Devan Nair - yes,  Mr

Lim  Ching Siong. He was not holding my hand. I  would

like  to  clarify  for  the Member  for  Anson  a  bit

further. Mr Lim Ching Siong used to sit behind  me-he

together  with  a  few others. I have forgotten  now..

Yes,  the Parliamentary Secretary to, the Deputy Prime

Minister. He could not be, holding my hand. He has  to

have  long  hands! But never mind. This  is  what  the

Member for Anson said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...plague-carrying rats can carry their falsehoods.

They do not wince from lies, Sir. Lies are part of

their daily bread. They will

tell  you  that they are not pro-Communists; they  are

not anti-Communists; they are not Communists; whatever

lies best suit them - lies every one! By lies they live,

and lies have ridden the streets these past weeks!'



<br><br>Well,  Sir,  "dishonest" - now he says they are  honest.

"professional  agitators" - now he  says  they  honestly

seek  the benefit of the workers, the welfare  of  the

workers.  These  are  things that need  clarification.

Therefore, I have every intention of giving way to the

Member for Anson in order to allow him to clarify.  On

that same occasion, at column 237 of the Hansard, Vol.

1,  No. 4, on 16th of May - this is just after the  Hock

Lee riots -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Which you fomented!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I did not, Sir. I was listening

to  the radio at the height of the riots, and I  heard

the then Chief Minister, instead of firmly talking  of

law and order and the maintenance of the integrity  of

the  democratic  system, say, "Dear  workers,  I  have

telephoned Professor Arthur Lewis, the well-known West

Indian  economist,  to come from  London  to  help  us

develop  the  country." And look at this - a  new  riot,

said he. I was so astounded as I listened to the radio

that  I did not know whether a government then existed

in Singapore. This is what he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have had these remarks about Government seeking

to stir up anti-Communist hysteria'.



<br><br>These  were  the  same  honest gentlemen  seeking  the

welfare  of the workers - Mr Lim Ching Siong, Mr  Fong

Swee Suan, Mr S. Woodhull - saying that the Member  for

Anson was stirring up anti-Communist hysteria.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Nair and Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> No. Whatever T have accused the

Member  for  Anson  of,  I think  "hysteria"  was  the

operative word as far as I was concerned. I was not so

much  concerned about whether it was of the  Communist

or  anti-Communist  variety. But his  emotional  state

was, I think, appropriately described by the operative

word "hysteria". He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This is not hysteria. These are facts. Singapore is

a political balancing point of Asia today.'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



1955/1956, Sir, is the hey-day of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I love Malaya...[momentous words, Sir] as much as any

man  in this House, and I am working for a Malaya that

will  not  be a satellite of England or of  any  other

nation in the world. And I am appealing now to persons

who  are  honest, to persons who are genuine,  and  to

persons who are able, to open their eyes to the  evils

within their own camp.'.



<br><br>I harken to his words, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You cannot have one foot in the Communist camp and

one foot in the democratic camp.'.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The P.A.P. line in 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Yes, and -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the Member for Anson

carries on with his interruptions, we will go on to  8

o'clock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I try to oblige the Member for

Anson  in  any way we can, in so far as it  helps  the

democratic process in the clarification of man's mind.

And  this  helps. Today perchance he  started  off  on

social security; a recital of the facts caused  him  a

great  deal of embarrassment and interjections leading

to  a debate, all of his own making, Sir. He asked the

question; he got the answer; he interrupted; this  led

to  a debate. He forced the Member for Thomson to have

to  make  a statement, to exculpate himself, a  rather

weak  and  feeble one, but never mind.  He  tried  his

best.  He  gave  an  opportunity  to  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  to  urge the Government to the  mischievous

courses  of action, to ram things down the throats  of

the workers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> And got it cornered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Cornered? That fortunately is

not  the  position we are in. Others may be  in  tight

corners  at  this moment. To those who lack sufficient

red blood corpuscles and iron in their stomachs, well,

good  luck to them. But we are grateful to the  Member

for  Anson  for this opportunity. He is interested  in

social insurance, to the glory of the Member for Anson

for having got it for the people of Singapore just by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



asking  one  question, or referring to some  committee

appointed in his time as Chief Minister. Fair  enough.

That is a fair political gambit.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is a very cheap remark.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Anson  is  getting a bit excited. If he objects  to  a

remark made by a Member, he rises on a point of order.

He must not shout across the Chamber in that way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> All I wish to say now is this.

Having sweated over this comprehensive social security

scheme  which is opposed by Mr Lim and his  group  of

Communist  unions, we are not likely  just  to  forget

about it. But to push it through right now would be an

act  of political folly. Other situations will emerge.

This is changing in a fluid situation. The ground  now

is  cold - cold  for them. The American T.V, team  that

went  down to Toa Payoh was disappointed, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  No landlords were there to be harangued,  to  be

buried  alive,  to  be beheaded; and  the  shots  they

wanted  to take of real, fierce slogans being  shouted

and  chaps running amok did not take place. We  intend

to  keep  it  that  way, by talking peaceably,  acting

peaceably,  and persuading peaceably. But, of  course,

if  people want to do foolish things, how can we  save

them  from their own folly? We can only persuade them.

But  after  it  is more stabilised - and  it  must  be - a

scheme will be presented. I have every confidence that

it  will be the Minister for Finance and my colleague,

the Minister for Labour, who will have the pleasure of

presenting it to this House. At the appropriate  time,

we  will give due acknowledgement, as we always do, to

those who have helped us, like the present adviser  to

the Barisan Sosialis, Mr James Puthucheary, a man  of

considerable  intelligence, as I  have  said,  in  his

lucid  moments. In one of his unlucid moments  he  got

involved in the Barisan. I saw him yesterday and had a

pleasant   conversation  with  him.  The  Member   for

Queenstown  saw  it  he  got excited.  He  called  Mr

Puthucheary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



away.  He  was  wondering what I was  doing  with  Mr

Puthucheary  with  so  much  bonhomie.  But  we   will

acknowledge the contribution Mr Puthucheary  made  to

this contributory scheme: first, to cover unemployment

and  redundancy;  next sickness;  then  old  age;  and

finally, of course, the Central Provident Fund can  be

dissolved  in  this  wider and bigger  institution  to

ensure stability and security for the worker, and  the

absence  of tension, discontent and hatred  at  social

conditions  which is so vital an element on  which  to

mount  barricades.  A  man who  is  reasonable,  in  a

reasonable  frame of mind, with a decent job,  a  roof

over his head, with his kids going to good schools and

learning  for a better future, is not a man  who  mans

the  barricade and takes a stone or a stick or a match

to  burn  up the society that he is enjoying. That  is

what  Mr Lim Ching Siong does not want. That is  what

he  told  Mr Devan Nair. "Do not have salary  scales.

Have  one  wage increase at any one time, gather  more

hatred  and  then  one,  step  forward  and  temporary

satisfaction." The workers relapse into mild apathy to

enjoy  the fruits of their victory. Then work up  more

discontent.   After  a  while - a  year  has   passed - no

increment,  because there are no wage scales.  If  you

get wage scales, you get a yearly increment. A chap is

on  good conduct in order that he can jump bars on the

wage  scale. So, after one year, because there  is  no

wage  scale, you come back for more. It is  an  annual

return. The union's annual return is to talk, at least

have  a  token strike. Even if the employer  wants  to

settle,  have  a  showdown, so that there  will  be  a

militant  spirit  of hatred. I have gone  through  all

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson is not all that naive. He may

not have, as I fortunately have, personal knowledge of

the  manipulation of human emotions, because I had  to

run  around  underground and understand these  things.

But  he knew what was happening. I was explaining  all

this  to  him  when  he  was Chief  Minister.  He  was

grateful to me and shook me warmly by the hand. Has he

forgotten  Hock  Lee?  I went to  his  flat  in  Meyer

Mansions. He plied me with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



champagne  out  of  gratitude for my  helping  him  to

resolve  all these troubles which in the end Mr  Fong

Swee  Suan stymied by refusing to allow the settlement

to  go through, and riots eventually took place.  That

is  the  real trouble with trade unionism in Singapore

today,  that the S.A.T.U. group led by - let us make  no

mistake about it - I estimate at the most 70 or 80 chaps

in  about 30 unions, not 85. I mean 85 unions were the

sum  total  they got together for the first  inaugural

meeting -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Those remarks will come in very

appropriately on item 2 of the agenda.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Thank you. Sir, this is a point

which   perhaps  the  Member  for  Thomson  can   take

instructions  on.  I like to be fair  to  my  debating

opponents. It started off with 85 unions, 14 of  which

were  the City Council Labour Unions Federation.  They

have  dissociated  themselves from  S.A.T.U.  So  that

number  has  been reduced. Several others melted  away

when  they discovered what it was all about. I  notice

lately  that all the joint statements have only  about

five  or six unions at any one time. The sum total  of

unions  is really about 20 or 30. The real trouble  is

these  few  cadres, and I give them credit  for  their

ability    to    work   hard   and   manipulate    the

unions - thousands  of workers - against industrial  peace

against   industrial  stability,  against   industrial

expansion  on principle. After one year, we  suspected

that  was what Mr Lim Ching Siong was up to. A series

of meetings, of which faithful records were kept, were

designed  to  force  an  issue - either  the   line   of

industrial  stability and expansion was  accepted  and

faithfully implemented or the break must come,  as  it

came.  The Member for Thomson knew that. That was  why

we  kept  minutes.  That was why he  challenged  every

single  word in the minutes when we came to confirming

them.  Since  he has chosen to follow the  group  that

persists  in selling the Communist Party line  in  the

class  struggle and class hatred at all costs, then  I

say  the  solution  to  it does  not  lie  in  passing

legislation in this Chamber. The solution  lies  in  a

basic resolution of the ground



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



position,  the remoulding of men's minds in  a  bigger

society,  and  then  the building  up  of  checks  and

safeguards within the democratic system to ensure that

at a later stage no more such reckless adventurers are

allowed to assume positions of importance in the trade

union  movement  or in any other organisations  within

the  State.  It  is  as simple as that.  First  things

first.  And the first thing is the resolution  of  the

political  situation. Then we will  resolve  all  this

social security and all the other matters.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask leave to

withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[14th  March,  1962], "That the Bill  be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>4.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we

adjourned last night, I was drawing attention  to  the

fact  that  the principle of the Bill itself  is  pure

gold,  and  the  unhappy  tradition  of  the  PAP, to

transmute gold into mud. We have had an exhibition  of

that  in  the  past hour of the endless gramophone.  I

pointed  out  also that the Minister for Home  Affairs

himself  seemed  to  be  so  deeply  ashamed  of   the

provisions  of  this  Bill that he  ignored  them  and

pretended they did not exist. I must say, Mr Speaker,

I  sympathise  with the Minister, if, in  fact,  these

provisions do not have his approval, but are  part  of

the  P.A.P, traditions which are forced on him. I drew

attention   to  the  pathetic  provisions  which   the

Government seek to incorporate in this Bill providing,

in  effect, that unmarked and uncertain ballot  papers

should  be  counted as Government votes. These  people

who  are so capable of sneering, these masters of  the

sneer, should recognise that there is hardly any piece

of  legislation or any provision on our  statute  book

which is so worthy of contempt as that provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



which  they  seek - the votes of blind chickens - because

it  is  only  blind chickens who would be  voting  for

them. Those capable of understanding and marking their

ballot  papers correctly would not, as they  correctly

anticipated,   be   casting  their   votes   for   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance

with  their usual sneering approach sought to pin  the

Opposition down to chapter and verse in the precedents

of  other territories for measures which we seek. They

themselves, in fact, have no precedents at  all.  They

themselves cannot point, even in the cheapest  country

in  the  world - we do not reproduce a P.A.P. government

twice

- to  any provision similar to this thing of contempt

which they seek to introduce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision, Sir, a matter that is startling

and  dreadful, is the provision that if on polling day

you are to be seen entering more than two premises  in

the  same  polling district, you would be prima  facie

guilty  of a criminal offence. Is it believable,  Sir,

that  a  responsible Government of decent human beings

should go so low as to seek that kind of muck? I  take

it,  Sir,  that  only  non-P.A.P, members  would   be

arrested  under  those provisions. In respect  of  the

original and really evil provision of this Bill, i.e.,

preventing any effort by political Parties  to  advise

the electorate and to inform them of the issues - clause

40 - the  Minister for Home Affairs has assured us  that

now  canvassing  will be permitted except  on  polling

day.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, he has  not  introduced  any

amendments to that shameless clause 40, but I take  it

that  he will be accepting the amendment of the Member

for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another curious provision which adds up to the

contemptible  approach  by  the  Government   to   the

principle of this Bill is to he found in the provision

that  evidence  can be submitted or documents  can  be

submitted  by  the State Advocate-General  before  the

Referendum  Judge, not on oath, without indication  of

sources, and in fact parts Thereof which may be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



marked secret will then be withheld from other parties

who   are  interested.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   I   have

personally  known of cases where, under the  P.P.S.O.,

documents have been marked secret which you can buy at

10  cents a time or 15 cents a time on the newsstands;

they  are  actually  chopped secret,  dozens  of  them

chopped   secret   by   some   peon   to   whom   that

responsibility  is assigned and presented.  Copies  of

the  Min  Pao,  Sir, which were readily available  were

marked  secret and submitted to the P.P.S.O. tribunal.

That  is  the kind of tribunal we are supposed  to  be

having. There can be no doubt, Sir, that if the P.A.P.

were  to remain much longer in office, there would  be

no rule of law. It would only exist in the breach with

all  the  holes  introduced by the P.A.P. by  way  of

exceptions  to  a  great  tradition  which   we   have

inherited in order to transform it into P.A.P. justice

for  P.A.P. members.  It is  not  my  intention,  Mr

Speaker,  to  take up the time of this  House  nor  to

ramble. Perhaps because I have not got the ability  to

ramble  in such an extraordinary fashion as the leader

of  the  Front bench of the Government. But I  do  say

that  I  do ask the Government to recognise that  this

Bill  is for the future, not merely their future, that

the  principle  is a thing of value,  which  today  we

should have been celebrating instead of pouring  scorn

on, as scorn it deserves, and that the amendments from

this  side  of the House seek to restore  dignity  and

integrity   to  a  principle  that  is  basically   of

considerable worth. It is true, Sir, that some of  the

amendments we have tabled spring from a deep suspicion

of P.A.P. motives, but I ask you to recognise that our

suspicion is well founded. I ask you to take a look at

the  Bill,  Mr  Speaker. The  original  Bill  had  no

provision  whatsoever for setting aside  a  referendum

dishonestly  conducted,  no  provision  at   all   for

upsetting any report by the Superintendent even though

all know that it was false. I ask you, Sir, whether it

is  possible  to imagine that there is a draftsman  in

existence  who  would  be so  incompetent  as  not  to

provide  for  a  Referendum Judge and  for  referendum

petitions.  If there is no such incompetent draftsman,

then was the omission intentional in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



order   to  provide  for  an  eventuality  when   this

Government would require a dishonest report?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister

asked you also, Sir, to  look  at  the

provision in the original Bill whereby canvassing  was

precluded throughout the period of referendum so  that

their Minister for Culture could pour his mess through

their   P.A.P.   Radio  but  no  others   could   even

intelligently  discuss or seek to assess  what  it  is

that is being asked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Australia under the Referendum

(Constitution  Alteration) Act, 1906-1936,  there  are

provisions whereby the exact measure that it is  being

sought  to  introduce may be attached to the question.

Here the question is going to be left in the dark.  No

one is to explain anything. It is to be sprung on you,

and  within  seven days you are to vote. That  is  the

original measure. I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether this

measure,  obviously  intended for the  blind  chickens

that  the P.A.P. think our people are, should  not  be

rightly viewed with the gravest suspicion by this side

and  every  aspect  scrutinised and treated  from  the

point  of  view that the P.A.P. would, where  it  can,

abuse  the  provisions for their own  party  political

ends.  I  would  say  that it is  unfortunate  that  a

measure  which  I have no doubt every Member  in  this

House  welcomes in principle, should have been dressed

up  in such fashion for purely political ends that  we

should  have to deal with it with acrimony instead  of

welcoming  it  with delight. I say to  the  Government

Benches - or such of them as have the courtesy to remain

to  hear - that  we  mean well by our amendments  and  I

challenge the Minister for Home Affairs to prove  that

any single amendment is, as he alleges, obstructive or

would  cause  delay.  I say that every  one  of  those

amendments  is  intended to tidy up the  Bill  and  is

perfectly bona fide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had a marathon debate on the merger

issue.  It is my hope that the symptoms of a  marathon

debate  on  the  Third Reading will not eventuate  and

that  the Government will have adequate sense, if  not

adequate decency, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



cooperate  in  cleaning up this mess which  they  have

made of an honest principle.



<br><br>4.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a referendum

is  a good thing, for it provides for the consultation

of  the  people on constitutional and other issues  of

national  importance. To that extent, we  welcome  the

Singapore National Referendum Bill. But, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, it is with a deep sense of regret that we see the

Government  using cunning tactics to delay this  Bill.

This  Bill should have been read and passed two months

ago. We on this side of the House do not feel that  it

should  be  delayed any further. We are therefore  not

asking  this Bill to be committed to Select Committee,

for  we  do not wish to be associated with any further

delaying tactics of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been strong rumours in town - for a

long  time  too -  that the Government  had  intended  to

railroad  merger through without having a  referendum.

There  was  genuine  fear  that  there  might  be   no

referendum  at  all, despite the talks of  the  P.A.P.

leaders  that the final decision would rest  with  the

people.  We  are  glad  that  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs, when introducing the Second Reading  of  this

Bill,  has  given a categorical assurance  that  there

will  be a referendum. Therefore, we consider that  an

open  discussion of the pros and cons of  the  various

clauses  of  the  Bill  will  enable  the  people   of

Singapore to have a better insight of what is to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like all good things in life, the Referendum

Bill can be used for evil intentions. We all know that

when  Nobel invented the procedure for the  taming  of

T.N.T. not  so  long  ago,  it  served  as  a   great

industrial advance; but later the very same  invention

was  used to cause unaccountable misery. All of us  in

this  House will remember with disgust the bombs  that

fell  in  Singapore during 1941/42 - no thanks to  Nobel

indeed for his good invention. As the Opposition in  a

parliamentary  democracy,  it  is  our  duty  and  our

responsibility  to see that sufficient safeguards  are

entered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



into  the Singapore National Referendum Bill  so  that

the  possibilities  of  its  abuse  by  a  discredited

government may be reduced to the very minimum.  It  is

with  this  noble  and honourable intention  that  the

Opposition  had  filed  the  amendments.  Instead   of

acknowledging  the good intentions, the  Minister  for

Home  Affairs  had  seen fit to slander  some  of  our

amendments  as,  according to  the  Straits  Tunes  of

today, page 11:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The amendments were apparently designed for and

would   have   the  effect  of  creating   delay   and

obstruction  and  mischief  and  trouble  at   polling

stations  or  inviting  of intimidation  or  generally

creating chaos and confusion to the voters.'.



<br><br>Sir,  all  our  amendments were made after  a  careful

study  of  this  Bill  in relation  to  the  Singapore

Legislative  Assembly Elections  Ordinance.  I  wonder

whether the Minister for Home Affairs really meant  to

have  his  slanderous  words apply  to  the  Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance. If  not,  he

would  certainly  do well to withdraw  his  slanderous

remarks at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have seen the Government playing dirty

political  games  in  this House  too  often.  We  all

remember the Government's jubilance when they  thought

they  had  us  in the Barisan Sosialis cornered  on  a

matter  concerning the privilege of a Member  of  this

House   to   come  to  this  House  unobstructed   and

unhindered. We in the Barisan Sosialis have played the

parliamentary  game  honestly and honorably,  but  the

Government laughed like Mad Hatters - to borrow a phrase

from the Deputy Prime Minister, it was as if they  had

expected us to play the game in some other fashion and

not  in accordance with the parliamentary rules. I  do

not  know,  Sir, what inspired them to think  evil  of

others - "Honi  soit  qui  mal  y  pense."  I  am   not

surprised.  But whatever it is, Sir, we  do  not  want

them to spring their dirty surprises on the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to all honest people, a referendum means the

submission  to  the  electors of  a  matter  of  grave

national importance; but to the P.A.P. it is not so. A

referendum to the P.A.P. is something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



rigged  up  to  salvage its political  bankruptcy  and

doom.  Sometime ago, the Prime Minister said  in  this

very  House that if things got too hot for the P.A.P.

the  P.A.P. would duck. I think it was the Member  for

Tanglin - I stand to be corrected - who remarked  that  if

ever the P.A.P. did duck, it would certainly become  a

dead duck!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> It was the Member for

Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> It was a good passing remark.

The  Prime  Minister has very evidently and  obviously

understood the wisdom of that passing remark.

said you will be a cooked goose!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Understanding the reality of

what  will  happen to them if they really ducked,  the

P.A.P. have  steadfastly and  stubbornly  refused  to

duck. But some way must be found for the P.A.P. to get

out  of  the  "ducking" they had at the hands  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis. What could be better than a renewal

of  its mandate by a sham referendum? Nothing could be

better than that strategy, and therefore this strategy

was  fixed and there would be a referendum.  That  was

towards  the end of last year. The Bill was introduced

and,  all of a sudden, the P.A.P. was confronted  with

some  snags  which could be overcome and  resolved  in

quick  time.  The  Second  Reading  of  the  Bill  was

therefore delayed to save its face. What are the snags

that  gave the Prime Minister and his colleagues  cold

feet?  I  venture to suggest, Sir, that there are  two

important  ones. Firstly, the Government had  taken  a

look  at  the  results of the referenda  conducted  in

other  places  and  had found, to their  discomfiture,

that   most  referenda  had  ended  in  disaster.   In

Australia,  from 1906 to 1935, they had  conducted  16

referenda.  I  quote, Sir, from the Commonwealth  Acts

1901 to 1935, Volume One, A to E, and Constitution. Of

the 16 referenda conducted between

the period 1906 and 1935, only three were approved  by

the  people  and 13 were rejected by the people.  That

must have given the Government cold feet.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



This  fact  alone,  Sir,  would  have  prevented   the

Government  from toying with the idea of a renewal  of

its  mandate  by way of a referendum. Far from  having

its  mandate renewed, the Government would be  obliged

to resign, for their constitutional proposals posed in

a referendum would be surely and certainly rejected by

the people. However, judging by past performances,  it

is  not impossible that the Government will not resign

even  after their sell-out proposals had been rejected

by the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now on the general merits

and  principle of the Bill. The remarks of the  Member

for  Nee  Soon are straying very far from the  general

merits and principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, in coming to the general

merits  and  principle of the Bill, I was  seeking  to

explain  why  it was that the Bill had been  postponed

for  two months. I will not go very far, Sir, but just

touching a little bit on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having had their proposals rejected by the people, I

can foresee the Government not resigning. But then the

Prime  Minister could not get away very  lightly  with

that,  for  there are still honest people  and  decent

people in the P.A.P. I am looking at the Deputy  Prime

Minister,  for I have a great regard for his  honesty,

and as a scientist of no mean repute -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the Member

for  Nee  Soon  is  suggesting  an  amendment  to  the

Referendum   Bill  in  mentioning  the  Deputy   Prime

Minister  as  an  honest politician.  We  are  on  the

general merits and principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you for your guidance,

Sir,I thought I should give a bouquet when it is due.

[Interruption]  I might disagree with the  Member  for

Anson on that score, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident, Sir, that there are few people in

the P.A.P. who have some decency left, and that should

the referendum on merger be rejected by the people, it

would  be an eye-opener to these people. That  is  why

the P.A.P. Government is so keen to delay this as long

as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



possible,  so  that  some form of  compromise  can  be

arrived  at  and that there will be no  loss  of  face

after  the  referendum. The P.A.P. is  perching  on  a

precarious political position today.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must call the Member back now

to the general merits and principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The second reason why the Bill

was  delayed was the lack of a good issue to  pose  to

the people. The P.A.P. had imagined that if they posed

a  national  issue to the people, it would  gain  wide

acceptance, approval and support. But then the  Tunku,

the Prime Minister -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are not debating why the Bill

was  delayed.  Members  are entitled,  of  course,  to

mention it in passing. But I think the hon. Member for

Nee  Soon  is  going  too much into  details  on  that

particular  aspect. He is entitled  to  criticise  the

Government  because  of  the  delay.  But  he  is  not

entitled to raise a debate on that issue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Can I, Sir, just briefly mention

the two reasons which I have given this House that led

to  the delay of the Bill? The first was that they had

cold feet after they had had a look at the results  of

referenda  held elsewhere. The second was the  absence

of a good issue which could gain wide support from the

people. They thought the merger issue would be a  good

one; but then the Tunku put obstructions in their way,

so   that   the  merger  proposals  now  have   become

unacceptable to the people. They are now shifting from

the merger proposals to the glorification of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Nee Soon is still

out  of order. Will be please come back to the general

merits and principle of the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in so far as

the   National  Referendum  Bill  provides   for   the

consultation  of  the  people  on  matters  of   grave

national importance, we welcome it in principle.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member take much

longer?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> About ten minutes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps we could suspend for tea. I

suspend this Assembly. I will take this Chair again at 5.35 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we broke

off  for suspension just now, I was saying that in  so

far  as the National Referendum Bill provides for  the

consultation  of  the  people  on  matters  of   grave

national   importance,  we  in  the  Barisan  Sosialis

welcome it. But as I have said before, the P.A.P. has

other  intentions  about this  Bill.  The  P.A.P. has

sought to use this Bill to give it an artificial  span

of life. But those who invoke the supernatural to live

an  unnatural span of life must be prepared to pay the

price  of  the  devil.  Let  the  P.A.P. state   here

categorically in this House that it will stand or fall

on   its  merger  proposals.  Let  the  P.A.P. state

categorically in this House that it will resign if the

people reject the P.A.P. proposals in the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did pull up the Member for Nee

Soon,  indicating  that he was  going  away  from  the

debate,  and  that  is  on  the  general  merits   and

principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the sitting

of the Assembly on 15th January, the Minister for Home

Affairs  moved the postponement of the Second  Reading

of this Bill on the excuse that Government wanted time

to  study  the Opposition's amendments. But  what  has

Government   done  with  those  amendments?   It   has

compromised  on matters of lesser importance  and  has

introduced  more rigid amendments to  the  Bill  which

denigrate  not  only the principles of  democracy  but

also the rule of law as we understand it. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



Government is so fearful that its flimsy propaganda on

the   merger   proposals  would  be  so   easily   and

effectively  torn  apart that it  seeks  virtually  to

impose  a curfew on polling day. During the period  of

the  referendum, nobody but the Government may present

its views. The Minister for Home Affairs said so in so

many  words.  I refer to the Straits Times  of  today,

when the Minister said that he would seek to limit the

prohibition of flags, banners, symbols, etc, only  to

the  period  from the date of issue of the  referendum

order  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  up  to   and

including   the  day  fixed  for  the  taking   of   a

referendum; that is to say, during the whole period of

the  referendum, there would be a complete prohibition

of flags, banners, symbols, and mass rallies.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Read it again.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> It is not necessary for me to

read  it  again.  Mr Speaker, Sir. The  Minister  can

clarify it when he replies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment of the Government virtually

transmutes  all unmarked and spoilt ballot  papers  or

uncertain ballot papers into a vote of confidence  for

the  Government. It is indeed ironical that  the  once

arrogant  P.A.P.  Government should  seek  a  vote  of

confidence from the unwary and from the unenlightened,

not  to speak of those who had intended to boycott the

P.A.P. by not marking their ballot paper. Mr Speaker,

Sir, if a member of the electorate wishes to show  his

disgust at the P.A.P. Government -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> He

should vote against it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - and marks or draws something

that  symbolises obscenity on the ballot  paper,  will

the  P.A.P. accept such a symbol as an expression  of

support for the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yellow culture.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Let the Minister for Home

Affairs say so, and say that they are in such a plight

today that even obscene symbols will be interpreted as

support for the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> How will you demonstrate?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, yet another amendment of

Government, the amendment to clause 4, does away  with

the   concept  that  one  is  innocent  unless  proved

otherwise.  Instead  of  putting  the  onus   on   the

Government to prove the accused's guilt, the amendment

seeks  to  put  the onus on the victim  to  prove  his

innocence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is what is done with crime.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> That is not justice as we know

it.  Sub-clause (5) of New Clause (B)  reminds  us  of

trial under the P.P.S.O. where only the Judge and  the

Government know the facts. Sir, it is not that I  have

any  doubts about the integrity of our Judges. On  the

contrary,  I  have full confidence in their  integrity

and  their  ability to pass judgment on  the  evidence

presented. What I am saying, Sir, is that I have grave

doubts  about the evidence, because it is not  allowed

to be examined by the other parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main drawbacks of the Bill have been mentioned

by  my  leader, the Member for Queenstown. It is  only

necessary here for me to stress that, in view  of  the

desperate position in which the P.A.P. Government  finds

itself -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You have been saying that for the

last ten months.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - it is of the utmost importance

that  the  framing  and the wording  of  the  question

should be left with the Assembly. We all know that the

P.A.P.  Government is quite capable  of  asking  in  a

referendum whether one would like to have independence

through merger or prosperity through Malaysia.  I  say

that  such questions are grossly unfair and dishonest.

If  the P.A.P. is really so shamefacedly determined to

exact  a  positive answer from the people, it  may  do

well  to ask whether the people prefer to live in  the

midst  of  peace and plenty and prosperity. Even  then

the   people   may  have  grave  doubts  because   the

credentials of the Government are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



questionable. We all remember that the slogans of  the

S.P.A, in the 1959 elections promised the people  food

and  work  for  all. But the people  knew  what  empty

promises  they were and they showed in a very positive

manner how such fake promises should be dealt with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must insist that in a matter of

such grave national importance, the question posed  in

a  referendum must be framed in this House  so  as  to

leave  no doubts unanswered as to the question and  to

the  possibility of bias. I submit that  in  no  other

place  in Singapore can the question be discussed  and

debated  more fairly than in this House. Under  normal

circumstances,  we  will always support  a  referendum

because  it is a mechanism for consultation  with  the

people.   Furthermore,   a  referendum   will   always

ascertain  that  the  wishes of  the  people  will  be

respected and that it is the people who will,  in  the

final  analysis, decide  their  future.  But  in  the

present circumstances, we feel that the Government, in

pursuing  its  Rightist deviation, and  in  trying  to

utilise the referendum for a second lease of life in a

most  shameful manner, has lost its mandate  from  the

people.  It  is  only right that  there  should  be  a

general election instead of a referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why do you not resign?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would gladly

resign  if any one Member of the Front Bench  or,  for

that matter, any Back Bencher would resign with me and

fight. If the Government Members are prepared to  give

me  that assurance, and are prepared to honour  it,  I

will resign right now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Resign!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Of course, the Government will

not  give such an assurance. They fight shy of  giving

such an assurance because they do not want to meet and

face the people. I hear the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs  shouting that I should resign first. If  only

he would honour his word and say in this House that he

would  resign  immediately after  I  resign,  I  shall

gladly resign.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Now both sides of the House are

out  of  order.  We are now dealing with  the  general

merits  and principle of the Bill. Let us go  on  with

that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to please you,

I  will  say  in  conclusion that,  knowing  that  the

referendum is but a political stunt of the P.A.P. we

still  support it. The people will know what  is  good

for  them  and the people will vote what is  good  for

them.  They  have  seen  enough  of  the  somersaults,

political  and otherwise, of the P.A.P. to ever  again

place  their  faith and their future in the  hands  of

such discredited leaders.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while

I  support  the idea of a referendum to ascertain  the

desire of the people, I think it is only right for  me

to  point out also the special difficulties we face in

the  Singapore  context  by using  this  procedure  to

ascertain that desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must remember that democracy in Singapore is

comparatively  young. Before we introduced  elections,

we  had rehearsals and mock elections in schools. Even

then people were scared about voting, not knowing what

they  were  in  for. And we had to legislate  to  make

voting compulsory. They have got over it, and I  think

they will learn to vote more wisely next time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This referendum is a new procedure. The aim is to

ascertain the will of the people on a specific  issue.

Whereas in most countries the issue is stated plainly

in  written language, here the issue is represented by

a   symbol,  and  that  is  going  to  be  our   first

difficulty - the  choice of a proper, symbol  that  will

represent that particular issue without implying other

issues. At an election, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



course, the symbol represents a political Party  or  a

political  candidate.  People holding  even  different

views would still vote for a political Party or for  a

particular candidate. But in a referendum they have to

come  down to one particular issue. We must not  allow

their  reasoning or their thinking to be  coloured  or

prejudiced by other irrelevant issues. I am afraid  in

the Singapore context a referendum on a very important

issue  might  become  involved  because  of  political

propaganda   and  agitation  with  other  issues   not

connected  with  the specific issue. It  could  be  in

connection  with race. It could be in connection  with

language.  It  could  be  in  connection  with   other

emotional issues, such as the Toa Payoh issue. We  are

thinking  in  terms  of a referendum  on  the  Greater

Malaysia idea. It is going to be difficult to  find  a

symbol that reflects, and reflects fully, that idea. I

hope  that  before the symbol is really  chosen,  many

people will have put their minds on to it so that  the

particular  idea rightly represents the Federation  of

Malaysia  idea. I am not very sure whether the  people

will  be  able  to  see it. But I give  them  my  best

wishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also it is stated that when it comes to voting, we

should  just  be voting for one symbol, one  political

issue,  so that the answer could be yes or no. Now  on

the merger issue, Sir, there are various alternatives.

Some  want  the Penang type of merger; some  want  the

Singapore  type  of  merger; some want  another  type.

Which  particular symbol is to be chosen to  represent

which particular type? Sir, it is always wise to  find

out   from  other  countries  and  benefit  by   their

experience.  Australia  has been  mentioned.  Although

time  was short, I happened to have a book lent to  me

entitled  "The  Government of the  Australian  States"

edited  by  S. R. Davies. It mentions here, Sir,  that

over  the  past  50 years the Australian  States  have

tried  out  this  method  of referendum.  The  Barisan

Member for Nee Soon has frightened the Government side

by  telling them that out of 16 referenda 13  were  in

the  negative.  The idea is that people naturally  are

negative and obstinate when it comes to anything



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



they are not sure about; so the answer is usually  no.

So if doubts can be aroused about any important issue,

any  doubt  of any kind, no matter how good the  thing

is, the answer will most likely be no, unless care  is

taken  to  present  the idea clearly  so  that  doubts

cannot be aroused easily and extraneous ideas are  not

brought in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to read a very brief extract to

show  that if in Australia they have experienced these

difficulties, we in Singapore are going to  experience

these difficulties even more. In page 708, in the last

five lines or so:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Certainly it is very doubtful whether at any time

in  the  past  50 years the issues have been  put  and

explained  to  the  people in such a  way  that  their

answer  of  yes or no in referenda could reveal  their

feelings.'



<br><br>The writer must have been shaking his head over this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For this reason, referenda statistics are barely

more than placings which can give little or no insight

to the complex mind of the people.'



<br><br>Then he said this, which is especially good for us  in

Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Granted that it is really the voice of their party

that  most  electors hear in a referendum, what  would

they say to the same question if the party voices were

silent? Undoubtedly it would vary profoundly.'



<br><br>Sir,  the  danger  is  that the people  would  not  be

expressing  their  own views but, because  of  various

reasons,  they would be expressing their party  views,

and  they  would  express their likes or  dislikes  in

terms  of whether they like a party or do not  like  a

party;  not  whether, they approve of that  particular

issue  or not. That was the difficulty encountered  in

Australia  and  which, I can see, will be  encountered

over  here.  Of course, we might train our  people  to

vote  regardless of party affiliation or party support

on  specific issues. Perhaps if there is time and  the

Government have the means, we could have a trial or  a

rehearsal  on a particular issue that is quite  clear.

For instance, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Confidence in the P.A.P.!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - equal pay for men and women. You

would  say a hundred per cent would be in favour.  Now

we  say that should be the view of the people. Try  it

out  and  I  venture to say that we  will  not  get  a

unanimous  vote on that from the people. But  we  will

get  a unanimous vote from every Member of this House.

Now  if  the  people  have  tried  out  voting  at   a

referendum several times, so that they learn to  think

above  emotion  or  antipathy to a  party  or  to  any

individual, then they can see what is right  for  the

country; they will know how to vote. I am afraid, Sir,

at  this  particular  juncture,  if  a  referendum  is

carried out and merger is brought in, there will be  a

great  deal  of confusion. The reports of  our  debate

here  confuse people. Can we be sure, in the confusion

of  a  campaign on an issue, submitted for referendum,

there would be clarity? In the amendments proposed  by

the  Member  for  Anson  and by  the  Government,  the

question of spoilt votes and uncertain votes came out.

Each one claimed that these votes should be assumed to

mean  voting for one side. Naturally people would  say

that  if the votes were uncertain or blank, they  were

voting  for nothing. They had not decided on anything.

That is what the ordinary man would say, Sir. But  the

politicians  may  not want it that  way.  I  therefore

agree  with the Member for Hong Lim when he  suggested

that  all  these  amendments should be  put  before  a

Select   Committee  and  carefully   studied   in   an

atmosphere not charged with emotion or political bias,

with  a  view to ascertaining truly and honestly  the

views  of the people on any particular issue submitted

to them through a referendum.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I wish to bring the

debate  back to the rails as members of the Opposition

in   the  course  of  the  debate  have  wandered  off

considerably   from  the  aims  and  purposes   of   a

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ought to clarify in our minds why a referendum is

conducted. A referendum is conducted by the government

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



the day in order to settle a certain question on which

it probably feels that by itself it cannot decide. Let

us  take  an  example. Sometime ago in New  Zealand  a

referendum was conducted to find out the views of  the

electorate  as  to  whether  beer,  brandy  and  other

alcoholic drinks should be served after 6 p.m. in bars

and hotels. That apparently was a very touchy question

for  the Government side as well as for the Opposition

side. The New Zealand Parliament felt that neither the

Government  nor  the Opposition would want  to  decide

upon  a  simple question like this, whether  alcoholic

drinks  should be served in hotels and  bars  after  6

p.m.  Therefore,  the  matter  was  referred  to   the

electorate, although I was told that Members  on  both

sides  of  the  House, particularly the male  Members,

were definitely in favour that alcoholic drinks should

be  served  after 6 p.m. But when the  referendum  was

carried out, it turned out that the electorate did not

want  alcoholic drinks to be served after 6 p.m.  What

does that prove? Does it mean that the electorate have

lost  confidence in the Government? Does it mean  they

have  also lost confidence in the Opposition  benches?

Neither  the  Government  nor the  Opposition  Members

resigned  from their seats. Parliament  just  went  on

merrily and up to date alcoholic drinks in New Zealand

are not served after 6 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a referendum cannot be won or lost. It is

wrong  to  say  that  a  referendum  is  won  by   the

Government or lost by the Government; or whether it is

won  by  the  Opposition or lost by the Opposition.  A

referendum  is conducted on a simple question  to, be

asked of the electorate: "Do you wish to have this? Do

you  wish  to  have that?" Therefore, a referendum  is

quite  different  from  a general  election  in  which

groups of bodies or political Parties take issue  over

certain  matters, and, therefore, the electorate  vote

according  to  the political platform of  the  Parties

which are standing for election.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin and the Member for Nee Soon

have just mentioned the specific instance of Australia

where  16  referenda have been carried out  since  the

Australian Parliament passed the Referendum Bill.  The

Member  for  Nee  Soon has mentioned that  only  three

proposals put to the electorate were accepted. Rut the

important  thing  that he has forgotten  to  tell  the

House  is  this,  that at no time did  the  Australian

Government  resign,  or  considered  that  it  was  an

indication   of   no  confidence  in  the   Australian

government  of  that day; neither was  the  Australian

Parliament dissolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another example which we may cite here. It

is  a  very  recent  example indeed  of  a  referendum

conducted in the West Indies. The question put to  the

people  was whether Jamaica should continue  with  the

Federation of the West Indies or should it opt to quit

the Federation. The people, by a very narrow majority,

decided to quit the Federation of the West Indies. But

the  present Government in the West Indies has a  very

large  majority. The Government never considered  that

it  was  a  vote of confidence against it.  So  it  is

important  that in this debate we should very  clearly

come  back  to the aims and objectives of a referendum

and that, therefore, our discussions should be centred

on  what  would be the best way of conducting  such  a

referendum  on  any question that may be  put  to  the

people,  either in the near future or  at  some  other

date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point made by the Member for Queenstown was that

the  question for the referendum should be decided  by

the  House. I put it that it is not possible  for  the

Assembly to decide on the question for the referendum.

In  the  Australian Constitution it is the  Government

which  decides on the question for the referendum.  It

is  the  Government which decides on the date for  the

referendum. It is pretty obvious why an Assembly or  a

Parliament  cannot  decide  on  the  question  for   a

referendum.  As  we  have seen it here  in  this  very

Chamber,  the reason is obvious. When we had a  debate

on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



question  of merger and on a number of other problems,

it  was  not possible for both sides of the House,  or

for  five  political Parties, to come to an agreement.

Even  the Opposition Members among themselves are  not

in  agreement  on the referendum. The United  People's

Party and the S.P.A.-U.M.N.O. Alliance have asked that

the  Referendum Bill should be submitted to  a  Select

Committee. The Member for Nee Soon has just  announced

the stand of his Party, that they do not want the Bill

to  go  to  Select  Committee. On the simple  question

whether  or  not  the  Bill  ought  to  go  to  Select

Committee, we find that even the Opposition themselves

cannot  agree.  How then can Members on  the  opposite

side  come forward with the proposal and say that  all

can  agree on such a major question like the  question

for a referendum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pretty obvious that the responsibility for the

execution of the referendum falls upon the Government.

It  is,  in  fact, the first time in  the  history  of

Singapore that a referendum will be held. But we  have

precedents elsewhere that it is the government of  the

day  that decides the question for the referendum  and

the date when it will be held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon has accused the Government

of  delaying the passage of the Referendum Bill. I put

it  to him simply that if we had not decided that  the

Second  Reading of this Bill would be held  yesterday,

the  Barisan  Sosialis  would never  have  been  in  a

position to insert the number of amendments that  they

have.  Similarly, the Member for Anson would not  have

been  able  to  insert that number of amendments.  Far

from  having  any intentions to delay the  passage  of

this  Bill,  it  is  our desire that  it  should  pass

through  the  Assembly  smoothly  and  as  rapidly  as

possible.  But  now the Government is faced  with  the

proposal  by some Members of the Opposition that  this

Bill  should now go to Select Committee, where it  can

be  examined probably in more detail and more  coolly.

Therefore, we have to consider whether it would be  in

the  interests of the people to allow this Bill to  be

considered in Select Committee. If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



passage  of this Bill is delayed by its being referred

to Select Committee, the blame for that delay will not

fall  upon  the  shoulders of the Government.  I  must

remind  the  House  that  if  it  does  go  to  Select

Committee, it will be at the wish of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty with the Member for Anson is this,

that  any  proposal  which he  puts  forward,  if  not

accepted by the Government, brings out from him always

a tirade of abuse and a dysentery of abusive epithets.

He  pretends  that  he is a knight in  shining  armour

fighting  for the people. But if only the  Member  for

Anson  were to look at himself in the mirror  or  come

over  to  this side of the House where he can look  at

his other self on the other side, he would realise the

muck in which he wallows. In the course of the debate,

he  has  tried  to  forget what the  purpose  of  this

referendum is. Like the Barisan Sosialis, he  pretends

that  the  question for the referendum is  similar  to

issues   which  are  put  forward  during  a   general

election. But as I have explained very clearly indeed,

a  referendum is simply conducted on a question  which

is  being  put to the people for their views,  and  it

does not reflect in any way whether it is a matter  of

confidence  in  either  the  Government  side  or  the

Opposition side. Therefore, in order to find  out  the

views   of   the  electorate,  this  Bill   has   been

introduced, and the clauses in this Bill outline  very

specifically how the referendum is to be carried  out.

In  this  way,  the  clauses in this  Referendum  Bill

differ to some extent from what you ordinarily have at

a general election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin has quite correctly pointed

out  that  the  question should be put succinctly  and

clearly  to  the people and that there  should  be  no

confusion  when  the electorate are asked  to  express

their  opinions. It is not a question of  picking  any

political  Party's symbol. This is not a party  issue.

The  question  for a referendum is put to  the  people

when  the  gravity of the matter is so great that  the

Assembly by itself cannot decide either way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, today we are debating  the  Second

Reading  of  the  Singapore National Referendum  Bill.

This  debate is on a very important Bill because  this

Bill  is  closely  related to the question  of  merger

between  Singapore  and  the Federation.  When  it  is

passed and becomes law, it will, firstly, be used  for

the  purpose  of  asking the people  of  Singapore  to

decide  by  ballot  the  question  of  merger  between

Singapore  and the Federation in accordance  with  the

heads of agreement as contained in the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Home Affairs made his speech

yesterday, I was very glad to note that he was willing

to  drop certain undemocratic provisions of the  Bill.

For  example,  he promised that during the  period  of

referendum  all  political Parties could  canvass.  Is

this  good?  Yes, I will say it is. Is it  democratic?

Well,  apparently it seems to be so,  but,  in  actual

fact, I will say that it is not democratic enough.  He

also  made  a  promise  that he  would  relax  certain

provisions  such  as  all-owing the  Chairmen  of  the

various political Parties the right to appoint polling

agents  who  could attach their seals  to  the  ballot

boxes.  He  also promised that if the  period  of  the

referendum  was too short, he was prepared  to  extend

it.  He also indicated that he was prepared to appoint

a High Court Judge to supervise and examine papers and

documents  relating  to  the  referendum.  Are   these

promises  all good? Well, my answer is that they  are.

But  are  they  democratic?  I  will  say  again  that

apparently they appear to be democratic, but they  are

not actually democratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few years when I was

in  the P.A.P. not only did I come into close contact

with the Prime Minister but I also had the opportunity

of  working with him and, as a result of this, I  have

come to know the manner of his thinking. At that time,

I  lived  together with the Minister for Finance.  Not

only  was  I a student of economics under him,  but  I

also played chess with him. So from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



these   experiences,  I  know  that  when  the   Prime

Minister - or   for   that  matter  the   Minister   for

Finance - says, "Well, go ahead. I give way. If you like

this, I will give it to you," that is when we have  to

be very, very careful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that the Minister for Home Affairs has in

many  respects  pretended to  be  very  democratic  in

regard to the Bill under discussion. He has said  that

he  is  prepared to relax the provisions contained  in

the  Bill.  We  want  to ask this  question:  Are  the

leaders  of  the  P.A.P. really so  kind-hearted?  The

answer  is  no. The reason for the P.A.P. giving  way

lies  in  the  proposed New Clause (A) to be  inserted

after clause 28 of the Bill. The addition of this  new

clause provides that any person whose ballot paper  is

unmarked  or  is  uncertain shall be deemed  to  be  a

person  who  accepts  or  is  willing  to  accept  the

decision  of the Government. This new clause makes  us

understand  why the P.A.P. is prepared to  come  to  a

compromise on other minor questions. This is the  main

issue. This new clause has a bearing on clause  13  of

the  Bill,  that is, the right given to the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara as to how and when the questions can be

put  up.  These two clauses - New Clause (A) and  clause

13 - are closely related.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few leaders of the P.A.P. have thought of a

wonderful method of doing this in this manner; that is

to  say, if they can so word the question to be  posed

to  the  people  that  in any way  the  votes  of  the

electorate will amount to saying that they support the

Government, then they will be able to stand  on  solid

ground. That is why they propose this new clause so as

to  ensure that when the people do not want to express

whether  they  are against or for the  question,  then

their   votes  will  be  counted  in  favour  of   the

Government,  I  would  say  that  this  is  really   a

wonderful plan indeed!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, our Party Chairman, the Member for

Queenstown,  indicated  in  no  uncertain  terms   the

importance of the wording of the question. The  Member

for  Anson  also clearly stressed the implications  of

the New Clause (A)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



which  provides that unmarked and uncertain votes  are

deemed  to be in support of the Government. The Member

for  Hong Lim also stated clearly that the whole issue

lies in how the Government words the question. He  was

very right when he reminded the people of Singapore of

this very important point. The Member for Anson stated

that  it  was very unreasonable to treat unmarked  and

uncertain  votes as those in support of the P.A.P.  He

deserves  credit for reminding the people of Singapore

of this important point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to point out that we can imagine - in

fact,  we  can see quite clearly - that from  these  two

clauses, the P.A.P. is going to depend on the  wording

of the question to play its game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest issue of the P.A.P. organ contains an

article  to remind us that in future, when the  P.A.P.

brings up a question for the people to decide, it will

be  something like this: a 20-cent coin and a  50-cent

coin  will  be  given to the people and  they  are  to

decide whether they want heads or tails. The editorial

reminds  us of this: "Heads, I win; tails, you  lose."

So  you  can decide for yourself from this  "Heads,  I

win; tails, you lose." If the question to be posed  to

the  people  is on these lines, then, Mr Speaker,  if

you  are a voter, which way are you going to vote? You

may be very angry and may want to refrain from voting.

But  the  Government will be very happy, because  they

will  say,  "Oh, such a vote will be taken as  support

for the Government." Now, if you are angry and draw  a

tortoise  or  a  bird on the ballot  paper,  then  the

Government  will be very happy because  "You  will  be

supporting  me  too." The Government have  nothing  to

lose  either  way. Now, if you are even angrier  still

and  tears the ballot paper, then it is just too  bad,

because in the Bill under discussion, there is  clause

31   (1)  (a)  which  provides  that  any  person  who

intentionally destroys any ballot paper will be  fined

or  sentenced to imprisonment for a term of  not  more

than two years. And more important still, you will  be

deprived  of the right to vote for a period  of  seven

years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, you see how well the Government

thought  of these things. If you do not want to  vote,

your vote will go to them. If you draw a tortoise or a

bird  on  the ballot paper, your vote will go to  them

too.  If  you destroy the ballot paper, you  are  just

inviting trouble for yourself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can you say this National

Referendum Bill is a democratic one? I would very much

like  to ask the Minister for Home Affairs to give  us

precedents  as  to which countries in the  world  deem

blank  votes to be votes in support of the Government.

This provision concerning unmarked ballot papers is  a

very  dangerous  provision and is detrimental  to  the

interests of the Opposition Parties. At present  there

are people already carrying out propaganda work in the

city  that if you are afraid of trouble in future  you

can  go to a polling station, get a ballot paper,  and

just  drop it into the ballot box unmarked.  If  these

people   could  go  round  and  tell  the  not   quite

intelligent voters to do this, then, by virtue of this

provision, such votes cast will have been  cast  in  a

very  unjust  manner as far as the Opposition  Parties

are  concerned.  So  I  say this provision  should  be

cancelled.  Otherwise, it is against the whole  spirit

of a national referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I have touched on the results and

consequences of destroying a ballot paper. We  are  of

the  opinion  that  it  is necessary  to  endorse  the

amendment proposed by the Member for Anson,  i.e.,  in

page  11,  line 40, to insert certain words to  ensure

that  when a person does not know what to mark on  the

ballot  paper or when he wants to show his disgust  at

the  Government's provision, he should not be deprived

of the right to vote for a period of seven years or be

sent  to  gaol  for two years. If the Party  in  power

agrees  to this, then we can be rest assured that  the

Government has no intention of taking advantage of the

wording  of the question posed to the people  to  play

out the Parties in the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have already said, the

National  Referendum  Bill  has  been  introduced   to

ascertain  the  attitude  of the  people  towards  the

question of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



merger.  On the question of merger, if the people  are

invited to decide, there is one simple way to  do  it,

and  that is to ask them whether they agree or  oppose

the  motion  and the White Paper on merger  passed  in

this  House. It is not a question of asking the people

which type of merger they want. It is only in this way

that the people can confirm the decision of this House

on the question of merger. The main question now is to

ask  the people to decide whether they want the  White

Paper  proposals on merger. It is not  a  question  of

asking  the  people  which type of merger  they  want,

because  when we were debating the question of  merger

in  this  House, the various political Parties brought

up   various   forms  of  merger.   They   talked   of

constitutional progress and the courses it could take.

But  the White Paper passed in this House does not say

which  type of merger the people should choose. It  is

whether  or not the people should accept the proposals

of merger as contained in the White Paper. So in order

to  implement  truly parliamentary  democracy  and  to

enhance  the  spirit  of  a national  referendum,  the

Government  should not bring up various questions  and

consult  the  people  on their views.  The  Government

should accept the amendment proposed by the Member for

Anson,  i.e. in page 3, line 38, to change  the  word

"questions" to "question", from a plural to a singular

number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pointed out just now why the P.A.P. was prepared

to  relax  certain provisions to show that  they  were

democratic.  I  said  that they did  so  because  they

wanted  to play on the wording of the question  to  be

posed  to the people. From this we can see that before

the  government thought of this method, they were very

undemocratic    in    prohibiting    canvassing    and

campaigning.  It  was only after  the  Government  had

thought  of  the  method which  I  described  that  it

appeared to be generous, saying, "I have accepted many

of  your  amendments. So how can you  say  that  I  am

undemocratic?"  I say that this show of  democracy  is

hypocrisy and insincerity. In any ease, the wonderful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



way  discovered  by the Government is  the  best  they

could  find.  All  of us know that on  the  eve  of  a

national referendum on merger, the P.A.P. has done and

is  doing all sorts of things, such as equal  pay  for

equal   work,  increasing  social  relief  and  public

assistance, building more houses, just to  catch  more

votes.  We are not actually against such acts at  all.

We support such acts, the building of more houses, the

giving  of  equal pay for equal work. We are  all  for

this because we have full confidence in the people  of

Singapore.  We  know  they are politically  aware  and

awakened.  We have full confidence in their  political

consciousness. We know for sure that they  will  not,

because  of  the  provision of  better  accommodation,

abandon  the struggle against colonialism. We  believe

they will not exchange their right to vote for certain

benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now when I listened to the Deputy Prime

Minister,  I could gather from his speech  that  there

was  good  news for us, because he indicated that  the

Government  had no confidence in a national referendum

and  that  is  why he stressed and listed examples  in

Australia  and  New Zealand where,  in  spite  of  the

adverse  decision  of the people,  the  Government  in

Australia and in New Zealand did not resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister is

trying  to  compare an important issue such as  merger

with  the  question of the sale of liquor  after  6.00

p.m. This is improper. I would like to tell the Deputy

Prime  Minister that on essential issues - we  can  take

Australia, for example; a national referendum was held

there and when the Government lost, they resigned.  We

can find such examples. I am telling him now, and more

important still I would like to draw the attention  of

the  Party in power to this question of selling liquor

after  6.00  p.m. Let us put it another  way.  If  the

Government  should  lose and did not  resign,  but  it

carried out the decision of the people as expressed in

the  national  referendum on the sale of liquor  after 6.00  p.m. Now, I would like to ask the P.A.P. whether

they  are  prepared to abide by the  decision  of  the

electorate in the event of the people refusing the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



White  Paper  on  merger. That  is  to  say,  are  the

Government going to stop all activities in  regard  to

merger  when the people refuse their White  Paper?  If

you want to take other countries as examples, then you

must  also follow the examples to the full as  far  as

democracy is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now my colleague, the Member

for  Nee Soon, has more or less expressed our attitude

towards the national referendum. We are of the opinion

that   in  a  country  which  practises  parliamentary

democracy,  the decision to put important  affairs  of

state and important political issues to the electorate

to   decide  is  a  very  good  method,  so  that  the

Government  can  always  abide  by  the  decision  and

opinions  of  the people. This is a very good  way  to

practise  parliamentary democracy. But if this  method

of  resorting  to  a national referendum  is  used  to

achieve  the  purpose  of enhancing  one's  own  party

prestige and to continue in office, then that  is  bad

and  it  is  entirely  wrong. If  the  Government  are

prepared  to  accept the decision of the people  in  a

national referendum, then it is a good way to exercise

it.  But  now, the question is whether the  Government

are  really  sincere in seeking the  opinions  of  the

people.  It  would  appear  that  the  Government  are

resorting  to  a referendum in order to achieve  their

purpose of continuing in office. In history there have

been many precedents. For instance, Syngman Rhee,  Ngo

Dinh  Diem and Chang Kai-Shek. At every election  they

were  always  elected.  If the P.A.P. is  willing  to

follow their example to maintain power so as to remain

in   office,   then   I   believe   that   under   the

circumstances,  when the people do not  like  them  to

continue in office, they will never have a good ending

to their political career. Here I would like to remind

the Party in power. If the electorate refuse to accept

the P.A.P. type of merger -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have allowed the Member to

carry  on  up  till now. I suppose he is  entitled  to

criticise  the Government on that line  for  a  little

bit. I have pulled up the Member for Nee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



Soon for being out of order in going on that tack.  We

are  now  on the general merits and principle  of  the

Bill. I think the hon. Member has made his point.  Let

us come back to the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will  not  say  much  on this. I would  like  only  to

express  my opinion of what the Deputy Prime  Minister

has  said. He has raised several issues, one of  which

is  that even should the Government lose in a national

referendum, they could still carry on in office. But I

would  say  that this is entirely different  from  the

real  issue, because the P.A.P. Government today  tell

the  people  that  if  there is no  merger,  then  the

problem  of unemployment cannot be resolved. If  there

is no industrial development, then the people will not

have  any  more houses to live in. In other words,  if

the  people  reject  the White Paper  on  merger,  the

present P.A.P. Government will not have the ability to

seek  out  new paths for the development of Singapore.

They  will  not  be  able to resolve  the  problem  of

unemployment and to carry out industrialisation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must have regard

for  the  Chair. The Deputy Prime Minister was  forced

into   irrelevancies  because  he  was   replying   to

irrelevant   arguments.   I   do   not   want    these

irrelevancies  to carry on. Let us come  back  to  the

general merits and principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  addition to what I have just mentioned, there  are

other  undemocratic  and  unreasonable  provisions  as

well. For instance, there is clause 27 (6). The Member

for Anson has proposed an amendment to this sub-clause (6).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say something about the Member for Anson's

amendment   in  regard  to  impersonated  votes.   The

provision in the Bill says that if a person goes to  a

polling  station  to  cast  his  vote,  the  presiding

officer may perhaps tell him that there have just  now

been  certain  persons  who have  cast  votes  on  his

behalf. Then he could be given a new ballot paper with

a different colour. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



this  vote could be described as an impersonated vote.

But according to the draft of this Bill -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Any comments on the amendments

proposed  are in order if they have some  relation  to

the  general merits and principle of the Bill. But  if

they are only in support of an amendment or against  a

proposed  amendment, then I think the proper time  for

the  hon.  Member  to  enlarge  on  his  views  is  in

Committee. But if, as I say, a comment on an amendment

has  really  some bearing on the general merits,  then

the Member is entitled in passing to mention that, but

not to debate the desirability of that amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

our  criticism and opinion of this amendment  will  be

raised  in Committee. Now, I would like to stress  one

point. With the addition of this provision which  acts

as  a  safeguard,  there will be no fraud  in  casting

votes,  because the impersonated votes will be counted.





<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, it would appear that

the  Member  for Upper Serangoon is casting aspersions

on  the  civil servants who will be in charge  of  all

these election procedures. So far as I know from  past

experience in the last few elections -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of elucidation being?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> It is an unfair allegation

against  the  civil  servants who have  no  chance  to

refute it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of elucidation.

That  is a point which the Hon. Minister will probably

emphasise when he replies to the debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was not accusing

the  civil servants. I was only saying that any  Party

in  power could make use of any loophole in that  sub-clause to profit itself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Therefore, if we

want to talk about democracy, it is better that this

amendment should be made to this sub-clause. That is

what I want to stress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of canvassing and campaigning, there

is  something bad in the provision because the  police

are  being  given very great powers. For instance,  in

clause  42, the Minister for Home Affairs has proposed

a  new  amendment  to  prove whether  any  person  has

committed  any offence relating to canvassing.  It  is

not  for the police to prove that the person concerned

is guilty of any offence, but it is for the person who

is  accused  to  prove that he is  innocent.  That  is

really  against democracy. The Government have thought

it   all  out  after  two  months  and  they  are  now

introducing  this amendment into the  Bill.  It  shows

that  they want to make use of this provision  perhaps

to  deal with the campaigning work carried out by  the

Opposition  Parties.  This  is  something   which   is

undemocratic  and  unreasonable.  As  to   the   other

unreasonable  and  undemocratic  provisions.  I   have

already  said my piece. Now, I will let my  colleague,

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang, supplement what I  have

not touched upon just now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether the Member for

Upper  Serangoon is conducting this sitting by calling

upon  the  Member for Choa Chu Kang to supplement  his

speech. I propose to turn a blind eye to the left  for

the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, I am persuaded now to see the

Member for Choa Chu Kang. I hope there will not be any

repetition of arguments.



<br><br>7.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Minister for Home  Affairs

in  concluding his speech on the Second Reading of the

Bill, said this. I will now quote today's Sin Chew Jit

Poh which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



has  reported  on what he said on that  occasion.  The

Minister said that under the provisions of this  Bill,

the  first  question the people of Singapore  have  to

decide  in  a  referendum is the  question  of  merger

between  Singapore and the Federation  of  Malaya.  We

have  in  the past already debated this question  over

the  radio  and  at Press conferences.  We  have  also

debated this question at several Assembly sittings  in

the past. There are many things which are necessary to

be said before June 1963. But now it is for the people

of  Singapore  to  decide on the  inevitable  form  of

merger  between the two territories. That is what  the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs said  in  concluding  his

speech.  Mr Speaker, Sir, certainly in the past  nine

months  the  people of Singapore have closely  watched

the  merger arrangement which was conducted solely  by

the  P.A.P.  They  are  concerned  over  the  question

whether the P.A.P. would let the people have a  chance

to  decide on this question of merger. I would like to

say  this. If there is no general election or  no  new

election,  at  least  there is a  National  Referendum

because  the people and the Press request  this;  also

because  the  P.A.P. has made certain  promises  under

pressure; and also because of the debate today in this

Assembly on the National Referendum Bill. That is  why

the  Bill  is  now proposed under these circumstances.

Now  what  the  people  want to know  is  whether  the

Singapore National Referendum Bill is introduced under

democratic  and reasonable circumstances, and  whether

there are any loopholes in this Bill. Or perhaps  this

Bill  is  intended only to meet the interests  of  the

present  minority Party which is now  in  power.  What

question  do the Government intend to put  before  the

electorate  to seek their decision? And on what  basis

will the question be put to the people for a decision?

Mr  Speaker, Sir, all these doubts and questions  are

very  prevalent among the people. This House  has  the

duty  to  elucidate and to tell the whole truth  about

the  Bill to the people. As Opposition Members in  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  we  have  the  unselfish  duty  of

exposing   certain   unreasonable   and   undemocratic

provisions in this Bill. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



have  the  duty  of  criticising  this  Bill  and   of

proposing  reasonable  and democratic  amendments  and

suggestions. We hope that the Party in power will have

the courage to accept such correct amendments proposed

by  the  Opposition. If the Party in power  will  only

insist  on  carrying on as it has been  doing  in  the

past,  then  we  can be very certain that  a  national

referendum  will lose its true meaning  following  the

passage  of  this Bill. For this then, the  Government

will  have to bear all the consequences. The  Minister

for  Home  Affairs  made  a certain  explanation  when

moving the Second Reading of the Bill. He used certain

cunning  words  and sophisticated arguments;  but  all

those words and arguments could not cover up the false

and  undemocratic provisions in the  Bill.  He  thinks

perhaps he has carried out the work by propagating the

P.A.P.'s  idea. If the P.A.P. can try to  impress  the

people that they are democratic, then the people  will

not   have   the   impression  that  the   P.A.P. is

dictatorial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. is of the opinion that

by  just  coming  to  a compromise  on  certain  minor

points,   that   is   tantamount  to   accepting   the

suggestions  of the Opposition. But I  would  like  to

tell  the Minister for Home Affairs that this kind  of

tactics  and  thinking cannot fool  us.  Why  did  the

Minister  for Home Affairs not reply to the Opposition

Members'  suggestions  and  amendments?  Why  did  the

Government  not explain why they have now put  up  new

clauses and new amendments? Why should the Government -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That comment is procedurally

wrong.  Amendments are argued for or against in detail

in  Committee, amendments are only mentioned  if  they

have  some  relevance  to  the  general  merit's   and

principle  of the Bill. When the Member for  Choa  Chu

Kang  asks  the  question why the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs has not explained his amendments in detail, he

is procedurally wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  I  want  to  say is that the Minister  for  Home

Affairs in his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



speech  divided the amendments of both the  Member

for Anson and the Member for Queenstown into three

categories. On  the  first  and  the  second  categories,  the

Minister  for Home Affairs quite clearly explained

the Government's reasons; but as regards the third

category  and the new amendments, he only promised

to   bring   up  his  explanations  in  Committee.

Therefore, we on the Opposition side have come  to

the  conclusion that the Minister for Home Affairs

did not give any explanation because he was trying

to  evade  giving an explanation and  evading  our

questions. That is the most important point he was

trying to evade -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must remind the hon. Member that

we  are on the general merits and principle of the

Bill.  We are not debating the amendments. He  can

only  mention the amendments in passing  if  -they

have relevance to the general merits and principle

of  the Bill. If he has further criticisms to make

about  the  amendments, he must wait until  we  go

into Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, we shall definitely raise all these points in

the  Committee  stage. I had raised  those  points

just  now  because  I  wanted  to  show  that  the

Government's  attitude was only to try  to  reduce

the  criticisms  that could  he  levelled  by  the

Opposition  at the Government; so that they  think

the  people  will not then be able  to  understand

clearly that there are some provisions in the Bill

which are unreasonable and undemocratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs said that judging from the sum of money spent in the last general election, the cost of holding a national referendum would amount to $400,000. He also stated many times that certain provisions in the Singapore National Referendum Bill are similar to those in the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance (Cap. 53). We have spent a

long  time  comparing  the Singapore  National  Re

ferendum   Bill  with  the  Singapore  Legislative

Assembly Elections Ordinance to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



find out the differences. The Government have  now

decided  that  polling  day  should  be  a  public

holiday, that voting would be compulsory, that the

provisions  in  respect  of  the  expenses  for  a

national referendum would be the same as those for

a  general  election,  and  that  we  should  have

adequate time to enable us to carry out our  work.

But  the Minister for Home Affairs has only orally

agreed  that  the  period for  canvassing  can  be

lengthened.  He  has  not  mentioned  specifically

whether  it  will be lengthened from the  original

seven days to 12 days. Flags and symbols will only

he  allowed  from  the  date the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  issues  an  order for  the  holding  of  a

referendum  up  to polling day. On this  question,

the  consequences will be just the same, as  there

has  been  no  amendment to this effect:  firstly,

before the Yang di-Pertuan Negara issues an  order

to  hold a national referendum, the Opposition can

never know when he will do so; secondly, before he

issues an order to hold a national referendum, the

Opposition can never have the chance to decide  on

certain symbols, banners and posters. This is also

the  case in a general election. Before nomination

day  is  announced, the Opposition Parties  cannot

put  up  flags, symbols and posters. Thirdly,  the

Superintendent can issue the symbols, banners  and

posters  in  respect  of a referendum  three  days

after the order is issued. For instance, when  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara issues an order to say that

there  will be a national referendum 20 days  from

today, the Superintendent must abide by the  order

of  the Minister for Home Affairs, that is to say,

after  one  week from today, he can then  announce

the symbols, banners, posters and the question for

the   referendum.  In  that  case,  how  can   the

Opposition  Parties know all this in advance?  How

can   they  know  when  the  Superintendent   will

announce  the  question  and  the  symbols  for  a

national    referendum?   Therefore,   the    oral

amendments stated by the Minister for Home Affairs

are only superficial amendments. In fact, they are

just  the same provisions as those in the original

Bill.  The amendments are more apparent than real.

For example, you prohibit a person from eating and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



then you amend the rule by saying that he can only eat

before the rice is cooked. I suggest that the Minister

for  Home  Affairs should give up all these  deceiving

tactics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and the

Superintendent  will make an announcement  after  they

have  received  an order from the Cabinet.  Therefore,

the  Opposition Parties will have no chance  to  carry

out  their propaganda work, whereas the Government can

make use of the radio and the Press to carry out their

propaganda  work. Can the P.A.P. say that this  is  in

accordance with the spirit of democracy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P.'s attitude today is

different  from  what  it  was  in  July  last   year.

Outwardly  it appears to be democratic. In the  debate

on  this  Referendum Bill, the Prime Minister and  the

Minister  for Finance are no longer arrogant and  they

should  be praised by us. However, we must not  forget

the conspiracy that lies behind their sweet words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs has superficially accepted many of the amendments proposed by the Opposition. It can be said that the Government have accepted contain amendments after having considered them for two months. However, Sir, we must not forget that the amendments proposed by the Government are

really  the  important  ones and  these  are  the  new

clauses proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs.  He

said that he would be moving certain amendments in the

Committee stage and that he would be explaining them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to discuss all the new clauses,

but  I  would  like to add to what my  colleague,  the

Member  for  Upper Serangoon, has said  in  connection

with  certain  amendments, especially the  New  Clause

(A).  Sir, we can see that this new clause is  a  very

absurd clause. If the elected representatives in  this

House support it, then we will only ridicule ourselves

by  becoming the laughing stock of the world. Sir, why

do  the  P.A.P. want  to include  in  the  Bill  this

provision  which is not found in other  countries?  If

they want to carry out a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



referendum  on  merger  between  Singapore   and   the

Federation in a democratic and just way, we  are  sure

that  100 per cent of the people will oppose it. There

can be no doubt about this. Even the

P.A.P. know this very well. Even the S.P.A, have  made

statements  pointing out that in the coming referendum

the  P.A.P. will suffer a crushing defeat. Therefore,

the  Government  have introduced this  new  clause  in

order to salvage its political fortunes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. is trying to make use

of  some questions which are detrimental to the people

and  which cannot be easily decided by the people.  In

the  coming  referendum I believe the P.A.P. will  do

this;  for  example, the people should  express  their

views on the question posed by the Government. And the

P.A.P. can pose the question this way: "Do  you  want

independence  through Malaysia?" The  second  question

could  be  this: "Do you want to achieve  independence

through  merger between Singapore and the Federation?"

Under these circumstances, the electorate will find it

very  difficult to make a clear-cut decision on  these

questions.  Although these two questions are  not  the

same, the content is the same, that is to say, "Do you

accept the merger proposals as contained in the  White

Paper?"  The  people cannot make a  decision  on  this

question,  because even if they make  their  decision,

they  will  fall  into  the trap  of  the  Government;

whichever  way they vote, they will all the same  fall

into  the  trap. The result is that they may  abstain.

Following the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections

Ordinance,  if  we  abstain, then our  votes  will  be

considered  as spoilt votes. However, in the  Bill  we

are  now debating, abstention votes cannot be regarded

as  spoilt  votes  but  as votes  in  support  of  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wish to draw the attention of

this  House that this argument has been repeated about

three  times.  It  has been repeated  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis speakers and by other Members. I just wish to

draw  the attention of hon. Members to that fact,  and

the repetition is beginning to be tedious.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, I

agree to your ruling. But as far as our Party is

concerned, we are trying to avoid repetition, but we

feel that this is a very important principle. But I am

only mentioning it in passing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Deputy Prime Minister has said that it

is  impossible for the question to be brought  to  the

House  for discussion and debate. The reason given  by

him  is  that the Opposition Parties are not unanimous

on  whether this Bill should be referred to  a  Select

Committee.  His reason is not convincing at  all.  You

may  recall  that  in  the  past,  when  debating  the

question of merger and Malaysia, the Government  tried

to  make  use  of  the debate to sound  the  views  of

Members  of this House. Therefore, on the question  of

the  referendum,  the  Government  have  the  duty  to

introduce  the question to this House to be  discussed

so  as  to  get it passed by this House. Otherwise  we

cannot  say that this is in keeping with parliamentary

democracy.  I have mentioned just now that New  Clause

(A) proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs provides

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Any person whose ballot paper -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is unmarked; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) is uncertain



<br><br>shall  be  deemed to be a person who  accepts  or  is

willing  to  accept  the decision of  the  Legislative

Assembly...'.



<br><br>Perhaps  the  Government are  trying  to  evade  their

responsibility  on this point, and  want  to  put  the

responsibility on this House. Then we, the Legislative

Assembly,  should  have  the  right  to  debate   this

question.  Otherwise it will be unreasonable  and,  at

the  same  time,  not in keeping  with  the  rules  of

parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we in the Opposition have this

worry.  That  is,  during the period of  the  national

referendum, can other Parties be given the  chance  to

hold  mass  rallies? Because clause  45  of  the  Bill

clearly states that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It shall be an offence for a person to operate any

loudspeaker or other instrument for the production  or

reproduction of speech, sound or music in  any  street

or  public place or any premises adjoining any  Street

or public place, so as to interfere



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



with   any  referendum  meeting  or  so  as  to  cause

annoyance  to  persons conducting  or  attending  such

meeting.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we hope the  Minister  will  come

forward  and explain whether this clause is applicable

to  the Government as well, because it does not  state

clearly  that the Opposition Parties can be given  the

chance of holding mass rallies. Under this sub-clause,

any  person  is prohibited from interfering  during  a

referendum. I say that this sub-clause allows only the

Government  to  carry out propaganda work  during  the

referendum  by  way of the Ministry of Culture  public

address   system  and  other  facilities.   In   these

circumstances, it is most unfair and dangerous to  the

Opposition because the Party in power has the right to

resort  to  the propaganda and publicity machinery  of

the  Government  to call any meetings and  rallies  in

respect of the national referendum. On the other hand,

the  Parties  in the Opposition will not  be  given  a

chance  to do the same by this Bill. It is impossible,

in  these  circumstances, for the people to  know  the

true  picture  of  the  national  referendum.  In  the

meantime,  especially now, these people may be  misled

by the speeches and talks of the Party in power. So it

is  my  ardent hope that the Minister for Home Affairs

will  explain  to  us  clearly the  questions  I  have

raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let us repeat our claim and demands: we hope

that   the   Government  will  conduct  the   national

referendum  under  democratic and just  circumstances.

The  Minister for Home Affairs knows that  New  Clause

(A)  provides  certain facilities for the  Government,

and  it  should  be withdrawn. The Opposition  Parties

should be given adequate time to put before the people

their   views   on  the  question  of   the   national

referendum.



<br><br>7.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the

Bill  in principle. We have had a very lengthy  debate

in  this  Assembly  on  the question  of  merger.  The

Assembly  debated  it  fully and exhaustively  over  a

period  of  time, and it was carried,  if  I  remember

rightly,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  unanimously.  In  those

circumstances,  it  becomes necessary - if  some  other

form of consultation with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



people  is  necessary - to determine on what  method  is

available to the Government for such consultation.  To

my mind, there are only two possible ways of doing it.

One  is through a referendum, and the other is, in  my

opinion,  a  wholly unacceptable one  which  has  been

suggested by the Barisan Sosialis for a long time, and

that  is  for the Government to resign and  go  for  a

general  election.  That is no way of  consulting  the

people  on  a  national  issue,  because,  as  I  have

previously  indicated  to  the  House,  if  it  is  an

election   that  is  to  be  used  for   purposes   of

determining  a  national issue whereby the  Government

and   the  whole  Assembly  resign  and  go   to   the

electorate,  in  such an election  there  is  not  one

single issue before the electorate but several issues.

Therefore, if a particular result ensues in favour  of

a  political Party, it could well be that the national

issue  which  is before the electorate would  be  lost

sight of. Therefore, the only possible way to do  this

is  through  a  referendum. If that is  accepted,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, then under our statute laws we  have  no

provision for a referendum in Singapore at the moment.

Therefore, it becomes necessary to table a Bill before

the House which will enable this referendum to be held

properly  and legally, and the Government are entitled

to  incur  expenditure for such a procedure.  That  is

what  the Government. I hope, is seeking to do in this

Bill. Nobody from the Opposition side, as far as I can

see from the Barisan Sosialis, has criticised the Bill

from  the  procedural point of view. I think what  the

Bill   tries   to  effect  is  a  set  procedure   for

consultation with the people. Instead of which  a  lot

of under-currents, which I personally am not aware of,

have  been introduced and the whole debate has centred

on  these under-currents which seem to be known  both-to  the P.A.P. and to the Barisan Sosialis. But we  in

the  Alliance, being innocent people in these matters,

have not understood the point and purpose of all these

discussions up till now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Is that so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Member for Upper Serangoon says, "We

are  fully convinced that the people of Singapore  are

politically alive." He also says, "We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



fully  convinced  that  the people  of  Singapore  are

politically  conscious." He has  also  said,  "We  are

fully  convinced that they will not sell their  rights

to vote on P.A.P. propaganda." If the Member for Upper

Serangoon  is  not  speaking with his  tongue  in  his

cheek,  what  then is he afraid of? The  P.A.P. might

pose  questions  to  say, "Heads, I  win;  tails,  you

lose."   But   the  politically  conscious   and   the

politically  educated people of Singapore  surely  can

see  through  that. What then is the Barisan  Sosialis

afraid  of?  The  Member for Choa Chu Kang  says  that

telling the Assembly about the Referendum Bill is  not

a  sufficient  telling to the people of Singapore.  He

wants  some other form whereby you can tell the people

of  Singapore about the Referendum Bill. It is a  very

interesting  proposition made by the Member  for  Choa

Chu  Kang,  when  the  whole  attack  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis  on the Government up till now has been  that

this  is  something  which  is  not  in  keeping  with

parliamentary democracy. Today, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

Barisan  Sosialis  seem  to  me  to  be  the  greatest

defenders of parliamentary democracy. The accent is on

parliamentary  democracy. Now if they  are  not  again

talking with their tongue in their cheek, what is  the

best  way  of  consultation  with  the  people  in   a

parliamentary democracy except through this  Assembly?

That is parliamentary democracy as I understand it. If

they are defending parliamentary democracy, then it is

consultation with the people through this Assembly and

not  a mass rally. That was possible in the City State

of  Athens some thousands of years ago. But it is  not

possible  these days. If every time a Bill has  to  be

put  through  in  a parliamentary democracy,  and  the

people  have to be consulted, and the Bill has  to  be

taken outside the Assembly and debated in public, then

government  in  a  parliamentary  democracy  would  be

impossible.  But in some other form of democracy  that

may be possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to take too much

time of the House. But I support the principle of  the

Bill. The procedure is necessary and the Bill seeks to

lay  down the procedure. Since the Bill was formulated

on the first occasion, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



number of amendments have been moved by Members of the

Opposition, and now further amendments have been moved

by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I was not present in the House when the Member for Hong Lim made the proposal that this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee. In the circumstances, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am entirely in agreement with him, and I do hope that, at the appropriate moment, he will take the appropriate step

to  have it committed to a Select Committee. But I  do

wish  to say that in the light of the opposition  that

has  been  raised both to the Bill and to  the  merger

proposals - this Bill is something which merely seeks to

lay  down the procedure to consult the people  on  the

merger  proposals - it is important that this  Bill  be

given  a thorough ventilation. To that extent, I  will

agree with the Member for Choa Chu Kang that the  best

way  of  telling the whole truth to the  people  in  a

parliamentary democracy is to commit it  to  a  Select

Committee. I repeat this again for the benefit of  the

Members of the Barisan Sosialis, that the best way  in

a  parliamentary democracy to consult  the  people  is

through a Select Committee, because procedurally it is

laid  down  that an advertisement be put  out  in  the

papers inviting members of the public to send in their

comments  to the Select Committee; and, if  necessary,

those  submitting representations will be  invited  by

the  Select Committee to give oral evidence.  That  is

the  only  possible  way by which all  the  people  of

Singapore can be consulted. As for my friends  in  the

Barisan Sosialis who are not talking with their tongue

in  their  cheek  when  they talk about  parliamentary

democracy, I hope that at the appropriate moment  they

will  support  the reference of this  Bill  to  Select

Committee.



<br><br>7.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

comment on the arguments put forward by Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis on the debate on this Bill. I  shall

divide  my  comments into two classes. First,  on  the

question  of  matters  of detail,  and,  secondly,  on

matters of some fundamental importance. By that I mean



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



what  the Member for Farrer Park has just referred  to

as  the  under-currents of tension  that  are  passing

between the Barisan Sosialis and us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the first class of comments. I was rather

astonished  to hear from the Member for  Queenstown  a

complete  denial of his statement made  at  the  radio

forum  that  he  had  no confidence  in  the  people's

intelligence. He denied ever making such a  statement,

and  he  even  went so far as to say that  it  is  the

P.A.P. who  has no confidence in the ability  of  the

electorate to decide on important issues. I  therefore

propose to read out before hon. Members a part of  the

verbatim  report  on  the radio forum  held  at  Radio

Singapore on Thursday, 21st September, 1961.  This  is

what the Member for Queenstown said on the referendum:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As regards the referendum, I don't think it is

suitable  because  a referendum is  something  new  to

Malaya.  As you know, the whole democratic process  at

the  present moment is not very conversant. People are

not  very conversant with the whole democratic process

and it takes a long time before people realise what it

is all about.'



<br><br>In  other  words, the Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis

does  not believe that the people are able to make  up

their  minds  in  a  rational way;  that  they  cannot

understand  the issues put to them; and, therefore,  a

referendum  is completely unnecessary. The Member  for

Farrer  Park rather seems to agree with that point  of

view.  I  infer  from his comments on the  meaning  of

parliamentary democracy that the best possible way  to

consult  the  people  is through  the  representatives

elected by the people to this Assembly. That being the

case, if the people's representatives have decided  on

the issue of merger that a certain course of action is

the  proper  course of action, then it is  up  to  the

Government  to implement that course of  action.  More

specifically  on the issue of merger,  this  Assembly,

which  was elected in a democratic manner at the  last

general  election, has passed and approved  the  White

Paper.   And,  therefore,  it  satisfies  the  highest

principle  of  democracy to get on with  the  work  of

implementing the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



White  Paper  proposals  with all  the  constitutional

processes  that are necessary to merge Singapore  with

the  Federation.  I agree with the Member  for  Farrer

Park,  on a point of constitutional law and on a point

of  constitutional principle that the Government would

be  completely correct, completely democratic,  if  it

proceeded  with  the  constitutional  arrangements  to

merge  Singapore with the Federation on the  basis  of

the  White  Paper  without further ado.  It  would  be

absolutely democratic in so doing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Chiang Kai-shek!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Absolutely democratic, and if the

Member  for Queenstown disagrees, I can recommend  him

the  best textbooks on constitutional theory. I  would

recommend  him  to read, for instance,  Ivor  Jennings

Cabinet  Government, wherein this theory is propounded

in  detail.  Why does he bring in Chiang Kai-shek  and

Ngo  Dinh Diem? I am not quite clear. Neither of these

two  gentlemen was elected to power on  the  basis  of

democratic elections. The Barisan Sosialis think  that

we  are the P.A.P. dictators like Chiang Kai-shek  and

Ngo Dinh Diem. Every child knows that if that were the

case,  hon. Members in the Barisan Sosialis would  not

only  be  in Changi gaol, but they would be  six  feet

underground. That is the way Chiang Kai-shek  and  Ngo

Dinh  Diem  deal with their political opponents.  They

are really like spoilt children that need a jolly good

spanking. And I have no doubt -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Chair is entitled to

draw  a line there and to ask the Minister to withdraw

that  expression. I do not think the Minister can call

Members of this Assembly "spoilt children" and suggest

that  they  should have a spanking. Will the  Minister

please withdraw that expression?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Certainly I withdraw, Mr

Speaker.  I  do  not  for one moment  intend  that  my

remarks  should  be taken literally.  The  Member  for

Queenstown was a rugger player of some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



eminence  and  I think it would take possibly  a  judo

expert  to put him under reasonable control  and  give

him  a spanking. I would just say that the correct and

proper democratic processes would be satisfied if,  on

the basis of the debate on merger when all the Members

present  at the end of the debate voted in  favour  of

the White Paper -

<div align="center"><b>VICTIMS OF RECENT FIRE (19th February, 1962)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN EU TONG SEN STREET</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on

the  19th of February, a fire broke out in Eu Tong Sen

Street  which  is in my constituency.  Several  houses

were  destroyed  and  about 150 people  were  rendered

homeless. Being the Assemblyman for that constituency.

it  was my duty to see that help be rendered to  these

unfortunate  victims, Accordingly,  I  applied  for  a

police  permit to collect funds for the  fire  victims

but to my surprise, I received a reply from the police

which  said  that  permission  could  not  be  granted

because  it  was supposed to be "against the  standing

policy" to do so. Sir, I wish to record my protest  in

the strongest terms against this utterly heartless and

discriminating policy of the P.A.P. Government towards

the     question    of    relief    for    the    fire

victims-[Laughter].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugh, huh? The P.A.P. today has descended to the

utterly  contemptible depths of trying to  play  party

politics  with  the suffering of human  beings  during

time  of  disaster.  Even on this purely  humanitarian

effort  of  trying to seek help for the fire  victims,

the  P.A.P. is trying to make political capital. Never

in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>







history  of  Singapore have we seen a government  more

desperate  and  more lacking in moral principles  than

today.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I wish to point out that never in

the past, even in the times of the colonial government

and of the previous government -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> - which the P.A.P. at that time also

regarded   as  a  reactionary  government,   had   the

authorities  refused  well-meaning  organisations  the

chance  to  render  help to human beings  in  time  of

disasters  like fires and floods. When the P.A.P. was

in the opposition, everybody knew how enthusiastic the

P.A.P. was in trying to organise help for victims  of

fire and flood disasters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I was in the P.A.P. before and I can go on

enumerating  example after example of  instances  when

the  P.A.P. as an Opposition Party, was allowed by the

authorities to participate in relief

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1958, during the huge fire in Kampong Koo Chye,

we  spared no efforts to do whatever we could to bring

relief to the thousands of victims. No effort was made

by  the  previous Government to prevent us from  doing

this  humanitarian work. Again, Sir, in  1959,  during

the  big fire in Tiong Bahru and 1961, during the fire

in  Upper  Chin  Chew  Street, I had  the  honour  and

privilege  to organise relief work for the unfortunate

victims. Moreover, Sir, as an elected Assemblyman  for

Havelock constituency, I had to deal with three  fires

in  that  area,  and  on each of  those  occasions,  I

organised the collection of funds and other  forms  of

aid for the victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am relating all this merely to demonstrate that

in  the  past,  it  was  always  a  commonly  accepted

practice  to  allow  Assemblymen  to  respond  to  the

sufferings of the people and to rush to their help. No

attempts were ever made by the authorities to  prevent

us from carrying out what was essentially our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



duty. As leaders of the people, it is Indeed our  duty

to  render whatever help we can to our people in times

of  disaster and need. Besides, it is only humane that

everyone must do whatever they can to help our  fellow

human beings in time of need. It is indeed unthinkable

that  anyone would be so utterly heartless and debased

as  to try and prevent others from sincerely trying to

render  relief to victims of natural disasters.  Thus,

Sir,  I  was  most shocked when I received the  letter

from  the police refusing me permission to raise funds

for  the people in my own constituency and to help the

victims  of the recent fire. Today, the P.A.P. leaders

are  so desperate for power that they are prepared  to

sink low enough -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How low?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> - to prevent Opposition Assemblymen

from  helping  people of their own  constituencies  in

times  of need. As their Assemblyman, I believe I  can

raise  more  funds from people of my own  constituency

for our fire victims. I have, in fact, done so before;

not once, but many times -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How many times?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> - when I was in the P.A.P. Now that

I  have left the P.A.P.the Government tries to  give

the impression to the people of my constituency that I

have no more interest in their troubles, by preventing

me  from  doing relief work for them. To the desperate

P.A.P. politicians  today, it is far  more  important

playing  politics than genuinely seeking aid for  fire

victims -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Did you give any yourself?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> They are even prepared to exploit

the  sufferings  of human beings for  political  gain.

They now wish to monopolise completely all relief work

and to prevent other political and civic organisations

from  participating in such work. The aim is  obvious.

They  want to give the impression that they are a good

Government -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Why

not?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> - whereas others are bad and

irresponsible. Is this fair?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I can quite understand, Sir, why

the  P.A.P. leaders  are now trying  to  impress  the

people.  They  are  not  really  concerned  about  the

people's  welfare; for having sold  out  the  people's

basic  democratic  rights of equal citizenship  rights

and   proportional  representation  in  the  so-called

merger arrangements, they have to find ways and  means

of  covering up their betrayal of the people. Sir,  we

would  not  mind  this monopoly if the  P.A.P. as  an

organisation  could really inspire  enough  confidence

from  the  people in their relief work. But  we  know,

Sir,  the P.A.P. organisation today is an empty shell;

neither  has  it  the manpower nor the  dedication  to

really  help  the  people. The rank and  file  of  the

P.A.P., those who really have contact with the people,

have already walked out of the P.A.P. We know that the

P.A.P. as  an  organisation  is  now  incapable   of

rendering  maximum relief for the victims of  fire  or

other  disasters. Very often, Sir, for  anyone  to  be

really  able to rally the people to help those victims

of natural disasters, one must have the confidence and

support of the people, otherwise it is often difficult

for  him  to  obtain  the maximum  response  from  the

people.  And  for  the P.A.P. to try and  prevent  the

elected    representatives   of   the   people    from

participating in relief work, especially in their  own

constituencies,   is,  to  say  the   least,   utterly

contemptible. I wish to urge the P.A.P. Government not

to  play  party politics with the sufferings of  human

beings.  Do  not try to monopolise relief work  in  an

attempt  to  bluff the people. It is useless  for  the

P.A.P.  Government to try to bluff the people. We  all

know  exactly what the P.A.P. Government is  today.  I

wish to urge the P.A.P. Government not to grudge other

organisations  playing  their  part  in  helping   the

people.  Where the welfare of the people is concerned,

we must all co-operate to do our best.



<br><br>8.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I thought the

Member  for  Havelock  would criticise  or  blame  the

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



for  not  doing enough for the victims  in  this

fire.  But instead he comes to this Chamber and  cries

that  the  Barisan  Sosialis  is  again  being  denied

another opportunity to exploit human sufferings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you can imagine that in a fire the

victims   themselves  are  very  anxious  to  retrieve

whatever they can at that moment. Therefore,  in  such

circumstances,  it is only fair that the  police  will

prevent  those  who are not affected, other  than  the

Social  Welfare Department and those who are assisting

in  the  fire fighting, from moving in or  around  the

vicinity.  In fact, in past experience, fire  fighting

was  hampered because an unnecessary and undue  number

of persons were allowed to mingle at the fire site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most important thing is this, Mr Speaker.

There  are unscrupulous persons around and they  often

cash in and loot the properties of the poor victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to a police permit to collect funds,

here  again,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, it  is  very  simple.

Anyone  who  wants  to assist in collecting  funds  to

relieve  the  fire  victims can apply  to  the  Social

Services Council. The Social Services Council  is  the

proper  authority in the State of Singapore which  has

been recognised for giving relief to fire victims.  If

the Member for Havelock had been sincere in wanting to

help the poor and unfortunate fire victims and not  to

exploit them, he could have just simply approached the

Singapore Social Services Council and they would  have

helped  him with the necessary receipts and  he  could

have  collected whatever amount he could to  help  the

poor unfortunate fire victims. But he had no intention

to  do  this.  What he wanted was to get a  permit  in

order that his Party could put up the Barisan Star and

they  could  go  about and mix around  with  the  fire

victims and hamper the relief work rather than  assist

the Welfare Department in relieving the fire victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of collections, the Social Welfare

Department   has   on   various   occasions   received

complaints  from  the  public  that  funds  have  been

mishandled  and that there has been a criminal  breach

of  trust. If the Member for Havelock wants it, I  can

show him all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



the  complaints. They have been referred to the Police

Department for investigation. Therefore, in order that

no unscrupulous person can cash in on these occasions,

we have therefore decided that only persons who really

want  to  help can obtain permission from  the  Social

Services Council and, with their receipts, they can go

round to collect money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the information of this House,

the   Government  had  done  what  it  could  for  the

unfortunate  fire victims in Eu Tong  Sen  Street.  In

this  fire  there were 32 families affected  and  they

totalled  150  persons. All these  persons  have  been

given  the  necessary financial assistance. They  have

all  been  offered accommodation by the Housing  Board

and they are now being accommodated in:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiong Bahru - 11 families:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kallang Airport - 3 families;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delta/Ganges - 6 families;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bukit Ho Swee 3 - families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as far as the victims are concerned, the

Government  have  looked after them properly  and  did

what  could be done. There is therefore no  cause  for

complaint  by the Member for Havelock. The  Opposition

complaint this evening is that they were not given  an

opportunity  to exploit another misfortune  for  their

own political purposes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was not our

asking  to  exploit anybody at any time. In  fact,  on

that particular evening when the fire broke out in the

Havelock  constituency, we went along to the  Havelock

Community Centre and there we saw P.A.P. members  with

arm-bands  lined up right inside the Centre.  Now  the

P.A.P. have always wanted to tell people that politics

should  not  be  brought in. Yet  on  this  particular

occasion  they  were all there with arm-bands  showing

the  people that only the P.A.P. were doing good  work

for  the people. We are not saying that they have  not

done  anything for the fire victims. We know that they

have -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> That is good.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - but what we want and to

point  out is this. What they have done is not enough.

They  are preventing other people from doing  more  to

help  the fire victims. Why should they prevent  other

people from helping? That is the point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Because you are in the Barisan

Sosialis!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And I want to bring up this very

important point. Nowadays, there is always one law for

the P.A.P. and one law for the non-P.A.P. I think I

can relate the instance of my being charged in court.

I was fined $40 on that occasion simply because -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, and I am glad I was fined

because the people in Singapore now know that there is

one  law  for the P.A.P. and one law for other people.

Sir,  I  might  just add a few words on  this.  I  was

merely doing the very same thing which we had all  the

time  been  doing  in  the  P.A.P., not  only  in  my

constituency  but in other branches as  well.  On  one

occasion,  the  Prime Minister himself was  addressing

the crowd. The same loudspeaker system was put outside

the  premises. The police never dared murmur a  single

word. There were no complaints. They never dared  take

action.  On another occasion, the Minister for Culture

was  directed  there by the police.  Fully  conversant

with  the whole process of the law, knowing full  well

that  the loudspeaker system was also put outside  the

building  and  that they were private  meetings  which

could have been construed to be public meetings by the

police,  the police nevertheless never dared  raise  a

finger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> But you were in the Party.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They never complained and, of

course,  they  would  not dare proceed  with  a  court

action. But see what has happened now that we  are  no

more in the P.A.P.!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You were attached to the Ministry of

Home Affairs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Not so very long ago during

the  fire  in  Bukit  Ho Swee a  great  number  of

organisations  had  helped. Now  just  because  we

happen  to  be  no more in the P.A.P.  we  cannot

help.  It  was  the same story with  the  fire  in

Siglap. Why are we not allowed to help? Why cannot

the  fire victims get a chance to receive more aid

as  a result of other people coming in to help? Is

the offer of aid a monopoly of the P.A.P.? Do they

have to monopolise everything?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Send your $500 to the social

welfare. We will give you a medal for it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister  for  Labour  talked  about  the

Barisan Sosialis star. What is all this talk about

political differences when we are trying to  help?

As the Member for Havelock has just mentioned, "Do

not play party politics where the suffering of the

people  is concerned." Make sure that everyone  of

us  can  put in his little bit of effort. That  is

the  main thing. We want to help to make sure that

the  victims get a fair share - not just a  share - of

whatever  help they can get from all  sources.  By

the  P.A.P. Government monopolising all  the  work

they  are  only making sure that the fire  victims

will not get the maximum help that is available.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> We will give you a receipt.

Sir, that is an astonishing remark from the Member

for Queenstown. The complaint Is not that the fire

victims have not been looked after but that -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They have not got the maximum

possible help.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> - had only the Barisan

Sosialis  been allowed to go around with the  "Red

Star"  of  the  Barisan, they  might  either  have

exhorted  or  otherwise persuaded people  to  part

with  their money and more might have been  given.

Sir,  nobody  was  going to stop them  from  doing

humanitarian work.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The police.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> No, I think the Member for

Secretary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Let me finish. All that was

required was, go to the Social Welfare Department,

clear  with  the  Council for Social  Welfare  the

receipts that you were going to issue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I was doing

any  collection,  Mr  Prime Minister.  The  Prime

Minister has forgotten the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I was speaking figuratively,

Sir.  All  they need have done was to collect  the

proper  receipts so that there would be  a  proper

accounting of the money. After all, only  recently

we  had  a  lot  of fuss and bother  about  stolen

furniture, sewing machines and all the rest of it.

We  know that Members opposite are men not beneath

making a claim outside court, but when they arrive

in  court they are afraid to substantiate on oath.

The  best thing is to ensure that there is  proper

accounting. Now, the point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> In fact, the refusal of the

permit came from the police. I wrote officially to

the  Superintendent of the C.I.D. and was  advised

by  the  Officer  in charge of the Central  Police

Station. The reply from the Superintendent of  the

C.I.D. was:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A licence under the house to house and street

collection Ordinance cannot be granted  as  it  is

against standing policy.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> It is against standing policy

to  allow  any Assemblyman or any political  Party

for  some genuine or bogus cause to go from  house

to  house with a receipt of that political  Party.

We have had enough experience of all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yet you did it before.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> That was the time when the

Government was inept and stupid enough  not  first

to  have carried out its duties as a Government to

ensure  adequate  relief for  fire  victims,  and,

second,  to  be  stupid enough to allow  political

competition to do relief.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There you are - an admission of

political competition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> That is the whole issue. When a

big  fire took place in Bukit Ho Swee, the Member  for

Queenstown  was there. So was I and so  were  lots  of

other people. As I have said, Sir, we have the supreme

advantage  of having jointly done all kinds of  public

acts.  As  I  have said, one was tied  up,  put  in  a

suitcase  and  locked  up. Then  after  a  while,  hey

presto,  the suitcase was opened and the man came  out

free.  The next time when he gets locked up. I am  not

quite  sure whether he will come out free or not,  but

that  is  another matter. The point I want to make  is

this. Do not try the old tricks any more because  they

are  known,  and we know that to do these  tricks  you

need  certain  props,  and  it  is  our  duty,  as   a

Government  in full knowledge of how these  confidence

tricks are done, to prevent such operations from being

foisted  upon  the people. [Interruption]  What  I  am

saying  to  the Member for Queenstown is that  if  the

former Government was stupid enough to try and go into

political  competition  for  relief  work,  well  this

Government is not. The fire that took place  in  Bukit

Ho Swee was of great magnitude. Of course, there was a

genuine  well of sympathy and of course there  were  a

lot   of   C.P, elements  running  around - the   Rural

Dwellers'    Association,   the    Country    People's

Association, the Old Boys' Associations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Old Girls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Not yet old girls. The masculine

includes the feminine, and equality of sexes has  been

going  on for so long in these sectors that they  have

not  bothered  about setting up special  organisations

for  Old  Girls'  Associations. But  having  had  that

experience,  we  ensured  that  there  was  a  channelisation for maximum benefits -



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> To the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> - to the people. The P.A.P. did

not  get  one single dollar of the nearly $700,000  or

$800,000 that was collected for the Bukit Ho Swee fire

victims. They were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



all  rehoused  at  public  expense.  It  was  not  the

P.A.P.'s money. We gave whatever was received.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> You hoped to get their goodwill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> We discharged our duty

effectively and efficiently as a Government, as is the

bounden duty of any government. It is also the duty of

any  government to prevent the exploitation of  public

misery, be it on a small or on a large scale, be it in

the  name  of  an  Assemblyman or in  the  name  of  a

political   Party,   or   of   the   Rural   Dwellers'

Association, the Country People's Association  or  the

Old   Boys'  Associations  be  it  Communist  or  non-Communist.  There  will be no exploitation  of  public

misery as long as there is an efficient government  to

ensure  that public misery is dealt with on  a  proper

and national basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point I think worth making and one

upon  which perhaps the Member for Havelock could well

ponder.  His complaint really amounts to this.  Either

through a lack of alacrity or for some other reason he

was absent at the moment of the calamity. He therefore

came  under  some  kind of criticism  for  not  having

evinced   the   right   kind  of  sympathetic   public

spiritedness required of an Assemblyman. So he has  to

make  some noise. We sympathise with him and  we  have

given him ample opportunity to make the necessary kind

of noise. But it is his misfortune for having made the

noise  in the wrong way. Nobody is getting any benefit

out  of  the  noise he is making today other  than  he

himself.  The fire victims are not going  to  get  one

cent  more  from  him. In fact, as I  have  said,  the

Council for Social Welfare receipts are waiting in the

C.P.A.  Room and a collection is ready to be had  from

all the 13 Assemblymen of the Barisan Sosialis -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not one cent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> - each of whom is entitled to $500

per  month  tax free. If there is any sincerity  about

all  this  and  if they really want to help,  we  have

proper receipts to ensure proper collection and proper

distribution and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



we  take  no  credit for it. All credit  goes  to  the

giver. It is as simple as that. The test is, are  they

prepared to cough up? Or is it their intention  to  go

around,  exploit public misery, shake  a  can  in  the

public face either by social blackmail or other  means

of  persuasion or coercion, extract lucre out  of  the

people,  part of which may go to the victims and  part

of which may not? The Parliamentary Secretary is quite

prepared  to  recite  all those  instances  where  the

police  have  more than a suspicion  that  large  sums

collected never went to the victims.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



As  I have said, when dealing with people who are  not

above pocketing what does not belong to them, one  has

to be very careful in these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at Eight o'clock

p.m.,  and  the time appointed for the termination  of

the sitting (half-past Eight p.m.) having arrived, Mr

Speaker  adjourned the Assembly without Question  put,

pursuant to the Standing Order.
