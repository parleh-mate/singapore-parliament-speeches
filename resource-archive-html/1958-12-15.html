<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to announce to honourable

Members  that on the 10th day of December, 1958,  I

received a a letter from Mr J. M. Mason, resigning

his seat as a Nominated Member in this Assembly  as

from today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the provisions of section 50

of  the Singapore Colony Order in Council, 1955,  I

reported the vacancy thus created to His Excellency

the Governor.

<div align="center"><b>REARRANGEMENT OF ORDER OF BUSINESS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order 9 (2), I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That item 2 be taken before item 1 on the Order

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That item 2 be taken before item 1 on the Order

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE IMPROVEMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.02 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat, P.M.N. (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is purely an administrative Bill.

The  main purpose of this Bill is to give the Rural



Board  power  to levy an improvement  rate  in  the

areas excised from the City Council, such as Katong

and   Braddell  Heights,  when  these   areas   are

transferred  to  the Rural Board  on  1st  January,

1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Ordinance stands at present, the

improvement rate can only be levied in the City. In

the  new Planning Bill, there is provision for  all

local  authorities to levy an improvement  rate  in

their areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



However, the Planning Bill will not be in force by

the time the Rural Board takes over these new areas

on the 1st of January, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Katong and Braddell Heights, the City

Council  at present levies an improvement  rate  in

these  areas,  and it is considered that  the  rate

should  continue to be levied when the Rural  Board

takes over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also provision in the Bill for the

Minister  to  exempt any areas from payment  of  an

improvement  rate. It is therefore  proposed  that,

for  the  time being, exemption should be given  in

respect  of Ulu Pandan and Pasir Panjang  when  the

Rural Board hands them over to the City Council  on

1st  January, 1959. An improvement rate is  not  at

present levied in these areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions of which I have spoken are

contained in clause 3 of the Bill. Clauses 2 and  4

and the Schedule are all consequential amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. [Dato Abdul Hamid].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read the Third time and passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>APPROPRIATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of

Supply [1st Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>10.08 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>FIRST SCHEDULE</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

merely  want to seek information on this Head  and,

if  you  will permit me, Sir, I will take  the  two

items standing in my name together, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allotted for Head 1 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1

therein.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allotted for Head 1 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (2) of subhead  1

therein.



<br><br>Of  course, nothing is laid down as to how long the

Governor  will draw his salary. It all  depends  on

when  the  new Constitution comes into  being.  But

then   on  item  (2)  $10  is  reserved  there.   I

understand  that for six months - if I  am  wrong,  I

stand  corrected -  both the posts of Yang di-Pertuan

Negara and United Kingdom Commissioner will be held

by  one  person, but later on the post of Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara will be separate from the  post  of

the United Kingdom Commissioner. Who will be paying

for  the salary of the United Kingdom Commissioner?

Ordinarily,  it  is  the British  Government  which

should  pay for its own man but, at the same  time,

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara will be Her  Majesty's

representative. Is the United Kingdom  sharing  any

of   the  expenditure  and  salary?  I  only   seek

information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been proposed as an

amendment, "That the sum to be allotted for Head  1

be reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead

1 therein."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members may, if they so desire,  range  over

the  next  amendment standing in the  name  of  the

Member for Telok Ayer, namely, "That the sum to  be

allotted for Head 1 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (2) of subhead 1 therein."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while the

Governor  on  the  coming into  force  of  the  new

Constitution will be the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and

at  the  same time the United Kingdom Commissioner,

half  his  salary  will  be  paid  by  the  British

Government  and  the other half  by  the  Singapore

Government. When the Malayan Yang di-Pertuan Negara

takes  office, all his emoluments will be  paid  by

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member withdrawing his

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, in view of the explanation

given, I withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $326,540 for Head 1 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 2-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,871,890 for Head 2 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 3-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $156,680 for Head 3 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 4-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $537,710 for Head 4 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 5-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $254,300 for Head 5 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  take this opportunity to place on  record

the  wonderful  job  done  by  the  Public  Service

Commission. At the same time, Sir, I want to remind

the  Commission of two points. First, it  is  about

the  recognition of foreign degrees. This  question

has  long  been pending. I wonder when  the  Public

Service  Commission will be able to decide  on  the

recognition of foreign degrees, including those  of

America  and  China,  because  I  think  this   can

contribute greatly towards helping the Minister for

Education  to  solve  the salary  tangle  with  the

Chinese school teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish also to remind the Public

Service  Commission about the number  of  graduates

from  the Chinese middle schools. Are they prepared

to encourage as many as they can of these graduates

to get into the public service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, as regards the  recognition  of

degrees other than Commonwealth degrees, the Public

Service   Commission  have  submitted  an   Interim

Report,  and I believe the final Report has already

been   forwarded  to  my  Ministry.  I   have   not

considered  the final Report yet.  I  will  make  a

statement later as regards the recognition of  such

degrees.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, I am only

interested   in  degrees  other  than  Commonwealth

degrees,  such  as  American,  which  are   foreign

degrees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to support the Member for Changi

on  the  question of recognition of foreign degrees

other than Commonwealth degrees. I think it is high

time  that  the  Public Service  Commission  should

consider  recognising degrees  other  than  British

Commonwealth degrees in education as well as in all

the  other professions. In the past we have had  no

alternative   but  to  accept  what   the   British

Government wanted us to accept. On the eve of self-government, I think it is high time that we  should

review the whole matter.



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> From what I gather from the

Interim Report, it does not confine itself only  to

the  question of recognizing degrees of holders  of

teaching posts. It is an overall question on  which

the Public Service Commission have already given us

a final Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I am in

favour  of the views expressed by the Minister  for

Education.  Although I welcome the  recognition  of

degrees  of  other  countries,  we  must  be   very

careful. Sir, I have been to many countries in  the

East which have a lot of so-called universities and

colleges, and, from personal knowledge, I would say

that  if we were to accept at random their degrees,

then,  I  am afraid we would not be able to provide

suitable education for the people here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $254,300 for Head 5 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 6-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $646,470 for Head 6 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 7-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, to initiate a discussion, I

have selected this item for discussion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is moving?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes. I therefore move the

amendment standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 7 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister's post in any democratic

country  is  a  post of honour. People  select  him

because  of  the  services he has rendered  to  the

country. This has happened in India, Burma,  Ceylon

and  many  other countries where they have  had  to

fight  for their freedom. Similarly with the  other

Ministers.  Here, of course, with the  progress  of

time, the colonial powers - the United Kingdom is the

only colonial power left in the Far East - are giving

us constitutional progress, and we have now come to

the stage of internal self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister's post carries a salary

comparable to that of the Chief Secretary, and  the

Chief  Justice - he is above them. But let me explain

further. As I have said in my speech on the  Budget

the salary structure is too high. The local man has

not got to run two homes. He stays in his home.  He

might  possibly be shifted in future to a different

one,  i.e. the  Government provide  residence  and

other benefits. Sir, I would suggest that as we are

replacing  the White men with our local men,  their

salaries should be fixed by the incoming Government

per local requirements. I also want to know who  is

going  to  fix the salary of the Prime Minister  of

the  incoming Government and whether the salary  of

the  present  Chief  Minister will  be  allowed  to

continue.   I  would  suggest  that  the   incoming

Government  consider my points in the interests  of

the  taxpayers.  They  should  not  pay  the  Chief

Minister the maximum for such a post of honour, but

should  reduce his salary and the salaries  of  the

Ministers as well to suit the local needs.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, when the

Rendel  Constitution  came into  force,  there  was

nothing   in  the  Budget  regarding  payments   of

salaries  to  be made to Ministers and,  therefore,

the  first Government which came into office  under

that Constitution had to consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>



what salaries were fair for Ministers. A motion was

brought  before this House in 1955 and the salaries

suggested by the Council of Ministers were  adopted

by  this  Assembly. If I remember rightly,  it  was

even  pointed  out by one Member of the  Opposition

that  the  Government was rather  cautious  in  its

recommendations, and that particular Member of  the

Opposition felt that the salary of $3,500  for  the

Chief  Minister  of  Singapore was,  in  his  view,

inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, Sir, in reply to the hon.

Member  for Telok Ayer, may I say to him that  when

the new Constitution comes into force next year, it

will  be  the Assembly which will have to  fix  the

remuneration  of  the  Prime  Minister.   For   the

present,  while  it may appear to the  hon.  Member

that $3,500 is rather high, may I point out to  him

that  out of 12 months' salary, two months'  salary

is being paid out as income tax?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I am afraid I am unable to

agree  with  the  Member for Telok Ayer.  Sir,  the

Chief Minister's post is very important. We can say

that  it  is an honour to whoever holds that  post.

But  a  man  cannot do the work if he is incapable.



The  Chief  Minister has a lot of  responsibilities



and  he  has entertainment expenses which I do  not

think  he  would like to charge to the  Government,

although  he  is entitled to term the  expenses  as

"official". There are also contributions and  other

expenses  which he could not really charge  to  the

Government.  Therefore, if  the  salary  of  $3,500

appears  to  the  Member  for  Telok  Ayer  to   be

excessive,  may  I  ask him what  he  considers  an

ordinary professional man should earn?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think hon. Members are

doing  exactly what they are not supposed to do  in

Committee  of Supply. In Committee of  Supply,  the

debate  is  really  on  the general  principles  of

Government  policy.  A debate of  this  nature,  of

course,   could  be  properly  conducted   in   the

Estimates Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have always pointed out in the past, I have

permitted hon. Members to ventilate what they think

ought to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



ventilated,  and that is all, but a  debate  should

not develop around those subjects.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Sir, I want to take part in the

discussion with the Opposition Members  as  to  the

salaries to be fixed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I thought I did indicate

that  I  am  stopping the debate on this particular

item.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I consider the amount of salary

for  the  Chief Minister should not  be  less  than

$3,500.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member

should now stop at that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I want to ask the hon.

the Chief Secretary -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the Chief Minister!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am so sorry. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on the amendment moved by the Member for Telok Ayer

on  the  salary of the Chief Minister, I personally

do  not consider that it is too much or too little.

If  the  Chief  Minister has done a  good  job,  he



deserves  all  that  he  earns  and  more - he   also

deserves  our  gratitude. If the job  is  not  done

properly  then we know what our feelings should  be

towards him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of the Chief Minister's

office,  I  have noticed that for three long  years

the  Chief Minister has also been the Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare and that the Chief  Minister's

post is one without a portfolio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I notice that this year there is going

to  be  added another department called  the  Rural

Development    Department   with   a   Commissioner

appointed.  I  think not only are Members  in  this

House  grateful for that appointment, but also  all

the  people in Singapore, especially those  in  the

rural  areas.  It  is  a long  time  since  anybody

mentioned  the  rural  areas.  Attention  has  been

focussed on the city and the rural folks have  been

left  to  do what they can for themselves and  with

whatever means



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



they  have  at their command. In fact, in comparing

the  Rural  Board to the City Council, I think  the

Rural Board is a very poor cousin, one of the  very

poor  relatives who are always living from hand  to

mouth,  holding  out their hands  and  begging  for

money   and   then  finding  that   not   much   is

forthcoming,  or  what  is  coming  will  never  be

sufficient for any project. The people in the  city

live in houses made of brick, mortar and stones and

supplied with modern sanitation, but the people  in

the  rural  areas  live in attap  huts.  While  the

people in the city have good, well-lighted and well-metalled  roads to move about, the  people  in  the

rural  areas  must content themselves  with  moving

along  unmade-up  roads, or  even  roads  that  are

almost  impassable. Bridges in the  city  area  may

cost  as much as a few million dollars, whereas  in

the  rural  areas  you may still find  the  one-log

bridge - the  trunk  of  a coconut  tree  felled  and

placed  across a river or stream to form a  bridge.

We find that the health problem in the city is well



looked  after, with many clinics spotted  all  over

the  place, whereas in the rural areas they are few

and  far between. Sir, all these are just a few  of

the  examples of how the rural people  have  always

been treated by the Government.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as we look through the whole Budget we

find  that  the  Chief Minister has remembered  the

rural  people.  He has appointed a Commissioner  to

deal   directly   with   the   problem   of   rural

development. I am sure this scheme is going to help

the rural folks in giving them more amenities. I am

aware that work has already been started, and  that

roads  are  being made. Many of the unemployed  are

finding  this Department a useful means of  gaining

their  self-respect, by earning their money instead

of  getting  it from the Social Welfare Department.

But  I  would  like the Chief Minister to  remember



that  not  only  is the work that  is  in  progress

important and must be carried out but that more  of

such  work  must be done. Work should  be  selected

from all areas in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



based  on population concentration and requirements

with  a view to long-term development. I would also

urge the Chief Minister to make known to the people

the nature of this work, and that the people should

actively  co-operate with the  Government  to  help

themselves.  I  would like to see a scheme  whereby

the  Government is identified with  the  people.  I

would  like to see it not only welcomed and praised

by the people but that the people should show their

willingness  to co-operate with the  Government  by

coming out and contributing what they can for their

own welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take an example, Sir. Suppose we have a

stretch  of road that must be repaired.  I  do  not

want  to see just the Government coming along  with

their employees repairing that stretch of road  and

then  going  away  quietly. It does  not  give  the

people  a  feeling  that something  is  being  done

especially  for  them.  I would  like  to  see  the

request  coming from the people for  making  up  or

repairing  of  roads  or bridges  and  that  it  be

channelled   to   the   Commissioner    of    Rural

Development. Thereafter, there may be a  conference

between   government  officers   and   the   people

concerned,  and a plan drawn up whereby the  people

will  assist the Government in pointing  out  those

places  that need repair. Those who can come  along

to  help  voluntarily will come forward to help  in

that  capacity,  thus showing  that  they  are  not

helping  because  they are paid, but  because  they

have  a  sense of civic responsibility. Then  also,

they  could,  by discussion between  them  and  the

Government, get the Government away from the  usual

red  tape of doing exactly what the people  do  not

want them to do, and do instead the right thing. In

fact,   I   know  many  projects  where  Government

officials  want  to  implement  their  pet  schemes

without  consulting the people, and they  ended  in

failure.   Here   is  an  opportunity   for   great

participation,  where the people can  be  consulted

and  where  they can give their best ideas  to  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am only quoting an example of road

building or road repairing. There are other  things

the Government can do.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



Perhaps  Government can assist the people in  large

scale   fruit  plantation.  Perhaps  we  may   have

Government  loaning  out  tractors  for   ploughing

agricultural areas, and in that way save a  lot  of

trouble for the people. Perhaps the Government  may

assist  the  people  in poultry  and  pig  rearing.

Government may perhaps be able to give these  hard-working rural folks a new store. Or Government  may

be able to give them poultry, cattle, goats or pigs

in  order  to breed better strains and in order  to

increase their production. I think a host of  these

things can be done for the people if the Government

will go to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, of course, the Chief Minister to

let  us  know  more  details about  these  schemes,

especially  in this Assembly, so that they  may  be

conveyed  to  the people and the people  will  know

that the Government are going all out to help them,

and help them in the right way.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not  want  to  repeat what I already  said  on  the

Second  Reading on Friday; but on this  subject  of

the  Rural Development Panel which the hon.  Member

for  Serangoon has brought up - the Commissioner  and

the  members on his Panel - I would like to  ask  the

Chief    Minister    how    he    reconciles    the

decentralisation  of  local  government,  which  is

going  to go forward through the District Councils,

with  the  centralisation in the opposite direction

which  is being proposed through this new Panel.  I

would refer again to page 466 of the Estimates,  to

the  notes  on the Head which we are discussing  at

this  moment;  the reference to the fact  that  the

"activities    of    various    Departments     and

organisations concerned with the rural  areas  have

tended to be unco-ordinated in the past"; and  this

co-ordination which is to be brought about  through

the  setting  up  of  the Rural Development  Panel,

consisting  of  the Heads of Departments  concerned

with    rural   development - a   purely   Government

Department. As I pointed out on Friday, there is no

reference  to District Councillors or  Chairman  of

District Councils being represented on this  Panel,

so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



the  District Councils elected through  the  people

can   be   brought  into  close  touch  with   this

centralisation scheme. As I already  elaborated  on

Friday - and  I  do  not want to  do  it  again - I  do

suggest that we should give very serious thought to

making  an entirely fresh appraisal of the  way  in

which our administration is being carried out,  for

we   cannot  afford  various  Councils  at  various

levels -  Government (or national), City Council  and

District  Councils.  Will the  Chief  Minister  not

agree  that the expenses involved should be  looked

into  afresh  so that we might possibly  streamline

our  administration for a very  small  island  much

more  inexpensively  and, at the  same  time,  more

efficiently?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like to  remind  the  hon.

Member  for  Telok Ayer about what he said  on  the

question of the Chief Minister's salary, when  that

question  was originally brought up. I am not  sure

whether you have closed the question on the debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have, in fact, closed the

debate  on  the  salary itself. The debate  can  of

course be pursued, as I have indicated.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, rural development is a



very  important  part  of any elected  Government's

activities  in any country. Our rural areas  happen

to be not very big compared with the rural areas in

most  countries  which  have  a  large  land  mass.

Perhaps   it   is  for  that  reason   that   rural



development  has  been neglected  in  the  past.  I

personally  think  that the real reason  why  rural

development  was neglected in the past  is  because

the  Government in those days was mainly interested

in Singapore's progress as a commercial centre, and

therefore the concentration on development was more

on  the  city  itself, which played a part  in  the

commercial  development  of  Singapore.  Not   much

interest  was  therefore taken in the  rural  areas

which   were  not  directly  contributing  to   the

commercial progress of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have changed, Sir, since the last few

years.   Rural  development  now  assumes  a   more

important   role  in  our  economy,   because   the

commercial   progress   of  Singapore   is   slowly

dwindling,  with the result that we  have  to  rely

more  and more on our home production and cut  down

on  imports.  For that reason, Sir, I  have  always

advocated  that the development of the rural  areas

should   receive  better  encouragement  from   the

Government, so that we may be able to produce  more

of  our  own foodstuffs at home and thereby  depend

less  on imported foodstuffs, and spend less  money

on  imported foodstuffs. The progress made  because

of  rural  development has been phenomenal  in  the

last  three years, as I have often stated  in  this

House  and  outside. We have been able  to  achieve

remarkable  progress in poultry rearing. Production

of  poultry  has  increased from 5  million  to  25

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rural development assistance consists of

three  phases.  In the first phase,  attention  has

been  given  to the elimination of risk  which  the

fanner  would normally, take because of the disease

factor   in  the  livestock.  Once  that  risk   is

lessened, then the farmer would proceed to go  into

livestock production in a big way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor is that farmers should be given

the  advantage  of scientific knowledge  which  has

been  accrued  over the years, and, therefore,  the

second phase is to give them that knowledge through

research   work   carried  out  in   Singapore   by

specialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third phase will be to encourage the farmer

to enter the export market and thereby create a new

industry  for  Singapore. We should earn  money  by

these exports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There again research is important. It should also

be part of Government's policy to carry out further

research in order not only to eliminate the disease

factor in poultry rearing, but also to cut down the

cost  and  the  time  of production,  so  that  the

ultimate cost would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



be  cheaper, and therefore the farmer would be able

to  compete in the export market. In fact, that  is

what is happening now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now not only self-sufficient in pigs,

about  60 per cent of which used to be imported  in

1955,  but  we  are  actually  exporting  them   to

neighbouring countries.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reference was made by the Member for Tanglin

to a statement in the Budget that rural development

was not co-ordinated in the past. That was so, Sir,

because   rural  development  consists  of  various

aspects  which  were  being  handled  by  different

Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, land alienation and resettlement

were   in  the  hands  of  the  Ministry  of  Local

Government,  Lands and Housing; the development  of

roads  and bridges was in the hands of the Ministry

of  Communications and Works; assistance to farmers

in   the  raising  of  livestock  and  agricultural

production, the use of fertilisers, germicides  and

so on, were in the hands of my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that would mean that three or four

Ministries  were  handling rural  development  from

different aspects. It was necessary to have  a  co-ordinating body to centralize the work, so that all

aspects of rural development would go hand in  hand

and  the whole project would not lag behind because

one  aspect  had  lagged behind. That  is  why  the

Government  decided  last  year  to  form  a  Rural

Development Panel and, as I explained to the  House

last  year, it was thought that the best person  to

co-ordinate   the   activities   of   the   various

Ministries  would be the Chief Minister.  He  could

then  issue directives to the Ministries concerned,

saying,  "I  want this aspect to forge ahead",  and

could  ask questions as to why one aspect  was  not

going   ahead,  thereby  holding  up  other   rural

development work, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin also raised another

point - why   no  reference  was  made  to   District

Councils playing a part in rural development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that they were not mentioned does not

mean that they will not be consulted, but since the

rural  development envisaged in  the  Budget  is  a

matter  of Government expenditure out of the public

revenue,  that is, Government revenue, it  is  only

fit  that  the  Panel should consist of  Government

department  heads.  But  it  is  quite  clear  that

wherever any matter concerns the District Councils,

the  Rural  Development Commissioner would  consult

them  and  get  their opinion on the  subject.  Any

definite  decision has got to be made only  by  the

Panel  because it is Government money that is being

spent.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I would not like it to be

thought - and  I think my hon, friend  who  has  just

spoken  rather  implied  it -  that  I  was  against

centralisation, the Rural Development Panel and the

necessity  of  having  a  co-ordinating  body   for

improving our rural areas. I am very much in favour

of   them.   But   in   these  days   of   economic

difficulties,  I think we' should consider  whether

we   can  afford  the  luxury  of  having  so  many

administrative  bodies  on  a  small  island,   and

whether  we  should not think afresh about  greater

centralisation rather than greater decentralisation

of  local  government - which is the way in which  we

are moving at present. It is not too late for us to

reconsider  and  give a further appraisal  to  this

whole problem. It has been sparked off, I think, by

the   fact  that  the  Government  have  found   it

necessary  to set up this Panel to look  after  the

interests  of  local farmers and the people  living

and working in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many problems connected with

development of our livestock production and our egg

production. There has been an enormous  advance  in

the  last few years, and it has been a very welcome

one.  At the same time, it has its dangers and  its

difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister for Commerce and Industry

will agree with me that egg production has probably

dropped in the last six or nine months, the  reason

being that, because of the enormous increase in egg

production, the price of eggs has dropped, I think,

from 14 or 13 cents to something like 10 cents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



That  is  because there has been overproduction.  A

lot  of the farmers in the rural areas are fighting

shy  of going in for poultry because of this  drop.

They  are unable to make both ends meet in  keeping



poultry. As a result of this, the price of eggs has

begun  to rise again and perhaps found its economic

level somewhere around 13 cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the problem here - maybe the Minister can

inform  us - is whether we can cheapen feeding stuffs

for poultry, so that the price of eggs can drop and

the farmers can make a living. That is the crux  of

the  whole  problem. In the good old  days,  as  we

sometimes  call  them, there was  the  kampong  hen

which could scratch around wherever it liked in the

neighbourhood of the village, eating whatever there

was off the ground, and it produced one egg a week.

You  can  call  that pure gain. Now  that  our  new



methods  are concentrated methods, possibly  a  hen

could  produce four eggs a week, but  if  it  costs

three and a half eggs in foodstuffs to produce them

it is not pure gain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem with which we are faced in

Singapore, and it is one which certainly requires a

Rural  Development  Panel  to  look  into  and   to

centralise all our methods.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I am glad that my amendment

has  aroused so much discussion. When I moved  this

amendment - of  course, I knew it will  be  the  next

Assembly  that  will  fix  the  salaries   of   the

Ministers - it was just to initiate a discussion  and

to  give  a  warning to the incoming Assembly.  The

reason is this -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I did make it quite

clear that there cannot be a debate on the salaries

as  such.  A debate on that can take place  in  the

Estimates  Committee. We are now on the  policy  of

the  Government  covered by  the  Chief  Minister's

Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on principle

I   am   discussing  it,  and  the   principle   is

this - whether   the  Colony  can  bear   such   high

salaries?  That is on this principle; if  you  will

allow me, I will go on with that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. On the question of salaries

as  a whole - I may be wrong, and the Chief Secretary

will  correct me if I am wrong - that will come under

the  Ministry of the Chief Secretary. If  the  hon.

Member  wishes to speak on salaries as a whole,  he

can,  of  course, do so when he comes to the  Chief

Secretary's Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr

Chairman,  Sir,  I  think it is  correct  that  the

salaries  of  the Civil Service are  matters  which

come  under my Ministry. I would be more  doubtful,

Sir, in the case of remuneration of the Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In that event, I will permit the

hon.  Member for Telok Ayer to range over  all  the

Ministers'  salaries, but not  the  salary  of  any

particular Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, that is

exactly  what  I  meant. I will be  coming  to  the

M.C.S. salaries later on in Head 8. But here, I  am

concerned with salaries of the elected Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colony should pay salaries according to its

means.  These  should not be so  high  that,  as  a

result,  the burden on the taxpayers gets  heavier,

as we have seen during these 3½ years. If we were

to  reduce the salaries of the Ministers,  who  are

elected  by  the  people, it would be  possible  to

bring down the salaries of others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of administration, as I have said in my

speech on the Budget, takes up 55 or 65 per cent of

our revenue. How are you going to start building up

Singapore's financial position in a sound way if we

are  to pay as we have been paying the expatriates?

As  I  have  pointed  out, I  am  not  against  the

expatriates, because they had to run two homes. But

my  suggestion, on principle, is this - that the  cut

in  salaries should start at the top and  then  the

administration  cost  will  come  down.  That  will

reduce  the  burden  on  the  taxpayers;  it   will

increase  the trade and industry of the Colony;  it

will  bring  down the cost of living, and  we  will

then be able to compete with others.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move my amendment on principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The Member for Tanglin, Sir,

has   brought  out  one  or  two  points  on  rural

development which I think need explaining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that egg production has taken a slight

dip in the last few months. The reason was not only

because there was greater egg production, but  also

because there was strong competition from eggs from

China. The increase in egg production brought  down

the  price  from 14 cents to about 11  cents.  Then

came  the competition from China eggs which further

brought  down the price to eight cents. The farmers

found  that  this was an uneconomical  price,  and,

therefore, production was lessened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we took the stand that all imported eggs

should  be  stamped, it has put a  little  curb  on

unfair  competition and has resulted in the farmers

taking   an   interest  again  in  increasing   egg

production. At the present moment, egg imports from

China  have  considerably lessened, not because  of

the stamping requirement, but because, I think,  of

the seasonal shortage in China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of cheaper feeding stuffs

for  livestock. Feeding stuffs are imported, except

probably  a  little  bit  that  is  found  here  in

Singapore.  The price of feeding stuffs  is  beyond

the control of the Government. We have to depend on

the  market  prices  prevailing  in  the  supplying

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what we are now doing is carrying out

research into the dietetics of livestock and, if we

succeed,  we may be able to find a mean diet  which

will  be  cheaper than, and just as nutritious  as,

the present diet provided by the farmers. If we can

do  that,  I  am sure we can cheapen  the  cost  of

poultry and pig production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the hon. Member raised was

that  Singapore cannot afford to have more of  such

bodies  as District Councils, City Council and  the

Rural Development Panel. But this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



Panel  is not paid, Sir,It is just a co-ordinating

Panel  of Government officials who receive no extra

pay.  Only the Commissioner and his Department  do.

That will be necessary in any case if concentration



is to be directed to rural development. You need  a

person  in  charge and a department with  him -  the

field  workers - and that is why this  Department  is

created. The Panel is just to give the Commissioner

advice  on  how  to  proceed and  how  to  get  co-ordination.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr Chairman, Sir, while listening to the arguments

put forward by the hon. Member for Telok Ayer about

the reduction of the cost of living if the salaries

of   Ministers  are  reduced,  I  did  some   quick

arithmetic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six elected Ministers, five of whom are

drawing  $2,500 each per month. The five  Ministers

will  be  drawing  $150,000 in all  and  the  Chief

Minister will be drawing $42,000, making a total of

$192,000 a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If to this amount we add the remuneration of

three  more  Ministers  for next  year - their  total

remuneration come to $90,000 - $192,000 plus  $90,000

will  make $282,000. Does the hon. Member for Telok

Ayer  seriously mean to say that the whole  of  the

$282,000 should be scrapped to reduce the  cost  of

living to the public? Or does he mean to say -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister is now inviting

a  debate. I have been trying to keep the debate on

a  proper  level and he is now going into  details,

and that is exactly what the Standing Order says he

must not do. Can I remind hon. Members of paragraph

(11) of Standing Order 69 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On any question in the Committee of Supply

debate  shall  be  confined to the  policy  of  the

service  for which the money is to be provided  and

shall not deal with the details of expenditure, but

may  refer to the details of revenues or funds  for

which that service is responsible."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have had enough on salaries. Shall we

go on to the Ministry itself?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I would like to explain

the  position. I was actually talking on the policy

of  the  remuneration  of the Ministers.  The  hon.

Member for Telok Ayer says that it will reduce  the

cost   of   living  if  we  reduce  the  Ministers'

salaries.   I   have  not  heard  any  constructive

suggestions as to how this paltry sum, I would say,

could affect the Budget as a whole.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I do not know whether the

Minister for Education has followed the trend of my

argument.  What I said was this. You start  cutting

the  salaries  from the top. If you  work  on  that

principle, you will bring down the cost of living.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I would like to ask further from

the Chief Minister - and I hope to tempt him from his

seat - whether he would say what he proposes to do or

whether   he   proposes  to   do   anything   about

considering   the   question   of   reducing    our

administrative expenses throughout  the  island  by

centralisation.  That  is  a  matter  I  raised  on

Friday.  I  raise it again now. I  have  stated  it

point by point. I hope the Chief Minister will give

an  assurance  that  he will go  into  this  matter

extremely seriously indeed. We have heard from  the

Minister  for  Commerce and Industry that  a  Rural

Development Panel is not a very costly matter,  and

that  it  can  be a Panel of extreme importance.  I

welcome it. I think it is a very good thing. What I

am  suggesting is that we can go one  step  further

and  save so much expense in administration  if  we

streamline the whole of our administration in  this

very small island.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Chairman, Sir, I am at last tempted to rise from my

seat!  I  find it difficult to understand what  was

the  purpose of that question. Is it suggested that

we  should scrap the District Councils? If the hon.

Member  will  let  me  know his  thoughts  in  this

matter,  perhaps  I can give him  a  more  detailed

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I thought on Friday I made that

quite  clear. In view of the fact that it is  quite

clear  that the revenue which we can obtain  cannot

rise  very  much above the present  level  of  $264

million for 1959 - this is a rough guess; it might be

closer to $300 million - and whereas it is inevitable

that   expenditure  must  rise,   particularly   in

education, which is one of the most tricky problems

we  have - how  to  educate all  our  children - I  put

forward  the  thought  that we  cannot  afford  the

luxuries  of  the democratic system  but  only  the

necessities. I felt the luxuries were to have three

or  four  District Councils plus the  City  Council

plus  the national (or central) Government and  all

the  other  administrative bodies that we  have  on

such a small island. I asked whether we should  not

all  of us think again whether we can afford it and

whether  we should not run this island  as  a  City

State, as I put it, with a single, streamline, well-planned  administrative body. I  further  gave  the

thought that if in the future we were to merge with

the Federation, it would be easier for that to come

about  as  a result of having put our own house  in

streamlined order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, in my division I find there are many plots  of

land   lying  fallow.  These  plots  of  land  were

earmarked  for  persons  from  the  Queenstown  and

Alexandra  Road  areas, but they were  rejected  by

these  people. There are, however, a lot of  people

in  my division who would like to make use of these

plots  of  land,  and I hope the Rural  Development

Panel  will make it easier for these people  to  be

given the opportunity to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, I was asking

the   Chief   Minister   this   morning   questions

concerning  the  work which the  Rural  Development

Commissioner and his Department expect to do, and I

have  not  had a reply from the Chief  Minister.  I

shall be obliged if he will give me a reply now.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, there was

hardly  any  debate on the Heads which came  before

this Head 7, but there has been a lot of debate  on

my Ministry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the hon. Member for Serangoon that

all his urgings upon the Government have been taken

note of by me. The Rural Development Panel will  be

so   informed  and  will  be  instructed  to   give

consideration  to the points which  he  has  raised

this morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin has brought up the

question of centralisation. I think it is a bit too

late in the day to suggest now that there should be

no  District  Councils. All of us in this  Assembly

are  committed to having District Councils, a  City

Council and a Legislative Assembly. I am sure  that

when  the District Councils come into operation  it

may  be  found  that what the hon.  Member  thought

would  be  a good thing for the whole of  Singapore

might be feasible. It is therefore for the incoming

Government  to  give consideration  to  the  points

which he has raised, but I would suggest that it is

now  too late to say that District Councils  should

not be formed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I shall be

glad  if the Chief Minister will inform us how much

money the Rural Development Department are going to

spend and where the vote appears in the Budget.  If

it does not appear in the Budget, will it be put up

as an A.S.V.?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> There is no item at present

in  the  Budget  on  rural development.  A  revised

programme  on rural development is being drawn  up,

Sir, and an A.S.V. will be submitted later.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I must apologise to hon. Members

for  the sound system, but we must carry on as best

we can.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> In view of the remark of the Chief

Minister that a programme has still to be drawn up,

will  that not mean that the expenditure  for  next

year  of  something like $268.5 million is not  the

end   and  that  we  will  be  faced  with  further

expenditure which has not yet been contemplated?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, an amount of about

$275,000  is left to be spent this year in addition

to the revote.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Sir, as a member of the McNeice

Committee  on  Local Government, I  can  tell  this

House  that  we  considered  very  thoroughly   the

question of the additional cost as a result of  the

formation  of the District Councils. We  felt  that

the efficiency of the District Councils would amply

compensate  for their cost. It was also recommended

in the McNeice Report that, if there was not enough

work  for,  say,  the  building  surveyor  or   the

sanitary  inspector of one district, he would  also

take  charge of that particular work in the  nearby

district,  thereby saving on the cost. The  McNeice

Committee was represented by all Parties, including

the  Progressive Party Member, Mr Kulasingha, who

also agreed to such a recommendation.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, one last point. The

Government feel that the District Council elections

must  go on. They could have come in any time after

August  1957  when  the Local Government  Bill  was

passed.  A  year  and a quarter has  now  gone  by.

Presumably  another year must go  by  before  these



elections  can  be held. Why is it that  there  has

been  so much delay if the Government are convinced

that   the  District  Councils  should  come   into

operation?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I am sure that the hon.

Member  must  have  in  his possession  a  copy  of

Sessional Paper No. L. A. 22 of 1958. It gives  the

Report  of  the  Select  Committee  on  the   Local

Government   Elections   (Amendment)   Bill.    The

Elections Ordinance has to be amended in the  light

of the recommendations of the Elias Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $383,240 for Head 7 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 8-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move my amendment on principle,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



Sir. In the next Assembly we will not have any  ex-officio  Ministers.  Sir,  in  a  small  city  like

Singapore we have six elected Ministers, three  ex-officio  Ministers  and four  Assistant  Ministers.

Will  it  not  be wise now for one or two  or  even



three  Ministries to be amalgamated into  one?  The

Chief  Secretary is a very important  Minister.  In

other countries I believe he is called the Minister

for  Home  Affairs. I do not know what the incoming

Government's designation will be of this  Ministry,

but as it will be retained, I suggest the abolition

of  the  Ministry  of Law as this Ministry  can  be

taken  over by the Minister for Home Affairs.  This

will reduce the cost of one Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the principle of salary reduction,

Sir,  can  any honest person in Singapore say  that

the  salary  drawn  by an expatriate  Minister  and

local  born be the same? The former has to run  two

houses but not the latter. If an expatriate officer

is  replaced, then the salary of the local man  who

replaces  him should be according to the  needs  of

Singapore.  Now  that is the proper  way  to  judge

salaries; and along with this the salaries  of  the

other Ministers should be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that principle, Sir, I move my amendment.



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the first item raised by the

Member   for   Telok  Ayer  was  the  question   of

economising on the number of Ministries and he made

one  specific  suggestion as to  a  Ministry  which

might  be abolished when the new Constitution comes

into  force. I can only say on that, Sir, that  the

number  of  Ministries under a new government  must

clearly be a matter for that government, and  there

is  nothing  that I can usefully  say  on  it  here

except  that  I would remind the hon.  Member  that

there  is  a  limit to the amount of responsibility

and work which one Minister can undertake in regard

to the departments under his charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, Sir, of Ministers' salaries

and  their  relationship with the salaries  of  ex-officio Ministers who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



civil servants, I would say that the considerations

which  should be taken into account for fixing  the

salaries  of  Ministers are not  necessarily  those

which  are  properly related to  the  criteria  for

fixing  the  salaries of the civil  service.  I  do

suggest to the hon. Member that there is perhaps  a

fundamental distinction there and that while  civil

service  salaries are properly fixed,  firstly,  in

relation  to  comparable remuneration and  benefits

enjoyed  by persons outside the public service  who

carry  similar responsibilities, for Ministers,  it

is  more  a  matter, I think, of politics  than  of

straight   criteria   for  fixing   civil   service

salaries.   Ministers   also   must   clearly    be

remunerated  in  relation to  the  responsibilities

which  they  are undertaking to the electorate  but

not  necessarily  on the same basis  as  the  civil

service which provides for a career during a  man's

lifetime.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Hon. the Financial Secretary enlighten us  on  the

creation  of new posts? According to his speech  on

3rd  December,  he  stated that  1,584  posts  were

created in 1956, 1,727 in 1957 and 1,723 for 1958.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member indicate what

figures he is giving?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> The figures are those given

by  the  Hon, the Financial Secretary on the Second

Reading of the Budget on 3rd December.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it would be for the

convenience  of hon. Members if we  deal  with  one

point at a time. The point that has been raised  by

the  Member  for  Telok  Ayer  is  now  before  the

Assembly,  and if the hon. Member wishes  to  speak

specifically  on that point, he can do  so.  If  he

wishes to speak on salaries in general, perhaps  he

will wait until the Head is proposed to the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I will speak later, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I am glad that the Hon. the

Chief  Secretary has explained how  the  ex-officio

Ministers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



draw  their salaries and how they would be  drawing

them  if  they  were  in  other  countries  of  the

Commonwealth  or  colonies. He also  explained  the

salary  of  the  Minister is  in  relation  to  the

political  position. As such, if any  person  takes

charge of this portfolio, then his salary should be

according to the local needs, and local needs could

be   judged.  What  are  the  needs  of  ex-officio

Ministers  and what are the needs of the local  man

holding  the  same  post?  And  with  that,  as   I

suggested before, the salaries should be reduced. I

just  bring  up  this amendment - I am  not  pressing

it - for the attention of the incoming Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member withdrawing his

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, I am not pressing the

amendment. I beg to withdraw it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $7,248,140

for Head 8 stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, there are a few points

on  the Chief Secretary's Ministry which I wish  to

put  forward  for him to consider. Of  course,  the

point of primary importance is about salaries, Sir.

Is it not high time for the Government to set up  a



Committee to survey and study the workings and  the

efficiency of the public service? There is  even  a

charge  that  luxuries  are being  enjoyed  by  the

public service, because so many new posts have been

created.  That  is  what I just  mentioned - that  in

1956,  there were 1,584 new posts; in 1957,  1,727;

and  in  1958, 1,723 new posts. These  exclude  the

Guard  and Escort Unit. A tremendous number of  new

posts  have  been created and I would like  to  ask

whether  it is possible for the Permanent Secretary

(Establishment) to look into the working efficiency

of   the  public  service  with  a  view  to  their

improvement, or whether arrangements can be made to

cut  down  their  personal emoluments.  The  public

outcry  is this: almost 50 per cent of our  revenue

is spent on salaries. I think, if I am not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



mistaken,  the  expenditure on  this  item  is  the

highest  in  the world. That is the first  point  I

wish  to put forward to Government to consider.  Of

course,  I  would like it to be borne in mind  that

such a rearrangement must not create any mistake as

for  example  in our neighbouring countries  where,

with  the  cutting  down  of  salaries,  corruption

increases and there is less integrity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the second point, I wish to touch on

our  internal security, Sir. Although  1958  was  a

quiet    year - no   rioting   and   no    subversive

activities - the  state of affairs is uncertain.  The

people  still do not feel that they are  secure  in

what   they   are  entitled  to  enjoy.   Gangsters

terrorise society and I shall touch on this when we

come  to  the  Head - Police. But regarding  the  two

measures  taken  by Government against  subversion:

the  first  is the striking out of certain  persons

from  the citizenship register; the second  is  the

banning  of  some  publications from  Hongkong  and

China.  Sir, I  wish to take this  opportunity  to

appeal  to the Hon, the Chief Secretary to consider

carefully  before taking drastic action  to  strike

off  from the citizenship register certain persons.

I have learned that many Chinese community leaders - quite  a  few  of them are members of  the  Chinese

Chamber of Commerce - have laboured for this country.

They  have  contributed a great deal to  Singapore,



either  in providing education or giving charities,

and  yet their names have been struck off.  Sir,I

wish  to  take this opportunity to ask whether  the

Hon, the Chief Secretary will be able to give us  a

satisfactory  explanation as to what  circumstances

have decided him that such persons' names should be

struck off from the citizenship register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the banning of publications, Sir.

Despite  the announcement made that over 400  books



have been released by the Hon, the Chief Secretary,

there are still thousands of publications which are

already  in the bookstores and libraries, and  even

in the hands of students and teachers. I would like

to  quote  a  specific case. Even  in  the  English

schools - because many of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



English  schools  have Chinese lessons -  there  are

many pamphlets and works on literature published in

Peking and Hongkong and yet such publications  have

also  been  banned by the Government  at  the  same

time.  Therefore,  why have all  these  unnecessary

inconveniences  as  a result of  introducing  these

measures  which,  in  the  minds  of  the   Chinese

community, especially the intellectuals, are  harsh

and rash? Will the Hon, the Chief Secretary give  a

detailed explanation as to why a lot of books which

have   already   been  censored  by   the   Chinese

Secretariat - if  I am not mistaken,  the  Government

has said, "Tighten the grip and reimpose the ban on

the  importation of such publications" - are  in  the

hands of many school students and individuals,  and

what  are  they going to do since such  books  have

been  officially banned by the Government but  they

have  already  bought  them  before  the  ban   was

imposed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is on external affairs. Since

external  affairs  is in the hands  of  the  United

Kingdom, and also the Hon, the Chief Secretary will

be  responsible  for this even in  the  future  new

Constitution,  I  wonder  if  the  Hon. the  Chief

Secretary  will  express  the  public  opinion   of

Singapore  towards  S.E.A.T.O.,  and  whether   the

Government  has decided to issue an  invitation  to

make Singapore a rendezvous for S.E.A.T.O. meetings

here?  If this can be avoided, so much the  better,

because public opinion should be respected.  And  I

assure  you  that, if you can make it  possible  to

have  a Gallup poll taken on this subject, you will

find that the people here do not want to embark  on

any,  say,  cold  war conflict,  and  unfortunately

S.E.A.T.O. is one of the main controversial  issues

in   the  minds  of  Asians  today.  I  wish   that

S.E.A.T.O. would not take Singapore as  the  ideal

meeting place for their future meetings because the

public  here  do not welcome them. This  will  stop

unnecessary  ill-feeling  that  Singapore  is   the

Gibraltar of the East, that Singapore is a  British

imperialist  military base. I think  that  is  very

harmful to our belief that our independence  should

be the cause of peaceful evolution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on this subject of external affairs

is  the echo of the Afro-Asian national aspiration.

From  time  to  time meetings are  held  in  Cairo,



Djakarta or some other Afro-Asian country, and,  if

I  am  not  mistaken, the Federation of Malaya  has

taken  part  in quite a number of such meetings  on

matters  of  economy  and  culture;  and  yet   the

Singapore  Government  have never  for  one  moment

considered sending a delegation or even an observer

to  such conferences. Therefore, what I wish to put

forward to the Chief Secretary is this: the general

feeling  among  the  people here  is  to  echo,  to

support,   any  move  of  the  Afro-Asian  national

aspiration;  and if we sincerely believe  that  the

British Government are honest and happy to grant us

independence then they should practise that honesty

by  showing  us a good example and encourage  us - by

allowing a Singapore delegation to attend  as  many

Afro-Asian conferences as they wish.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the hon. Member for Changi

has  brought up a very important issue before  this

House  about  S.E.A.T.O.  Sir,  Singapore  will  be

getting  a  new  constitution  for  internal  self-government, but it will have no responsibility  for

defence  or external affairs. I do not know whether

any  S.E.A.T.O. meetings are held in Singapore.  If

they are held, I think it is improper. Meetings  of

such  nature  should be held in  those  territories

which are members of S.E.A.T.O. Singapore is not  a

member.   The   United   Kingdom   Government   is.

Therefore,  on this principle, meetings should  not



be held in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like to raise a question on subhead 61  of

Head   8,  page  67 - Rent  on  Quarters.  Why   must

Government,  year  in and year out,  spend  such  a

large  sum  of  money on rent on quarters?  It  has

already been pointed out time and time again to the

Government that this unnecessary expenditure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



should  not  arise. Furthermore, Government  should

not waste public money on such a silly item.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, Sir, most of the bungalows

provided for all Government officials are bungalows

with two or three bedrooms with bathrooms attached.

Why   cannot   Government  make   arrangements   to



accommodate  two  families  in  the  same  bungalow

instead of one family living in one big bungalow of

four   bedrooms?  Moreover,  the  bungalow   itself

occupies   a  very  large  piece  of  ground.   The

occupants  of  these bungalows never  make  use  of

these  bungalows. I also understand that Government

have  to pay for the maintenance of these bungalows

and their grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to subhead 10 in page 57, Sir - Upkeep of

Chief  Secretary's Residence. In the year  1958  we

are  spending $13,860. We have here today a sum  of

$4,620  which  is  only a part  provision  of  this

expenditure.  This is unnecessary.  Why  must  this

money  be  spent  at the expense of the  taxpayer's

pocket? Government should try to conserve, as  many

Members themselves have pointed out in this  House,

and  should  try  to cut down expenditure  to  save

money.  As  we  all  know,  we  have  spent   money

unnecessarily on things like that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another item, Sir, is in page 59, subhead

20 - Teachers'   Allowances.   I   would   like    an

explanation  from the Chief Secretary  as  to  what

this  amount  is  for.  Sir,  the  Hon. the  Chief

Secretary's  Ministry has cost the  taxpayer  about

$7,240,000. I am quite sure, Sir, this money can be

saved.  If we cannot cut it by 50 per cent, we  can

cut  it by 40, 30 or at least 20 per cent. Look  at

subhead  54,  page  66 - Passages  and  Miscellaneous

Travelling   Expenses.  In  1958  the   amount   is

$1,200,000. This year it is $1,130,000 - a saving  of

$70,000 - but that is not enough.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I

have  a  number of points to review in a relatively

short  time.  The hon. Member for Changi  suggested

that it might be useful, if I understood him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



right,  to set up a Commission to inquire into  the

efficiency  of  the running of the  Public  Service

with  the  object thereby of cutting  down  staffs.

Sir,  I  very  much  doubt  whether  setting  up  a



Commission  of that kind would indeed achieve  very

much.  A  Commission  could  clearly  only  concern

itself  with  the  broad principles  of  Government

administration,  and  what is clearly  required  in

relation  to the matter which the hon.  Member  has

raised is a detailed examination so that whoever is

conducting the examination can satisfy us  that  in

any  particular  department or  in  any  particular

office,   the  work  which  that  office  or   that

department has to undertake is being done with  the

greatest  economy of staff, and that all the  staff

are  fully occupied. If the hon. Member will  refer

to  page  64 of the Estimates, subhead 5, Assistant

Secretaries  (Organisation),  he  will   see   that

provision has been made for three officers  trained

in  Organisation  and Methods to be  appointed  for

this  very  purpose of investigating the efficiency

of  the  working  of the different offices.  And  I

would only add to that, Sir, that in regard to  the

additional  posts required for the  Public  Service

year by year, to which the hon. Member referred, he

must  remember that year by year the Government  is

being called upon to do more and more, and in order

to  do what it undertakes to do, it has to have the

necessary wherewithal to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point the hon. Member for Changi raised

was   the  working  of  the  Singapore  Citizenship

Registration  Ordinance.  Sir,  hon.  Members  will

remember  that  the  provisions  inserted  in  that

Ordinance   were   designed   to   facilitate   the

registration of the largest number of people in the

shortest possible time, with a view to drawing up a

new  electoral register for the elections which  it

was  thought  at  that time would  be  coming  very

shortly.  Every  country  which  provides  for  the

naturalisation of persons not born in  the  country

always conducts enquiries into the application made

by  any  particular  individual.  It  is  a  normal

practice  to provide also for referees or  sponsors

from   responsible  citizens  who  are   themselves

citizens  of the country. In this particular  case,

all applicants who filled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



up  a  form which, on the face of it, complied with

the   provisions   made  in  the  Ordinance,   were

registered without further ado. But it was intended

at  the time when the Ordinance came in, that there

should be a review of the registrations made during

the first three months, and it was for that purpose

that  the provision was inserted in section  26  of

the  Ordinance  to  enable the Chief  Secretary  to

revoke the citizenship within twelve months of  the

registration; but it was also made quite clear that

that was no bar to a further application at a later

date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of books which have been

banned  under the ban imposed on certain publishing

houses, I can assure the hon. Member that the  work

is  being  carried  on with the  greatest  possible

speed.  It is being done in consultation  with  the

importing  houses concerned who, by agreement,  are

acting  on  behalf  of all the  bookshops.  Certain

figures which I gave at a recent meeting show  that

there  are  some 500 books which have already  been

exempted, and I will try and ensure that that  work

does proceed with the greatest expedition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third point which the hon. Member raised

was  the  question  of the South-East  Asia  Treaty

Organisation.  This matter, in which  he  was  also

supported by the hon. Member for Telok Ayer,  seems

to  me  to  be reopening part of the Constitutional

Agreement  reached  in  1957.  It  is  specifically

provided  in  that  agreement (the  report  of  the

Constitutional  Conference),  and   it   has   been

reflected in the provision made in the Constitution

that the United Kingdom Government should have full

and  free  use  of  the Base in Singapore  for  the

discharge of her defence obligations.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am quite sure that all of us, as the

hon. Member for Changi has said, would be very glad

if  there was no cold war and, indeed, if we  could

avoid  getting caught up in it. But I am afraid  we

cannot  deny  its existence, nor can we  deny  that

certain  obligations have to be accepted by certain

countries, of which the United Kingdom is  one,  to

try  and ensure that the cold war does not get into

a hot one, or that the potential aggressive designs

of other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



countries should not be allowed free rein. This  is

a  matter which has been discussed fully and agreed

in  the  Constitutional Conference, and  I  do  not

think that there is any question of reopening it at

this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also referred to the question of

Afro-Asian    meetings   and   representation    by

Singapore.  I  am  not  sure  whether  he  has  any

particular meetings in mind, but I would  only  say

on   this,   that  when  it  comes   to   attending

international    conferences    or    international

meetings,   it  is  customary  to   wait   for   an

invitation.  I  am not aware of any  invitation  of

this  kind  which the Government has  received  and

which  has  been turned down. I would  also  remind

him, in connection with sending representatives  to

conferences  of  this  kind,  of  the  considerable

criticisms this Government has received  from  time

to time from the hon. Member for Telok Ayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tiong Bahru referred to the

item  for rent on quarters. That item, Sir  was  no

doubt considered by the Estimates Committee;  I  do

not  expect  that money will have to be spent.  The

only  matter of doubt on this question  of  housing

has  been  recent,  and may  still  be  during  the

forthcoming year -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $7,248,140 for Head 8 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 9-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move the

amendment standing in my name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 9 be reduced

by  $10  in  respect  of item  (1)  of  subhead  1

therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been speaking on this subject from

year to year - I see some people opposite me smiling.

I  consider the Department of Broadcasting a  haven



for  white  men  who are drawing  big  salaries.  A

reduction  of salaries or a reduction of  personnel

could be made.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



This  would result in economy and lessen the burden

on the taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only recently that we hear that Singapore

will  be running its own broadcasting, and that  it

may  be  run on a commercial basis. I would suggest

to  the incoming Government that, instead of making

the  Department a burden on taxpayers, they  should

make it self-supporting and revenue earning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to enquire from the present

Government  as to how many expatriate officers  are

now  on  the  staff  of Broadcasting  and  in  what

grades;  how  many  local men have  been  sent  for

training  overseas, and when can they  replace  the

expatriate  officers,  so that  the  Department  of

Broadcasting can be run by local men.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the

question  of  broadcasting,  a  question  has  been

tabled  regarding the deletion of certain  dialects

from    news   broadcasts.   I   understand    that

representations  have  been  made  to   the   Chief

Minister  and the Chief Secretary on that  subject.

We  have had a reply from the Ministers saying that



the  representations will be considered, but up  to

today  we  have  had no clear-cut  views  from  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the Chief Secretary that

Radio Malaya, or broadcasting, exists for one  very

important  function and that is to keep the  people

informed of what the Government are doing, and  all

the  important  things that are happening  in  this

country.  Now,  that  is of the utmost  importance.

After    that   come   cultural   or   entertaining



broadcasts.  But  we  must  always  remember   that

broadcasting exists primarily for the communication

of  ideas - important ideas which affect  the  people

most intimately. If we take away that aspect of its

function, then Radio Malaya, or any other medium of

broadcasting, is no more than any ordinary form  of

entertainment,  like that of a  cinema  or  even  a

concert.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of informing the people, it is

important that news broadcasts should reach out  to

all  types of people. I venture to suggest that  if

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



cut  down trivial entertainment broadcasts so  that

the  time may be saved for more broadcasts of  news

items  it will serve a much more useful purpose  to

the  people.  It  is no use if a  small  number  of

people know a great deal of Government affairs  and

the  rest  of the people are excluded from  knowing

what  Government are doing or are  trying  to  tell

them. News that is important should be conveyed  to

one and all, and not to selected people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations on this matter have been made to

the  Government by responsible people and  by  very

many   important   guilds  and  associations.   The

Ministers  have  given their reply that  they  will

consider  this matter. I hope they have interviewed

all  the  representatives so  as  to  get  a  clear

picture  of what the people want. I certainly  hope

that the Government will not ignore their pleas and

their  representations and do away with this aspect

of  broadcasting which might keep them informed  of

what  the  Government are wanting to  do,  and  co-operate with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I rise to

endorse the speech delivered by the hon. Member for

Serangoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us recollect the question I raised at

the  last sitting of this Assembly when I asked the

Chief Secretary on what grounds the Government  had

decided to cut down the news item in the vernacular

dialects.  I  was  astonished  to  hear  the  Chief

Secretary say that it had only been decided to  cut

the   news   item,   but  that   the   period   for

entertainment still remained the same.  This,  Sir,

is  indeed  astonishing. For what purpose  are  the

Government  running the Department of Broadcasting?

Is  it  solely to entertain our people? If so,  the

decision   to   continue  with  the   entertainment

programmes  in  Teochew, Kheh,  Hylam,  Foochow  is

correct.  But the Broadcasting Department's  policy

is  not  merely  to entertain the  people,  but  to

inform  the people. The decision to strike off  the

news item is therefore wrong, especially when there

are  more than 200,000 Teochews, Khehs, Hylams  and

Foochow.  Many of them are illiterate. They  cannot

write  or read the newspapers, and the only  source

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



information   for  them  is  from  the   radio   or

Rediffusion.  The policy of this Government  is  to

cut  down  these news items, but they are ready  to

continue  with  the Turf Club broadcasts,  race  by

race, in order to encourage more people to play the

"Wan Tse Piao Chap" which is an illegal lottery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.00 noon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bookmakers actually have to pay a big reward

to  the Broadcasting Department for helping them to

run an illegal lottery and have illegal bookmaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government really consider that

broadcasting time is insufficient, why do they  not

increase broadcasting time by having two shifts  of

workers? Instead of finishing off at 11 o'clock  at

night, make it 12 midnight and cut down many of the

nonsensical   items   in  the  English   programmes

especially the sexy jazz music.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly oppose the Chief Secretary's

decision  to  cut down the news item broadcasts  in

the     vernacular     units,    despite     strong

representations from dignified and  very  respected

guilds  and associations, as indicated by the  hon.

Member  for  Serangoon. The  voice  of  the  people

cannot be over-ruled just like that!



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I also

oppose  the  closing down of the news broadcast  in

Teochew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, the Teochew

community, I was told in this House, is  more  than

200,000 and it would really be a pity if they  were

to be cut off from broadcasting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. Member for Changi has mentioned, if

the main idea of broadcasting is for entertainment,

then,  Sir, it does not make much difference.  But,

unfortunately,  the  purpose  of  having  a   radio

station is to provide an information service  which

will tell the people actually what is going on.  So

if this medium of Chinese dialects were cut off, it

would  be  very  difficult for the  masses  of  the

Teochew community to know what is going on all  the

world over and, in particular, in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government should reconsider this

matter very carefully before they decide to cut off

this  Teochew  dialect, which is one of  the  other

dialects they want to cut off.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  get  a reply from the Hon, the Chief Secretary.

The  collection from broadcast listeners'  licences



in  the year 1957 was $1,135,000; in the year 1958

it is $1,129,000; and in 1959, it is expected to be

$1,213,400.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I cannot understand, Sir, is that year in

and year out this figure remains almost the same. I

am  quite sure we sell more radio sets in Singapore

today,  or  every  year that passes,  and  yet  the

figure  remains stationary. There is no improvement

at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talking about Teochew broadcasts, I, for one,

will  support  its retention. I am a radio  dealer,

Sir, and I know with certainty that 60 per cent  of

the  purchasers of radio sets from me are from  the

Teochew  community and, in their  applications  for

licences,  they  stated that they  wanted  to  hear

Teochew  broadcasts.  I can vouch  for  that,  Sir,

because I have been in the trade since 1946.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, the

hon. Member for Telok Ayer raised the matter of the

future  of  Radio Malaya which, as he informed  the

House, has been his practice year after year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, this is not a matter on which I can

commit  an  incoming government;  but  the  present

policy,  as  has been announced, is  to  provide  a

commercial  service  in  Radio  Malaya,  or   Radio

Singapore  as  it  will be then,  with  a  view  to

obtaining revenue which we hope will go some way to

offsetting  the  declining  contribution  from  the

Federation  towards the upkeep of  broadcasting  in

Singapore  as  and when they are  able  to  develop

their own services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out, Sir, that in regard to the

expenditure provided under Broadcasting,  which  he

refers to, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



think,  as  being a burden on the public purse,  he

will  see,  at  the  foot of  page  76,  that  that

expenditure   is  offset  by  appropriate   revenue

through    listeners'    licences    and    through

contributions from the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate in respect of the contribution from

the Federation of Malaya - $2,000,000 - is drawn up  on

the basis which has been in operation up to now, of

adding  together the broadcasting expenses  of  the

two  territories and then dividing or  apportioning

the cost according to the number of licence holders

in each territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial negotiations still being conducted

with the Federation have not yet been completed and

I, therefore, cannot say what the final figure will

be under that head for 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also referred, Sir, to the expatriate staff in

this Department and asked for information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, out of a total figure of 20 expatriate staff

at  the  time  the  Malayanisation  proposals  were

introduced,  the staff is now down to  10  and  is,

therefore,  cut down by 50 per cent  and  this  has

been  kept in line with the scheme set out  in  the

Malayanisation White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are local officers both on scholarships

overseas and also the University of Malaya here for

taking   up   higher   responsibilities   in    the

Department. I am afraid I have not the  figures  to

hand but I will supply them to the hon. Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Chinese broadcasts, Sir, I

would  like  to  reiterate  what  I  said  when   I

announced  this attempt to improve the standard  of

Chinese  broadcasts, that the only  object  of  the

Government  in endeavouring to cut down the  amount

of  time spent on repetition of news broadcasts  is

in  order  to  improve the service for the  Chinese

population as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Member who has spoken in this House, has

spoken  solely on what it is going to mean  to  the

Teochew community if these news broadcasts are cut.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



But  I  have  not heard any word on behalf  of  the

other  communities  for  whom  the  proposals   are

designed to produce a better service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been into the matter further and despite

the  figures which I gave the House at the time,  I

made the first announcement that broadcasts of news

bulletins at present occupy 10½ hours  out  of  a

total  weekly broadcast of 83½ hours, I can  tell

the  House  that  we  will arrange  to  retain  the

Teochew  broadcast - the news broadcast - and, in  fact

that  will  mean - maybe the incoming Government  may

wish  to  review  it -  that  we  do  not  make  any

alteration, at any rate for the time being. We will

not  make any change for the time being in  respect

of the present Teochew broadcasts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested, Sir, that it was important that

broadcasting  should  be  used  for  cultural   and

educative  purposes rather than for  entertainment.

Here  again,  Sir, I pointed out when I  made  this



announcement  that  the  object  of  revising   and

reforming  the  present Chinese broadcasts  was  in

order  to  be  able  to  give the  opportunity  for

improving the educative nature of these broadcasts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also suggested that it was important that

all  listeners should be able to listen in to Radio

Malaya  in  order to understand what the Government

wanted  to  give them but I would stress  on  that,

Sir, that the Department of Broadcasting is not  an

instrument of Government policy and it  is  not  in

any  way  a  means whereby any particular political

party   which  is  in  power  at  the  time  should

influence   the  electorate  and  those   who   are

listening to broadcasts. Its presentation  of  news

and  other matters should be entirely unbiased  and

impartial  and that is what this Department  always

seeks to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention was made, Sir, of racing broadcasts, I

think.   That  has,  I  am  advised,  ceased   some

considerable time ago and has not been renewed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also suggested by the hon. Member for

Changi,  that  we  should improve the  broadcasting

service  by  increasing the hours of  broadcasting,

and I think he mentioned the possibility of working

staff  in  two  shifts. But, in the  light  of  the

criticisms that we have already had from  the  hon.

Member  for Telok Ayer in regard to the expenditure

under  this Head, I think any idea of doubling  the

number  of  programme staff in order to  provide  a

larger  and longer broadcasting service is  clearly

not in the picture, at any rate at the present time

and  having regard to the standstill nature of the 1959 Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude, Sir, by referring, firstly, to

the matter of licence fees to which the hon. Member

for Tiong Bahru drew attention. I have no doubt  he

is  certainly correct in saying that radio sets are

being sold every day, and if they are being used in

Singapore,  then we hold that the owners  of  those

radio sets should take out listeners' licences, and

I  hope  that the listeners themselves would accept

their proper obligation in this respect, because it

is  not  at all easy to chase after and detect  the

unlicensed   receivers.  But  what  can   be   done

certainly will be done and is being done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also point out to the House, in relation

to  the  expenditure of this Department  for  1959,

that  the  estimates do in fact show  a  saving  of

roughly $450,000 on the estimates for 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, there are only five

minutes  to go and I wish to be correct. Just  now,

when  we were talking about the Chinese section  of

vernacular  broadcasting, we  did  appeal  also  on

behalf of the Hakkas, Hylams and Foochows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a person moves about freely in Singapore

society,  he  will know that the Foochows  and  the

Hylams  are commonly connected with work as coffee-shop  assistants, taxi-drivers and  trishaw-riders.

This   very   important  section  of  the   working



community  should not be condemned.  Many  of  them

cannot read and write. So how can they be kept well

informed  of  what  is going on  in  the  State  of

Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore make a last appeal to the Chief

Secretary  to  reconsider the question  of  Chinese

dialect  broadcasts of news items. They should  not

be touched at all.



<br><br>12.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I am glad that the Chief

Secretary  has  given me satisfactory  information,

and  that  he will inform me how many of the  local

personnel have been sent overseas for training. The

whole  object  is that Singapore should  run  every

Government  department with local men.  That  will,

firstly,  give  them employment and,  secondly,  it

will cost less in salaries and the expenditure will

be  greatly brought down. If this is done in  every

Government    department,   and   not    only    in

Broadcasting,  it will help to reduce  taxation  to

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving many amendments. It is

immaterial whether they are withdrawn or  defeated.

Why I bring them up is to get information, and this



is the occasion for Opposition Members to do so, by

moving  amendments. In any case, the Government  is

ending  within the next three or four  months.  The

other reason why I started all this discussion  was

to  give  the incoming Government an idea  of  what

they ought to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I withdraw this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the sum of $3,238,490 for

Head 9 stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I have certain figures for the

hon. Member -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Hon. the Chief Secretary

is  now too late. He should not have agreed to  the

withdrawal  of  the  amendment.  Perhaps  he  could

supply  those figures to the hon. Member after  the

sitting?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> May I say something further, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On the general aspect of

broadcasting, certainly. We are now on the  general

aspect. Is it in answer to the Member for Changi?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Hon. the Chief

Secretary is too late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I might explain the procedure. If the

Hon. the Chief Secretary had a reply to be given to

the  speakers, he ought not to have agreed  to  the

amendment being withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, of course, is in the hands of the

Member  who moved it, and his reason in asking  for

leave  for the withdrawal of the amendment is  that

he  is  satisfied that what he hoped to  raise  has

been amply answered and therefore he asks leave  to

withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any hon. Member was not satisfied that the

questions  raised on the amendment had  been  amply

answered, then it was up to him to say "No" when  I

asked  the  Question, "Is it the pleasure  of  hon.

Members  of the Assembly that the amendment  should

be withdrawn?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are on the main Head - Broadcasting - and if

any hon. Member wishes to speak on any other aspect

of Broadcasting, he can do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,238,490 for Head 29 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we should now suspend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $9,108,730 for Head 11 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I spoke on

this subject during my Budget speech and I want  to

elaborate a little further on what I said  at  that

time,  and that is this. Singapore is a small city.

We  were formerly spending a lot on naval and other



services. At that time, Singapore was most advanced

politically  and we thought that it  would  be  the

first to achieve independence, as we had the system

of  elected Members whose number was increased from

6  to  9,  and  now  to  25.  As  it  happens,  the

Federation has achieved independence and  Singapore

still  remains a Colony. The burden of defence,  or

the responsibility for defence, is not on us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the last Budget sitting, it was I and

many others on this side of the House who said that

all  naval expenses should be scrapped. We  made  a

lot of arguments and, with the reasons advanced, we

are glad that this is no more our responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the modern world, a small city like

Singapore, in the event of an attack, cannot  stand

alone  or defend itself singlehanded. Even the  big

countries -  both  the Western democracies  and  the

Russian  bloc - have pacts with other  countries.  No

one  can simply stand alone today. Recently we have

seen  what has happened in Egypt, Jordan,  and  the

Lebanon  and many other countries where the  United

Nations  have  come  to  their  aid.  Then  is   it

worthwhile  to  have  such a heavy  expenditure  on

defence services? One thing is certain, and that is

that we cannot defend ourselves from air attack  or

any  other attack. We are a small city and  have  a

small population. Then why spend so much on defence

services  and  also on the capital  cost?  I  would

advise the incoming Government to scrap the maximum

expenditure. After all, the Budget stands for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



three  or  four months and no more. The framers  of

the Budget will not be there too!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might explain about the cutting of salaries, if

you  will  permit me. What I said this  morning  is

that  it  is an honour to be elected Chief Minister

or  a  Minister  but what is the use  of  replacing

expatriates who came from 8,000 miles with our  own

men  if our own men cannot reduce the burden on the

taxpayers? That is the gist. For, after  all,  Sir,

each  one  of us knows what is our expenditure.  If

anybody  brags, income tax returns and prewar,  war

tax  returns  are there. Death duties  records  are

there - what they inherited and what they have. So  I

think there should only be reasonable salaries  for

our elected Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I rise to speak on

defence,  but the line I am taking and  the  course

adopted  is  quite different from  the  Member  for

Telok Ayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me it is a sheer waste of time to argue

and debate about how much money is spent on defence

and  on  which item we should keep on  spending.  I

would  like to ask this House whether the time  has

now  arrived  for us to consider whether  Singapore

can  be defended, and also whether Singapore should

be  defended. In other words, Sir, whether to  take

the  course to make Singapore an open city with  no

fear of any type of war or the threat of war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, merger with the Federation seems very far

away.  Singapore has to look after herself. And  if

Singapore can be made an open city, Sir, I  do  not

think  that we have much to worry. As a Switzerland

of   the  East,  Singapore  can  naturally  attract

wealthy  investors who will know that Singapore  is

the  safest place in the world besides Switzerland.

It  is an open city without any fear of war or  the



threat of war. Sir, I am supporting this motion and

even  our new Constitution clearly states that  the

defence  of  Singapore  is  in  the  hands  of  Her

Majesty's  Government.  Therefore,  why  should  we

still have an item called Defence?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I purposely want to emphasise that we have

now  arrived at the stage Where the Government will

work  towards  a policy to make Singapore  an  open

city  as  well as a free port. Whether merger  with

the  Federation is going to be a reality or not  is

of secondary importance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

looking  through the Defence Estimates, I  am  very

glad  to observe that the item for the purchase  of

three  minesweepers amounting to  $15  million  has

been  deleted.  For two successive  years,  I  have

attacked   that  item  as  being  unrealistic   and

unnecessary,  since  minesweeping  is  an  obsolete

method  of warfare. I said that the money could  be

much  better spent on social services.  I  am  glad

that  at  last my views and criticisms  have  taken

effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the items that have been singled out for

attack  by  the Member for Telok Ayer, I  see  that

most  of them are for salaries for our local people

who have been recruited into the Royal Malayan Navy

and  the  Singapore Battalion. Some of the expenses

are  for  the  salaries of expatriate officers  and

they must, I am sure, be for a very limited period.

They  will  only be engaged when it  is  absolutely



necessary for the instruction of our local boys.  I

do not agree that we should pare down on a means of

employment for our local lads, as we know that  the

problem of unemployment is terribly acute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think on the whole the items are realistic

and I support the expenditure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, defence for

a  country,  no  matter how small it  might  be  is

necessary;  but  what i would like  to  touch  upon

today, Sir, is Civil Defence. The Civil Defence, as

you  will see, Sir, has done good work not only  in

war  time  but  also  in peace time.  We  have  had

reports  time  and  again that whenever  there  are

fires and other disasters which need help, they are

always  there the first in service and the last  to

be  recognised. When I say "recognised", Sir,  like

other services, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



will  have  honours bestowed on them - Long  Service

Medals,  Meritorious Service Medals and  so  on - but

the  Civil Defence get nothing and I am afraid  the

Government has, to a certain extent, overlooked the

good  work  done by them. For the past  few  years,

they  have been poorly equipped. I was in the Civil

Defence, Sir, as a top officer for six years. I had

to  pay  all my expenses. That did not matter,  but

what I am talking about concerns the rank and file,

Sir.  They have had only one uniform since the last

six years. I do not know about this year at all. So

I  would  like Members of this House to  know  that

when  they  say that the Government are extravagant

in  their expenditure on defence services, they are

not right. Government have been most stringent with

their money on civil defence, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take

up  the  remarks of the Member for Changi that  the

only  and  obvious  solution  to  the  defence   of

Singapore is to declare it an open city.  It  seems

to  me  very  much  on a par with the  solution  he

suggested  for dealing with the gangsters,  namely,

that you should take them aside and pat them on the

back  and  say,  "Be good boys in future."  if  you

declare  Singapore an open city, the value of  that

declaration does not depend on you. It  depends  on

the people who may have designs on the city and, in

the  light  of current methods of warfare,  I  very

much  doubt whether that is going to give you  much

protection.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's policy on defence as a

whole  in this Budget is in line with the  rest  of

the  Heads of Expenditure; a standstill Budget with

a  certain amount of consolidation, particularly in

the  First  Battalion  of  the  Singapore  Infantry

Regiment.  There  does seem to be some  idea  that,

when  the  new  Constitution comes into  force  and

Singapore  enjoys self-government,  there  will  be

some    radical   chang   in   relation   to   this

responsibility.  I suggest, Sir,  that  this  is  a

mistaken  view.  The  responsibility  for  external

affairs and for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



defence rests now, and has always rested, with  Her

Majesty's  Government in the United Kingdom.  After

the appointed day that responsibility will continue

to  rest with Her Majesty's Government but she will

not thereby he assuming any fresh responsibilities.

They  are there already, and it has always been  an



accepted   practice   that  while   Her   Majesty's

Government in the United Kingdom has to accept  the

strategic  defence of a number of widely  separated

territories  all  over the world, those  particular

territories  have  always made  some  contribution,

however  small,  towards looking after  themselves,

and  Singapore, it seems to me, has a very definite

intered  craft,  and it is very desirable  that  is

quite unrealistic to suppose that Singapore can, so

to  speak,  wash  its hands of the defence  of  the

island from external aggression, or whatever it may

be,  and  to say that it belongs to somebody  else,

because the people of Singapore have a very genuine

interest  in  seeing  that Singapore  is  defended.

Moreover, if hostilities did break out, it is quite



clear  that  there would be a number of matters  in

which  the  Singapore Government would  be  vitally

concerned, such as continuation of supplies.  There

is no reason to suppose that, in any future war, we

should  not have the same type of situation as  has

occurred  in  the past, indeed it is likely  to  be

probably  more  severe,  and  immediately  on   the

outbreak of war, whether it is conventional weapons

used  or whether it is nuclear weapons, there would

undoubtedly   be  an  interruption   of   supplies.

Supplies  might  be  difficult to  obtain  and  the



Singapore  Government would have to  take  whatever

steps  were  necessary  to  try  and  ensure   that

supplies were brought under Government control  and

fairly  distributed, and so on. All  those  matters

which come within the internal jurisdiction of  the

Singapore Government arising out of a state of  war

will  still rest with the Singapore Government  and

they will, in the interests of the people, have  to

take the necessary steps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the size of the contribution made by

Singapore  towards  its own defence,  the  present

figure  rests  at round about 3 per  cent  of  the

Budget



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



as  against 5 per cent for last year, and I suggest

that  no one can reasonably claim that this  is  an

inordinate proportion of the expenditure under this

Head,    particularly   bearing   in    mind    the

corresponding  percentage of  expenditure  and  the

burden  which is borne by, for instance, people  in

the  United  Kingdom  who have  accepted  and  will

continue  to  accept  its very much  wider  defence

responsibilities.  I  would also  suggest  to  hon.

Members  that the defence of Singapore is  a  vital

matter to the Federation, and if we do as we do one

day  look  forward to a merger with the Federation,

it is indeed proper that Singapore should also play

its part and bring a contribution to that merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the Royal Malayan Navy

has  been transferred this year and will, from  the

1st of January, no longer be the responsibility  of

the  Singapore Government. I should mention in that

connection  that  there is one  service  which  the

Royal  Malayan Navy has provided for  us  in  peace

time  while it has been a Singapore Force, and that

is  acting  in support of the Marine Police.  There

have   been  occasions,  and  there  may  well   be

occasions  in  the  future,  when  our  territorial

waters  have  been entered by foreign  gunboats  in

pursuit  of Singapore registered craft, and  it  is

very desirable that the Marine Police, who are  not

a  trained fighting force, should have behind  them

some  support to deal with situations of that kind.

The  Federation  Government have generously  agreed



that  the  Royal  Malayan  Navy  will  continue  to

provide  that  support in so  far  as  their  other

commitments permit, but that does mean that we  are

dependent  on  their  goodwill  and  indeed   their

commitments  towards the Federation will  naturally

increase,  and  the time which they can  spare  for

assisting Singapore will correspondingly reduce. I,

therefore,  suggest that one of the  matters  which

the  incoming  Government may have to  consider  in

connection  with  the defence of Singapore  is  the

need  for some small regular element in the Malayan

Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve for meeting just that

particular situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say a word on the volunteer

forces, and in this connection I should like to say

that  I  know of no foundation whatsoever  for  any

idea  that  the M.R.N.V.R., or any other  volunteer

force is nothing but a centre for drinking, and any

such suggestion is, in my view, a quite unjustified

slur  on a patriotic body of men who, whatever  the

merits  or  demerits of the policy  of  maintaining

those  forces, or whatever their military value  or

lack  of  military value, are devoting their  spare

time  very willingly in this way to the service  of

their country. The volunteer forces, Sir, have,  as

hon.  Members are aware, been now made  subject  to

call-up   for   internal  security  purposes   and,

therefore, they are an additional reserve on  which

the  Government can draw in the event of widespread

internal disturbances which will, of course,  under

the   new  Constitution,  still  remain  the   full

responsibility of the Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other aspect of volunteer service to

which  I  would also like to refer. We have  had  a

number  of  debates  in this  House,  sometimes  on

legislation,  sometimes on motions, in  which  very

considerable  apprehensions have been expressed  as

regards the youth of this City and the way in which

they  are  caught up with the secret societies  and

the  way  in which they are inveigled into spending

their time hanging round corners, coffee shops, and

so  on,  where it is only too easy for them  to  be

drawn into bad habits or indeed into crime. In  the

course  of  these debates, considerable stress  has

been  laid  on  the  need for finding  some  proper

outlet  for  the  energies and spare  time  of  our

youths,  whether it be in youth clubs or any  other

form of organisation, and I do suggest to the House

that  the  volunteer  forces  in  this  respect  do

provide  a very valuable means indeed for  teaching

discipline, self-respect, and a genuine  pride  and

sense  of  service to their country. There  are  at

present, counting the regular and volunteer  forces

together,  something over 9,000 men. Of those,  the

regular  element  is  a very small  element - 600  or

700 - and the balance of those 9,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



are all volunteers, and I do, as I say, suggest  to

the  House  that,  quite apart  from  the  arguable

military  value  of these forces, in  this  respect

they  have  a  very  real value  towards  providing

training for the youths of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Telok Ayer, and I think

in  this he enjoyed the support of the hon.  Member

for  Changi, suggested that in this day and age  no

one  could  stand alone in matters of defence,  and

the  implication  of  that,  if  I  understood  him

correct,  was  to say that since you  cannot  stand

alone, it is no use doing anything about it at all.

There, I entirely disagree with him, Sir. It  seems



to me that is clearly the policy of the ostrich - put

your  head in the sand and take no account  of  the

realities which are going on around you.  The  true

answer  is  that, against the potential  threat  of

outside  aggression,  there  must  indeed   be   an

alliance  and  a drawing together of all  the  free

countries,  and  that each should take  a  hand  in

ensuring  the defence of the whole to the  best  of

its ability and resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just conclude, Sir, by associating myself

with the tribute paid by one of my hon. friends  to

the  Civil Defence organization, and to say to  him

that  I  realise they could indeed do  better  with

more  and with better equipment, the need of  which

indeed  we  have  very much in  mind,  but  in  the

present  state  of our financial  resources  it  is

unfortunately  one  of those needs  which  have  to

wait.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to add three minor points to  what  has

already been said by the Chief Secretary. First,  I

think, out of self-respect to ourselves and to  our

pride,  we should be ready to play our part  should

this  little  island  home  of  ours  be  attacked.

Secondly,  as  all Parties have agreed  to  seek  a



merger  with  the Federation of Malaya,  we  should

also  be  ready, in the event of the Federation  of

Malaya  being  attacked, to go to  her  assistance.

Thirdly,   as  already  mentioned  by   the   Chief



Secretary,  our volunteer forces will  be  a  great

help to the Police, Force for the purposes of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



internal   security.  In  the  event  of   internal

disturbance,  I hope whichever Party  is  in  power

will use the military forces only as a last resort.

We should be able to look after ourselves, at least



to   the  extent  of  looking  after  our  internal

security. Without spending this $9-million  out  of

our  revenue  of  nearly $250-million  and  without

being  ready to die in defence of our island  home,

all  this  shouting for Merdeka would  be  just  an

empty shout.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $9,108,730 for Head 11 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 12-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $208,910 for Head 12 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to raise

one  point  regarding film censorship. The  revenue

derived  from  censoring  films  is  estimated   at

$305,000.  As against this, expenditure is  roughly

$209,000,  which includes a sum of  about  $108,000

which  is paid to the Federation as their share  of

the  revenue,  which means, roughly speaking,  that

each  country makes a profit of about $100,000  out

of  censorship fees. Now the Federation is about to

set  up  their own Board of Censors, which I  think

will take place during 1959. Presumably, therefore,

this payment to the Federation will not continue to

be  made.  If that is so, then the Government  will

make  about  $200,000 on this particular operation.

Apart  from the financial side of the question,  we



would  like  to  know  whether  the  Government  is

contemplating  any  change in policy  or  procedure

when censorship is separate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The film trade does not feel that it should pay

the  existing censorship fees twice,  once  in  the

Federation and once in Singapore, when the  revenue

already  collected  of  $300,000  could  meet   the

expenses in both territories. We would like to know

what  arrangements  have been reached  between  the

Federation  and  ourselves  with  regard  to   this

question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the hon.

Member for Tanglin has pointed out, this is a  Pan-Malayan service and the Estimates reflect that  the

revenue  more than covers the expenditure, and  the

difference  is  apportioned between the  Federation

Government  and the Singapore Government  according

to  the  amount of entertainment tax paid  in  each

territory.  That, Sir, is the present position.  As

the  hon.  Member has said, the Federation,  as  is

understood, are proposing to set up their own  film

censorship organisation, but we have at the present

time  not come to any arrangement with them yet  in

regard to any change in the existing arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards any reduction in the fees charged for

censorship, I think, Sir, that it will be a  matter

for  consideration  by  my honourable  friend,  the

Financial Secretary, in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 31 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that this controversial issue which I

have  initiated looks, especially at this juncture,

not  only  like  an anti-climax to  what  has  been

debated in previous years, but is also very  silly.

Indeed,  it is useless for this House to  hear  the



arguments  for  and against family  planning  being

repeated year after year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I wish to bring out one argument which was

overlooked   in  previous  years.   This   is   our

confidence in the future. I am not prepared  to  go

into  detail into the merits or demerits of  family

planning. What I would like to emphasize,  however,

is the belief, the confidence in the future held by

those who oppose family planning. These people have

been termed a conservative type. The supporters  of

family  planning  have  accused  the  opponents  of

family  planning as being ignorant of and blind  to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



present state of affairs. They say we are blind  to

the  need  to  plan  the growth  of  population  in

Singapore.  They  have argued  that,  in  order  to

provide for more hospital beds and more schools for

our children, family planning is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I put this fact forward. Those who support

family  planning  have  no confidence  in  building

hospital  beds  and  more  schools.  Why   do   the

opponents  of  family planning  hold  the  contrary

view?  Because they have full confidence that  they

can build more hospitals and schools to accommodate

their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have good reasons for my confidence in the

future,  especially at this juncture when everybody

is  shouting  for a merger with the  Federation.  I

wish   to  stress  that  the  opponents  of  family

planning  have  good reasons to  believe  that  the

future is in their hands. Sir, we who oppose family

planning  can run our own affairs. We  can  provide

for   our  means  if  and  when  we  attain   self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population has not risen much since the

colonial  regime.  Now that we are  reaching  self-government, we are beginning to lose confidence  in

ourselves. We say we must stop our population  from

increasing  because our future is not bright.  With

the  mounting  increase  in population,  we  cannot

tackle our social problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I used to advise young persons who liked to

come to me for advice as to whether they should get

married  or not. I simply asked them this question:

"Do  you believe in family planning or not? If  you

believe  in  family planning, you  had  better  not

marry. But if you do not believe in it, you may get

married."  The reason is simple, Sir. A  young  man

who  decides to get married has full confidence  in

himself. He believes that he has reached the  stage

where he can do everything himself. He may even lie

to his fiancee that he can pull down a mountain. We

know  a man usually likes to lie to his loved  one.

He  wants to show that he can do everything to  win



her heart and get married.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think this is the sort of

conversation  we  should hear in a  young  nation,

"For  three  or four years and until I  receive  a

salary of $250 we must not get a baby".



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young nation must have vigorous and

extraordinary confidence in herself, just  like  a

rising  sun from the East. As a young and vigorous

nation,  we know that the future is very dark.  We

know the population of Singapore is one and a half

million.  We know it is only 225 square miles  and

very small. If one knows Manhattan Island which is

in New York City one will not say Singapore is too

small to have one and a half million people.  What

is  the size of Manhattan Island? It is very small

and  yet it can carry millions of people. I do not

think the Americans find that family planning is a

"must"   and   so  must  be  subsidised   by   the

Government.   No,  Sir,  even   in   Britain   the

Government  do  not  subsidise  family   planning.

Therefore, why should it be in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will call him, who supports the Family

Planning  Association in Singapore, a  coward  who

has  no  confidence in the future or no confidence

of a merger with the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I wish to touch on the

Family  Planning Association itself is  that  this

Association  is one of the most distinguished  and

noble   organisations.  Judging  by  the  personal

wealth of its office-bearers, we know that  it  is

one  of the wealthiest organisations in Singapore.

To  many of them, $100,000 is just petty cash.  It



does  not  come  up  to the cost  of  a  piece  of

jewellery or a diamond ring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if all the office-bearers of this

Association  sincerely  believe  that  they   must

contribute  something towards the welfare  of  the

people  of  Singapore, they should  not  come  and

bother  the  House by asking for money.  They  can

easily get the money from their husbands, Sir. If

you  want  to  put  it as a challenge,  there  are

numerous  charitable  organisations  in  Singapore

which  render  a  more  tremendous  and  wonderful

service than the Family Planning Association. Last

year, I mentioned the Blue Cross



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



Association. It wants to be connected with welfare

work. Any fires or any disasters that happen,  you

can  immediately see Blue Cross officials reaching

the  place  much  earlier than the Social  Welfare

Department   people,  Sir.  They  contribute   and

collect    not   only   cash   but   also    other

goods - foodstuffs,   clothing,   everything.   They

provide even cooked meals for the victims.  And  I

have  not  heard  of  the Blue  Cross  Association

coming  to the Assembly and saying, "You  see  our

record.  We served the Geylang fire victims.  This

is  what  we give. Therefore, the Government  must

subsidise us." They do not. The officials  of  the

Blue   Cross  Association  know  they   are   just

performing their duties and that it is up to them,

the office-bearers of the Association, to look for

the  donors,  not  only  in  cash,  but  also   in

foodstuffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I strongly oppose the Government

granting  another $100,000 to the Family  Planning

Association,  especially in view of our  financial

hardship at this juncture, and more especially  as

the  Minister for Education has been forced to cut

down  a  lot of things, like the building of  more

schools. Let him first build more schools and then

Government   can   indulge  in   the   luxury   of

contributing $100,000 to this Association.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to

be  allotted  for  Head 25 be reduced  by  $10  in

respect of subhead 31 therein." Honourable Members

will  have noticed that the hon. Member for  Telok

Ayer has given notice of a similar motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I support

the  hon. Member for Changi's amendment on subhead

31, Head 25. The same amendment stands in my name.

If  I can support him now, then I will not move my



amendment. I hope that will be in order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this subject was discussed last year,

we  had  a full gallery to hear the arguments  for

and   against,  but  now  the  gallery  is  empty.

Possibly  the  Association  know  that  they  will



receive their money and the future lies in the lap

of the gods and the incoming Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member will probably find

the  gallery full tomorrow morning, when  the  item

was scheduled for debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I hope so, Sir! If you like, I

can   continue  with  this  subject  till  tomorrow

morning, but it will not appeal to Members  on  the

Government side!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to this question, Sir, on principle. To

save  a  woman or to protect her health from giving

too  many  births, advice on birth control  is  not

forbidden   in  religion.  But  we  have   received

objections  from  certain  sections  of   different

religions.  Why  should  the  taxpayer's  money  be

spent,  when there are conscientious objections  to

it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do agree that in various countries

associations of this nature have been  set  up - some

on  a  voluntary basis, some by the  Government.  I

think we have to satisfy the taxpayers who pay into

the  revenue  fund and their objections  should  be

upheld.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the Government has a clinic

for  consultation on this subject, that will  serve

the purpose and satisfy the taxpayers because it is

part  of  the health services for giving advice  or

treating the people coming into the clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, is it wise to hand over $100,000 to a

private association over which the Government  have

wry little control? They can spend the money in any

way  they  like.  I do not question  their  motive,

their  integrity  or  their honesty.  But  you  are

parting with the taxpayers' money and giving it  to

a  private body which is doing some work  in  their

own way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has hospitals and clinics, and the

best  solution  to the problem is  to  establish  a

clinic  for this purpose and not to give a cent  to

this Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the hon. Member for Changi that

the  association, as a private body, should not  be

given  such a big sum. There are many other  bodies

giving voluntary help. Why cannot this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



Association  do the same thing? If  they  say  they

cannot  raise  the money, well, that is  their  own

lookout.  We should look to the Government  to  get

the  work  done.  If the Association  cannot  raise

sufficient  money, the major portion of  the  money

should not come from the Government coffers.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Chairman,  Sir, I have discussed this subject  with

the  Chief Minister and he has agreed, as in former

debates on this controversial point, that there can

be a free vote. I therefore second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the arguments in favour of or against this

have  been  advanced in the past  and  I  can  only

repeat  them, but there is no necessity  whatsoever

to do so. I support this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

the hon. Member for Changi to know that I am not  a

member    of   the   Singapore   Family    Planning

Association: neither do I know where the place  is.

But I am no coward when I stand here to say that  I



support family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am taking a realistic view. Sir. To say that

the  Committee  of the Family Planning  Association

are  composed  mostly of members of  the  wealthier

class and that they should be in a position to make

contributions without asking for Government aid, is

in my opinion not right. They have given their time

and  their energy to this work. I believe  they  do

not  live  only on the $100,000 which the House  is

being  asked to approve. But they have  also  drawn

from  their  own pockets whatever expenditure  they

could afford.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Not enough!



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> Sir, I said just now that I

took  a  realistic view, because all these years  I

have  noticed that the housing problem has not been

eased,  in spite of the number of houses that  have

been  built  by  the S.I.T. I also think  that  the

incoming   Government  might  find  difficulty   in

providing  for adequate housing for the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education problem also exists. Sir, a few

months back I got the shock of my life when I  read

a  statement  in  the  Press  that  out  of  16,000

children  only  5,000 would be  allowed  to  go  to

secondary school, and the rest would have  to  find

places elsewhere. It was very nice of the Hon. the

Minister for Education to announce later that those

who   passed  would  be  admitted  into   secondary

schools,  but for those who failed, there is  still

no solution.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Planning Association is doing its

best,  and  although  it may  not,  as  the  people

expect, stop the growth of population, it has, to a

certain  extent,  prevented the  multiplication  of

children  in Singapore. We also know of the  crimes

that  exist here and that, I think, Sir, is due  to

the  fact that we have too many children who  could

not  get  the facility of having a good  education.

First,  because the Government could not give  them



that   facility,  because  they  could  not   build

sufficient  schools; and, secondly,  their  parents

are  poor  and  there are a lot  of  them  who  are

unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I feel it is a sad case today that the

Government  are not rich enough to give the  Family

Planning  Association more money and they  have  to

reduce  the amount to $100,000. They know that  the

Government have not got the money. I hope that  the

incoming  Government will take the right  view  and

give  the Association more money if they can manage

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I  am  really caught unawares. I thought  the

subject would come up tomorrow and I have left  all

my  papers at home. However, I will try my best. In

the  first  place, I support what  the  Member  for

Changi has just said, and I think I will be failing

in  my  duty  if  I do not stand up  and  voice  my

disapproval  of  this  grant  of  $100,000  to  the

Singapore  Family  Planning  Association   for   no

purpose whatever.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Report of the Association for

1957,  some  20,000  visits were  recorded  at  the

various  clinics of the Association.  These  visits

are  different  from  the actual  number  of  women

attending.  Supposing one woman  visited  a  clinic

twice  in  a year, therefore only 10,000 women  had

been  to the clinics; but I am prepared to take  it

that the 20,000 visits were made by 20,000 women.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my estimation I think there were in 1957

at  least  200,000 married women. So you  will  see

that 180,000 of them did not go to the clinics  for

advice  or  treatment. Therefore, how on  earth  is

this Association going to prevent or slow down  the

growth of the population? It is impossible.  It  is

just  like  asking for the moon. So why should  the

Association carry on and waste the ratepayers' good

money?  I have yet to see the Association producing

evidence   to   prove  that  family   planning   or

artificial contraception anywhere in the world  has

ever  been  a  success. There are many institutions

right  here  which deserve more help and  yet  they

have been given a niggardly sum. I suggest that the

$100,000,  instead  of being  handed  over  to  the

Singapore  Family Planning Association,  should  be

distributed  among the more deserving  institutions

in  Singapore, [or instance, the Little Sisters  of

the Poor, the Youth Council and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly oppose this grant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr  Chairman, the hon. Member for Changi  told  us

that  we  must have confidence to face the  future,

instead  of  trying  to help  the  Family  Planning

Association.  I think it is relevant here  to  give

him  some facts and figures and we must face  those

facts and figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another ten years we are going to have a

population  of  two million, of which  one  million

will  be  under the age of 14, all needing  primary

education.   These   one  million   children   will

necessitate the construction of school buildings to

the  tune of at least 2,800 extra schools in  order

to  absorb all of them. At present we have a  total

of  701 schools - that is the latest figure I have up

to the middle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



of  this  year. Of this number, there are  about  6

secondary schools to about 100 primary schools.  If

we are going to have another 2,800 primary schools,

I  do  not  know where you are going  to  find  the

places to build them. We must also have another 180

secondary  schools.  Sir,I have  done  some  quick

arithmetic.  2,800 primary schools at $300,000  per

school   will  cost  $840  million.  180  secondary

schools  at  $750,000 per school will cost  another

$135 million. It means a total of $975 million. Our

total  revenue is only $270 million odd. I  do  not

know how we can raise that amount of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Family Planning Association are not

advocating  birth control, a subject which  may  be

objectionable to certain religions;  but  they  are

only  giving advice to parents who feel  that  they

should  plan their family, or they should not  have

any  more  children,  either because  of  financial

circumstances or health reasons. I do not  see  any

reason why there should be this objection to a mere

$100,000 grant to an Association which give  advice

to   parents  who  can  ill  afford  to  have  more

children.  I  personally feel that this  amount  is

much  too  little. I would like to see a  grant  of

$250,000 to this Association.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, we still

have  23½ hours to go for this subject, and  that

prompts  me  to rise to my feet on the question  of

the  Family Planning Association over a  period  of

four years; and I do so on this occasion in protest

against  the reduction in the grant, for the  first

time  in  four years, from $120,000 to $100,000.  I

would  like  to  know  what  the  reason  for  this

reduction   is.  The  answer  which  the  Financial

Secretary may give may be an obvious one, but it is

not  obvious  when one realises what  a  retrograde

step it is in this very important matter, and I  am

quite  certain from what the Minister for Education

has  already said that if he were on this  side  of

the  House he would support me even more vigorously

than he appears to do now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what in fact has the Family Planning

Association done recently with the $120,000 at  its

disposal this year? The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



figures  I have are that, from an average of  1,600

attendances per month during 1957, they  have  gone

up  to 2,500 in 1958 and reached a record figure of

3,000  in October. In one month there were no  less

than  600  fresh cases to deal with in the  clinics

that have been set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a reduction of $20,000 in the grant, the

good  work  that has been done will  be  stultified

just  when it needs further encouragement and  just

at  a time when the whole movement is getting under

way.  It  is  not only the mothers who  go  to  the

clinics who have to be considered, it is also  what

I  call  the  word of mouth propaganda  that  those

mothers  spread  far wider in the  population  that

counts as well. As I say, I feel this is very  much

of  a  false  economy.  I would  like  to  have  an

assurance from the Government that it is not losing

interest  and withdrawing support from  the  Family

Planning  Association  which,  to  the  extent   of

$20,000,  is in fact true. This indeed is something

which the Government should be tackling itself, and

I   for  one  would  accept  with  equanimity  this

reduction  if Government is going in the next  year

or  so  to  take the whole matter over on a  proper

basis.  The only thing about that would be that  it

would  probably cost very much more than the paltry

$100,000  which  the Association,  as  a  voluntary

association  and with voluntary help, is  doing  at

the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, the whole

debate reminds me of a delightful Malay proverb.  I

may  not quote it correctly because I learnt it  30

years  ago.  It sounds something like  this - Seperti

kodok didalam tempurong - which means, according  to

the Wilkinson dictionary, like a frog, hiding under

a  coconut shell, looking at the sky through a hole

in  the  shell  and  saying,  "That  is  the  whole

heaven."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help feeling, Sir, when I heard the

arguments  put up by some Members before the  House

supporting this reduction, that they have  wilfully

closed  their  eyes  to what is happening  in  this

small  country  of ours. In spite of moaning  about

unemployment  and  the increased  population,  they

still   say  that  there  is  no  need  for  family

planning. My



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



colleague here who sits on my left, usually my good

friend - I do not attack him except on occasions such

as  this - wants proof. What proof can one want  when

an  occasion like this will take years  to  produce

proof?  However,  there is one proof  that  can  be

shown  straightaway, and that is the record of  the

number  of  people who go to the  clinics  to  seek

advice.  As  the  learned Member  for  Tanglin  has

pointed out, the number has increased from about  a

thousand  odd to nearly 3,000 a month. I think  the

record  is  50,000  attendances  for  a  year.  Any

businessman will tell you that if his goods  appeal

to the public, he will get more and more customers.

What   better   proof   than  that - that   so   many



"customers"  have  gone  to  the  family   planning

clinics  and  have benefited from  what  they  have

learnt and received?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far there has only been one cogent argument

against   this   grant  to  the   Family   Planning

Association and that is: why cannot all  this  work

be  done at the Govvernment clinics? Well,  I  have

heard  complaints about long queues and  delays  at

outdoor  dispensaries  and  hospitals.  I  believe,

after  bitter complaints, the position is now  much

better. If we had these 50,000 people going to  the

clinics for advice, God help us!



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to say that some



sections  of  the taxpayers do not approve  of  the

spending  of  public  revenue,  part  of  which  is

derived  from  them, because it  is  against  their

conscience, Sir, is rather confusing an issue which

should be judged purely from its economic angle. It

is  true  that some sections of the public may  not

approve  the  grant  for family planning  purposes,

because  family planning is against their religion.

It  is  also  true that pig rearing is against  the



religion  of Muslims, and therefore it  is  logical

that  they  will  not  approve  any  grant  to  the

Veterinary services which assist in pig-rearing for

food purposes. Similarly, those who are against the

taking  of  life  for  any purpose,  even  for  the

purpose  of  eating, will oppose any grant  to  the

Fisheries Department because this will be used  for

fishermen to catch fish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



for  food purposes. So will the same persons oppose

a grant for dog-shooters, which also appears in the

Estimates.  Then again I take it that  the  Muslims

will  probably  oppose utilising any  part  of  the

revenue  derived from liquors, because the drinking

of alcohol is against their religion, and therefore

any  part of the revenue derived from alcohol which

is  sold for drinking purposes should logically  be

opposed  by  them, if that revenue  is  applied  to

purposes  which  are of benefit to the  schools  to

which  the  Muslims go. Therefore, I say that  that

issue should not be confused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A government runs the country not on the basis of

the likes and dislikes of any particular section of

the  community, but rather on the good of the whole

community  as  such. Personally, I  have  no  views

either way on family planning. I do not support it,

neither  do  I  oppose it, but I  think  it  is  an

economic necessity in the circumstances that we are

in today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to that, the Member for Changi said

that  Singapore  is not too small to  hold  a  much

bigger  population than it is holding now,  and  he

mentioned  the  Island of Manhattan which  holds  a

much bigger population. That is quite true, Sir. In

size,  Singapore  may not be too  small.  It  could

probably  hold  two or three times the  population,

but  what  the Member has not foreseen is that  the

economic necessities of the situation dictate  that

the  population of Singapore should be  limited  to

the  size  where  our economic resources  would  be

capable of taking care of that population.  Now  he

has many times spoken on our economic difficulties:

the  unemployment problem which is growing  day  by

day;  and also, Sir, hon. Members on the Opposition

side have belaboured constantly Government spending

so  much  money that, as a consequence,  taxes  are

raised,  because the money has to  be  found.  That

money  has to be found for what? For providing  the

necessary  educational, medical  and  other  social

services for an increasing population. Now if  that

population goes on increasing and we have  not  the

resources to provide for that increase, what arises

then? You will get a lot of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



hooligans    and   vagrants   amongst   school-age

children, because Government cannot provide enough

educational  facilities, and so on, and  you  will

get,  as during the Occupation period, sick people

lying  in  the streets. I am sure the hon.  Member

must  have seen them during the Occupation period,

because  there were not enough medical  facilities

to  cater  for  them. Therefore,  family  planning

becomes an economic necessity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is not the size of Singapore that is

dictating   family  planning  but   the   economic

necessity.  Sir,  how has that economic  necessity

arisen?  The  Member  for Tanjong  Pagar  is  very

clever in his analysis of any situation, but he is

not  here  at  the moment to give us  a  brilliant

analysis.   The  economic  necessity  has   arisen

because  of  this: God made earth for  mankind  to

inherit.  But does mankind inherit the  earth,  as

mankind?  It  does not. Today we find  a  part  of

mankind has taken big chunks of the earth - hundreds

of  thousands of square miles - and reserved it  for

themselves,  leaving  the other  part  of  teeming

humanity  in  countries  which  are  not  able  to

support  them:  for instance, Java, China,  India,

Japan,  and  so on. Yet we have examples  of  vast

continents  having a population that is  not  even

one-tenth of the continent's capacity to hold that

population - all  reserved  for  certain  groups  of

people  who  thought that God  intended  that  the

earth should be inherited by them only and not  by

the  others. Now that is the real reason  for  our

economic plight today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Australia recently, I was asked by

many people, "What do you think if the immigration

quotas are relaxed for Asians?" I said, "It  is  a

jolly good idea. If you do that, I am sure that  a

lot  of  the  antagonism which some of the  Asians

have against Australians will be removed." I think

that  is  the  background to the whole  situation - that the teeming humanity in certain parts of  the

world  is confined within small land masses  which

have  not  the  resources  to  provide  for  them,

whereas  vast tracts of land - hundreds of thousands

of  square  miles, which can hold  ten  times  the

population that they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



now - are  lying fallow; and therefore if the  world

can come to an agreement whereby these vast tracts

of land can be opened up to the teeming masses who

cannot provide for themselves, because their  land

cannot  provide enough resources, then we  do  not

need  any  family planning anywhere in the  world.

But  until that happens, it is necessary for small



countries like Singapore with limited resources to

try  and limit their population, because there  is

no  other  way out of these economic difficulties.

The well-off countries have to realise that sooner



or  later a situation is going to be brought about

where  they  will have to open up and they  cannot

keep  their  doors closed. In the meanwhile,  they

are  trying  to  put off that evil day  by  giving

assistance under this plan and that plan,  and  so

on. It is all very well - as I said to somebody, "I

have not come to the United States to beg. If  you

give  us assistance, it will be as equals, but  no

begging  from  anybody." They  have  realised  the

situation  and they are trying to avoid  the  evil

day.  I  do not know how long that can be averted,

but  it  is  exercising the minds of  many  Asians

today. Hence this bitterness today amongst certain

classes  of  Asians. The only way by  which  these

vast  lands could be opened up is by going to war,

and  we  want to avoid war at the moment,  because

war is not going to benefit anybody today - not with

hydrogen  and  atom  bombs being  let  loose.  All

humanity  will suffer or be killed if they  go  to

war.  Therefore, the only way for us to do  is  to

limit  our population until such time as the other

people  see reason and realise and open  up  their

countries themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hold no brief for the Family Planning

Association,  but  that is  the  only  Association

today doing such work; and because it is the  only

Association and because Government is not directly

giving any family planning assistance, that is why

it  has to give a grant to that Association. I  do

not  know whether the money is being wisely  spent

or  not. I have not gone into the details  of  how

the  Association works, but because it is the only

Association,  there  is  no  other  way  out   for

Government but to give it a grant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

how  many  of us know this Chinese proverb "Cutting

the  foot  to suit the shoes." Suppose  a  boy  has

grown  up very quickly, and he tells "Pa, my  shoes

are  too small." And then his father replies,  "Cut

out  your  d - toes to fit the shoes." Do  you  think

that that is the attitude for the father to take?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must have misunderstood

the hon. Member, but I do not know whether the hon.

Member used a word which is not really used in  the

Assembly beginning with 'd'. If he did, I will  ask

him to withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I beg to withdraw it. I

said,  "Cut short your foot and then you  can  suit

your shoes. Your foot is too big. Therefore cut  it

out.  Papa will be able to save money. There is  no

need  to buy a pair of new shoes." Sir, we must  be

grateful  to the Minister for Education for  having

given   us  wonderful  figures  concerning   school

buildings  and how much they will cost. I  am  also

very  grateful  to  the Minister for  Commerce  and

industry. This is the first time he spoke  in  this

House  as  an  expert  on mankind!  He  gave  us  a

classification  of  mankind; he  talked  about  the

shortage of land and this and that. But I am  sorry

to  say that both the Ministers show that they have

no  courage  to face the future. They also  do  not

have  the  courage  to  face  a  merger  with   the

Federation  of Malaya. We are going  to  have  vast

lands  very soon. They also do not have the courage

to  face  the  advancement of science.  Sir,  human

beings  have  succeeded in conquering space.  Human

beings  have been able to produce millions of  tons

of explosives to kill human beings. So it is only a

matter of policy - how to divert the wonderful  brain

of  man  into  productive rather  than  destructive

channels.  Then the population question can  easily

be  solved.  If you have kept in very  close  touch

with  British economic progress, I am sure you will

know that they have discovered a means whereby they

could   extract   energy  from  sea   water.   That

discovery, I think, is a year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



old.  It  is called Zeta. If we are able to extract

energy  from  sea  water instead of  from  fuel  or

firewood why should we worry about the future? If a

responsible  parent has the courage and  confidence

to  provide all the necessities for his family  why

should he worry about the future? He will not  say,

if  his  family keeps on getting bigger and bigger,

"Cut down the expenditure on clothing. Cut down the

food  expenses, because your daddy's income is only

$200  a month." Or "Because another baby is coming,

therefore there will be extra expenditure on milk."

If  the  parent thinks like this, if  he  does  not

think of any other means to try to solve the family

problem;  if he just only hopes that the  new  baby

does  not suck milk; if he just waits for his other

sons and daughters to cut down their food ration in

order to save on food, then he has no confidence in

himself. It is not the right attitude to take  that

because his salary will not be increased until next

year, therefore he cannot afford to have a baby,  a

new  member  of  the family this year.  That  is  a

defensive attitude. I do not think it is the  right

attitude  for every responsible man who  should  be

able to shoulder the burden of having a family.  On

this moral ground I strongly oppose the grant.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, with your permission, I

think we will have to continue the debate tomorrow,

because there is a lot of time still left for  this

Head.  If  you like, Sir, I will say  a  few  words

until four o'clock.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That depends entirely on what the

hon.   Member  wishes  to  say.  Is  it  on  family

planning?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir, because I have an

amendment on this subject on the Order Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole question is whether Mr and Mrs

Singapore should have children. If they think  they



should have and there are many, what will happen to

them? How will they be accommodated? How will  they

fare  economically? The question before the  House,

as far as I am concerned, is this: Do not give away

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



a private association such a big sum of money,

because some members of different religions are

objecting.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.

of Supply has made progress in the consideration of

the Bill and beg leave to sit again tomorrow.
