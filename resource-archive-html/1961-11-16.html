from the United Kingdom Commissioner with reference

to  his  speech made in the Assembly on 20th  July,

1961,  in  support of his motion, "That this  House

expresses  its  confidence in the Government",  and

whether he will indicate its nature and contents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as  I  said  in  my radio broadcast  of  27th

September this year - and I quote my words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The British have more experience in dealing with

such  delicate  situations. Whatever  embarrassment

our  exposure caused them they have said absolute]y

nothing  and thereby saved themselves from  further

embarrassment."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since this broadcast, I have received no

representation from the United Kingdom Commissioner

with  reference  to my speech in this  Assembly  on

20th July.

<div align="center"><b>MALAYSIA SOLIDARITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Appointment and expenses of Singapore delegate)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister (a)

who appointed the Member for Geylang Serai as a

delegate of Singapore to the Malaysia Solidarity

Consultative Committee which met in Jesselton in

August, 1961; and (b) whether the expenses of the

Member for Geylang Serai in connection with his

visit to Jesselton to attend that meeting were paid

out of public funds and by what authority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Geylang Serai

was  appointed  a  delegate  of  Singapore  to  the

Malaysia  Solidarity Consultative  Committee  which

met  in  Jesselton in August 1961 by the Government

Members  of the Singapore delegation to the  C.P.A.

Conference  in  Singapore in July after  discussion

with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



Opposition Member delegates to the same Conference.

His expenses amounted to $596, and so did those  of

the  Minister  for  Culture who also  went  to  the

Jesselton  Conference. They were paid  out  of  the

Conference  vote under Head 28, sub-head  10.  This

vote  is  under  the  control of  the  Ministry  of

Finance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> The Prime Minister

said  that  the  Government Members  consulted  the

Opposition Members. Did the Prime Minister  realise

that our Opposition Member, the Member for Choa Chu

Kang, was never consulted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we would

have saved ourselves a lot of trouble if Members of

the  new Barisan Sosialis Party had indicated their

stand  on  the confidence motion on 20th  July.  We

asked  them  where they stood: for or  against  the

Government.  They said they were  not  against  the

Government.  Therefore  they  could  not   be   the

Opposition. Now they complain that, in  fact,  they

were   the  Opposition  and  that  they  were   not

consulted.  So they cannot have it both  ways.  Now

that  they are clearly in the Opposition, if  there

is  to  be any consultation, we shall take  in  the

Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  refer  to  what  the  Prime

Minister has said just now. Although I took part in

the C.P.A. Conference, I was not invited to discuss

the  question  of representatives.  Therefore,  the

Government  did  not  have  a  discussion  with  us

regarding  the  choice  of representatives  to  the

Malaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I must make it clear that we

are on supplementary questions. We are not debating

this  question.  But  if  the  hon.  Member  has  a

supplementary question, he can ask it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On the 20th of

July, at a sitting of this Assembly when we debated

the  motion  of  confidence in the Government,  the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang did not indicate that  he

was against the Government; so we presumed that  he

supported it. It was only on the 31st of October



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



that  we  knew he went over to the Opposition.  The

meeting  was  held in August without inviting  him,

because he did not seek contact with us. Therefore,

we were not responsible for that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is

it  the  contention of the Prime Minister that  all

Assemblymen   on   the  Government   Benches   will

automatically   agree   with  Government   policies

whether in principle or in minute details - and

that  without consulting them at the beginning,  he

can  assume  that  they have agreed  with  all  his

policies? If that were so -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

going a little too far. We are now dealing with the

appointment  of  a representative to  the  Malaysia

Solidarity  Consultative Committee.  If  he  has  a

supplementary question on that, he may ask it,  but

not on the wider implications of policy and so on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): A Minister of the

Government  should take notice that he should  hold

consultations with the others.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There again I think we are perhaps

entering into a debate. There does not seem  to  be

any supplementary question to be answered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think our

Party Whip has carried out his duty. Of course,  he

has to inform all Members concerned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Did the Prime Minister inform

the President of the C.P.A. about the matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I was on leave at that

moment,  and  the  Acting Prime  Minister  was  the

Leader  of the House. I do not think he was in  any

way  connected  with the C.P.A. delegates  to  this

Conference.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think we have had enough of debate.

If any hon. Member wishes to raise the question, he

will  have an opportunity either on the adjournment

or in a motion.

<div align="center"><b>NEGOTIATIONS ON MERGER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>WITH FEDERATION OF MALAYA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for Statement)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr

David Marshall -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To ask the Prime Minister whether he will make

a  statement on the subject of the negotiations  on

the  question  of  merger with  the  Federation  of

Malaya,  and  whether the Government will  table  a

Report dealing with the said negotiations.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Having received Cmd. Paper No. 33 of

1961 this morning, my question is answered.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That does not prevent the Prime

Minister from answering it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I add that I shall be

moving a motion in connection with this Paper  when

the contents can be debated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>LEAVE OF ABSENCE OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MINISTERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister (a)

whether  any  Minister has taken leave  of  absence

from  his  duties  since the last  sitting  of  the

Second Session of this Assembly, giving the name of

the   Minister,  the  period  of  leave   and   the

provisions under which such leave was granted;  and

(b)  whether any Minister on leave of absence,  has

received  or  will  be receiving  remuneration  and

allowance as a Minister for the period of leave and

under what provision of the law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Since the last sitting of the

Second  Session  of  this Assembly,  the  following

Ministers have taken leave of absence under section

33   of  the  Singapore  (Constitution)  Order   in

Council:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister - from 25th July to 24th October.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health - from 24th July to 22nd September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs - from 22nd July to 15th September.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance - from 3rd September to 15th September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture - from 23rd September to 8th October.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development - from 23rd October to 29th October.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Minister is on leave, including the Prime Minister, one of his colleagues in the Cabinet acts for him. No Minister is paid any acting allowance. All Ministers receive remuneration as Ministers for

the  leave period. This was also the case from  the

time the Member for Anson was Chief Minister of the

then Singapore Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>MALAY MARKET IN GEYLANG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether  he  will  consider acquiring  a  site  and

building  a  market for Malay stallholders  in  the

Geylang area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on the 7th of December,

1960,   the  Government  approved  a  plan  for   a

comprehensive redevelopment of the site in  Geylang

Serai   for  community  purposes.  There  will   be

provision   for   a  school  with  playgrounds,   a

community  centre,  housing,  local  shopping   and

market, and two open market areas. Land acquisition

proceedings are on the way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation of stalls will be by the Markets

and  Hawkers Department and will take into  account

the   fact  that  this  is  largely  a  Malay  area

patronised  by  Malays in the  Kampong  Melayu  and

Geylang Serai areas. It is therefore reasonable  to

expect  that  the  majority  of  stallholders   are

expected to be Malays.

by  the  Federation  of Malaya  Government  to  the

Singapore  Government in regard to the exercise  of

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether  he  will make a statement  disclosing  the

full  details, within his knowledge,  giving  names

and  identities, etc., of Communists and  Communist

subversive   activities  in  Singapore,   and   his

dealings with them and their activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have, in my first series

of   broadcasts,  sketched  in  broad  outline   my

personal  knowledge  of  the  activities   of   the

Communists and pro-Communists in Singapore. In some

cases,  I have had to name the persons involved  in

order that the truth may be known and not disputed.

It  is not my intention, however, to go on a witch-hunt   and   label  all  the  Communists   I   know

personally.  However,  certain  organisations  like

S.A.T.U.,  Partai Rakyat, and some members  of  the

Barisan Sosialis, have challenged me to prove  that

they  are Communist front organisations. Sir, I  am

accepting  their invitation and will do  so  in  my

second series of broadcasts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So far as is possible, I do not

wish  to identify publicly the persons that I  have

known.  It  is only when not to name these  persons

would  leave a blank in the whole picture and allow

the  Communists to try and cast doubts on the truth

and veracity of my statements that I shall name





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



the   persons   who  are  actually  performing   or

directing  these  Communist  activities.  All  such

persons named publicly will have full rights  under

the law to clear themselves and their reputation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it pleases you, Sir, in view

of  the  fact that to be a Communist is a  criminal

offence  in this area, will the Prime Minister  not

recognise  that it is the duty of a  citizen, even

more  so  the  Prime Minister, to  make  known  his

knowledge of all Communists in this area, at  least

to the police for purposes of prosecution under our

laws?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I think the Member for

Anson, as the first Chief Minister of Singapore, is

fully  alive to the tremendous difficulty that  is

posed  by the silent intimidation of the Communists

and  their  elimination squads of any  witness  who

goes  into open court, or even in camera.  I  have,

therefore,  given the Communists an opportunity  to

allow   them   to  initiate  action   against   the

Government and against myself personally for having

damaged their fair names if they say that they  arc

innocent.  Doubtless they may also  have  consulted

their  multifarious  legal advisers  and  advisers.

Some  of  these advisers have only passed Parts  of

the   Law  Examination.  However,  they  may   well

understand  that  to challenge statements  made  of

them  would  be  to  undergo the rigours  of  being

plaintiffs and giving evidence in person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Member for Anson can well vouchsafe

from  his law and very intimate knowledge of  Court

craft, an innocent man telling the truth can  prove

his  innocence at any time, particularly  since  he

has  available to him the whole panoply of the law,

the best advocates in the land. Some of them, I  am

sure,  are  prepared to do a brief for  nothing  in

order  that justice will be done. I regret to  say,

however, that apart from one proceeding in relation

to  contempt  of court by some 30-odd non-Communist

strikers, there has not been any action on any part

of the talks that I have delivered, I would ask the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Anson  to draw his  own  conclusion - 30

innocent  strikers  who are  now  under  charge  of

obstruction  are  quite prepared  to  assert  their

rights if I have transgressed the law and I have to

submit as if I were a private citizen. So also  can

all the others who say they are innocent. They have

their remedies. They can consult their advisers and

they   can   undergo  the  hazards  of   the   open

confrontation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could

one  anti-Communist hero, like our Prime  Minister,

get  on  so  well with the so-called Communists  in

Singapore for the last six years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, that is the whole point - that I was never an anti-Communist in the sense

that  I  was just anti the Communists. I am a  firm

supporter  of the democratic system. In so  far  as

the  Communists  were with us  in  the  nationalist

movement  to  destroy the colonial  system,  I  was

prepared  to work with them and took my  risk  with

them  for  years. And they knew it. But when  their

policy  is no longer to destroy the colonial system

in  order that the democratic system can be set up.

but to undermine the State in order to establish  a

base  from  which they can communize the  whole  of

Malaya, then I say that the non-Communists and  the

pro-Communists  must inevitably part  company.  Co-existence,  Mr Speaker, Sir, whether it  be  on  a

domestic and national level or on the august  plane

of  international relations, can only  continue  if

there are no massive issues which divide them.  Mr

Nehru  is not an anti-Communist, but that  did  not

prevent him from standing up for what he considered

to be his national rights over the borders of India

against      the      Communists,      co-existence

notwithstanding. Sir, we had served notice, the day

we  moved the confidence motion, that we intend  to

see  merger  and an independent, democratic  Malaya

through.  And those who want to fight  us - be  they

Communists or whatever they may be - cannot expect us

to submit passively and be pulverized. Surely, Sir,

the  most  fundamental right a man has is  that  of

self-defence. A non-Communist does not subscribe to

self-destruction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



Only  fools do that. Sir, if there are still  fools

in Singapore or, if I may be so bold as to suggest,

in  this  Assembly who are non-Communists  and  who

want to go with them and be destroyed, what can  we

do to save them from their own folly?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do forgive me, Sir, it is rather an

important matter. I crave your indulgence.  Sir,  I

can  appreciate  the  Prime  Minister's  difficulty

about  prosecution. He is perfectly  right.  But  I

would   suggest  that  it  is  a  matter  of   very

considerable importance to the public  as  a  whole

that  the  names  of  the  persons  whom  he  knows

actually to be Communists in this territory  should

be disclosed. If the Prime Minister will permit me,

Sir, I myself as Chairman of the Workers' Party  am

to  some extent concerned, because it was suggested

that my Party was infiltrated by Communists.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is, Sir. I would point out, Sir,

that we had sought from the Prime Minister

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was saying that if the hon. Member

goes  on in that strain then, of course, the  whole

matter  is  developing  into  a  debate,  and   the

Standing  Orders tell me that that  should  not  be

allowed.  I can only allow supplementary questions,

and  I leave it to the ingenuity of Members to turn

their statements into supplementary questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, will the Prime Minister

consider   divulging  in  confidence   to   persons

legitimately interested the names of the Communists

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson, as

the Chairman of the Workers' Party, wrote to me and

asked  me to disclose the Communist cadres who  had

been   planted  in  the  Workers'  Party.  I   have

consulted  the  legality of  this  matter.  I  have

written  to the Chairman of the Workers'  Party  in

reply  that if he, who was the first Chief Minister

of  Singapore in 1955, would give us an undertaking

that  he would not divulge this information to  the

Communists concerned and the details of the data we

had  on  them, then I am prepared to ask the  State

Advocate-General to waive the Official Secrets  Act

and  disclose to the Member for Anson all  data  in

connection with Communists in his Party. The  offer

is  made  in  good faith. I am confident  that  any

undertaking given by the Member for Anson  will  be

honoured  and  I  think the State  Advocate-General

will also be confident of that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

was extremely interested to hear the Prime Minister

say  that  only  fools embark  on  political  self-destruction. If that definition is true,  Sir,  the

corollary  is also true - that anybody  who  embarks

upon  self-destruction is a fool. The clearest  way

of  determining whether one is embarking upon self-extermination  is  by  going  to  the  country  and

letting the people decide.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The summary is in the last page.

Head  42,  Official  Assignee and  Public  Trustee.

There  is an amendment standing in the name of  the

Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 42 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, you will notice that these

Supplementary Estimates are required  to  meet  the

increases under Personal Emoluments as a result  of

partial restoration of variable allowances from the

1st  of January this year and full restoration from

the 1st of September. That is not the total figure,

Sir. The total figure is much greater. But the rest

are   offset  seemingly  by  savings  to  meet  the

increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since this Government took

office,  the  issue of the variable  allowances  of

civil  servants  has  been  made  a  headache - a

headache  for  the  Assembly, a  headache  for  the

people,  and most of all, Sir, a headache  for  the

civil service and particularly 6,000 of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I am seeking to ask the

Government  to consolidate the variable  allowances

into  the  pay of the civil service, so that  there

can  be no further reductions. I am not asking that

they should receive one cent more of salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I want is to take the question of the pay of

the  civil servants out of politics. Sir, they  are

entitled to security; they are the very backbone of

our   administration.  In  fairness  I  think   the

Government  will admit our civil service  has  been

reasonably efficient. And frankly, Sir, I  know  of

no other civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



service  in  the  whole of Asia with  such  a  high

standard  of integrity. In many cases, I think  the

Government  will  frankly  admit  that  the   civil

servants  are radically underpaid compared  to  the

responsibilities  we  place  upon   them.   It   is

important  that these human beings,  from  whom  we

expect  so  much, should at least have a  sense  of

security  free  from the possibility  of  political

intimidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to be brief, Sir, but I ask your

indulgence to review shortly the history of  P.A.P.

dealings with the civil service on this one  aspect

of variable allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1959, Sir, this Government took office

through  an  overwhelming vote  of  the  people  of

Singapore, but it was generally recognised that the

English-speaking  population, in  all  probability,

did not vote for the P.A.P., particularly the civil

service.   Before  this  Government  even  appeared

before the Assembly, one of the very first steps it

took  was  to slash the variable allowance  of  the

civil  service. And in His Excellency's  speech  to

this  House outlining Government policy on the  1st

of July, 1959, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The threatened deficit of S14 million for 1959 can

he and will be wiped out and the Government has not

shrunk   from   unpleasant  measures   to   achieve

financial  stability. But such sacrifices  as  have

been  imposed  by way of pay cuts  have  fallen  on

those most able to hear them.'



<br><br>My  reference,  Sir,  for your record  is  Assembly

Debates, Vol. 11 No 1. Col. 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Those most able to bear them', Mr Speaker! How

little did the Government recognise that of all our

citizens,  the honest civil servants are  the  ones

who   budget  most  carefully  according  to  their

incomes, and any radical reduction means very  real

hardship. In any event, Sir, as was pointed by  the

Leader  of the S.P.A. in the debate on the  Address

in  the following year, on the 8th August, 1960, it

transpired  that there was no $14 million  deficit.

There was not even a $1 million deficit. There  was

$9 million surplus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it can be said, Sir, that the Finance

Minister  did  really make so big an error  as  $23

million  in  his  estimate in our inevitably  small

budget, why did the Government not restore the  pay

cuts the moment it was recognised that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  was not going bankrupt? That Singapore,

in  fact,  was stable and was doing very well?  In

fact,  there was a surplus and not a deficit.  Why

did  they not restore the pay cuts? In fact,  Sir,

the  leader of the S.P.A. - more credit to him - moved

in  this  Assembly, on the 8th of August, for  the

restoration  of the pay cuts. But the  Government,

using  its  steamroller  majority,  defeated  that

motion. Sir, it is interesting to remember that in

this  very Assembly, on 21st July, 1959, the Prime

Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What they are bellyaching about is not the

principle  of negotiations. The bellyache  is  the

pay cut.'



<br><br>The  civil  servant could not even moderately  and

constitutionally and legitimately complain about a

pay  cut without being called a "bellyacher". That

was  the  attitude  of  the  Government,  and,  in

fairness.  Sir, it is true to say  that  in  those

debates,   as   I  have  read  them  in   Hansard,

Government  vehemently denied that  the  pay  cuts

were  by  way  of  revenge  against  the  English-educated for not having voted for the P.A.P.  But,

Sir,  what do we see now? From 1st January, after

tremendous  efforts, a partial restoration:  first

to those who agreed that that would be final; then

ultimately to all. And then, Sir, lo and behold, a

miracle  happened! The pay cuts were  restored  in

full   from   the  1st  of  September.   And   His

Excellency,  in his speech to us last month,  said

that  with  merger in prospect it is  possible  to

relax  many  of the stringent measures of  economy

previously  adopted.  With  "merger  in  prospect"

also,  Sir, a vast sum of money will no  doubt  be

voted  to  the Federation, and we would have  less

money to spend. But be that as it may, Sir, merger

is two and a half years ahead, if, and I hope with

all  my heart it does, come to merger. Why  is  it

that  the Government is in such a hurry to restore

the  pay  cuts now? Sir, in this context,  let  us

face another fact of life. In 1959, the Government

could  say,  "We  do not care about  the  English-educated.  It  is  the Chinese industrialists  who

will vote us into power." And they did.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The industrial workers, not

the industrialists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you. I am indebted to the

Prime Minister. He recognises the P.A.P. stand  so

well.  He has aptly and correctly corrected me.  I

accept  it.  "We  do not care about  the  English-speaking; it is the Chinese industrial workers who

will vote us into power." And they did. Today  the

Prime  Minister and, I have no doubt, the rest  of

his  group  are all too conscious that  they  have

lost  the  confidence  of the  Chinese  industrial

workers.  And if they hope to survive, it  is  the

English-educated on whom they are  to  rely.  Sir,

whatever  the  motivations of  the  Government,  I

would suggest that their conduct does give rise to

feelings,  and  legitimate  feelings,   of   fear,

intimidation  and insecurity on the  part  of  the

civil service. I plead, Sir, let us put an end  to

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want them to worry next time we have a

general  election, having learnt their lesson,  if

they vote P.A.P. and suddenly the S.P.A. come into

power - and miracles do happen - may be they will get

another  thrashing.  Let  us  protect  the   civil

service,  legitimate protection which  an  honest.

decent  group seeks. Many of them could  earn  far

more  in  the outside world. They join  the  civil

service  sometimes out of a sense  of  dedication,

but  mostly,  Sir,  because of  their  desire  for

security.  And  I  say, let us protect  the  civil

service from a legitimate deep fear that has grown

from government action of possible intimidation. I

say,  let  us help keep the civil service  out  of

politics. We all recognise that that is  the  only

way  in which they can serve the country best.  I,

therefore,  move this amendment in order  to  urge

the Government to consolidate the pay cuts, not to

pay the civil service more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I thought the motion to  amend  the

vote under Head 42 by the Member for Anson was, in

fact,  related to the administration of the Office

of  the Official Assignee and Public Trustee.  The

Member  for Anson, however, brought up the  larger

issue of variable allowances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he made a number of allegations against the

Government and the Party in power in respect of the

motive underlying this measure. He claimed that the

reduction  of  variable allowances was  an  act  of

political  intimidation.  Sir,  we  know  that  the

Member   for   Anson   is   given   to   oratorical

pyrotechnics. But by no stretch of the  imagination

can this measure be called political intimidation.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, when the P.A.P. was returned to power,

the  prospect ahead of us was by no means easy, it

is  true we had a formidable majority in the House.

It  is also true that at that time we realised that

the  struggle  for power in Singapore  between  the

Communists  and the non-Communists must  eventually

come out into the open. When and over what issue no

one could at that time predict. At that time it was

clear  that  the  Government of the  Federation  of

Malaya would not even entertain the idea of merger.

Singapore,   to  all  accounts,  by  all   possible

forecasts  made by reasoned men at the time,  would

have  to  go it alone for a considerable number  of

sears.  We  are  a small island with no  resources,

with   a   bursting  population  and   a   mounting

unemployment  problem, it is obvious  that,  if  we

were  to  survive  as a going concern,  to  provide

enough jobs for a growing population, there must be

a  tightening of the belt all round. We could do it

voluntarily by deliberate Government policy, or  it

could  be  imposed through the sheer hard facts  of

economic processes. We decided at that time that we

must  lay  aside as much savings as  possible  from

current  income  in order that we  could  have  the

resources  to mount a substantial rate  of  capital

development to ensure that the economy expands fast

enough to give jobs for the growing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is so elementary a principle in

economics  that  I do not think I need  labour  the

point.  When it comes then to tightening the  belt,

it  is  only  proper that those in  the  Government

should  provide  leadership,  in  particular  civil

servants in the higher income bracket.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson claims the civil

service  has  high  standards. I will  not  dispute

that.  I have already paid my compliment in  public

to  the integrity and effectiveness, within limits,

of  our  civil service. But he claims that, by  and

large,  they  are  underpaid.  Sir,  this  I   will

dispute. There are certain categories - professional

men - in short supply for whom even the present  rate

of  pay in Government service will be inadequate in

comparison  with  what they  can  earn  in  private

practice. That is conceded. But the fact that in  a

few  occupations members can earn more  in  private

practice  than  in  Government  service  does   not

entitle  one  to generalise over the inadequacy  of

pay  in  the whole civil service. I would say  that

there  are a priori grounds for believing that  the

rate  of  pay  in civil service from the  long-term

point of view is too high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that the pay of local civil

servants  has been geared to the pay of  expatriate

officers.  The  basic  pay  is  the  same  and  the

variable  allowances are the same.  The  expatriate

officer  gets some $200 to $250 more as  expatriate

allowance.   In   respect  of  the   higher-ranking

officer, the difference between the pay of a  local

officer and his expatriate counterpart may be about

10 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the factors by which we can assess

whether  the  level of pay is adequate  or  not  is

surely whether the country can afford that rate  of

pay. One of the criteria we can apply is the wealth

of  the  country. How does Singapore compare  with,

say  Great  Britain, in regard to national  wealth?

How  does  our  per capita national income  compare

with  that  of  the  British  per  capita  national

income? Sir, I can assure you that we certainly  do

not  come anywhere near 90 per cent of the  British

level.  Then,  on  those general considerations,  I

would  say  that  the statement by the  Member  for

Anson that our civil service is underpaid cannot be

sustained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to the present situation in the market for

the  services of civil servants, it is, of  course,

highly  abnormal. Malayanisation has been going  on

for  some  years.  There has been an  abnormal  and

large demand for administrators, technicians and so

forth to man the civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



service posts that were once occupied by expatriate

officers.  But  this  is only  a  temporary  phase.

Eventually,  these  posts will be  filled  and  the

demand  for civil servants will find its own level.

It  is  only when we reach that stage that  we  can

really  come to a proper assessment whether or  not

we   are  overpaying  or  under-paying  our   civil

servants.  Therefore, until we  reach  that  point,

there  is no question of consolidating the variable

allowances  now being paid to civil  servants  into

the basic salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has seen fit, in the

course of his remarks, to discourse on the P.A.P.'s

attitude  towards  the  English-educated.  He   has

claimed  that  we  have lost  the  support  of  the

Chinese-speaking  industrial  group  and  that  our

survival  depends  on getting the  support  of  the

English-educated. Sir, it is obvious that the ideas

of  the  Member for Anson on matters  of  political

strategy are exceedingly innocent, because that  is

not  the way you calculate things; that is not  the

way  in  which you decide your policy. The English-educated,   in   terms  of  voting  strength,   are

unimportant. They may amount perhaps to some 15 per

cent of the total electorate. Their contribution is

not  the  manner  in which they  cast  their  votes

either for one Party or one programme or the other.

That is not the decisive function they fulfil. They

have  a role to play. This we had stated right from

the  beginning before we formed the Government, not

merely  after  we  formed  the  Government.  It  is

certainly not after the defection of members of our

Party  to  pro-Communist groups. We have said  that

the English-educated are, in a sense - and only in  a

sense - the prototype of the future Malayan,  because

he  has  transcended the communal barriers, whether

he  be a Malay, an Indian, a Chinese or a Eurasian.

He  has a feeling of group identity that transcends

communal  barriers.  He has also  absorbed  certain

values of personal liberties which are essential in

the running of the democratic system. But where  he

has  failed is that, in the course of events  under

colonial  rule,  he  has  occupied  a  position  of

privilege  as  regards job, income  and  career  as

against other groups. To that extent, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



has isolated himself from the other sections of the

community.  We,  of the P.A.P.,  have  always  been

saying that the role of the English-educated is  to

get  out  of  the  state of isolation  and  provide

leadership,  ideas and organising  ability  in  the

movement  to  create a new Malaya. To say  that  we

have reduced the variable allowance as a measure of

retribution  against  the English-educated  because

they  did  not vote for us in the general elections

is,  I think, something that is too foolish to need

justification.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, it is pitiful to see the

Minister  for  Finance humming and hawing,  shilly-shallying, trying to defend himself -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I remind the Member for

Queenstown   that   there  are   such   things   as

parliamentary language, decorum and dignity?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is good to see the Minister

for  Finance trying to enumerate the virtues of the

civil  service  and  the English-educated.  Let  us

remind  them  that  only two years  ago  the  Prime

Minister  said  this of the civil service  and  the

English-educated,    "If    nothing    else    more

catastrophic happens to the civil service than  the

loss  of their allowance, then they should go  down

on  their  bended  knees and  thank  the  gods  (or

something  to  that effect) that their  souls  have

been  spared."  These are words not of  people  who

really  respect the English-educated and the  civil

service.  Now,  when they realise  that  they  have

really   lost  the  support  of  all  the  Chinese-educated, they are hoping to catch some votes  from

the  English-educated. They go along to  hand  back

the  pay  cuts. Everybody knows that this so-called

prospect of the so-called merger has nothing to  do

with  what is happening. Why must they bring merger

in?  Do  you think the people can be easily fooled,

that  they  will support that type of  merger  just

because  they get back a little bit of the pay-cut?

They  must  go  back  to  school  again  and  study

psychology.  Why?  [Interruption.]  Yes,  that   is

correct, Sir. The Minister for Finance should go to

Woodbridge and take a course there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also interested in the fact that neutrality

has  been mentioned about the civil service. We are

all  interested  in  the neutrality  of  the  civil

service.  The Prime Minister himself has said  that

the civil service should be neutral. Yet only a few

days ago we heard a civil servant talking over  the

radio about merger. What right has he to talk about

merger?



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I have had occasion in

the  past to indicate to hon. Members that speaking

in  a  loud voice - to put it very mildly - is not what

one would expect in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My apologies to you. Sir. But

anyway  this is no neutrality of the civil service.

Why do they make use of the civil servants to fight

and  speak for them over Radio Singapore? They  are

misusing  the  facilities  of  Radio  Singapore  to

propagandise their own way of merger. Let  us  tell

them that if they want to talk of the civil service

or  anybody, they must always respect the principle

of  negotiation in all their dealings. This is only

one  example of their arrogance. Let them learn not

to  be  so arrogant in future. Maybe they  will  do

better -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Get some votes!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and get more votes possibly.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I had not

thought  of  joining in this debate, but  when  the

Minister for Finance tried to explain away that the

arbitrary  imposition of the pay  cuts  was  not  a

political move -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Intimidation



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> He would prefer "political

intimidation". Let me try to explain. Did  not  the

Minister  in  this very House thump his  chest  and

say,  "We  the  P.A.P. shall never retreat."  Never

retreat,  indeed!  Brave  words!  Today  they  have

retreated,  because there seems to  be  no  traffic

police  to stop people crossing from that  side  to

this side. [Laughter].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Serjeant at Arms, I think

you  ought to see that order is maintained  in  the

Gallery. Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> When they first came in, they

were  all  in  white - pure white,  like  innocent

lambs! Today they are in all sorts of colours - pink,

red and even black.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is the clothing of Members

relevant to what we are discussing? I might have an

attack on my wig! I do not think that is proper.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is relevant to this

extent - that when they first came in pure white, the

very  first words they uttered were, "We the P.A.P.

are  a  good,  clean and honest Government."  Good,

clean  and honest, indeed! Today, there is no  more

of that kind of -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member must

at  least try and understand what is in the mind of

the  Speaker. When he indicates that that  type  of

language or speech is irrelevant, it is irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I bow to your ruling, Sir, but

let  us  say  that the Government  had  to  beat  a

retreat  in  spite of the fact that they  had  said

that  they would never retreat. What did  they  do?

They  said, "All these allowances can only be  paid

back  to  those  who have joined the  A.U.P.E." - a

P.A.P.-sponsored trade union: [Hear, hear!].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Is this not a kind of

intimidation of the civil service, to join a  union

that   is  controlled  by  the  P.A.P.?  The   word

"intimidation",  Sir,  has been  suggested  by  the

Minister for Finance himself. Today when the  poor,

strong,  good and honest P.A.P. is reduced to  just

26 against 25 on this side. "Oh, semua boleh balek.

You  will  get back everything, boys.  Never  mind,

merger is on the way. Take everything back." Is  it

not  a  fact?  Everyone knows it.  Even  the  civil

service  knows it. Of course, the P.A.P. will  not

admit  it. But certain former Members of the P.A.P.

who  are  now on this side of the House  will  say,

"Yes, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



was  meant to teach the English-educated  a  lesson

and  to  show to the Chinese-educated that although

the  P.A.P. Government could not raise them to  the

level  of  the English-educated, they had at  least

brought  down the English-educated to the level  of

the  Chinese-educated." That was the intention.  No

words from the Government will ever convince anyone

that  that  arbitrary move, without even consulting

the  trade unions who were at one time led by them,

was  not a political move or intimidation of a kind

which can only be described as "P.A.P.-style"!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Just a second Sir. There is one

point  the Member for Anson has brought up.  It  is

very short.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must remind hon. Members

that  the  time allotted for this topic ends  at  a

quarter  to  four. I have no doubt the hon.  Member

will give an opportunity to the Government side  to

reply.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I understand, Sir, but this will

only take just half a minute.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Member for Anson has

suggested  that  the variable allowance  should  be

absorbed  into the basic pay so that the basic  pay

would   not  be  at  the  tender  mercies  of   the

government of the day. From the little that I  know

of  the Constitution of the State of Singapore, may

I  say  that  the  basic pay is always  subject  to

reduction  should  the need arise?  The  protection

afforded  by the Constitution is in so far  as  the

payment of pensions is concerned. It has nothing to

do  with  the basic pay. Any government of the  day

can  reduce,  increase, or let  it  remain  static,

depending upon the financial situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think when Members rise to

speak  on  certain  topics  in  this  House,   they

sometimes  speak  only to certain sections  of  the

community.  If  one were talking  to  the  English-educated, like the Member for Queenstown  and  the

Member for Cairnhill, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



one could say, "What a wicked and tyrannical act it

was  to  cut  down the allowances and so  on."  One

could  also, like Mr Rajendra and S.A.T.U.,  say,

"Back-date  all  these pay cuts. The  mass  of  the

people of Singapore will support

it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> S.A.T.U. is genuine.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Rajendra spoke on behalf of

S.A.T.U. He promised to support S.A.T.U. He  was  a

Joint  Secretary. But, Sir, not a  single  word  of

that  statement  appeared  in  the  Chinese  Press,

because  the  Chinese component of  S.A.T.U. knows

that  the  Chinese-educated feel that the  English-educated civil servants are paid too much.  Whether

it  is right or wrong, that is an existing feeling.

If   you  take  Singapore  by  itself - 75  per  cent

Chinese, the majority of them are Chinese-educated - then  I  say the relentless logic of  numbers  of

people  seeking  employment - equal opportunities  as

the  English-educated - must lead to a position where

the  common  denominator finally prevails.  If  you

have  a  cake and you divide it equally  among  the

Chinese-educated,   Malay-educated   and   English-educated,  the man who formerly got a larger  piece

is likely to get a smaller piece, and vice versa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give now, Sir, the political explanation as to

why  the  variable allowance was  restored,  and  I

think  the  English-educated  civil  servants  have

enough  grey  matter to calculate this.  I  am  not

interested in whether they vote for or against  the

P.A.P. That is a triviality. [Interruption].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have faced many a peril and we have passed

through  many  a  valley  of  death  and  survived.

[Interruption]  Their test is yet to  come,  and  I

hope I will see fierce men and women of courage and

conviction. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> But if you take it on a Pan-Malayan basis where Pan-Malayan opinion is

different,  because  you  have  large  numbers   of

Malays.  English-educated  and  Tamil-educated  who

believe  that  the  right way of  doing  things  is

somewhat different from the way the purely Chinese-educated think,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



then  naturally you have to find a new denominator.

It  is  as  simple  as that. As  my  colleague  the

Minister for Finance has explained, the 15 per cent

English vote can make no decisive difference in any

election.  Their  role  is  to  ensure   that   the

machinery of the State functions and ticks, because

they  are  in  key positions. The security  of  the

State  must  be  upheld.  Its  integrity  must   he

protected.  They  know  that  if  the  Member   for

Queenstown  had his way and he was  today  here  in

charge of the government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The incoming Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - on behalf, not of his 13

Assemblymen, but of men more powerful and more able

than himself -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir,I am an open leader. I

have no principal behind me. I am my own principal.

I am not a proxy [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am not a proxy for anybody. I

have  no  Committee  other  than  the  open  P.A.P.

Executive Cornmittee that decides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No hack-seat driver.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What the people of Singapore

must understand is this - and they do understand  it - it  is not the Member for Thomson or the Member for

Queenstown  who is going to run the  government  - either  this one or the next one. Nobody  is  silly

enough to believe that. Anybody who can add two and

two   together  to  make  four  knows  that   these

representatives    of   the   people    are    also

representatives  who take directives  from  illicit

groups  and  organisations and who  fear  the  open

confrontation of the open encounter  and  the  open

argument, because the principal is not there to set

the line. The wrong line is taken in a forum. There

is no time to refer back to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



Committee. A remark made  and  admitted,  a  concession  made

in   the argument sets the line on citizenship and on

other matters. I think the Member for Queenstown will not

relish a second encounter with the Member for Kreta

Ayer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Any place, anytime!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown

appears  to  be disregarding the authority  of  the

Chair.  I  think  I have had to say  "Order"  about

three  or  four  times. There is a  Standing  Order

under which I could act. I could say that that  was

grossly disorderly. I could ask any Member  who  is

grossly  disorder to leave the Assembly Chamber.  I

do  not  wish to do that. I would like  to  impress

upon  hon.  Members that the Chair  becomes  a  hit

impatient  when its authority is just flouted.  Mr

Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So you see, Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  question of making it permanent  carries  the

matter  no  further. There is no  finality  in  any

constitution. The finality is the strength  of  the

State.  If that strength passes into the  hands  of

those  who want to see that state altered  and  who

have  the force to implement their will - and  force

means  literally physical force - then  no  guarantee

in  any constitution is worth the piece of paper it

is  written on. Pakistan had a Constituent Assembly

that  deliberated on its Constitution for a decade,

and  brilliant lawyers they were. But the ultimate

authority  is  the authority of  the  man  who  can

implement  his  will.  If  the  will  is  that   of

Singapore  alone - the civil service  can  do  their

computation - then I say allowances will go down.  It

is logically inevitable. But if the will is that of

the  people of Malaya as a whole, then a  different

situation   prevails,  because  the  weighting   is

different. It is simple. Fur that reason -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Urban and Rural Services

Consultative Committee is assessing the  priorities

for   electricity  supplies  to  all  kampongs   in

Singapore.  Kampong Buona Vista  is  amongst  those

under consideration for next year. Priority depends

upon  two things: the density of the population  in

that  area and the easy availability of electricity

supplies.  So far since February 1960, 30  Kampongs

have  been  provided  with  electricity  under  the

Government's kampong lighting plan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, why is

the  electricity supply to Kampong Buona Vista only

halved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I re-interpret the

question?  The question was: why has  the  lighting

done for Kampong Buona Vista been only up to half?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that the vote has run out. If we can

find a transfer vote, virement - what they call  in

Establishment expertise - you transfer from one  Head

to the other, then we will do it this year. It not,

we  will do it from next year's vote. The programme

has  been  so accelerated that the money  which  we

provided   for  at  the  end  of  last   year   was

insufficient.  I  hope,  however,  that  with  some

ingenuity on the part of the Treasury, and  perhaps

assistance  from officials of the City Council,  we

might be able to find some savings.

<div align="center"><b>(Tabling of any available Reports thereon)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether  he  had  any  prior  intimation  from  his

advisers  of  the impending shortage of  the  water

supply  which commenced on 28th August,  1961,  and

whether   he  would  table  any  available  reports

thereon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, as early as May this year

the  City Water Engineer informed the Acting  C.A.O

of   a  possible  shortage  of  water  if  rainfall

continued to be below the yearly average for  those

months of the year. The reason was that last year's

rainfall  was the lowest for 80 years  of  recorded

meteorological  reports.  It  was  61   inches   as

compared with the yearly average of 90 inches. As a

result,   our  impounding  reservoirs  which   were

normally  filled  up  during the  rainy  season  of

November,  December  and  January  were  left  half

empty.  However, the water levels  in  Johore  were

then  reasonably  good and no  rationing  was  then

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the drought continued throughout May, June,

July  and August, not only did the water levels  of

our   impounding  reservoirs  in  Singapore  become

perilously low, but the water levels in Johore also

went  down. Out of a daily consumption of  some  69

million  gallons of water, 59 million gallons  come

from  Johore. Because of the drought in  Singapore,

the   whole   69  million  gallons  of  our   daily

consumption  of water had to come from Johore.  But

when the drought hit not only Singapore but was, in

fact,  worse in South Johore and water levels  went

down, rationing had to be introduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the end of October this year, rainfall in

Singapore was only 51.44 inches as against a yearly

average over the last 80 years of 76.31 inches  for

the same ten months, January to October.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am informed by the Meteorological Office that

the  drought hit many parts of the Federation,  and

many  towns  there  also had water  rationing.  The

reports regarding the water situation were released

to  the Press on two occasions: first, by me on the

25th  of  June  this  year,  when  the  facts  were

disclosed, and later on the 3rd of September by the

Deputy Prime Minister who was then acting as  Prime

Minister.  All relevant data had been disclosed  in

these two Press reports, and there is little to add

to them in tabling them in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In the light of the warning as

indicated  since  May,  would  the  Prime  Minister

inform  this  House whether his officials  and  his

Department   were  conscious  that  a  drought   in

Singapore would also necessarily mean a drought  in

Johore, and what plans were prepared since  May  to

meet this possible eventuality?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there was never any danger

of  a  complete cut-off in supplies, because  there

was  sufficient water in the impounding  reservoirs

in  Johore for the vital needs of the City. Had the

rainfall  for  the months of May,  June,  July  and

August  been  even three-quarters of that  normally

obtained  for  that season of the  year,  rationing

would   not   have  been  necessary.  Unfortunately

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- although some have it that that has something to

do  with  people exploding bombs in other parts  of

the  world - the weather seems to have  changed,  and

not  only South Johore but I am told Indonesia also

went  very dry; and the moment the level reached  a

point  where  if  the drought still  continued,  it

would  become  perilous, then  rationing  would  be

introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I add that at the moment the water levels are

rising, and, in fact, if we are prepared to take  a

risk that November and December this year would  be

as wet as they normally are.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



then  we can lift the rationing. But if we lift  it

and  November and December are not quite so wet  as

they normally are and as dry as last year, then  we

shall  be  in  trouble. So, for  that  reason,  the

rationing has to go on for the time being. But  the

moment  we  are  sure  of, and  the  Meteorological

Office can confirm, the Northeast monsoon which has

hit  Kelantan and Trengganu, that it  is  very  wet

there  and  it  is also wet in South  Johore,  then

rationing can be lifted.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I seem to be misunderstood. All I

asked,   Sir,   was:  what  plans   were   prepared

beforehand to meet the possible eventuality?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The only plan, Mr Speaker,

Sir, is to conserve what water there is and stretch

it  out for as long as possible. And the moment  we

reached  the  level  where it became  necessary  to

ration,  then  the public had to be inconvenienced.

The last thing we wanted to do is that. As long  as

there  is  enough in store to carry us  on  to  the

rainy   season  in  December,  then  we  are  quite

prepared  to go on without rationing. But when  the

level in Johore River and Tebrau went down, then we

hit rock-bottom and we had to close the bars.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

could  the Prime Minister tell the House, with  the

best  possible  conditions for Singapore,  when  he

hopes to raise water rationing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would like to have announced

today  in  this Chamber that we are lifting  it  as

from  2  o'clock so that we do not have  to  fiddle

around  with pails and cans of water in the toilet.

But  my  latest information from the Meteorological

Office says, like all weather forecasters who  like

to  remain  credited and creditable  oracles,  that

they  will not predict that the monsoon,  which  is

wet  in  Kelantan and Trengganu and which is coming

in the next few days to South Johore and Singapore,

will  be  wet. They say that there have been  cases

where  it is wet in Kelantan and Trengganu, but  by

the  time  the winds come down to South Johore  and

Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



it has gone desiccated and dry. Sir, if they are

unable to give me this assurance, then I will deny

myself the pleasure of telling hon. Members that

they can wash their hands with a degree of dignity

and comfort. However, if in the course of the

debate next week, I receive reports from the

Meteorological Office that the North-east monsoon

is also wet in South Johore, then water will he

on.

<div align="center"><b>ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SCUDAI RIVER SCHEME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

what is the estimated expenditure of the part of

the Singapore Government for the development of the

Scudai River Scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The estimated expenditure for

the development of the Scudai River scheme to

provide for the collection, storage of water,

treatment, pumping to quarters, site, buildings and

pipelines is estimated at $11 million. But at the

same time, co-related to this extension, there will

have to be a 15 million gallon storage reservoir in

Singapore with distribution pipelines which will

cost a further $9 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is the Prime Minister himself satisfied

whether, in view of the fact that we are going to

the Johore River for our eventual water supply,

this $26 million that is going to be spent on the

Scudai River will not eventually turn out to be a

waste of public money?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is $9 million, making in

all $20 million to provide for 15 million gallons

of storage space in Singapore for the water to be

pumped in. That is one of those questions which I

am unable personally to satisfy myself on, because,

much as I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



like to be able to, I am really unable to say from

my own knowledge how these things are done. But the

engineers  have  assured me - I have  to  take  their

advice,  and  I am reasonably satisfied -   that  the

best thing we can do is to take the advice that has

been  tendered to proceed with this.  I  might  add

that  this is a matter which is contentious between

Singapore  and Johore, that the moment  the  Johore

River  project  is completed the Johore  Government

wants  to  buy over our best reservoirs in  Pontian

and Gunong Pulai, where the water is soft and sweet

and  the  treatment costs little, as distinct  from

Tebrau where a considerable amount of treatment  is

required. So I would rather not get involved in the

intricacies  of the argument on both sides.  All  I

can say is that we have been extremely fortunate in

that, despite pressure from certain members of  the

Johore  State Assembly to buck the price up, taking

advantage of the drought and the negotiations going

on   in  the  course  of  the  drought,  the  State

Secretary  and the Mentri Besar have  resisted  the

temptation to do so. They have only insisted on the

1955  agreement. I think the Member for Farrer Park

will   remember  this  because  he  was   in   the

Municipality then in 1955 when these new rates were

agreed.  The  old rates were 25 cents  per  gallon.

There  were no royalties. Singapore supplied Johore

at  25  cents, and they sold to their consumers  at

whatever profit they could make, and everybody  was

happy. Then the cost of treating the water went up,

because  instead of collecting water in  convenient

catchment areas like Kota Tinggi and Gunong  Pulai,

we  had to tap Tebrau, and now Scudai, and later on

the  Johore River. It has gone up to 50  cents.  In

1955,  the  Municipality came to an agreement - well,

the  Johore  Government insisted  that  it  was  an

agreement;  our contention is that it  was  only  a

preliminary  agreement - that  the  cost   of   water

supplied  to Johore should be brought up  to  date,

namely, 50 cents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Would the Prime Minister

think  it convenient then to answer questions  14*

and 15+ at the same time?



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions standing in the name of Mr David Marshall read as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 14. To ask the Prime Minister (a) what is the total payment to be made to

the Johore Government for water supplied from Tebrau water works from 1955 to

30th September, 1961, at the new rates; (b) what is the estimated payment to be

made to the Johore Government for the supply of water to Singapore in 1962 at the

new rates; and (c) whether he is aware of any expenditure involved on the part of the

Johore Government for providing such supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 15. To ask the Prime Minister (a) what is the estimated payment to be made

by the Johore Government to Singapore for water supplied by Singapore for the year

1962 at the new rates; and the estimated cost thereof to Singapore; and (b) the

reasons for increasing the rate from 25 cents to 50 cents per thousand gallons of filtered water.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, that was at the back of

my mind.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister may answer

questions 14 and 15 at the same time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, 14 and 15 at the same

time. And so they came to what our officials think

is  a  dubious  proposition,  because  one  cannot

calculate  development,  particularly   with   the

tremendous industrial development in Singapore, or

the  expansion in consumption. They  came  to  the

agreement that we were to pay 3 cents royalty  per

thousand  gallons  and  we  charged  the  cost  of

treatment  at  50  cents  per  thousand   gallons.

Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, depending on

which  way  one  pitches one's hopes,  the  Johore

Government  did not yield to pressure  from  their

State  Assemblymen to scrap the agreement and  ask

for  something  more. We could  not  persuade  the

Johore  Government to scrap the agreement  and  go

back  to the old one where we supplied them at  25

cents,  even  though  we were supplying  it  below

cost.  But then we tap the rivers for what we  can

make up for that. However, the best that could  be

done is to stick to the agreement in 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total payment - this is the answer to question

No. 14 - to the Johore Government for water supplied

from  the Tebrau water works from 1st March, 1955,

to  30th  September, 1961, is  $1.8  million.  The

estimated  payment  to  be  made  to  the   Johore

Government for the supply of water to Singapore in

1962 is $.57 million. Sir, I am not aware of any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



expenditure  on the part of the Johore  Government

for  providing this supply which we undertake  and

extract on our own, other than helping with a  few

police  escorts during the time of the  strike  to

maintain   the   water  works.   The   collection,

filtration, pipelines and storage are all  at  our

expense. In fact, we also supply Johore Bahru with

their  requirements for water at cost. But I would

like to add that the Johore Government leases  the

catchment  area to the Singapore Government  at  a

purely nominal rent. So we have to be thankful for

our blessings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to question No. 15+, the estimated payment to

be  made by the Johore Government to the Singapore

Government for water supplied by Singapore in 1962

is  $.625 million, of which the estimated cost  to

Singapore is $.562 million. As I said, the  reason

for  increasing the rate of 25 cents to  50  cents

per thousand gallons of filtered water is that the

cost  of supplying the water, of treating it,  has

increased for the Singapore Government. The charge

of 25 cents per thousand gallons was below cost in

the  last few years, although it was the cost when

it   was  fixed  many  years  ago.  The  Singapore

Government would have preferred to retain the  old

cost  at  25  cents  in the old  agreement,  which

expired  in 1948, and waive the extra cost  of  25

cents  per thousand gallons, provided we  did  not

have  to  pay  3  cents per thousand  gallons  for

extraction.  However, as I said, the best  bargain

that  was  made in the circumstances was that  the

City  Council and the Johore Government agreed  to

implement  the  new  rates  which  we  say  was  a

preliminary agreement, but which they  say  was  a

final  agreement  in 1955 - at the  time  when  the

Member for Farrer Park was in the City Council.  I

think the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Anson was in charge of the  Government

then. Although several discussions were held,  this

is  the  position  and the agreement  will  now  be

formally ratified.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, we are spending $11

million on the Scudai River project, and the  Prime

Minister  mentioned a lease. Are the  installations

and  the  works  which  we  will  be  erecting  the

property  of the Singapore Government on  freehold;

and if not, what are the terms of its ownership?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am now speaking from memory.

But  I  will  supply  the  full  information  in  a

supplementary written answer. I think the last that

I  saw the file before I went off on leave and  the

Deputy  Prime Minister took over was that  we  were

pressing for a 60-or 80-year lease and they  wanted

a  20-year one. I am not quite sure exactly at what

figure  agreement has been reached. But  I  believe

that  the  calculation has taken into  account  the

amortization  and the writing-off of  these  assets

over the years of the lease. As the lease runs out,

so will the capital installations be written off.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Prime

Minister  tell the House when he hopes to  complete

the  Scudai  River  scheme and  when  he  hopes  to

commence the Johore River scheme?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am speaking now on the

information supplied by the Leader of the House, as

he  was in charge of these negotiations which  took

place while I was on leave. The Scudai River scheme

will  be  completed in two years from the  time  at

which it was announced; and the Johore River scheme

will  be commenced as soon as possible. But we have

not been able as yet to assess the approximate date

of completion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Will the Prime Minister assure the

House  that  there  are  definite  schemes  in  his

ministry for commencing the Johore River scheme?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I cannot explain how

valuable water is if only to keep us going  in  the

Assembly.  But I can assure the Member  for  Farrer

Park that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



I  have  been most anxious about this situation.  I

have  been  watching the population curve  and  the

consumption curve going up and finding out when the

consumption   curve  is  going  to   overtake   the

production curve. I have the full guarantee of  the

City   Engineer   and  his  assistants   that   the

production  curve  will always keep  ahead  of  the

consumption curve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scudai River scheme will be ready in two

years.  Just  as we are about to be  overtaken,  we

will take another leap forward and be pumping more.

Just  as  we are about to be overtaken, the  Johore

River scheme will be finished. I can only say, Sir,

that I trust that they have done their calculations

correctly. I am sure they have done it to the  best

of  their  ability. I only hope that the population

of  Singapore will not rise faster than it has been

doing.  They have estimated that, going on  at  the

normal  rate  4  per cent, all will  be  well.  But

if - and this is really the point - the Jurong project

gets  under way and industrial consumption goes  up

tremendously and unexpected demands are made,  then

it  may well be that we will have to ask the Johore

Government  not to insist on buying  out  our  Kota

Tinggi  and Gunong Pulai reservoirs. They  want  to

buy  them  over  because, as I have explained,  the

water  there  is the sweetest in South  Johore.  It

almost  requires no chlorination. We would like  to

keep  it in reserve in case unexpected demands  are

made by industry on the use of water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand the

Singapore  Water Engineer is in Europe looking  for

water  for  Singapore.  Could  the  Prime  Minister

please  tell  the  House what  progress  the  Water

Engineer is making in Europe in securing water?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have it on the authority of

no  less  a scientist than the Leader of the  House

that  the  City  Water Engineer is  not  in  Europe

seeking water. He is seeking a consultant on how to

tap  water faster. He is due back shortly.  Perhaps

if the Member for Farrer Park will raise the matter

again  after the City Water Engineer has come back,

I will be happy to table a report setting out the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



success of his sojourn in Europe - I mean his success

in looking for a consultant engineer.

<div align="center"><b>CLARIFICATION OF DISTINCTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BETWEEN "FEDERAL NATIONAL"</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND "FEDERAL CITIZEN"</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether  he  will  clarify the distinction  between

"Federal  National"  and  "Federal  Citizen",   two

phrases used in a recent broadcast by him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, in the memorandum which

has  been tabled as Cmd. Paper 33 of 1961, the term

"Federation  National" has been used in  preference

to  the  term "New Federation National"  so  as  to

avoid confusion with the term "Federation Citizen",

which means a citizen of the present Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original English terminology for a person's

association with a country is "nationality" as used

in  several Acts of the British Parliament  and  in

the  legislation at present in force known  as  the

British Nationality Act of 1948. Members will  note

that by international practice the description of a

person's  association  with  and  protection  by  a

country is the term "nationality". This practice is

followed   by  us  in  Singapore  in  our  passport

application forms and in the passport itself. We do

not  use the more modern term extant in some of the

newer Dominions of citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave some blank forms-not permanently on the

Table, Mr Speaker, Sir, because these are valuable

documents. I am not suggesting that anyone in  this

House wants to get away in a hurry, although I have

heard  that  some are trying to disguise themselves

by  growing beards and wearing spectacles! For  the

scrutiny  of  Members  of  the  House,  I  lay  the

application form and the passport on the Table.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Can the Prime Minister please

tell us what are the rights which a national has?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If I allow that question, it

can  open  up a very wide debate on the subject.  I

think the question is just an inquiry as to whether

the  Prime  Minister will clarify  the  distinction

between "Federal National" and "Federal Citizen". I

am  sure the Member for Queenstown will make a note

of  that and say what he wishes to say when we come

to  debate the Prime Minister's motion, which  asks

the  House  to  accept certain heads  of  agreement

between the Federation and Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Marshall, is it a supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, please, Mr Speaker, Sir,I ask

of   the   Prime  Minister  if  I   am   wrong   in

understanding that a Federal citizen is  a  British

national  by  virtue  of the  Constitution  of  the

Federation and section 1 of the British Nationality

Act of 1948?



The Prime Minister rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Before the Prime

Minister answers - he can and may answer later on  if

he  wishes  to - it  occurs to  me  that  that  the

Member's  supplementary question under our Standing

Orders, might not be in order. The Standing Order I

have in mind is Standing Order 19 (1) (h). It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'a question shall not be asked for the purpose of

obtaining an expression of opinion, the solution of

an   abstract  legal  case  or  the  answer  to   a

hypothetical proposition;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, if the Prime Minister is in a position to

answer, he can do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, again I am speaking now on

general principles since it is a long time since  I

took  my examination on British Constitutional Law.

The  British  Nationality Act  introduced  for  the

first   time   the   concept  of  nationality   and

Commonwealth citizenship. The idea is that although

Canadians, Australians and South Africans  did  not

want Indians, Pakistanis, Ceylonese and Malayans to

move  in  and  out  of  their country  freely,  the

British  wanted  to maintain this  concept  of  the

unity of one family of different coloured children,

and so they coined this concept of the Commonwealth

citizen. Everybody became a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



Commonwealth citizen; and as a Federal citizen is a

Commonwealth citizen, he was therefore entitled  to

enter  the United Kingdom. I do not know  what  has

happened  now about the West Indians going  to  the

U.K. in   strength.   But   this   concept   asks

Commonwealth  citizenship - a common term - to  embrace

all races in the Commonwealth, but at the same time

keeping  British nationality, which was  introduced

by  the  British Nationality Act of 1948,  separate

and distinct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure what the purport of the question is,

but  if  the  Member  for Anson  will  give  me  an

intimation before-hand and allow me not  to  be  my

own  legal adviser, which is the last thing I think

I  am  competent  to be, I will consult  the  State

Advocate-General. I am told. Mr Speaker, Sir, that

one  should never be one's own lawyer, and I  often

have  to  resist the temptation of  not  doing  the

things  that  I  think I want to do  when  I  am  a

participant and at the same time advising myself. I

have   done   it  once,  with  a  great   deal   of

satisfaction  for  myself.  But  I  was  told  that

normally  it  is  better to leave these  things  to

another    man   who   could   explain   it    more

dispassionately -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would that apply to the Member for

Anson?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If the Member for Anson will

indicate  what  are  the  parts  that  he  requires

clarification,  then I will seek  advice  from  the

State  Advocate-General who is competent to  advise

us in these matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my

submission  that there can be no such  thing  as  a

Federal national because -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again the Member for

Anson  is  embarking on a debate on this particular

subject.  He  is  not  entitled  to  do  so  during

Question  Time. If he has a supplementary question,

by all means ask it.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether,  in view of the reputed action of Portugal

in  Angola,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



consideration will  be  given  to  the

question  of  severance of trade relations  between

Singapore and Portugal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I say that the people

of  Singapore  and  the Members  of  this  Assembly

cannot  overstate our abhorrence at the  atrocities

perpetrated  by  the  Portuguese  colonial   regime

against   the  African  people  of  Angola.   These

atrocities  which the Member for Anson  has  kindly

referred to as "reputed action" had been proved  by

many independent observers and documents. I am sure

the  House will want the Government to do  whatever

we  can to help the people of Angola in their fight

for   freedom  against  these  brutal  methods   of

suppression.  However,  I  am  informed  that   the

severance of trade relations between Singapore  and

Portugal  would be of no assistance  whatsoever  to

the  people  of Angola. Our imports and exports  to

Portugal  and  her  dependencies  is  a  negligible

proportion of our entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the case that I recall as having been

discussed  by  the  Government  is  that  of  South

Africa. Although we as a Government wanted  to  ban

imports,  we  could  not ban consumption  of  South

African  goods  without at the same time  affecting

our  free  port  status  and  also  preventing  the

transhipment  in Singapore for other  countries  of

goods from South Africa. Similarly, in the case  of

Portugal. If we sever trade relations and  ban  the

imports  with  the purpose of banning  consumption,

then  because  we  have  no  impounded  warehousing

system  we will automatically also have to ban  all

imports  even for transhipment elsewhere. For  that

reason,  I  am  informed that very little  will  be

gained by severing trade relations and sonic damage

may he done to our free port status.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I accept the

validity  of  the indications given  by  the  Prime

Minister for the reason of not disrupting our trade

relations  with Portugal, but if we are not  to  do

that  in  order to show our disapprobation  of  the

inhuman  blood  bath  in Angola, would  the  Prime

Minister  indicate what other action it is possible

for the Government to take and what action he would

consider taking?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am told the normal

discourtesy  in these matters, when  one  does  not

want to cut one's own nose to spite oneself, is  to

isolate  coldly,  or  put  into  cold  storage  the

representative   of   the   country    representing

Portugal.  I  have  not  known  of  any  ceremonial

occasions  to  which  he  has  been  invited  since

Angola.  I  cannot  speak with certainty  on  these

matters, but I am quite sure it will give all of us

some sense of satisfaction at having expressed  our

detestation by conveying through the representative

our  utter  contempt for his Government  in  acting

that way in Angola.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if there are more effective methods of

hurting them without hurting ourselves, I shall  be

very happy to receive the proposals.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is there no method by which the

public  could be associated, not in private  social

matters but publicly, to give them the satisfaction

of expressing their deep anger?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am not saying this is

international convention or practice, but I  think,

from  time to time, what happens is that one brings

effigies of the President of the country before the

legation of the Embassy and symbolically burns  and

beats  the person to death, hoping, by the  process

of  pinpricking the idol and black magic, that some

harm  would  befall  the person some  thousands  of

miles  away. I do not know how we can do this here,

and whether there is an honorary consul on whom  we

can work these witchcraft methods. But if there  is

any way to do them harm - most important, of course,

is that it must not do us harm - I am all for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC ASSISTANCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to ask this House to turn its eyes  for  a

short while on some of our sores.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to draw attention to the plight of some of

our poor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the definition of "poor"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956 a Report on Urban Incomes and Housing was

drawn  up by the then Assistant Director of  Social

Welfare who is now our Minister for Finance. It was

an  excellent,  a carefully prepared document - if  I

who  am  a novice on these matters may be permitted

to   express  an  opinion.  It  referred   to   the

definition of "poor" (at page 113) as meaning those

persons  who  live in conditions below the  minimum

physical needs to maintain health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Report arrived at the conclusion that in

the  period  1953-54,  the  minimum  income  for  a

husband,  his  wife and two children  was  $101.85.

This  was eight years ago. The cost of living,  the

Minister  will  admit, has not gone  down.  It  has

risen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, another statistic from this Report is

that  about  30  per cent of our  population  lived

below  that  minimum standard and are poor.  Thirty

per cent lived in poverty in 1953-54. I do not know

how   much  the  position  has  improved   in   the

intervening  years. I should like to believe,  Sir,

that they have improved in spite of our increase of

population. But it is not on this very large  group

that  I  ask the House to concentrate its attention

tonight.  I  would like hon. Members to concentrate

on a small portion of this group living in poverty.

I  would like the House to concentrate on those who

may be officially presumed to be starving - those who

draw public assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have sought from the Ministry of Labour

information, much of which was courteously granted,

but when I asked for figures which I could not find

of  those who were drawing public assistance, I was

courteously but firmly refused that information. It

is  my  hope that this top-secret information which

the Minister is so unhappy to disclose to a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



Member  of  the  House, will be  disclosed  to  all

Members  of the House and we shall have the figures

for 1956, 1960 and for the end of October 1961, of

the  number  of human beings in Singapore  who  are

living  well below subsistence level. I might  say.

Sir, that the Minister for Finance in his Report on

Urban  Incomes and Housing said that  one-fifth  of

the  households  of the poor was living  on  public

assistance, but that was a long time ago and it  is

not   proper  that  this  House  should   work   on

statistics so old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is public assistance, Sir? It came into

being - so  far as I can trace it -  immediately  after

the  occupation period when a large number  of  our

people  were  in dire economic need  and  temporary

relief  measures  were instituted  and  were  later

administered  by  the newly-formed  Social  Welfare

Department which was formed in 1946. At that  time,

Sir,  grants  were given of $5 per man,  $4  for  a

woman,  and $2 for children per month. The neediest

recipients,  however,  could  get  free  meals  and

additional assistance. Five years later,  in  1951.

the  public  assistance scheme was established  and

the rates to those who were fully eligible were $15

for the head of a household, $5 for each dependant,

with  a  maximum  of $40 for each family.  That  is

extremely  low,  Sir,  but  let  us,  in  fairness,

recognise that at the same time there was an  equal

amount  given to those who were sick, so  that  the

person  receiving public assistance if he was  sick

got  a double allotment. Even then it was generally

recognised  that  the double allowance  itself  was

well  below  subsistence  level, particularly   in

respect of families with young children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in June 1953, there was a further change and

all  degrees  of  eligibility  were  abolished.   A

residential   qualification   of   one   year   was

introduced.  The scales then established  were  $15

for  the head of a household, $5 for the wife,  and

$5 for the child, with a maximum of $90. You had to

have  a huge family of some 12 children to get  it.

Sickness  allowance was also paid at the same  rate

as  public  assistance, and it is to be  recognised

that this was very important to those who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



were  sick. Also the wife herself, if she was sick,

did  not merely get a sickness allowance of $5  but

she was given $15.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what was the cost of this scheme which in its

way  indicated  our  awakening conscience  and  our

awakening  humanity? In 1958, Sir, the scheme  cost

$7  million. In 1959, it cost 7� million. Late  in

1959 - the  year  this Government took  office - public

assistance rates were altered by the Government. At

first  it  was  not recognised to what  extent  the

alteration was adverse to the most defenceless  and

most  needy  of the human beings who populate  this

island,  for the P.A.P., with its unerring instinct

for  the  propaganda point, increased the allowance

to the head of the household by $1 and made it $16.

It  increased the allowance to the wife to  $10 - all

to  the  good,  Sir, every little  bit;  I  am  not

complaining - and the child over 16 to $8.  That  is

good,  Sir.  Wherein  lies the complaint?  Sickness

allowance which quite materially affected  a  large

portion    of    the   people   receiving    public

assistance - sometimes  as   much   as   half   their

income - was  abolished  altogether,  bringing  about

acute hardship to a group already recognisably  and

officially  unable  to work and  requiring  special

nourishment because of their illness, let alone the

minimum necessary for maintaining human health.  In

addition.  Sir,  non-citizens, no matter  how  long

they lived in this country, were refused all public

assistance. However, in fairness, let me  add  that

to  the head of the family, only if he was so sick

that  he  could  not work - and it was  a  grave  and

lengthy  matter - he was given a disability allowance

of $10 per month. Other cuts were made. Persons who

are  not  married cannot receive public assistance,

no  matter how long they are unemployed, no  matter

how sick they are. Sir, let me correct that. If the

unemployed  single person has been  sick  for  more

than  a month, then during his sickness he can  get

his  public  assistance. Non-citizens  of  whatever

length of residence are completely ineligible,  and

those  living in households where there is  regular

income  are  barred. You might  say  that  that  is

reasonable. I put it to you. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



you are conscious that not only amongst the Chinese

but  in all races there is a strong attachment  and

fixed  family  ties;  and you can  appreciate  that

these things do happen - that a brother takes in  his

widowed sister with six children, but because he is

a  clerk who earns $150 a month, the widow and  the

children get nothing. There is a regular income  in

that household.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter, Sir. Tuberculosis allowance was

discontinued  in  respect of  those  who  are  non-citizens,  whatever their length of residence.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, at first view, this might seem a very

reasonable  political move. We  must  conserve  our

resources for our citizens. But what the Government

has  failed  to recognise is that the  tuberculosis

allowance  which  is  above subsistence  level  and

assists  tuberculosis  patients  to  improve  their

health  prevents  them from becoming  a  continuing

focus   of   infection.   Non-citizens   who   have

tuberculosis do not limit their infection  to  non-citizens, and the economy which the Government  has

sought  to  make  is  a false economy  because,  by

leaving the unemployed tuberculosis patient who  is

a  non-citizen without any resources to improve his

health,  the Government encourages and assists  the

additional  spread  of  tuberculosis  amongst   our

people, because these people continue to be a focus

of infection to our healthy citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these cuts, Mr Speaker, Sir, were presumably

enforced  in  the  name  of economy,  but  I  would

suggest that the result has not apparently been  no

ticed.  It has not been recognised, Sir, that  such

action  increases the hardship of a major group  in

Singapore - those who are unable to work  because  of

illness and where the very existence of poverty has

led them to be vulnerable to illness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I will not go back to the Report of the gentleman who is now our Finance Minister, but I will give you one other statistic which I am sure

he  will  accept  as valid and  which  he  will  be

prepared to respect. I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



reliably  informed,  Sir, that  the  Department  of

Social  Medicine  of the University  has  carefully

investigated and finally ascertained that  the  sum

of  $22  per  month  is required for  the  cheapest

reasonable diet to maintain the minimum standard of

health  on  the  basis of scientific  marketing - and

this  $22  per  month does not  take  into  account

clothing, rent and other basic human needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means, Sir, that those who are recipients of

public  assistance in their thousands and  tens  of

thousands are today living, in truth and  in  fact,

at  a  level where their health is actually rapidly

deteriorating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every government with an eye to the long-term

welfare  of  the  people must  recognise  that  the

effect   of  this  extreme  malnutrition   over   a

prolonged  period  will have  a  very  considerable

bearing  on the public economy. I speak of economy,

Sir, because that seems to be the important aspect.

apart,  it seems, from other aspects which have  or

seem  to  have a little validity to hon, gentlemen

opposite, such as human values and humanity. If  it

is   economics   that  the  P.A.P.  Government   is

interested, Sir, then I say it is false economy  to

save money from the sick and the starving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been the effect, Sir, of these measures

introduced by Government of economy in the realm of

public assistance?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been good enough to supply me

with figures, and, as I have indicated, in 1959  we

spent  $7,746,000; in 1960 we saved $350,000.  That

was  the economy in 1960. In 1961, on the basis  of

the  figures supplied up to the end of August,  the

total   we  will  spend  for  the  whole  year   is

$6,400,000.  In 1961, Sir, we will  have  saved  $1

million  from the poor and the starving as compared

with  1960. Is this the type of economy  that  this

House, being  made conscious of it,  would  really

approve?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if these human beings who are our

citizens  are  to  be deemed expendable  and  their

death  is  to be welcomed as saving the State  some

money, from  the point of view of  the  community,

this  is  an  unrealistic and uneconomic  approach.

Starvation  and  poverty of  the  nature  indicated

takes its toll on the whole community, not only  on

the  women and children who immediately suffer, but

on  all citizens, through increases in the rate  of

crime,  the rate of illness, and the very degrading

atmosphere in which such matters can happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children, Sir, who have to suffer malnutrition

during  their  tender and formative years,  because

their  parents  have  only $5  to  spend  on  their

food - one-fourth  of  the  basic  minimum   required

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- cannot be expected to grow up healthy, employable,

balanced  or  good citizens. They must  necessarily

grow up distorted, sick burdens on the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is not and should not be a political or party matter. No citizen can be comfortable so long as there are those who starve.

Sir,  it  is  a  question of money. Money  must  he

found.  Let us resolve: "In Singapore no man  shall

starve."  And  then  let us set about  finding  the

means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one more. In 1957 there was tabled in this

House  the  Report  of  the  Committee  on  Minimum

Standards of Livelihood. I refer to two paragraphs,

paragraph 203 and 204.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`203. We think that the Public Assistance scheme

should be put on a formal statutory basis and  that

the  rates  of  allowances and categories  of  need

covered by it should be approved by the legislature

and   should  be  subject  to  amendment   by   the

legislature  from  time to  time  as  occasion  may

demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;204. We think that the existing rates of allowance

should be increased ...'



<br><br>I  will be through, Sir. These recommendations have

been ignored - the Report shelved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other aspects, Sir, I would like to deal

with very briefly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delay in investigation of cases seeking public

assistance has increased under this Government.  It

is said that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



more  time is required in order to exclude  fraud.

But,  Sir,  a  delay of three  to  four  weeks  is

indefensible in emergency cases where human beings

are starving.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has exceeded

his time of twenty minutes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the subject

of  poverty and human suffering is a touching one,

and  the Member for Anson has excelled himself  in

dealing with such a subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say at once, Sir, that surely every

reasonable man will agree that poverty  is  a  bad

thing   and  should  be  eliminated  if  that   is

possible?  But,  Sir, while it  is  legitimate  to

express  discontent  over  the  rates  of   public

assistance  that are being paid to Singapore,  let

us  not forget that this is one of the highest  in

Asia, in fact the highest known to me. Let us  not

forget  that  the  income earned  by  the  average

family in receipt of public assistance is about as

much  as  what most families in other  undeveloped

countries of Asia earn in their full-time jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of poverty is not peculiar to us.

It  is  a  general  problem of all under-developed

countries  of  the  world.  Public  assistance  is

feasible  in  a  city trading economy  like  ours;

because  it  is compact and because  we  have  the

administrative machinery to give our assistance to

those   who   are   needy.  But  they   are   only

palliatives;  we  can only reduce  the  degree  of

destitution. But if we aim at eliminating  poverty

completely,   as   the  wealthier   industrialised

countries in the west have substantially succeeded

in  doing,  then it is absolutely  vital  that  we

expand  our economy, increase our national  income

in  order that we can afford to cream off  surplus

resources for our less fortunate brethren.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to mention this before

concluding. That the decision to review the  rates

of  public assistance was to make the whole scheme

more  rational.  It has been discovered  that  for

many  years the payment of sickness allowance  was

subject  to  grave  abuse. There  were  no  proper

checks that those in receipt of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



such an allowance were, in fact, properly entitled

to  them. There were no regular medical check-ups;

and  in  the  nature  of things,  because  of  the

shortage of medical personnel, it was not possible

to   have  the  number  of  examinations   to   be

conducted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have increased payment rates in other

respects to compensate for the withdrawal of  this

allowance.  Next  year  we shall  make  a  further

increase  in  the rates of public assistance.  The

proper way, of course, to deal with the problem is

to  have a contributory insurance scheme to  cover

the  barest  risks  to life which  overtake  urban

workers - the  risk  of unemployment,  the  risk  of

death  of the wage earner, provision for a  steady

income  after retirement. A lot of work  has  been

done  in  the  past years, but there  are  certain

difficulties in carrying out this insurance scheme

which I think this House can very well discuss  at

the appropriate time.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, in fairness to my colleague, the

Minister  for Finance, since the Member for  Anson

has  made reference to the time when he was in the

civil  service, I thought it only proper  to  give

him a few minutes to reply. I think he has more or

less covered some of the proposals and suggestions

made by the Member for Anson, but I would like  to

touch on the figures which the Member claimed that

he  was  courteously but firmly refused by perhaps

an  official  of  my Ministry.  I  would  like  to

disclose these figures to him now, indeed  to  all

Members of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1958, the number of persons of

public assistance per month is

72,604; 1959, 81,840; 1960, 89,548; for the months

of  August  1961, 89,244; September 1961,  89,060;

October 1961, 89,432. From these, you can see. Mr

Speaker,   that  the  average  amount  of   public

assistance   disbursed  per  month   ranged   from

$576,867 to now $602,583.60.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point raised about non-citizens,

which  I  am  sure hon. Members of this House  will

recall  during the by election in Anson, the  same

question, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



think, was raised by the Member for Anson. But  he

must  at  the same time understand the  conditions

prevailing in our State on the question of  public

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say here, Mr Speaker, that the

Government  is  spending nearly $7�  million  a

year,  on public assistance, and this figure would

have   increased  had  it  not   been   for   this

qualification  of non-citizens.  To  grant  public

assistance to non-citizens would encourage  people

from  surrounding  countries which  have  no  such

scheme  or have a less favourable scheme  to  take

advantage of the allowance payable here. This is a

substitute for residential qualification, and most

countries  in the world have either a  citizenship

or   a   residential  qualification  for  a   non-contributory  scheme  such  as  that   of   public

assistance. In the case of a social or a  national

insurance   scheme,  no  such   qualification   is

necessary,  as  the  beneficiary  has  contributed

towards   the   scheme   and,   subject   to   the

satisfaction  of  the contributory qualifications,

he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



has an absolute right to the payment of benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that the rates which we are paying

now  are the highest payable in respect of  relief

allowance  in  this  part  of  the  world.  It  is

proposed,  as from 1st January, 1962, to  increase

the rate of allowance for a head of household from

$16  per  month  to  $21 per  month.  This  is  in

accordance with the recommendations of the  P.A.P.

Review Committee.

In  1959, after the P.A.P. Government took office,

the head of household allowance was increased from

$15  per  month  to $16 per month,  and  the  wife

allowance -
