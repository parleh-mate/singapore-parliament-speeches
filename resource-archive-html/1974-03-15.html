<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN SERVICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Training schemes for officers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs  if  there  are  formal  training

schemes  for  officers inducted into  the  foreign

service;  what forms these schemes take; and  what

amount  of money was spent on these schemes during

the years 1971 to 1973.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Ong Soo Chuan) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have been asked to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of 1973, a Foreign Service Training

Scheme was established for recruits to the Foreign

Service. Prior to this date all training had  been

on  an  ad  hoc  basis supplemented with  overseas

training courses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>





The  ad hoc training consisted largely of a series

of  talks  relevant to the Ministry and basic  in-

service  training in the Ministry and in  Overseas

Missions.  Trainees were also attached to  various

Government Ministries and Departments in Singapore

for briefings on the policies and functions of the

Ministries  and Departments of Government  and  on

matters  relevant to the officer's work  overseas.

The  first  group of trainees to undergo  the  new

form  of  training  was appointed  by  the  Public

Service Commission to the Foreign Service in  late

1973,  and  hence  commenced  their  training   in

January 1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Service Training Scheme comprises

four phases as follows:-



<br><br><i>1st Phase - Basic Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a full-time, three-month period of

training  made  up  of lectures  and  seminars  on

Foreign Service subjects. For the academic portion

of this training, lecturers from the University of

Singapore  and  the  Staff Training  Institute  of

Singapore are also used. For the practical part of

the  training diplomats and Heads of  Missions  of

the Singapore Foreign Service who have returned to

Singapore are used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses on international relations,

international law and international economics  are

some of the subjects taught with the assistance of

the   University  of  Singapore.  There  are  also

courses  covering  political  and  economic  work,

intelligence  and social etiquette,  protocol  and

consular   work   and  personnel   and   financial

administration.  These  are  conducted  with   the

assistance  of  the  Ministries  of  Defence   and

Finance.



<br><br><i>2nd Phase - Language Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a part-time, six-month period of

training  in  a foreign language selected  by  the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During this phase  of

training,  trainees are also attached  to  various

Divisions  of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  and

other Government Ministries in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For language training the foreign language

training  courses conducted by the Adult Education

Board, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



Language Centre of the University of Singapore  as

well  as  its Extra-curricular Studies  Department

are  used.  Also,  where necessary,  the  Ministry

makes available the services of private tutors for

specific languages.



<br><br><i>3rd Phase - Practical Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a full-time, three-month period of on-the-job training. The trainee is attached to the

United  Nations  desk of the Ministry  of  Foreign

Affairs  which is the best available in  Singapore

"desk-type"  training for young  recruits  to  the

Foreign Service.



<br><br><i>4th Phase - Post-course Attachment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a full-time, two-month period of

attachment to a particular South Asian  or  South-east   Asian   country   for  practical   training

purposes. Alternatively, the recruit is sent as  a

member  of  official delegations to  international

conferences  or meetings, or even as a  member  of

the official delegation to the United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, under the Training Scheme, trainees are

obliged to attend seminars and talks organised  by

the  Institute of South-east Asian Studies and the

University of Singapore, as well as the  Ministry,

on Foreign Service subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above, scholarships and Colombo

Plan  awards  for  foreign  service  training  and

intensive   foreign  language   training   offered

through the Public Service Commission are used  to

improve  and upgrade the knowledge and  experience

of Foreign Service officers who have completed the

Training  Scheme  and are working  either  in  the

Ministry Headquarters or in Overseas Missions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1971, a sum of $34,000 was spent on sending

overseas  officers  on  training  courses  awarded

through  the Public Service Commission.  In  1972,

expenditure on training increased to an amount  of

$48,000  when  more officers became available  for

awards under the Colombo Plan for scholarships  or

training courses overseas on subjects relevant  to

the  Foreign Service. In 1973, training was  still

largely ad hoc because the Training Scheme was not

really implemented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



until the first group of trainees became available

in    1974.   Expenditure   in   1973,   including

expenditure  on  training  course  overseas   (for

example,  the Foreign Service Training  Course  in

Canberra) was $34,800.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

just  for  the  record.  When,  in  reference   to

language   courses,  the  Parliamentary  Secretary

referred  to  the  Department of  Extra-curricular

Studies,  was  he referring to the  Department  of

Extra-mural Studies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I call on the Member for

Kallang to ask the second Question, may I indicate

to  hon. Members that supplementary questions  may

be  put  for  the purpose of elucidating  an  oral

answer,  and  are  not meant  to  anticipate  oral

answers   to  other  Questions  to  the  Ministers

concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PRIVATE CAR OWNERSHIP</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications if it is the policy of his Ministry

to   discourage  private  car  ownership  and   to

encourage  the  use  of public  transport;  if  he

realises  that the public transport  services  are

inadequately and poorly serving the public; and if

he  will not introduce sudden and drastic measures

to  discourage  private car  ownership  until  the

public transport services are improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the deliberate policy of Government to restrain the growth of the

private  motor  car population in Singapore.  When

new  rates  of taxes on motor cars were introduced

in  October 1972, it was then announced  that  the

higher  rates  of  taxes were made  to  discourage

private  car ownership and not for the purpose  of

raising revenue. However, the number of new  motor

car  registrations for the period October 1972  to

September 1973 was 20,459 which represented  a  25

per  cent increase over the new registrations  for

the corres-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



ponding  period  from October  1971  to  September

1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot sustain such a high growth rate except

at tremendous economic and social cost. Therefore,

taxes  on  cars had to be raised again in  January

this  year. In the statement announcing these  tax

increases,  the Finance Ministry again  reiterated

that  this  was not done to raise revenue  but  to

discourage  private  car ownership.  It  was  also

stressed that if these increases did not have  the

desired  effect,  further  revisions  of  the  tax

structure  would be required until  a  balance  is

reached.  I am happy to say that, this  time,  new

registrations of private cars for January showed a

50  per  cent reduction over new registrations  in

January  last  year,  while new  registrations  in

February  were  down  by  28  per  cent  over  new

registrations in February 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettably true that the present public

bus  services need further improvement, especially

service   during   peak  hour  travel.   We   have

authorised   a   Supplementary  Public   Transport

Service with 259 vehicles (of which 253 are school

and  other  buses and six are goods  vehicles)  to

provide  an express, limited stop service,  during

peak  hour periods. In addition, the reserved  bus

lanes  which  have been introduced and  are  being

extended will give buses the priority they deserve

on our limited road space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not there will be more drastic

measures  to check further increases in  ownership

of  private cars depends on how many new cars will

be  registered this year, and in the years  ahead.

As  incomes grow, so has the car owning group. The

new taxes imposed since January, together with the

steep  increases in petrol prices  caused  by  the

doubling  of the price of crude oil since  January

this  year,  appears to have had  some  effect  in

slowing down the growth of car owners for the time

being.  However, even with the present  number  of

cars,  it  is already planned to have a  park-and-ride  scheme. Commuters will be able to park their

cars  in  fringe  car  parks and  take  a  special

shuttle bus into or out of the Central Business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



District  (CBD)  during peak periods.  This  would

help  to  cut down traffic congestion during  peak

periods.  Car pooling and staggered working  hours

will  also  greatly reduce congestion during  peak

periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 28th February, there were 137,470 private

cars  registered  for use on  our  roads.  If  the

growth  rate  of  17 per cent  per  annum  in  new

registrations  in the last three years  continues,

it   will  be  impossible  to  solve  our  traffic

problems.  We  cannot  increase  our  roads  by  a

similar percentage each year. And in the CBD,  the

increase of road capacity is very limited, despite

road  widening  and  one-way  traffic  flows.  The

longer  we  delay  action, the  more  painful  and

costlier  the  solutions will be. When  car  taxes

went  up in October 1972, all car owners were  put

on  notice. All present and future car owners have

to  recognise  the  limits of our  road  capacity,

especially in the CBD. By a combination  of  taxes

on  cars, parking fees, restricted entry into  the

CBD  during peak hours and peripheral parking  and

reserved bus lanes, we must and can ensure maximum

freedom of access to the CBD. This is essential to

the vitality of the CBD and on our whole economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An improvement in the public bus service is

vital.  It is the mainstay of our public transport

system  and  would continue to be  important  even

after  we  have a Mass Rapid Transit System.  This

may  be  in  the  late 1980's. The  Singapore  Bus

Service  Ltd  is making the effort  to  match  the

Government's  initiatives to get the bus  services

to meet ever higher needs. This year, there should

be  further improvement in the number of buses  on

the  road  and their standard of maintenance.  The

more  difficult problem is to improve  performance

of  bus drivers and conductors. Safer driving  and

more courteous service need a longer period of re-education. However, courtesy is a two-way process.

Considerate  conduct  and  co-operation   of   the

commuters is a necessary contribution to a  better

bus service.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, with due respect to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



you,  if  I  were  not asked to dish  out  all  my

questions,  I  would not have  done  so.  But  the

suggestion   had  come  from  the   Minister   for

Communications  yesterday.  As  for  now,  I  have

several  supplementary questions to  raise  but  I

shall ask only a few at a time unless the Minister

wishes  to dodge the questions. Yesterday  he  was

dodging  the questions I put to him, and therefore

I  would  appreciate it if he would  give  me  the

courtesy  by answering them wherever possible,  in

the public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are all these measures meant to encourage more

people to travel in a transport service run by the

profit-making private monopoly, the SBS?  Are  all

these  measures  meant to benefit  the  privileged

SBS?  Is  everything being tailored to favour  the SBS?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will answer

the question, but it looks as if it has arisen out

of the subject of private car ownership, and comes

back again to the SBS.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> May I clarify, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> In view of the fact that car

owners  are restrained from using their cars,  and

that car ownership is also being discouraged,  the

people will have to travel by bus. Therefore,  are

not  all  these measures only a means to encourage

them  to travel by buses operated by the SBS? That

is the connection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Now that the Member has

elaborated on the question, I am in a position  to

answer  him.  It  is true that  if  we  discourage

private  car ownership, there is the tendency  for

people  to travel by public bus. But that is  only

one  alternative. There is also  the  car  pooling

system  whereby  one private car can  be  used  to

carry  four  passengers  instead  of  the  present

average  of 1.3 passengers. The second alternative

is  that  there will be this peripheral  car  park

scheme. Car owners going into this CBD area  would

have  to  park  their cars in the  peripheral  car

parks and then jump on to the special shuttle bus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



service,  not  necessarily the SBS. It  has  never

been indicated that this shuttle bus service would

be  run  by the SBS. The third alternative is  the

supplementary public bus service or,  as  somebody

has called them, the school buses and lorry buses.

They  are available and they are a great  boon  to

the travelling public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> There are Comfort taxis too!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> My colleague has also

suggested  that  there are Comfort  taxis  of  the

NTUC.  I hope the Member is encouraging the people

to  travel by the NTUC Comfort taxis. There  is  a

long string of alternatives. If people do not wish

to travel by SBS buses, they do not have to. There

are  so  many other alternative forms of transport

available that the SBS will have to fight for  its

survival.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Sir, more people travel by bus

than  by taxis. Taxis are beyond the means of  the

majority  of  workers. Will the Hon. Minister  not

agree   that  the  introduction  of  measures   to

discourage   private  car  ownership  will   cause

difficulty  to  some people? And  to  deprive  car

owners  of  the use of their cars will cause  them

even  greater  inconvenience?  And  to  discourage

people  from  owning cars is already a  cause  for

some people to raise the question: why should they

upkeep  a private monopoly? And therefore imposing

such  other measures would certainly cause adverse

emotional reaction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, evidently the

Member  for  Kallang has not  taken  note  of  the

answers  to  his questions. He has not, therefore,

asked  questions relevant to the answers. He  goes

off  at  a  tangent. The reply given to  his  Oral

Question on private car ownership was that all car

owners  had been given notice that taxes would  go

up  and  that  it would be costly  to  maintain  a

private car. And if they do not take heed of  such

notice, then I suppose they might go to the Member

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



Kallang  and  make  a plea at his  Meet-the-people

sessions. I cannot afford to look at one aspect of

the problem only but in the national interest,  so

that  our  City  will progress economically.  Just

because  he owns a car, it does not mean  that  he

has  the right to go anywhere he pleases. That  is

why  we have introduced the reserved bus lanes  so

that priority is given to the public bus, not  the

private car.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Is it a bus service run by a

State-owned company or by a private monopoly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As I have said, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  hon.  Member is unable  to  follow  the

answers  but  keeps  on talking  of  monopoly  and

nationalisation.  He  is  obsessed  by  these  two

words. It is the duty of this Government to ensure

that public transport is the best that is possible

in  the  circumstances, and every effort  will  be

made to ensure that this is so.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Encik Abdul Aziz, I suggest you go

on to the third Question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>USE OF GOODS VEHICLES FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications why goods vehicles have  been  used

for  public transportation to supplement  the  bus

services  operated  by the Singapore  Bus  Service

(Private) Limited; and if the use of such vehicles

will be a permanent state of affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, use of goods

vehicles to transport passengers to and from  work

is  nothing  new.  I am sure the hon.  Member  for

Kallang  would  have seen, not so  long  ago,  the

numerous  lorries  carrying hundreds  of  civilian

employees  of  the British military establishments

to  and from work everyday. Even today, if he were

to  go  to  Jurong, and I believe he  does  go  to

Jurong,  he  would see lorry after lorry  carrying

workers to and from work in the industrial estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member would be pleased to know that,

to date, 103 goods



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



vehicles  (all  lorries)  have  been  issued  with

licences for the carriage of passengers under  the

Supplementary Public Transport Service Scheme;  of

these,  97  are  for Adult Worker  Contract  (AWC)

permits  and  six Public Transport (PT)  licences.

Those who do not wish to travel on the public  bus

services  provided by Singapore  Bus  Service  Ltd

(SBS),  or  school  buses under the  Supplementary

Public Transport Service, scheme B, should not  be

prevented  from  travelling in goods  vehicles  if

they so wish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether this supplementary service of goods

vehicles  being  used for carriage  of  passengers

would  remain a permanent state of affairs depends

on  whether it would continue to be needed. Unless

peak  hour  travel  demand can be  spread  through

staggered  working  hours, car-pooling,  park-and-ride   scheme  and  other  measures,  there  would

continue to be a need for the supporting  role  of

the  Supplementary  Public Transport  Service  for

peak hour travel, for the foreseeable future.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Sir, can the scheme to permit

goods   vehicles  to  transport  human  cargo   be

considered a measure that will improve the  public

transport service? Is it appropriate to state that

the  bus  services have deteriorated  to  a  point

commonly experienced in a protracted state of  war

and chaos?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member for Kallang used the words "human cargo". I

would  prefer  to use the term "human passengers".

As  I  have stated, it is the wish of a person  to

travel  either by bus, school bus, taxi or  lorry,

and he cannot thus be termed as "cargo" because he

has  the  option. It is admitted that, because  of

the  incapacity of the SBS to provide an  adequate

number    of   buses   for   peak   hour   travel,

supplementary schemes have to be put forward,  and

we  should leave it to the commuters to decide how

they  wish  to  travel  for  the  money  they  are

prepared to pay. Service is not for free,  whether

they  travel  by taxi, public bus, school  bus  or

lorry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Is it admitted that there are

not enough buses right now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister has been saying

that for days!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As you yourself have said, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have been saying that for days.

But admittedly he is so impervious that nothing

goes in.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> I have heard it. But let this

House know, and let the public know, of what the

Minister thinks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The tragedy is that the Member

<div align="center"><b>(Staff turnover)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Social  Affairs  what  the  turnover  rate  is  in

respect  of  staff in the Probation and  Aftercare

Service; and if consideration is being given to  a

review  of the terms and conditions of service  of

the staff in this section of his Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the average turnover

rate  of the Probation and Aftercare Officers  for

the  period  1969-73 was about 30  per  cent.  The

figures are as follows:

<pre>

   1969  40    per cent

   1970  46    per cent

   1971  20    per cent

   1972  14    per cent

   1973  30    per cent

</pre>

<br>It gives an average of 30 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of recruitment and retention of

trained  social  workers is not  peculiar  to  the

Probation and Aftercare Service alone. There is  a

general  shortage  of trained  social  workers  in

Singapore.  Many  of  them prefer  administrative,

research and training jobs in the private  sector,

to  field  work  in  the Probation  and  Aftercare

Service.  The  work of a Probation  and  Aftercare

Officer is specialised and onerous. The Probation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



and  Aftercare Officer has to work both during and

outside  of  office  hours  to  rehabilitate   the

offenders  through  supervision,  which   involves

visits  to  homes and to places  of  work  of  the

probationers.  This  type of work  calls  for  the

right  attitude and training to help offenders  to

become  socially useful and law-abiding  citizens.

It   requires  an  officer  with  high  leadership

qualities and a strong character. He must be  firm

and  at  the same time sympathetic to the problems

and  needs  of  offenders and their families.  The

very  specialised nature of the job, the  lack  of

trained  social  workers, and the more  attractive

jobs in the private sector are the reasons for the

high turnover of staff in the Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry recognises that with the rising

crime  and  delinquency rate,  the  Probation  and

Aftercare Service has a vital part to play in  the

prevention   of  juvenile  delinquency   and   the

treatment of offenders. To fulfil its role in this

aspect of community welfare and redevelopment, the

Service has to be made sufficiently attractive, in

comparison  with other jobs in the  civil  service

and   in   the  private  sector,  to  ensure   the

recruitment  and  retention of suitably  qualified

officers  in the existing establishment. Proposals

to  strengthen the organisational structure of the

department  by  the creation of  more  promotional

posts  to enable serving officers to better  their

prospects,   as  well  as  better   salaries   and

conditions  of service for officers, have  already

been  submitted  to the Ministry  of  Finance  for

consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if the Government will give consideration

to   raising  the  cost  of  living  allowance  of

pensioners,   to  allow  them  to   meet   present

inflationary  conditions; and  if  the  Government

will   also   consider  referring  the   case   of

pensioners to, say, the National Wages Council for

periodic adjustments of their pensions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  I  am  happy  to  announce   that

Government  has decided to grant with effect  from

1st  April, 1974, an ex gratia allowance to assist

pensioners in difficulties in the present abnormal

inflationary situation. The ex, gratia payment, to

be  termed  the new Singapore Allowance,  will  he

confined  to  pensioners  resident  in  Singapore,

whose  total pension is less than S650  per  month

and who will have retired before 1st April, 1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensioners whose total pension is $100 per month

or  less will receive an allowance equal to 50 per

cent of their pension, subject to a minimum of $15

per  month  or  a maximum of $30 per month.  Those

whose  pensions are above $100 per month but below

$650 per month will receive a flat rate of $30 per

month, subject to a maximum gross pension of  $650

per  month.  Pensioners  with  mixed  service  now

resident in Singapore will be paid half the  rate.

To  ascertain  total pension, basic  pension  plus

existing  Singapore Allowance and Cost  of  Living

Allowance  will be aggregated and rounded  upwards

to the nearest dollar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Singapore Allowance will also be payable

to  widows who receive a dependants' pension  from

the  Singapore  Government provided  they  are  in

receipt of the pension as a result of service  put

in  by their deceased husbands. Persons in receipt

of  an Injury Allowance which itself is subject to

review   will  not  be  paid  the  new   Singapore

Allowance.  Persons  who  have  been  retired   on

disciplinary  grounds with reduced pension,  other

than  on grounds of indebtedness will also not  be

eligible.  In order to alleviate the  hardship  of

those  retired on account of indebtedness, it  has

been  decided to include them for payment  of  the

allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, about 4,000 pensioners will

receive  the  new Singapore Allowance.  This  will

cost  the  Singapore Government $1.1  million  per

annum  and  represents an 11 per cent increase  in

the pensions bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress that this ex gratia

allowance  to pensioners resident in Singapore  is

not in any way to be linked with the NWC award for

workers. Whereas the NWC award is really a form of

supplementary  wages to workers which  takes  into

account  the  performance of the economy  and  our

competitive   position   in   labour   costs   and

productivity, this special ex gratia allowance  to

pensioners   is   based  on   entirely   different

considerations.   Regard   was    had    to    the

unprecedented   rise  in  the  cost   of   living,

particularly in the financial year that  is  about

to  end.  However,  there  will  not  be  periodic

adjustments. It would be totally inappropriate  to

refer the matter of payment of pensions to the NWC

for  consideration. Pensions are paid as a  result

of  pensioners having qualified under their agreed

terms of service with the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  the  basis  of equity, will the  Minister  for

Finance  consider  allowing  pensioners,  who  had

retired  prior  to  the  implementation   of   the

recommendations of the Harvey Commission in  1969,

to  consolidate the then cost of living  allowance

into  the  basic  salary? If so, these  pensioners

would  then  be  able to recompute their  pensions

based  on  their  last  drawn  salary  revised  to

incorporate their former basic salaries  and  cost

of  living  allowance, just as though it  was  one

consolidated salary?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to refresh the memory of the Minister,

before  the  Harvey  Commission's  recommendations

were adopted in 1969, there was a basic salary and

a  cost of living allowance. After 1969, the basic

salary  and  the  cost  of living  allowance  were

consolidated   into  one  single   basic   salary.

Therefore,   the  last  drawn  salary   of   those

pensioners who retired before 1969 would  be  only

the basic salary, and those who retired after 1969

would  have  the last drawn salary  as  the  basic

salary plus the cost of living allowance. There is

this difference. On the basis of equity, will  the

Minister' consider allowing those pensioners



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



who   retired  before  1969  to  recompute   their

pension?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is another

question.  It is totally unrelated to the  present

question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[4th  March, 1974], "That Parliament approves  the

financial  policy  of  the  Government   for   the

financial  year  1st April, 1974  to  31st  March,

1975.". - [Minister for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  support the Government's financial policy

for  the financial year 1974-75 as outlined in the

Annual Budget Statement. However, I would like  to

comment  on  the policy and its implementation  in

three particular areas. They are: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Government's role in consumer protection;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Faster development of supporting industries;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Development of teachers in the institutions

of  higher  learning  and  technical  officers  of

public institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is true that there is very little

Singapore can do about rising prices caused mainly

by external factors, the Government can take steps

to  ensure  that  this state  of  affairs  is  not

further  aggravated  by unscrupulous  manipulators

and profiteers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Government has already taken

some  positive  measures to combat rising  prices.

The  setting  up  of  consumer co-operatives,  the

lifting of tariffs on some imported products,  the

campaign  to  educate the public to  refrain  from

hoarding and the public warning given yesterday to

traders and manufacturers against profiteering and

hoarding,  are some of the measures taken  by  the

Government  to protect the consumers. While  these

measures hope to check spiralling prices, they are

by  themselves not sufficient. I submit  that  the

Government  can  and must do more to  protect  the

consumers from profiteers and hazards.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that the Government has enacted the

Sale  of  Food  Act  which,  among  other  things,

prohibits the sale or use of articles dangerous to

health and prevent deception and fraud arising out

of  the  sale  of  food.  The  Act  also  requires

labelling to be informative and ethical and covers

not   only  food  products,  but  also  appliances

intended  for  use in food preparation.  This  Act

should  be  more  vigorously  enforced,  including

imported products. In addition, there is, however,

a need now for the Government to extend protection

to  include more than food products and appliances

for the following reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore consumer lives in a consumer

paradise  and can purchase products from the  four

corners  of  the  globe in any of  our  shops  and

departmental  stores. He also  leads  a  hazardous

life  each  day  he uses certain products  and  is

liable  to  be cheated when he makes a  particular

purchase.   For,   apart  from   the   regulations

governing  food, drugs and medicines,  almost  any

other consumer product can be freely imported  and

sold  to  the  Singapore public. It is unfortunate

that we do not have statistics on the injuries  or

deaths  resulting  from  the  use  of  "hazardous"

consumer products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government firmly believes that our

consumers   need   to  be  protected,   then   the

Government  must  initiate appropriate  action  to

protect the public from the daily hazards of using

questionable  consumer  products  and  from  being

cheated.  Our  buying public is not  sophisticated

enough  or  technically competent to differentiate

trade     marks,     quality    and     misleading

specifications.  All  that  most   consumers   can

understand  are  the differences  in  prices.  The

public  must therefore be helped where they cannot

fully  protect  themselves. This can  be  achieved

through  enacting  a  new  Act  to  regulate   the

importation and sale of a wide variety of consumer

products,  including household products  and  toys

not covered under existing laws. Such an Act will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



also  encourage  and motivate  our  industries  to

produce better quality products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, while we encourage our

industries to improve their technology and upgrade

quality and to manufacture products for local  and

overseas markets, we must at the same time  ensure

that   imported  products  are  equally  reliable.

Otherwise   our  industries  are  handicapped   to

compete even in our own markets and our efforts to

motivate  our  industries  to  better  qualitative

heights will be negated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know of examples of products where the

quality  is  suspect. Many of these  are  imported

products. While we do insist, under the Licence of

Manufacture  Act,  that  our  local  manufacturers

comply   with   certain  requirements,   including

specifications of quantity, performance,  quality,

etc., on their products, most imported products do

not  have to comply with this. To be fair  to  our

manufacturers,  we  must  insist  on  proper   and

informative  labelling of some of  these  imported

products. As a Government, if nothing is done,  we

may  be  accused  by  our local  manufacturers  of

maintaining  double  standards.  The  more  honest

traders  and manufacturers are put in a  difficult

position  as they have to decide whether to  lower

the  quality and hence the price to join  in  this

free-for-all. In the end the consumer suffers. Our

industrialisation programme will also be  affected

in the long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can cite numerous other examples, like

electrical  appliances, paints,  toys  and  toilet

paper, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain authorities can require local

manufacturers  to  strictly  comply  with   safety

requirements, but only the PUB has the power under

the  old  City  Council legislation  to  check  on

imported electrical products. For various reasons,

this  enforcement function has been  neglected  by

the  PUB.  Although  there  has  been  talk  about

amending  the outdated legislation over  the  last

five years, nothing has happened. Perhaps the  PUB

may not be the most appropriate agency now for the

enforcement of the electrical safety requirement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locally manufactured paints are required to meet

certain   specifications.  The  use   of   certain

chemicals   (though  they  may  be   cheaper)   is

prohibited for certain paints, as these  chemicals

may  pollute  the environment. These  requirements

are  not applicable to imported paints, and  there

is  no existing law to compel imported paints even

to  declare their specifications regarding quality

and quantity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, lead-containing materials should not

be  used  for the manufacture of toys in order  to

protect  our  children from lead poisoning,  which

can   lead  to  deterioration  of  health,  mental

retardation or even death. I am not aware  of  any

existing   law  prohibiting  the   use   of   lead

containing materials, including paints in toys, in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of cheating or profiteering,

traders  usually  cheat on quantity  and  quality.

Cheating  in quantity can be more easily detected,

but  cheating  in  quality is  more  difficult  to

detect.  Take  the  case  of  toilet  paper,   for

example.  Consumers are only interested in  buying

them by the rolls, and they buy them cheap without

knowing  either the quality of the  paper  or  the

number  of  sheets that they get per roll.  It  is

known today that there are some tissue paper rolls

in  the  market which have got very big cores  and

therefore  very  little paper on  them.  They  are

cheaper and the paper is, of course, thinner.  The

consumers are thus being cheated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems similar to what I have just cited exist

in  the manufacture of many products, and there is

therefore  a  need  for manufacturers  to  specify

their  products. I would like also to inform  this

House   that   many   developed   countries   have

experienced   the   above   problems   in    their

industrialisation programmes,  and  many  of  them

have  come  out with legislations to  protect  the

consumers as well as the manufacturing sector.  In

the United Kingdom they have the Trade Description

Act. So also some neighbouring countries have come

out with similar acts, and many are considering to

do likewise as their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



societies  become more affluent.  In  the  present

situation  where there is mounting  inflation  and

profiteering,  it is necessary to  have  this  Act

passed  as  soon as possible. The Government  must

have  the  authority  to require  both  local  and

foreign  products to specify, wherever  necessary.

This  will  not  impede trade  because  I  am  not

suggesting  that  we  should  impose   a   blanket

requirement,  other than where it involves  health

and  safety. Other commodities can be so specified

from  time  to  time and, when  necessary,  to  be

incorporated in the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to propose that the

Government should enact a Consumer Protection Act,

very  much  on the lines of the Trade  Description

Act of the United Kingdom to cover commodities and

appliances other than those cited in the  Sale  of

Food  Act.  The Consumer Protection Act  would  in

essence  give powers to the Government to  require

ethical labelling of specified commodities and  to

restrict   the   importation   of   products    of

questionable  quality which would be  against  the

interest   of  our  consuming  public,  or   which

constitutes a danger to safety and health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government may use the services of an

existing   department,  or  establish  a  Consumer

Protection Commission or agency, to carry out  the

stipulated  functions of the  Consumer  Protection

Act. The Commission's basic philosophy would be to

motivate  the  private sector to  provide  product

safety  and  to  educate the  public  to  be  more

conscious  and  critical of product quality,.  The

Commission   should  be  given  a   fairly   broad

enforcement  authority with the power to  purchase

products and to specify products that need  to  be

tested.  It  should also have the  power  to  seek

court   injunctions   to  prevent   non-conforming

products  from entering the market. The Commission

should  work  closely with bodies  such  as  CASE,

whose   members  can  provide  a  useful  feedback

information.  In this way I think  the  Government

will  succeed not only in protecting the interests

and safety of the consumer but will also encourage

and support the growth of industries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



genuinely   concerned  with   higher   technology,

product quality and safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to take up my second point and,

that  is,  the development of adequate  supporting

industries    for   the   Republic's   established

manufacturing sector. Although the Government  has

recognised  the important role of these supporting

industries  and  has  earmarked  $100  million  to

assist in equity participation in the promotion of

these  industries,  relatively  little  has   been

achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the manufacturing sector is bereft of the

complementary  facilities  that  could  have  been

provided    had    our   supporting    industries,

established  during  the  earlier  days   of   our

industrialisation,  succeeded in  upgrading  their

technical  skills and content. What we lack  today

are  a  number of "small" industries,  capable  of

producing  precision  engineering  tool  and   die

making,  production  of higher quality  industrial

products,  better  type  of  electroplating,   and

manufacture  of  more  sophisticated   metal   and

plastic   component   parts   for   our   existing

industries.   Small  but  highly   technologically

oriented supporting industries are in great  need.

Manufacturers  of  electronic calculators,  radios

and other products in Singapore have still to turn

to  Japan,  Taiwan and Hong Kong  for  moulds  and

relatively simple metal and plastic parts for  the

products made here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to urge the Government to

re-examine  critically not so much our  policy  on

supporting industries, but the ways and  means  by

which we are attempting to attract such industries

to Singapore. Admittedly, from an investment point

of  view,  there is not much glamour in attracting

these   industries  to  Singapore  as  a   typical

investment of a supporting industry is usually  in

the  region of $1 million or less. There is a  lot

of   work  involved  and  the  investment  sum  is

relatively  low when compared with the big  multi-nationals.  There  is  therefore  a  tendency   to

concentrate  efforts  to attract  investment  from

multi-nationals almost to the entire exclusion  of

these supporting industries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



I  am  not suggesting, Sir, that we should  reduce

the  intensity  of our efforts to  attract  multi-nationals.  What I am suggesting here  is  that  a

more  positive programme should be  drawn  up  and

equal  priority given to attracting  the  required

supporting  industries to our shores.  For  it  is

these   industries  that  will  form   the   solid

foundation  of  our  industrialisation  programme.

They  will  ultimately  decide  whether  the  next

decade will be as rewarding as the last.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to comment on certain

aspects  of  the Government's policy  on  manpower

development.  The  Government  has  increased  its

grants  to  the  Industrial  Training  Board,  the

Singapore  Polytechnic, the Ngee Ann  College  and

our two universities. These grants are essentially

provided  to  cater for the increasing  intake  of

students  into these institutions. The  policy  is

good,  but  can  it  be  successfully  implemented

without   paying   special   attention   to    the

development  of  the  staff  required  for   these

institutions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, it is a known fact that we have

great  difficulties in recruiting  teaching  staff

for  the tertiary institutions. Why is it so?  Far

too  often, this has been attributed to  the  fact

that the public sector can never compete with  the

private sector in terms of remuneration and perks.

While  money and fringe benefits may be  important

to  some,  there  are  many others  who  would  be

prepared  to  take up teaching positions  provided

there  is  job satisfaction and avenues for  self-betterment. Dedication can only be carried out  so

far,   and   dedication  without  the  concomitant

recognition  and reward will undoubtedly  lead  to

disenchantment and frustration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am suggesting, Sir, that we should create

opportunities  to  enable  lecturers  in  tertiary

institutions  to do a fair amount of research  and

development  work  through the provision  of  more

research  facilities. It is true that we  may  not

see  any tangible results from their research  for

some  time.  We will, however, be able to  attract

the  right type and number of teachers we need for

the expansion of these institutions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



What  can be achieved, also, is an improvement  in

the  morale  of the lecturers, an opportunity  for

self-betterment and development of the  individual

and  a  higher  degree of professionalism  in  the

respective  institutions. All these are  vital  to

the   successful  development  of   our   tertiary

institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would again suggest that we consider seriously

the  provision  of  an annual grant  of,  say,  $2

million   for   research  and   development   work

emanating   from  the  tertiary  institutions   of

education and technical institutions like the PUB,

the  HDB,  PWD,  SISIR, etc.  This  money  can  be

handled by the Ministry of Science and Technology,

for example. We should also look into the question

of  giving incentives for research and development

for  the  technical  and professional  staff  from

these   institutions.  Not  many  civil  servants,

including those in statutory boards, are given big

pay  rises  -  only a few at the top get  it.  The

provision of more facilities in these institutions

will  definitely help decrease staff turnover  and

fossilisation of some individuals. $2 million is a

small sum compared with the sums we spend on these

institutions. At this stage of our development, we

simply  cannot  afford a manpower drain  from  our

technical   and   educational  institutions.   The

development  of manpower, our only resource,  must

be balanced and it should receive more attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that our aim is to develop

Singapore as a centre of excellence, not  only  in

the areas of finance and tourism alone but also in

the  technological competence in certain  selected

fields.  I  would  like  to see  greater  emphasis

placed  on  science  and  technology  related   to

Singapore's development. This is sadly lacking  in

the Budget Statement for 1974-75.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, our able Minister for  Finance  has

once again presented us with a painless budget. In

his Budget Statement not only did he not introduce

any  new  taxes or increase them, he  has  instead

given four tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



concessions. At a time when the common  people  of

Singapore  are  creaking  under  the  pressure  of

inflation, this is a welcome move indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is but a small country. In the

midst  of world-wide inflation, crop failures  and

energy  crisis, Singapore can still stand  solidly

on  its  own.  All these depend on  our  energetic

leadership  and  our hardworking  people.  In  the

turbulent waters of the world, Singapore  is  just

like  a  small boat being tossed about. Our people

realise  the importance of co-operating  with  the

Government  in  such  a  situation.  In  the   new

situation where the era of cheap oil has  come  to

an  end,  there  is all the more a  need  for  the

people   of  Singapore  to  have  faith   in   the

leadership  of  the Government. With  co-operation

between the Government, management, and labour, we

will  be  able  to  increase our  productivity  to

offset  the effects of inflation. With this effort

coming  from  all  quarters, we can  maintain  our

economic growth, though at a lower rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we want to set up a democratic socialist

country  of  justice  and  equality.  This  is   a

principle  that we cannot budge or  change  about.

That is to say, we must bridge the gap between the

rich  and  the  poor, the have and the  have  not,

otherwise  socialist ends cannot be attained.  The

poor then will not go into deeper poverty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor people should be given equal

opportunity to get out of poverty. This is  not  a

very easy task. For some reason or other, the poor

people  have  more children than others.  This  is

either because of the obstinacy of the parents  or

because  of  the  failure of the  family  planning

scheme. I do not wish to quarrel about who  is  at

fault. But these things happened five or six years

or  even  a decade ago. In the light of  a  rising

cost of living, I do not think anybody has got the

guts  to defy inflation and produce more children.

But  what  about those poor families  who  already

have  a lot of children? Instead of helping  them,

it  seems  that some punitive measures  have  been

imposed on them. For example, the fourth child



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



will  not  be given priority in school  enrolment.

School children have to pay unnecessarily more for

miscellaneous school fees and other expenses. Most

of  the poor families with a lot of children  live

either  in  one-room Housing  Board  flats  or  in

dilapidated  attap huts in the rural  areas.  They

find  it  difficult to make ends meet  with  their

present  income.  And  because  of  such  punitive

measures, things have become worse for them. As  a

result,  some  of them either have  to  give  away

their   children  or  to  stop  their   children's

education  in  order to lighten their  burden.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, in this way the poor people who hope

to  get out of poverty by educating their children

will  have their wishes shattered to pieces. Their

children  will  then become drop-outs  because  of

poverty.  If the children are good, they  will  be

prepared to take up odd jobs or work as labourers.

If  they should unfortunately associate themselves

with  bad  hats, they will become gangsters.  They

will  become not only a social burden but  also  a

social threat to our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must make it clear that I am

not  against family planning. What I am saying  is

that  where  poor families with a  big  number  of

children  are  concerned the  mistake  is  a  fait

accompli.  We  should let bygones be  bygones  and

help  lessen  their burden, instead  of  punishing

them  for  what they did in the past by  depriving

them  of the opportunity to educate their children

in  order  to get out of poverty. If  we  do  not,

these poor people will forever be in poverty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these observations, Sir, generally I

fully  endorse  the various points raised  in  the

Minister's speech.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may

I  say  that  I  hope  I can  be  as  diligent  in

balancing my assessment of the Budget Statement as

the  Minister has himself indeed been diligent  in

presenting  us  once  again  with  a  harmoniously

balanced  budget.  There is  some  temptation,  Mr

Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



nowadays to be a little overwrought in our present

economic and social circumstances, when there is a

fair  amount of grumbling, especially about  three

conditions: (a) high prices, (b) the sad state  of

the  bus  system, and (c) non-improvement in  many

ways of the state of many things we see around us,

e.g, road conditions, traffic conditions, quality

of   goods  and  services  we  get,  and  unabated

pollution, especially through smoke from  vehicles

which in many countries is just an important cause

of  pollution as industrial activity, and  so  on.

But,  as  I  have said, we must try to maintain  a

cool outlook and make fair judgments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the credit side, we must admit that during

the  past  fiscal  year, when newspaper  headlines

have  screamed  financial crisis  after  financial

crisis throughout the world, our showing has  been

commendable indeed. We even anticipate  a  revenue

increase in the coming fiscal year, inasmuch  also

as  our  revenue has been steadily increasing,  in

fact, even exceeding our original estimates in the

past.  Although the Government has been  extremely

cost-conscious and, indeed, revenue-conscious  (as

judged by three medals being awarded to our Inland

Revenue officials, with the top medal going to the

top   official),  Government  is  not   completely

without heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge for yourself, Mr Speaker, by the

performance  of  the  Minister  for  Finance  this

afternoon  when  he said pensioners  would  get  a

raise.  I  would  certainly urge  the  Member  for

Moulmein   to   persist  in  his  representations,

considering   the   present   condition   of   the

Minister's heart!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> I will do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> In the present Budget itself,

additional  estate duty exemptions and  remissions

as  well  as  increase in relief for  parents  and

grandparents  have been contrived. The  two  other

items  of  relief, which the Minister has referred

to,  are  not too important for the generality  of

the  public.  But  one  must  also  remember  that

although  property  tax is  a  highly  significant

source of revenue,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



existing owner-occupiers of residential properties

have  been  allowed  to continue  paying  the  old

rates,  despite  upward  revision  of  the  annual

values of their properties. I must urge that  this

status quo should be preserved. Furthermore, since

April  1973, import duties on 149 items have  been

abolished  resulting in a revenue  loss  of  $21.4

million.  The  abolition of  these  import  duties

should  have resulted in the lowering of the  cost

of  certain  items on the market. In  some  cases,

there  has been a reduction in the price of goods.

In  other  cases, maybe the effect  has  not  been

adequately contrived, but I am sure the Member for

Potong Pasir is on the ball.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There we have, Mr Speaker, Sir, these

concessions  made because we have done  relatively

well.   Perhaps  there  could  be   a   few   more

concessions. For one example, increased income tax

reliefs   could  have  been  granted.   It   seems

ridiculous in these days of rising prices to  give

a   personal  relief  of  only  $2,000   for   the

individual  and,  worse,  $1,000  for  his   wife.

Moreover,  a  relief of $1,000 for  earned  income

seems  inadequate when those people who are merely

salaried  are  the  ones who are  hardest  hit  by

inflation  despite a 9 per cent allowance  and  an

additional  $25.  A businessman raises  his  price

corresponding to the increase in his cost,  but  a

person  who is earning a fixed salary governed  by

increments  and NWC awards, which pensioners  will

not  enjoy,  cannot make a commensurate adjustment

to  the  cost  of  living where his  earnings  are

concerned. I wonder, Mr Speaker, Sir, whether  the

Minister for Finance would be too scandalised if 1

suggest   that  the  Government  make  a   further

magnanimous  concession, in this regard,  at  some

appropriate time?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I repeat, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget

indicates  that  we have not done  badly.  Indeed,

like  any good housekeeper, the Government is  not

spending  more than it can pay for.  We  are  even

salting away respectable sums of money in case  of

a  rainy  day. Those who come after us  should  be

grateful  to  us  for very prudent  house-keeping,

where in many other countries governments are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



laying  on  a  debt for those who  come  after  to

shoulder and meet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our very success has resulted in some of our

problems. As the Minister has rightly pointed out,

some  of  our citizens have themselves contributed

to  the inflationary trend by injudicious spending

habits.  During the last Chinese New Year  season,

for  example,  we were treated to the  astonishing

spectacle  of  the price of a certain  species  of

fish reaching astronomical proportions. And if you

were  to visit any of the departmental stores that

are  scattered all over Singapore, you  will  find

them   well-stocked   and   well-patronised,   and

patronised  not  by  the rich but  by  those  with

moderate income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must draw comfort from the fact that our

people  are generally well-housed, in good health,

and  still seem to have money to spend, as we have

been   luckily   spared  the   same   spectre   of

unemployment as has haunted other countries. It is

possible,  however, that one of  the  reasons  why

people  arc spending more money is that they  feel

that  if they do not spend their money now, things

may  be  too costly for them to get later on.  How

Government  may persuade them that  this  attitude

may  not  be in the best interests of the  country

and  of consumers themselves is a matter that must

involve our attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as I said, our very rapid rate of

development  in  the  past few  years  has  caused

problems. For example,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Traffic difficulties have resulted from more

and  more  people  being able to  own  cars.  Road

surfaces  have become more easily damaged  because

of massive use; to facilitate road transportation,

Government  has  this year set aside  a  total  of

$33.1 million for construction and improvement  of

roads and for allied special projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 100,000 people are waiting for Housing Board

flats.  The  more  we build, the  more  there  are

people  who want to take advantage of Government's

provision. Eighty per cent of those on the waiting

list  want to buy. This shows the success  of  our

Housing  and Development Board programme  and  the

high



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



degree   of   acceptability   of   Housing   Board

accommodation - here, also, despite complaints  of

the quality of the finish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Even our well-run container port recently

became  clogged up. I am sure we would not  prefer

to  see  our  wharves  empty and  idle.  But  this

illustrates,  Sir,  that we cannot  achieve  rapid

progress without a certain measure of social cost;

although  steps  should be taken  to  reduce  this

dissonance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned that a small part of the reason

for  the inflationary trend is apparently  due  to

the  fact  that large numbers of people can  still

afford  to  indulge in their consumer preferences.

While  one  has  to  concede  this,  it  might  be

reasonable  to  question  the  extent   to   which

Government  action  has been  taken  to  stem  the

inflationary tide, even if such action would  have

only  a  marginal  effect on the cost  of  living.

Certainly  the Government has taken  a  number  of

economic measures to counter inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where the consumer movement is

concerned, I would have said that much more  could

have  been done by Government to help it along.  I

would  have said that there could have  been  more

information   given  to  consumers   about   those

operations  of  the  market  which  consumers  can

understand  and which they can use  to  help  them

assess  the fairness of prices. However, only  two

days  ago, it was announced that daily price lists

of   certain   essential  food  items   would   be

published, and a special information unit had been

set  up  to guide consumers, and so on. Of course,

we  welcome such measures, Sir. But why  did  they

have to come just before a Budget debate, when, in

the  case of the introduction of one or two taxes,

there  is  no unnecessary delay, and Finance  does

not wait for the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we hope that the Ministry of Finance

will be able to pull out many more rabbits out  of

its  hat,  that will help the consumer.  It  might

insist  that prices be displayed on all  goods  in

places  like provision shops and other  stores  to

help consumers make quick



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



assessments. There should also be some  indication

of   quality,   like   product   description,   or

indication of measures of ingredients. This  is  a

matter  on  which the Member for River Valley  has

touched  on at great length, and I Would  like  to

mention  my  support  of  his  proposal.  To  help

Ministry  of Finance officials, helpers from  CASE

could    be    empowered   to   make   appropriate

investigations,    subject   perhaps    to    such

auxiliaries receiving proper training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the statement

the  Minister for Finance has made about the  high

priority which Government gives to the solving  of

problems   in  road  transport.  This  House   has

witnessed salvo after salvo of questions fired  at

the Minister for Communications over the condition

of the bus system. However, over the last few days

some   improvement  has  been   brought   to   the

situation,  with  supplementary Scheme  B  showing

signs  of  successful operation. But, at best,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, supplementary Scheme B would  be  an

ad hoc measure to patch up conditions temporarily.

In  fact, operating Scheme B is like returning  to

the situation that prevailed decades ago, you will

remember,  Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore  when  we

had  the small mosquito bus services with each bus

operated  by an owner-driver. We have to  look  to

the  improvement  of the SBS.  We  hope  that  the

Minister  for  Communications will  eventually  be

able  to  contrive  for us "a regular,  efficient,

clean and courteous service". These words were the

words the Minister for Communications used in  May

1968, when he spoke of what he would set out to do

in  respect of the dependability of the  transport

service.  Even  at  that  time  the  Minister  was

already    answering   queries    regarding    the

inefficient and poor service of our bus companies.

It  is unfortunate that things should have come to

an even sorrier pass today, six years later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, one must also admit that it is

no  use  wasting  time  over  laments  and  heated

argument.  The  Minister  for  Communications   is

himself most acutely and painfully aware of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



our bus situation. I have no doubt that, if it  is

necessary and feasible for the Government to  take

over the bus service, then this will be done.  The

Minister has shown his determination to maintain a

course   of   action  he  deems  best  under   the

circumstances. Surely this conclusion has not been

reached  without a total assessment of choices.  I

do  not see any alternative to giving the Minister

and   his  aides  a  chance  to  vindicate   their

judgments.  At the same time I would  like  to  be

assured that, while every attempt is being made to

whip  up  the  necessary hardware  -buses,  repair

facilities, and so on -to meet the situation,  the

matter  of  training of relevant  management  both

inside  and outside the SBS is also being  pursued

vigorously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I would like to comment further on a few

other  matters  in  the Finance Minister's  Budget

Statement.  The  Minister  has  referred  to   the

Ministry  of  Education pressing  ahead  with  its

programmes   to   increase  the  second   language

exposure  time in primary schools. He has followed

the paragraph in which he has made this point with

a  paragraph in which he began with a reference to

greater  emphasis  on quality  (in  education).  I

might  just  point  out  that  quality  does   not

automatically flow from greater exposure to second

language.  What  our  pupils  are  exposed  to  is

important. Are they exposed to the best  teaching?

Are  they  exposed to the circumstances  in  which

adequate  aids like textbooks, teaching  materials

and other important adjuncts are easily available?

Quality  will  result from an improvement  in  the

quality  of  the materials our pupils are  exposed

to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again ironically greater exposure to second

language  must necessarily result in less exposure

to   the   original   language   of   instruction.

Certainly,  whatever the terms that are  currently

used,  one language must gain only at the  expense

of  another  where exposure time is concerned.  We

have  already  had  comments  publicly  about  the

lowering  of the standards of English as reflected

in the quality of English that we meet even at the

University, for example. I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



not  be  at  all  surprised that  the  quality  of

Chinese  also  has gone down. It is  necessary  to

look  at  language  teaching  not  only  from  the

viewpoint  of  exposure time  but  also  from  the

viewpoint  of improved methods and of  utilisation

of  all educational resources available. I do  not

think  I need elaborate on this. It is very likely

that the matter is exercising the attention of the

Ministry of Education, but we would like more  and

more practical evidence of our pre-occupation with

quality where education is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to round

off   by  commenting  on  a  certain  spirit  that

pervades the Budget Statement: no feather-bedding;

nothing  is  for  free;  we should  not  encourage

passengers  (in this regard, I am  a  little  more

hopeful  now  that the Singapore Bus Service  Ltd.

will not take this injunction too literally). With

economic patterns being radically altered  by  the

oil  crisis, I think our people would do  well  to

take  even  more  alert notice  of  this  sort  of

philosophy,  and prepare also to make  alterations

to  their style of living. Our citizens must,  for

example, learn to co-operate more to fight against

profiteering and indigenously-inspired  inflation.

We  must co-operate to bring our crime rate  down.

We  must co-operate to stem the traffic chaos that

will inevitably result if everybody wants to drive

to town as the lone passenger in his car. When the

improvement   of  the  bus  system   comes   about

adequately, we must be prepared to park our car in

the  periphery of the city centre and go into town

by public transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as our citizens learn to co-operate more closely with one another, I think,

Government   itself  should  pay  a  little   more

attention to cultural development in Singapore.  I

hope  to  say  a  little more on this  during  the

debate   on   the  Estimates,  but  our  financial

officials  should  remember that  the  returns  to

culture  are  not  calculable  only  in  terms  of

dollars and cents; that sound cultural values  and

development are real contributions to the  welfare

of our people, the welfare of our State. Although,

if our Budget officials ask,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



"What is the profitability in encouraging cultural

development?", it would be difficult to explain to

them.  To illustrate that we cannot make a  proper

cost-benefit analysis of culture unless  we  bring

all sorts of imponderables into consideration, let

me  refer  to  a  rather well-worn joke  in  music

circles about the efficiency expert hired to  make

a time and motion study of a symphony orchestra in

performance. This efficiency expert reported  with

horror   that  the  overall  efficiency   of   the

orchestra was barely over 50 per cent because many

of  the musicians were actually playing only  part

of  the  time. I hope that it is not this kind  of

misguided  attitude  that  will  characterise  the

attitude  also  of Government in  respect  of  the

future   development   of   cultural   policy   in

Singapore, in respect of which incidentally I have

looked  in vain in the Budget Statement  for  some

reference. Despite this, Sir, I beg to support the

financial policy of Government as outlined in  the

Budget.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  thank the Hon. Minister for Finance  for

his   very  clear  and  lucid  exposition  of  the

economic situation obtaining in Singapore, and for

his  realistic and frank appraisal of the problems

confronting our nation in the year ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three crucial factors that are felt acutely

by  the  workers of Singapore, namely, oil prices,

imported  inflation and currency instability,  are

matters  of  concern to all of  us,  because  even

though  there may be long-term solutions,  in  the

short  term,  they  generate  problems.  In   this

context, the tax reliefs announced by the Minister

are  no doubt welcomed by all but may I, with your

indulgence,  Sir, touch on a few  points  where  I

feel that sufficient thought may not possibly have

been  given,  for reasons that perhaps  I  am  not

aware.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would first like to touch upon the

question   of   tax   relief   for   parents   and

grandparents, which has been raised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



from $300 per year to $750 per year per dependant.

While,  no  doubt, this relief  is  welcome  to  a

number  of  people  and is a  step  in  the  right

direction, I would like to enquire whether we know

exactly  the number of taxpayers who will  benefit

by  this concession. In other words, Sir, can  the

Minister   inform  us  how  many  taxpayers   will

actually  benefit  by  this  concession?  This  is

important  because  our  people  should  know  the

extent  of  relief granted under the head,  Income

Tax. I ask this question, Sir, because it seems to

me  that  the  larger  area where  tax  relief  is

required,  has  not been touched  upon.  And  this

concerns  personal relief in income tax.  Personal

relief,  Sir,  stands  at $2,000  per  year,  plus

$1,000 relief for earned income. And this personal

relief of $2,000 was fixed more than 20 years ago,

when incomes were much lower, and purchasing power

much higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has stated that consumer prices

rose  by  an  average of 22.9 per  cent  over  the

previous  year  alone. In that context,  how  much

more then must consumer prices have increased over

the  last 20 years, since the tax relief of $2,000

per  head  was  first fixed? Sir, I presume  I  am

right  in  saying that, when tax relief of  $2,000

was  fixed more than 20 years ago, the figure  was

arrived  at  after careful study, and that  $2,000

was considered to be an equitable minimum to allow

for a reasonable standard of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rise in the cost of living, there has

been  practically no increase in personal  relief,

except  for  the $1,000 allowed as earned  income,

introduced some years ago. And I am sure you  will

appreciate  that if the consumer price  index  had

risen  by an average of nearly 25 per cent  during

the  last  year, surely it has gone up many  times

since  the figure of $2,000 relief was fixed.  The

final  result is that the poor have become poorer,

and the tax sits heavily on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is required, Sir, is for personal relief to

be  increased  to a more realistic  and  pragmatic

level, in keeping with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



the   inflationary  trends  which   the   Minister

referred  to earlier. Only then will there  be  an

incentive  for  our people to work harder  because

only  then will they be able to retain the  fruits

of  their  labour, instead of having  it  siphoned

away  on  the one hand by income tax and,  on  the

other hand, by inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every now and then, we hear exhortations and

warnings that higher wages can only be related  to

higher  productivity. While this is undoubtedly  a

reasonable  dictum,  what  is  the  incentive,  if

higher  wages, resulting from higher productivity,

are  negated  by  taxation and inflation?  Sir,  I

submit  that  there is no incentive. And,  if  the

present state of affairs carries on, we will  only

be   stifling  our  workers'  desire  for   higher

productivity and higher wages.



<br><br>3.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Hon. Minister for Finance has taken  the

sting  out  of the Budget debate. It is  customary

for  Finance Ministers to increase taxes or impose

new  taxes  during Budget time. Since 1969  we  in

Singapore have begun to look forward to the Budget

debate for tax concessions that the Government was

going  to make and not new taxes that it was going

to  impose. This has become a habit over the  last

couple  of  years. Newspapers have stopped  gazing

the  crystal ball to predict new taxation measures

that  the  Minister was going to impose. In  fact,

they  have even stopped taking photographs of  the

Minister  walking into Parliament  House  carrying

the  dreaded black box containing all the terrible

new  or increased taxation measures the Government

was going to impose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I compliment the Minister for Finance on his

economic  survey  of Singapore for  1973  and  his

Budget Statement. Since last year, this has become

a  new  innovation and the comprehensive  economic

survey  and  our  economic policy have  been  very

illuminating as well as educational. The method of

presenting  these to Parliament  in  the  form  of

tabled  statements allows for proper and  detailed

study.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note that the Government is

aware   that  in  spite  of  the  National   Wages

Council's  recommendations of the past two  years,

the  rapid  rise in cost of living has offset  any

wage increases. Real wages for workers, therefore,

have  declined, in spite of the fact  that  profit

margins   in   the   manufacturing   sector   have

increased. The interim NWC recommendation for 1974

has  been  a  welcome relief for the lower  income

group.  We have no doubt that the decline in  real

wages   for   workers   would   be   taken    into

consideration  when  the next NWC  recommendations

are  made  in July. We on our part are willing  to

work with the Government and the entrepreneurs  to

increase  productivity so that  our  manufactured,

quality products would be competitively priced  in

foreign markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our careful anti-inflationary

policies  of  the past, we have had a  very  small

rise  in  cost of living until about  three  years

ago.  But  in  the  past three years  or  so,  our

consumer price index has risen very, very  sharply

although   it   does  not  appear   excessive   in

comparison  with  the developed countries,  having

regard to the fact that we are not food producers.

Food  prices rose by 35.5 per cent in  1973.  This

year,  in  the  past two and a half months  alone,

there  have  been  further substantial  increases.

Although  these increases are mainly  external  in

origin, I appreciate that the Government is  doing

all  it  can to reduce the continuous increase  in

prices  of essential commodities brought about  by

local  forces. During FY 73 the Government  lifted

import  duties, according to the Minister's survey

on  149  items  of  a  wide range  of  foodstuffs,

household  appliances and construction  materials.

Lifting  of import duties must result in reduction

of  prices of these items. This aspect of  pricing

of the products after the removal of import duties

has  not been properly followed up. I welcome  the

interest  shown  and the recent  activity  of  the

Trade  Division  of  the Ministry  of  Finance  in

warning  profiteers and traders who either  marked

up prices or indulged in short-selling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



The  Consumers' Association of Singapore has  made

its contribution, within its competence of limited

resources,  but  no  amount  of  consumer   action

without  the  help of the Trade  Division  can  be

successful  when we have in our midst  greedy  and

anti-social wholesalers and retailers who want  to

make a quick buck.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers associations in most parts of the

world  are financed substantially by public funds.

In   the   Scandinavian  countries,   France   and

Switzerland, the government finances the consumers

associations to an extent of 100 per cent  of  the

expenses.  In most other countries, the government

subsidizes    the   consumers   organisation    by

substantial amounts. In Singapore, the  Consumers'

Association of Singapore has been to-date financed

by  the  NTUC  by  more than 70 per  cent.  It  is

gratifying  to note that this year the  Government

has  decided  to  assist CASE with some  financial

contribution.  If CASE is to be expected  to  play

its  part more vigorously, then CASE must also try

to  help itself and not just depend on the Finance

Minister's  handout, that is, its membership  must

increase  with a consequential additional  support

from the Government. The trouble with CASE is that

there are far too many critics of CASE and too few

members  who  grudge paying $6 per  year  but  are

quite free with their criticisms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the taxation policy and

changes  for FY 74. It appears as if our  Minister

for Finance has anticipated the sort of criticisms

that  Backbenchers  like me  would  make  and,  in

anticipation,  he  has  justified   the   taxation

measures that were introduced recently. It is said

that  attack is the best form of defence.  In  the

case of our Finance Minister, it appears as if his

policy is justification even before being accused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has taken cognizance of the views expressed

by Members of Parliament, in particular the Member

for  Katong and myself, in respect of estate  duty

on houses owned by wage earners. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



higher  exemption and remission limits  of  estate

duty would relieve large numbers of the middle and

lower  income group house-owners. This is  how  it

should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision of tax relief for dependent parents

and  grandparents as touched upon by my colleague,

the  Member for Bras Basah, from $300 to  $750  at

least  brings parents and grandparents to an equal

footing  with  the first grandchild  who  is  also

being given a relief of $750. Let us hope that  by

FY  75  the Minister will consider increasing  tax

relief  for wives as well. The high cost of living

has also spread to the high cost of maintaining  a

wife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot really follow what we gain by

giving  incentives  to  foreign  ship-owners   for

registering their ships in Singapore.  This  is  a

concession which should not be given at all. I  do

not  know what benefit this concession brings  us.

Ships registered in foreign countries are known in

shipping circles as "flag of convenience" vessels.

Some   countries   which   encourage   "flag    of

convenience"  ships are Panama,  Liberia,  Somalia

and  Honduras.  How  does  Singapore  benefit   by

joining this "flag of convenience" league? Many of

the  ships registered in the countries I mentioned

earlier on including Singapore sail the seven seas

but  never  to the country in which  the  ship  is

registered.  The  foreign  ship-owners  of   these

Singapore registered vessels would not hesitate to

register   their  ships  in  any   other   country

tomorrow,  provided  they  are  offered   slightly

better  incentives for some reasons of their  own.

Sir,  may I submit that Singapore's good name  and

its flag would be tarnished if we are listed as  a

"flag  of  convenience" nation. If the concessions

given  are  in  respect of genuine  locally  owned

ships  which call at our port and employ,  if  not

all, some of our crew, then I have no quarrel with

the tax concessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to life insurance

concession. Life insurance has not been so popular

among  the  Singapore public and in the  past  the

benefits of life insurance were enjoyed mostly  by

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



small  proportion of the wealthier citizens.  Only

recently,  the general consciousness has increased

and  many persons from the lower and middle income

groups,  notably from the membership of the  trade

unions,  have been coming forward to save  through

life insurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Minister gave considerable help

to  these insuring people in the lower and  middle

income  groups by removing the limit of  one-sixth

of  their assessable income which applied  to  the

amount  of income tax relief available in  respect

of    life    policy   premiums   together    with

contributions  to  the  CPF  and  other   approved

provident funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change in the taxation basis of the

purchased  life  annuity  now  proposed   by   the

Minister  will  no  doubt open  up  for  the  life

offices  an opportunity to develop a new  type  of

insurance   cover   but  will   also   allow   the

policyholders a valuable option to receive  claims

proceeds either in a lump sum or in the form of an

annuity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher exemption from estate duty will also

enhance the net value of life insurance policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, therefore, welcoming all these measures

which  should help spread the protection  of  life

insurance   among  the  masses  and  enhance   the

financial security of the policyholders and  their

families,  may  I ask the Minister to  consider  a

suitable  amendment to section 44 of the Insurance

Act? The provisions of section 44 of the Insurance

Act  help beneficiaries of life policies to obtain

quick  settlement of their claims if  the  amounts

payable do not exceed $10,000. Now as an estate up

to  $50,000 is to be exempted from estate duty,  a

corresponding change in the provisions of  section

44 of the Insurance Act would seem logical.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  in  the  previous year we are again  presented

with a painless Budget. In welcoming the Statement

from the Minister for Finance, in particular,  the

tax concessions, one should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



not  however  overlook the series of  departmental

exercises  in  tax increases of an  indirect  form

that  have occurred during the year under  review,

which  have inevitably inflicted pains of  varying

degrees. If our citizens have suffered the  pinch,

they  can  at least take consolation in  the  fact

that  whatever monies collected by the  Government

have been and will no doubt continue to be put  to

good use that will produce lasting benefits to the

country  and bring about wellbeing to the  people.

No  public funds have been squandered on  wasteful

monumental  white  elephant projects  carried  out

under  the pretext of national prestige. Nor  have

any  funds  finished  up  lining  the  coffers  of

individuals.  All  funds have  been  wisely  spent

either   in  the  strengthening  of  our  national

security,  the  upgrading of social and  community

services,  or in the active promotion of  economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic prosperity and social stability

that  we  enjoy today have been due  in  no  small

measure  to the successful implementation  of  the

Counter   Recession  Strategy   adopted   by   the

Government in 1968, when we were threatened  by  a

possible  recession consequent  upon  the  British

military   withdrawal.   By   spending   available

surpluses  from  revenues in the right  direction,

such  as urban redevelopment and the promotion  of

industrialisation,  the Government  has  not  only

acted as catalysts but also provided the necessary

stimulants  for  greater economic  progress  which

have  culminated in an unprecedented state of full

employment. There is therefore a lot  to  be  said

for  our  not  subscribing to the  "something  for

nothing"  philosophy. However, in the  maintenance

and  extension  of  public  services,  every  care

should   be   exercised  to  ensure   that   those

responsible  for the implementation of  Government

policies  do  not become over obsessed  by  profit

motive  only  and  overlook the  commitment  of  a

government  to the underlying social good  of  the

community. In any society there arc to be found  a

certain number of underprivileged and needy people

who, not due to the lack of trying, have failed to

make the grade. They need a helping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



hand   from  somewhere,  and  I  feel   that   our

philosophy  should  be one  based  on  "the  least

number   of  passengers"  and  not  one   on   "no

passengers".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we look forward to another year there is

indeed  much cause for concern. The chaotic  state

of  the  world  economy  today  has  rendered  any

forecast  well-nigh impossible. To what extent  we

will  be  affected, it is obviously  difficult  to

make  an accurate guess, although it is heartening

to  note the Minister's Statement that if  we  all

pull  together we may still be able to  achieve  a

real growth rate of some 10 per cent per annum. To

achieve  this,  he has prescribed the  formula  of

higher  productivity  and lower  wastage  for  the

manufacturing sector. In addition,  Sir,  I  would

suggest  that  it is time for more  active  export

promotion  by Government in conjunction  with  the

private  sector.  The  oil  crisis  has  overnight

changed  the  entire  pattern of  distribution  of

wealth among nations; consequently the transfer of

purchasing  powers and perhaps radical changes  in

demand patterns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensive market research is obviously necessary

to  identify  the extent and the  nature  of  such

changes  so  as to assist us in adjusting  to  the

fast changing situation and in making sure of  our

fair share of the world market. In this connection

active support, financial and otherwise, should be

provided   by  the  Government  even  though   the

ultimate  success  rests  upon  the  awareness  of

managements  of the importance of maintaining  our

competitive  edge by becoming more  efficient  and

better  informed of market conditions. Whilst  the

manufacturing sector has been and will continue to

be our leading growth sector, it is encouraging to

note  that the Minister has not lost sight of  the

potentials   of   our  services  sector,   namely,

financial,   banking,  insurance,  transport   and

communications institutions. There  are  unlimited

scopes  in  these fields for us  to  step  up  our

invisible  earnings,  and I  do  hope  that  every

assistance  and  encouragement will  be  given  to

these industries in the extension of their ser-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



vices abroad by way of tax and other incentives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at home, inflation will become part of our

everyday life and we shall have to learn  to  live

with  it.  Whilst I am pleased that the Government

is  taking  measures  to minimise  the  effect  of

inflation  in  so  far as goods are  concerned,  I

would  again  urge the Government to give  serious

consideration  to  introducing measures  to  limit

increases  in  housing  rents,  particularly   for

houses  occupied  by people in  the  lower  income

group.  It  is  appreciated that the  Housing  and

Development  Board is doing its utmost  but  until

such  time as the long waiting list for HDB  flats

is  shortened,  something  of  an  interim  nature

should  be  done to prevent unscrupulous landlords

from  taking  undue advantage of the situation  by

hiking rents, in many instances by several hundred

percent  in  any  one year. This  is  an  area  of

inflation  which  is  clearly  not  imported,  and

therefore well within our control.



<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in the Budget Statement on the financial policy of

the  Government for the coming year, the  Minister

for Finance has briefly touched on the subject  of

road transport, which has attracted much attention

and debate both inside and outside this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that the solving of urban

transportation   problems  has  been   given   top

priority,  and I am particularly pleased  to  note

the  setting  up of the high level Road  Transport

Action  Committee  which I  consider  is  a  major

administrative step in the right direction.  Urban

transportation problems cannot be cured solely  by

"transportation"  solutions.  As  we  know,  motor

vehicles move because people want them to move  in

connection  with  their  various  activities,  and

traffic  is therefore fundamentally a function  of

activities.  This also explains why  there  is  so

much  traffic  in  the Central  Business  District

because  activities  are concentrated  there.  And

since the intensity of activities is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



directly  related to the intensity  of  land  use,

traffic  is also similarly regarded as a  function

of land use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Communications has rightly

pointed  out yesterday in his reply to the  Member

for  Kallang, the problem we face is one faced  by

all big cities. The number of people going to work

in  the  CBD  has increased more than  five  times

since the redevelopment of the CBD, but road space

has  expanded  less than twice to  cater  for  the

vehicles  carrying  people to work  there.  It  is

obvious, therefore, that our present deteriorating

urban traffic situation is not merely due to  poor

management  of  the public bus services,  and  the

situation   can   neither  be  saved   by   simply

nationalising  the SBS. As the roads  are  already

occupying more than one-third of the land space in

the Central area today, to further expand the road

space  would mean less space for human  activities

for which a planned city is basically intended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications is to be

congratulated for the introduction of the  various

bold  measures of traffic management, such as  the

adoption of the one-way system, reserved bus  lane

system,  and  the impending park-and-ride  system,

car  parking restriction in the Central  area  and

other  pricing  policies,  to  solve  the  current

problems.  But traffic management alone could  not

for  long  prevent  further deterioration  of  the

traffic  situation  if  the  CBD  activities  were

allowed to continue to be intensified, regardless.

The   problem   is   essentially   a   matter   of

rationalising  the arrangement of  activities  and

transportation system, and the urgent need to have

a   carefully   planned  economic   and   physical

development programme to ensure that land use  and

transportation policies are properly co-ordinated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Government is aware that whatever

form  of  long-term traffic solution  is  adopted,

either  with  or  without MRT,  it  will  have  an

immense   impact   on  our  strategic   land   use

arrangement and distribution of activities  within

this  City  State. Therefore, there is  an  urgent

need for much closer co-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



ordination   between  ministeries   and   agencies

responsible   for  land  use  and   transportation

policies.  Perhaps  this  may  best  be   achieved

through  another high-level body  similar  to  the

Road Transport Action Committee. There is also the

need  for  an  early  decision on  the  long-range

traffic solution, whether with or without MRT,  as

this will go a long way to assist other Government

agencies to plan and programme for the development

of  utility  services and infrastructure,  and  to

guide other major public and private developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the physical constriction of our City

State,   the  existing  and  future  pattern   and

intensity  of  urbanisation, as reflected  in  our

public  housing policy, inner city  policy,  etc.,

and the stated intention to develop Singapore as a

brain  services centre, I am of the  opinion  that

our   island  Republic,  as  distinct  from  other

cities,  has  the necessary pre-conditions  for  a

viable MRT system. The existing mode and system of

road-base    public   transportation    has    its

operational  limitation  under  the   same   urban

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with these observations, I give

my  support to the motion standing in the name  of

the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the

Suspension  now. I will take the  Chair  again  at 5.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I fully support the financial policy

presented by the Minister for Finance on  the  4th

of  March.  In this Budget, not only no new  taxes

are imposed but instead there are four tax reliefs

or  concessions  which result in  a  reduction  in

revenue  of  about $9 million.  In  the  midst  of

international  inflation and general  increase  in

the prices of commodities, and the oil crisis,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister for Finance has been able to present

yet  another painless budget. This is indeed  rare

and praiseworthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the total sums in the Budget

have  shown  an  increase  both  in  revenue   and

expenditure.   This   is  a  reflection   of   the

satisfactory  growth  rates of  our  economy.  For

example, in terms of revenue, our total revenue is

expected  to  reach  the figure of  $2,322,950,000

which represents an increase of $448,050,000. This

is  an  appreciable increase and it goes  to  show

that  there has been satisfactory growth  in  such

industries  as  manufacturing,  ship-building  and

ship-repairing, tourism, and other  services.  The

result   is  that  revenue  is  showing   constant

increase  and  this  is something  which  deserves

praise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of expenditure, Defence and Education

represent  the greatest. The large expenditure  on

Defence is necessary in order to establish a sound

and   efficient  defence  system  to  secure   our

sovereignty,    independence,   and    territorial

integrity. Mr Speaker, Sir, the $300 million which

is  going to be spent on the Ministry of Education

is  to develop national education so that all  our

people will benefit from it. We cannot, therefore,

criticise  the expenditure provided for these  two

Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is only a small increase in

expenditure   for  Health,  Social  Welfare,   and

Primary  Production. This is not adequate.  As  we

know,  with  an increased population, there  is  a

greater need for medical and health services,  and

therefore  the  Government  should  increase   the

provision for Health Services. We should also  not

be miserly in the provision for Social Welfare, so

that the unfortunate people in our society can  be

better  looked after and better cared  for.  These

measures  are  not meant to encourage "parasites",

but rather we have a social responsibility towards

these  unfortunate people. The provision  for  the

Primary  Production  Department  should  also   be

increased  so  that  more  research  work  can  be

conducted to increase the supply of vegetables and

meat in our country. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>





should  also like to see a reduction in the prices

of these items, thereby reducing the burden on our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although there is an

international trade recession, our external  trade

has  performed  exceptionally well,  reaching  the

figure  of over $20,000 million. This is indeed  a

glorious record. The fact that our external  trade

has  been able to achieve such heights is  due  to

the   presence   of   a  good  harbour   and   our

geographical  position.  In  addition,  the  early

introduction of containerisation and the increased

efficiency in dealing with imports and exports are

also     basic    factors.    Besides    excellent

infrastructure and other essential facilities, the

most  important factor is the development  of  our

industries and manufacturing. We must also improve

the quality of our products so that we can compete

in  international  markets. In  order  to  achieve

these objectives, our workers should work hard and

constantly  seek to improve the quality  of  their

skills.  However, Our workers should be adequately

rewarded  for  being diligent  and  hard  working,

especially  in  a time of inflation.  Our  workers

should  be given reasonable rewards so that  their

families can have a decent life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has granted four

tax  reliefs  and  concessions. I  would  like  to

express my wholehearted support and admiration for

him.  Apart  from the registration of  ships,  the

majority of our people will benefit from the other

three items. This goes to show that our Government

is  concerned  with the welfare of the  lower  and

middle income groups. But there is one item of tax

relief  which has not been increased, and that  is

the   personal   relief  for  income   tax.   This

unfortunately   has  led  to  a  great   deal   of

disappointment. As we all know, the present amount

of relief was fixed 20 years ago. There is a world

of  difference between the cost of living then and

the cost of living now. The Minister has said that

the  consumer price index during last  year  alone

has  risen  by  23  per cent.  I  would  urge  the

Minister  to  consider  soon  the  question  of  a

greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



personal  relief in order to reduce the burden  of

the taxpayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a Member for a rural constituency, I

have  paid  particular attention to the  financial

provision for rural development. I remember during

last   year's  Budget  debate,  I  requested   the

Minister to consider increasing the provision  for

rural  development, and he promised that he  would

consider. Since then, I have been looking  through

the  various  items in the Budget for  this  year,

greatly  hoping that there would be a  substantial

increase  in  the provision for rural development.

But  I notice that there is only a slight increase

in the various items. This will bring some benefit

to our people, as the projects in the construction

of  roads  in rural constituencies like Sembawang,

Nee  Soon,  Chua Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang,  Jurong,

Punggol may be completed smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree completely with the Minister for

Finance  when he said that we are faced with  many

challenges  in the years ahead. These include  the

currency crisis, the problem of inflation, and the

various  difficulties encountered in  our  way  of

life  and  livelihood. In order to overcome  these

difficulties and hardships, I think we  should  do

this.  Firstly,  all our people should  co-operate

with    the    Government   to   overcome    these

difficulties. Secondly, we should conduct a thrift

campaign  to cut down all unnecessary expenditure.

Thirdly, our workers should work hard and increase

their  productivity  so  that  the  economy   will

continue   to   thrive.   Fourthly,   labour   and

management  should co-operate to ensure industrial

peace.  If  all our people can open up  additional

avenues and cut down unnecessary waste, and strive

forward,  I  am  sure we shall be  able  to  march

forward to a healthy and steady year.



<br><br>5.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I am glad that the Minister for Finance  has

presented another painless budget to this House on

the 4th of March, 1974. Not only will there be  no

new taxes, but at the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



time  he was generous enough to give us a few  tax

concessions.  The young people who are  supporting

their  parents and grandparents are happy to  know

that the Minister for Finance has kindly agreed to

increase the tax relief for dependent parents  and

grandparents  from  $300 to  $750  per  dependant.

However, I hope the Minister for Finance will give

further consideration to increase it to $1,000 per

dependant, especially in view of the present  high

cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, everywhere you go in Singapore,

you  will hear people talking about price  hiking,

profiteering, the bus service is giving a  lot  of

inconvenience,  frustration and disappointment  to

the  commuters,  and other things affecting  their

daily  life. The newspapers report about shortages

of  food  and  raw  materials, trade  associations

announce  price  increases,  unemployment  on  the

increase  in  other countries, more  young  people

taking  drugs,  and  more  people  are  committing

suicide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is facing some of these difficulties

but  the  people  here  are  much  more  fortunate

because we still maintain political, economic  and

industrial stability. There is economic growth and

industrial  expansion. There is full  co-operation

between   management  and  labour,  as   well   as

Government. We are happy that there is almost full

employment  in  Singapore. More than  50,000  jobs

were created last year. I believe that so long  as

we  continue this tripartite co-operation, we  can

meet   all   the   challenges  and  overcome   the

difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that prices of commodities have

gone up because of global inflation, uncertainties

in   the   international  monetary   system,   oil

production cut and increase of oil prices  by  all

the  oil producing countries, shortage of food and

raw materials, and other causes. Singapore has  no

natural  resources like oil, gold, timber, rubber,

tin, copra or rice, and we have to import all  the

things we want from other countries; therefore, we

have to pay for the prices they demand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one would object to the reasonable and fair

increase  of  prices of things. What  we  strongly

object  to  is the deliberate spreading of  rumour

that  there  is a shortage of certain commodities,

for  example,  sugar, followed  by  hoarding,  and

finally increase in price. Luckily, our Government

has the capacity to deal with it by releasing more

sugar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of repeated warnings by the

Government, profiteering is still going on. Giving

warnings   only  will  not  have  the  effect   of

restraining them from hoarding or profiteering. In

fact,  it  has  reached  a stage  where  they  are

determined  to get the maximum profit and  to  get

rich as quickly as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are aware that the Government is

doing  its  best to lessen the impact of inflation

and to curb price hiking by profiteers. The people

feel  strongly that the Government is too  lenient

towards the profiteers. So many warnings have been

given  to  them,  but no drastic action  has  been

taken.  So  far,  there has  been  no  prosecution

against anyone indulging in hoarding, profiteering

and  giving short-weight in goods, like bread, for

example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC is also doing its best to deal with the

present inflation and price hiking. It has already

established two co-operative supermarkets, one  in

Toa  Payoh and the other in Bukit Ho Swee. Another

two  supermarkets will be established, at  Selegie

Centre  and Serangoon Gardens. Also NTUC's WELCOME

will  establish more supermarkets in  the  various

housing estates in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the general feeling of workers in Singapore

is  that the Government can control wage increases

very  well  but it is unable to exercise effective

control   over  unreasonable  price   hiking   and

profiteering. The time is overdue already for  the

Government  to  take drastic action  against  them

immediately.  These hoarders and  profiteers  care

for  their ownselves in making more money, getting

rich  quickly and enjoying wine, women  and  song.

They do not have the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



slightest  concern  for our national  interest.  I

strongly  urge  the Government to prosecute  them,

fine  them  heavily, put them  in  prison,  cancel

their  licences  and confiscate  their  goods  for

hoarding and profiteering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Government action alone will not help

solve  the whole problem. It is necessary  in  the

national interest that all workers, employers  and

the  people co-operate with the Government to deal

with   these  disgraceful,  shameless,   parasitic

hoarders   and  profiteers.  These  hoarders   and

profiteers  are  indeed "social  cancers"  in  our

society, and we have to eliminate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers fully appreciate Government's

acceptance of the National Wages Council's interim

wage supplement of $25 per month to those who  are

earning less than $1,000 with effect from February

1974, to be followed by another recommendation  in

July 1974. I hope the final National Wages Council

recommendation in July 1974 will give more to  the

workers  who  are  in  the  lower  income   group,

especially those who are earning less than $300  a

month.  This $25 will at least help to lessen  the

financial  strain  of  the  workers  to  meet  the

present  high  cost of living. I am sure  all  the

unionised workers will get the $25, but I am  very

doubtful  whether  all  the non-unionised  workers

will  get  the $25 from their employers.  1  would

strongly urge them to join a union in order to get

not only the $25 but also to obtain other benefits

as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Minister for Finance that

to  meet the difficulties we have to face in 1974,

concerted   efforts  by  employers  and   workers,

producers,  traders and consumers must  match  the

Government's  own  efforts  to  achieve  continued

economic growth, with inflation kept down  as  low

as  possible.  He  also mentioned  in  his  Budget

Speech  that  employers and  employees  must  move

vigorously towards productivity increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the workers agree to the need

to increase production. But what about giving them

a productivity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



bonus?  Most  employers are very vociferous  about

increasing  productivity  but  very  silent  about

giving  a productivity bonus. They would not  even

care  to  mention  about it. When  employers  make

substantial  profit,  they  just  keep  quiet  and

expect the employees to work harder. When they are

losing  business or getting less profit, they  run

to  the  workers  and  tell them  their  woes  and

miseries. Subsequently, they will retrench as many

workers  as  possible. Where is  the  justice  and

fairness  to  the  workers?  Employers  pay  wages

according to the services rendered by the workers.

If  they  work  harder and make extra  efforts  to

boost production, employers make extra profit  and

therefore  they  must  give a productivity  bonus.

There  is  nothing  free in this world,  including

labour service on productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of criticism has been published in the

press  expressing dissatisfaction with the present

bus  service - the buses are dirty, polluting  the

air  with  black  smoke from their exhaust  pipes,

irregularity in running the bus schedules, drivers

refuse to stop at bus stops, conductors are  rude,

frequent  breakdown  of  buses.  Of  course,   the

commuters  have  some of their own  faults  to  be

blamed for. I would not like to add any more  fuel

to   the  fire,  but  may  I  just  make   a   few

recommendations to improve the bus service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Expedite the repair of the 400 buses. (2)

Expedite  buying  of more new buses  to  ease  the

acute  shortage of buses. (3) The Management  must

hear  the grievances and difficulties of  the  bus

workers.   Also  to  consider  their   views   and

recommendations  to  achieve  an   efficient   bus

service to the satisfaction of the commuters,  bus

workers  and  Management.  Management,  Union  and

Government  must do their very best to solve  this

problem.  (4)  The Management to  consider  giving

shares to the bus workers as incentive bonus. This

will  make  them part-owners, when  they  will  of

course, work harder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the detailed reply and assurance

given  by  the  Minister  for  Communications   in

Parliament   yesterday  to  further  improve   the

efficiency of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



the  bus  service, let us all hope  that  it  will

operate  efficiently as soon as possible.  I  must

add   here   that  the  successful  and  efficient

operation of the bus service requires the full co-operation of the bus commuters as well. They  must

also  appreciate  the  difficulties  of  the   bus

drivers and conductors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance in his

Budget  Statement  on 4th March,  1974,  mentioned

that  the  average price of crude oil is now  well

over US$8 (S$20) a barrel, which means a four-fold

increase in price over the pre-October 1973  rate.

This  sudden and rapid increase of the  crude  oil

prices  has  created  an economic  burden  on  the

balance of payments of consumer nations, not  only

to  the  developed  countries but  the  developing

countries  as  well.  The oil producing  countries

will  be  getting a lot of money  from  their  oil

supplies.  In  fact,  millions  and  millions   of

dollars  are pouring into their coffers, and  they

are  faced  with the problem of how to  spend  the

money. All the oil companies in the world are also

making hundreds of millions or billions of dollars

because  of  the  oil crisis and increase  of  oil

prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here is a report from the Straits Times of

5th February, 1974, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Exxon Corporation .., annual earnings of US$2.44

billion.  Texaco, the third largest but second  in

profits, registered $1.29 billion.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`So far, 16 of the US's 20 largest oil companies

have reported their 1973 results, and they add  up

to nearly $8 billion in profits for the year.'



There is another report from the Straits Times  of

2nd March, 1974. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Royal Dutch/Shell group reports net income

for  1973 has risen from �281.7 million to  �730.0

million  on  sales  proceeds  of  �10,558  million

against �7,961 million.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Bank of Japan survey, Singapore

and  eight  other nations would lose  a  total  of

about  $6,750 million because of higher crude  oil

prices. Other developing countries are facing  the

same problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the possible settlement of the

conflict  in  the Middle East countries,  I  would

like to appeal to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



national leaders of the oil producing countries to

give serious consideration to restore the oil  cut

as  soon  as possible and not to further  increase

the  oil  prices.  The  developing  countries  are

suffering  terribly because most of  them  do  not

have  the  financial means to pay for the  oil  at

such  high  prices. The present oil  cut  and  the

increase of its prices have already badly affected

their  economic  growth and  industrial  expansion

which will eventually lead to further unemployment

and  starvation to some developing countries. This

will  be  a  great  blow to the  progress  of  the

developing countries and may bring economic  chaos

to the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my

colleagues   in  this  House  in  supporting   the

financial  policy of the Government  contained  in

the  Budget  Statement made by  the  Minister  for

Finance in this House on the 4th of March, 1974.



<br><br>5.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the motion standing in the name of  the

Hon. Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, like other countries, has recently

been  hit  painfully  by the  problem  of  growing

inflation.  There is only a small  consolation  in

the fact that the effect of inflation here is less

severe  than  in  many other  countries.  But  the

problem  of coping with the wildly rising cost  of

living  remains  for the ordinary  wage-earner  in

Singapore  a  big headache, as much as  for  wage-earners  all over the world. For him, the prospect

of  living  in privation and want is becoming,  if

not has become, a reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the merchant, the petty trader, the pig

farmer  and the hawker, who have raked in handsome

profits,  often through profiteering, the ordinary

wage-earner  has become the sole  victim  of  this

growing  menace  of  inflation.  Unlike  the   pig

farmer, the hawker and other self-employed persons

who  are able to jack up prices of their goods  or

services to keep pace with inflation, many of whom

have now joined the ranks of the upper-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



middle  income  group, the wage-earner  finds  his

real  income shrinking and the value of his  hard-earned savings diminishing. This, Mr Speaker, Sir,

is  the  core  of  the  problem  of  inflation  in

Singapore and elsewhere in the world. This is  not

the  fate  that a wage-earner would like to  have,

less so his trade union and his government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic solution to this problem. Wage

increases  merely serve as a temporary  relief  to

try  to  help him to maintain his present standard

of  living, only to be out-stripped time and again

by  spiralling increases in prices of commodities.

It  is  only  to  be expected that there  will  be

heartaches and hardships in this period of  rising

cost  of  living  for the wage-earner,  his  trade

union and his Government. More and more persons in

the  ranks of the trade union movement are  coming

round to the view that though wage adjustments are

necessary and useful to offset an increasing  cost

of  living,  particularly  for  the  lower  income

group, the more important thing to do in the long-term  view is to ensure employment for the maximum

number of people and to devise effective means for

the   restraint   of   price   manipulations   and

unreasonable hikes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that I welcome the recent

moves  taken  by  the  Finance  Ministry  to  curb

profiteering  and  unwarranted  price  hikes.  The

Finance  Ministry should have acted much  earlier,

but  nonetheless, it is better late than never.  I

only  hope  that these recent thunderings  of  the

Finance Ministry to warn unscrupulous traders  and

others are not just pre-budget debate gimmicks  to

placate  Parliament, but are genuine efforts  that

will  be  sustained  and further  strengthened  to

prevent  any  inflationary  tendency  from   being

exploited  and  worsened by profiteers  and  other

social parasites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depreciation of the real value of money, as

the result of growing inflation, has a deleterious

effect on the will of the people to save. More and

more  persons are beginning to doubt  the  age-old

practice of saving, when one dollar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



yesterday is worth more than one dollar  today  or

tomorrow. More persons are thus inclined to  spend

their  money  now  rather than save  and  see  the

diminishing   value   of  their   savings.   Their

philosophy seems to be "spend and enjoy  now,  die

later." There is no incentive to save.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make things worse, Government gives a

miserable  5-  per  cent interest  for  their  CPF

contributions for which no interest is payable  in

the  year of contribution. The Post Office Savings

Bank  pays 4� per cent for savings. The Government

should  seriously  consider  upping  the  interest

rates  of  CPF savings and deposits with the  Post

Office Savings Bank. Perhaps the Government should

consider  paying  8  per  cent  interest  for  CPF

savings,  8  per  cent interest  for  Post  Office

savings for the first $1,000, 7� per cent interest

for the second $1,000, 7 per cent interest for the

third  $1,000  and  6 per cent  interest  for  any

subsequent amount. For the CPF and the Post Office

Savings Bank to pay much less than what the  banks

and  the  finance companies pay at  current  rates

ranging  from  9-1l  per cent  for  savings  would

suggest  that  the  Government  is  taking   undue

advantage  of the savings of workers, even  though

such  savings are utilized to finance or subsidise

Government in all its development projects,  which

also equally benefit the rich tycoons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that my formula is the most

feasible and justifiable or that the Government is

not doing anything. The Government may have better

formulae  or other solutions in the pipeline.  But

what  I  am  saying is that the need to  fix  more

realistic  rates of interest must  be  recognised.

First,  to  check the erosion on the will  of  the

ordinary people to save, and secondly, to  protect

for  their  future enjoyment the  fruit  of  their

savings  as far as is humanly possible.  The  rich

and  the  not-so-rich can invest their savings  in

properties  or  in  stocks  and  shares  and  earn

handsome  returns. But the middle income  and  the

lower income groups have not the means to join the

club  of property owners or investors. Their total

wealth,  apart  from the Housing  and  Development

Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



flat,  consists of some meagre deposits in  banks,

finance companies or the Post Office Savings Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another area in which Government can do

something  to  assist  some of  the  wage-earners,

namely,  increase  the  tax reliefs  for  personal

income  and  for  the maintenance  of  wife.  This

matter has already been eloquently raised by other

Members  in this House. If the Government  accepts

inflation  as a fact, then it should  also  accept

the  fact  that the existing tax concessions  have

become unrealistic for two reasons: reduced  real  value of money and rising  cost  of

living.



<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I first express my support  for

the  Minister  for Finance when he  presented  his

Budget Speech on the 4th of March. However, I feel

that,   as  a  result  of  the  disturbances   and

instability  in  the international economic  scene

brought  about  by  the fuel crisis,  an  economic

storm has attacked the whole world and has made us

in  Singapore realise that this world is, in fact,

a cruel and unsympathetic one. As the Minister has

pointed out in his speech on the 4th of March,  we

had  a  growth rate of 22 per cent which  exceeded

our  target of 15 per cent by 7 per cent. However,

in  real  terms, the growth rate was only  11  per

cent  because of the increase in prices. Iii other

words, we Singaporeans have tried our best to work

hard but, because of unpredictable events, many of

the results of our hard work have been reduced  to

zero  by  international  inflation.  Many  of  our

middle and lower income groups have no choice  but

to  tighten  their belts to ensure a  survival  on

this earth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to my mind, as Singapore is a place without

any natural resources, we have to learn our lesson

from  this unpredictable storm. It is only in this

way  that  we can continue to establish  a  bright

image  in  this situation of change  and  ups  and

downs.  Our  economic  development  has  in  large

measure  been attributed to the stability  of  our

political   situation.   This   stable   political

situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



has  served  as a buffer against the  forces  from

outside Singapore. This stability has also  helped

us  to  overcome the economic crisis in the 1960s.

We   must  therefore  continue  to  preserve   and

strengthen  this political situation  and  improve

our political climate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we adopt the attitude of a small number of

hypocrites mentioned by the Minister for  Finance,

we  would  have collapsed long ago. We would  have

landed on the chopping block of other countries to

be  slaughtered  at will. Sir,  the  Minister  has

pointed  out  rightly that this  small  number  of

idealists have over the years appeared to be  full

of  sympathy.  On  the one hand, they  have  shown

their anger and regret over the $1 increase in the

school's  miscellaneous fees. On the  other  hand,

they have sent their children to expensive private

schools in Australia and England. I would like  to

point  out further that these people have all  the

time  been  afraid  that their children  would  be

called up for national service and be burnt by the

hot  sun when doing national service. Yet, at  the

same  time,  these are the very people who  expect

our  police and security personnel to protect them

so  that  they can enjoy themselves at  places  of

entertainment  at  night. Furthermore,  they  have

never  intended to make Singapore their  permanent

place of residence. Today, Singapore may be better

off  than other countries. But if, on another day,

more  restrictions are imposed in Singapore,  they

will  ask: why can we not allow streakers  to  run

wild, running in and out of classrooms as they  do

in  Europe  and the United States?  And  when  our

situation  deteriorates, I am sure they will  pack

up  and  say,  "Distant pastures are  greener.  We

shall be able to find a better place elsewhere."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure all Members in this House will

remember  that  not very long ago  we  experienced

this  perverted tendency. But all of us know  that

in  our  society there are birds of  passage,  but

fortunately their number is very small. They  will

not be able to hinder us in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



our development efforts. Sir, I am afraid that  if

we  sit  back and adopt a passive attitude towards

this  small number of birds of passage,  then  our

vision will be blurred and the demarcation between

right  and wrong will no longer be clear.  We  may

even  think that they are the privileged few, upon

whom our political leaders and our people have  no

control whatsoever. To my mind, we should, through

various  means and measures, promote a  solidarity

and patriotic campaign so that all our people will

discard  the selfish narrow outlook and  think  of

the country as a whole. They will then be able  to

sacrifice themselves ia order to secure the safety

and  integrity  of our country. In this  way,  the

small  number of hypocrites and birds  of  passage

will  not  be able to have their way as easily  as

they can now. We should isolate them and those who

blindly   follow  their  ways  will  be  able   to

recognise  their faults and turn over a new  leaf.

Sir,  the Minister has painted an ugly picture  of

these hypocrites. If we go further and promote the

spirit  of  loyalty and patriotism, I am  sure  we

shall   be  able  to  overcome  all  our  economic

difficulties  and bring Singapore  towards  a  new

peak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support fully the financial policy of the

Government.  I  would like to ask  those  who  are

implementing  the  policy of  the  Government,  in

other  words, the public servants, to discard  all

bureaucratic  practices  and  avoid  as   far   as

possible  authoritarian forms of instruction.  Let

us  hope  that  all  our  people  will  co-operate

closely  together  in a spirit of  patriotism  and

loyalty,  decide our future together, and shoulder

the task of the development of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to express again my full

support for the Minister for Finance in his Budget

Statement.



<br><br>5.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg your  leave  to  make  some

comments   on   the   Finance  Minister's   Budget

Statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the many unfavourable recent

developments  in  the financial world  which  have

affected our economy in no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



small  way,  it  is heartening to  note  that  our

Finance  Minister has proposed no  tax  increases.

Instead he has proposed certain tax reliefs,  such

as  the  increase of relief from $300 to $750  for

those   who   support   aged   parents.   I   must

congratulate the Minister for this. The  greatness

of a government is not measured by the size of its

army or by the stock of gold it holds, but by  the

way  in which it provides services for its people,

especially the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past year has seen much progress in the

fields of employment, industrial growth and  trade

promotion.  It  is an achievement that  calls  for

recognition and endorsement by every citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 9 per cent wage increase and the $25 flat

increase for workers drawing a salary of less than

$1,000 have certainly brought relief to the  lower

income  group. However, all these increases  would

be  of  no  avail  if  the prices  of  commodities

continue  to rise. I therefore urge the Government

to  adopt measures to keep the prices of essential

commodities  down.  The  setting  up  of   WELCOME

Supermarkets  and SAFE Supermarkets  has  to  some

extent  helped the workers, but these are too  few

to  benefit the majority of our people who live in

various parts of the island. While it is true that

the prices of commodities are somewhat cheaper  in

some  of these Supermarkets, the cost of transport

would  offset  the  saving. I therefore  urge  the

Government  to set up more such Supermarkets,  and

to set them up quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public transport system has recently been

revised,  and  while  it  is  claimed  to  be   an

improvement, workers are complaining that it costs

them more to move from place to place. The new bus

lanes  which are designed with good intentions  to

relieve  traffic  congestion  have  produced  more

traffic   jams  than  before.  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,

therefore,  we have to take steps to  improve  the

transport system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent increase in charges at the Government

hospitals  and outpatient dispensaries has  caused

considerable hardship to the poor people. It now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



costs  $3  per visit per person at any  Government

clinic.  When one member of the family  catches  a

cold,  it will invariably spread to other  members

of the family, especially the children. If one has

three  or  four children, then it would  cost  the

family  in  the  region of $15 per  visit  to  the

clinic for treatment. For families earning $200 or

$300  per month, this is certainly going to  cause

hardship to them. While I agree that the  cost  of

medical treatment is rising, I am sure it does not

cost  $3  to treat a person for a common  cold.  I

hope  that the Government will consider the plight

of  the poor people who, if they are unable to pay

for  the  treatment, will have to suffer  quietly,

because the $15 could well be the marketing  money

for a couple of days for the family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Government to function efficiently, it

is important that its civil servants be given fair

opportunities for advancement. While new  recruits

in  the  Service  are people with better  academic

qualifications, the older officers who have proven

their   worth  over  the  years  should   not   be

discouraged.   They   should   be    given    fair

opportunities for promotion. Short of this,  there

would he no incentive for hard work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the declared policy of the

Government to bridge the gap between the haves and

the have-nots. I have no doubt that the Government

is  vigorously pursuing this policy, and I venture

to  take this opportunity to draw the attention of

Government to some of the difficulties of the have-nots.  I  am  aware  of  the  difficulties  to  be

encountered  in trying to achieve this  objective,

and  I  am sure future policies will be made  with

this in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the Minister for

Finance's Budget Statement.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister was indeed most eloquent and  adroit

in diplomacy when he presented his painless budget

to  the  House on the 4th instant. But it  was  as

expected,  for was not the pain inflicted  on  the

populace during the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



better  part  of 1973 and earlier this  year  when

time  and  again Government upped  costs  for  the

citizens in petrol taxation, Housing Board  flats,

electricity,  and  so forth?  Goodness  knows  how

Government was also responsible for the  inflation

that hit the Singaporean these last 12 months~



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these hard times, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Singaporean  was eager to hear the  euphony  of  a

reduction  in  taxes, especially income  taxes.  1

would  like  to  elaborate on income  tax  reliefs

which were rather skimpingly covered by the Member

for Katong and expanded on by other Members. I too

believe  that  the  present high  cost  of  living

demands  more  realistic tax  reliefs.  Funny  but

true,  a wife in these times is worth only  $1,000

tax  relief, and the first two children, $750  and

$500  respectively. Most certainly it  costs  much

more   in  these  hard  times  to  maintain  them.

Singaporeans are understanding and do not ask  for

maintenance; just additional tax reliefs  to  make

it  possible to manage, after having cut down much

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave concern is that the pay rises over the

last   eight  months  are  being  more  and   more

diminished in value at the time of payment because

of  inflation and because the income tax  personal

allowances have not materially changed. There must

be a more equitable system of taxation. There must

be  a radical extension of the existing degree  of

exemption  to  workers of low earned incomes,  and

more  realistic personal allowances and  bands  of

income  chargeable at the reduced rate of tax,  in

order to provide substantial relief to those  most

in  need.  A  direct way to help  the  lower  paid

worker  is  to  raise the level  at  which  earned

income is exempt from taxation in order that lower

paid workers should pay either less tax or even no

tax at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask for a system that should be one of giving

relief by way of taxation to low-paid workers. The

lower paid worker is still paying too high a share

of taxation. The system, at present, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



regressive  at the lower levels of income.  It  is

the very essence of a capitalist society which  we

have come to reject. It is conceived in inequality

and  misery  and its product even today  is  still

unnecessary  poverty among pensioners  and  lower-income groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be some loss of revenue and

alternative    taxes   may   be   an   unavoidable

consequence.  With a desire to  reduce  the  heavy

burden   of  income  tax  on  low  earnings,   the

alternative  taxes  must  show  a  preference  for

higher  direct taxes on those with higher  incomes

as  against  any further marked shift to  indirect

taxes  which  take  very  little  account  of  the

ability of people to pay them. A clear example  is

purchase tax which bears proportionately much more

heavily on working class households.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me once again stress that if more money is

needed  by  the Government to offset the  cost  of

increasing  the  personal  allowances,   let   the

Government take it from those who can best  afford

to  pay in order to assist those who most need it.

I  recognise, of course, that tax relief can  only

be  a partial answer to the financial problems  of

the  lower paid workers. I recognise, for example,

that tax reliefs are not of much help to those low-paid  workers who already pay little or no tax  at

all.  But  there  are  ways  of  improving  social

equity.   One  such  way  is  to  improve  earning

opportunities of workers in industry which pay low

wages  because they are not as efficient  as  they

can be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the present Government came to power, a

great deal was heard about the necessity for doing

justice to the lower paid workers, but not  enough

has  been done. But, to be fair to the Government,

we  must accept that Singapore has moved some  way

towards  implementing this justice.  Unfortunately

the  Government  is only doing the  slow  foxtrot.

What is needed is a quick step without a twist. It

is  therefore  high  time that  the  vague  easily

misunderstood talk in favour of the lower paid was

replaced by action, directly understood, to  leave

them enough to live on in decency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have listened with close and  rapt

attention, as I always do, to the remarks of  hon.

Members  on all the points which they have  raised

today,  touching on the financial policy  of  this

Government.  I did so with a view to adopting  any

constructive  suggestions raised and to  repairing

omissions  in  the policy which I  have  tried  to

outline with some fullness in my Budget Statement.

Let  us  not mistake the fact that we are  in  the

midst  of  one  of the difficult  periods  in  our

economic  history;  that the  right  economic  and

financial policies to meet the situation  will  be

important, if not critical, and that any ideas  or

innovations which enable us to adapt  to  the  new

situation  ought  therefore to be  very  carefully

explored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must therefore confess to feeling some

disappointment  at  the  somewhat,  if  I  may  be

forgiven to say, meagre contributions, which  this

debate  has made, to the solution of our  economic

problems.   While  I  appreciate   some   of   the

complimentary   remarks   made   on   the   Budget

Statement, although there were critical ones also,

especially  the  last one, I am  saddened  to  see

that, with the exception of perhaps the Member for

Katong and the Member for Henderson, there has not

been  the comprehension that I had hoped for  from

all Members. This may not be entirely unnatural in

respect  of  some  of the economic  and  financial

statements, but I had expected at least some ready

appreciation of the spirit and philosophy  of  the

Government's   policy   on   taxation   and    the

implementation of those policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I touched on the philosophy of Government in

dealing  with the problems concerning the  public,

as   had  been  voiced  in  the  press  and   also

faithfully reflected by hon. Members in this House

both  in parliamentary questions and again in this

debate.  That philosophy, I must repeat again,  is

not  to encourage passengers although we may  have

to  carry some of them from time to time,  out  of

our  compassion  for  giving social  justice.  Our

intention is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



provide for equality of opportunity. And we  shall

give  every  citizen or, if he is not  capable  of

benefiting, his child or grandchild, the chance to

be  productive, to be able to improve himself,  to

move  in the scale from the category of unemployed

or  of unskilled worker to the category of skilled

worker  and to the professional and brain  service

worker, so that he will draw the higher income and

richer reward which must attend the acquisition of

such  skills and of the higher productivity  which

such skills generate. In this society there are no

barriers to such mobility. If there are,  we  must

try  to  remove them, and we shall not  spare  any

expense,   whether  it  be  by  formal  education,

informal training, or learning on-the-job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to these remarks, I am glad of the very

general  support which Members of the  House  have

given  for  the Budget and for welcoming  the  tax

concessions  which  I have announced.  Of  course,

they  do  not  satisfy all Members and  I  do  not

expect  them  to  satisfy  even  the  majority  of

Members. In the previous Budget debate I  think  I

had   some   idea  of  the  Members'  desire   for

additional  reliefs for taxpayers and their  wives

under  the  Income  Tax  Act.  Unfortunately,  any

Finance  Minister  must weigh the  possibility  of

giving  tax concessions or tax reliefs  and  their

cost, with the additional expenditure that may  be

expected,  and which I have outlined in my  Budget

Statement,  to meet the additional cost  of  fuel.

The  additional reliefs which have been  suggested

for  taxpayers  and  wives would  have  been  very

considerable. Perhaps I may disclose  that  I  did

try  to  work  out what an additional  $1,000  tax

relief for every taxpayer would amount to,  and  I

decided that the figure was not one which I  could

readily accept and concede in this Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted the comment of one particular Member, a

rather  plaintive suggestion that Budgets are  not

what  they  used to be, as no taxes but  only  tax

reliefs were announced in the Budget Statement.  I

hope    other    Members   will   contain    their

dissatisfaction with this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



particular  practice.  I  have  tried  to  explain

exactly   what   I  proposed  to  do   at   Budget

Statements,  and that was that there would  be  no

major painful additional taxes if the economy, and

therefore  the additional taxes generated  by  the

economy,  grows at the rate we expect it to  grow.

Last  year's growth rate was perhaps not quite  as

large as we would have liked. In the past we  used

to  calculate  our growth rate at current  prices,

and  we  did not make too much distinction between

the  real growth rate, which was probably  one  or

two  per  cent  less, and the  growth  at  current

prices.  Unfortunately, although our  1973  growth

rate  at current prices was 22 per cent, our  real

growth was considerably lower. Nevertheless, I did

not  think that there was any need in this  Budget

to   impose  additional  taxes.  That   might   be

necessary if the economy turned down. Perhaps  the

practice,  which  the  Member  for  Telok  Blangah

complained, of announcing no new taxes  will  have

to he reconsidered at this time next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also made a few

remarks on "flags of convenience" and why I should

have  given  concessions in regard to shipping.  I

would only say that countries like Liberia do  not

establish concessions for shipping purely  because

they  thought  it was a fashionable thing  to  do.

Obviously there are benefits to be obtained by any

economy which decided that this was desirable, and

I  think that Singapore will benefit also from the

amount  of  additional  business  which  would  be

generated by the exemptions I have given  for  tax

on  shipping. If he could convince me  that  I  am

wrong  in this assumption, I will be very glad  to

revise my views on exemption of tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also suggested

amendment  of section 44 of the Insurance  Act  in

order  to  bring  the figure of  $10,000  somewhat

nearer  to  the  $50,000  level,  similar  to  the

exemption  I  have given for estate duty.  I  have

noted  this  suggestion and  will  in  due  course

consider an amendment to the Insurance Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir made some comments

on   direct  and  indirect  taxation,  and  I  was

somewhat puzzled by his suggestion that our income

tax  system  is  regressive. It  is  against  most

expert fiscal opinion, and I will be very happy to

consider any better form of taxation which will do

greater  justice  to  the  lowly  paid  worker  as

against the higher paid worker. Certainly it  will

be  quite an innovation and we in the Ministry  of

Finance shall always be pleased to learn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his mention of purchase tax, I

say that there have been no indirect taxes or,  if

there are, they will be lifted except for articles

like  petroleum, liquor and cigarettes.  There,  I

think,  perhaps  we  should save  the  lowly  paid

worker  from extravagance in these and  raise  his

real income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the remarks on the economic

conditions,  only  the Member for  Bukit  Ho  Swee

mentioned the oil crisis. He commented on this, no

doubt,  because of his union connections with  the

oil industry. Of course, all of us are envious  of

the   very   considerable   profits   which   the

international oil companies have made, and we only

hope that if any of these profits are made locally

they  will  be  ploughed back into investments  in

petro-chemical and other plants in Singapore, thus

helping our economy to grow at a more rapid rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the topics that has recurred in the

comments  of  most  Members is  on  inflation  and

prices.  Now,  this is a difficult problem  and  I

have  touched  on  it  very  fully  in  my  Budget

Statement because I realise its importance and its

effect  on the common man in Singapore. I am  very

conscious  that  we can do a lot more,  and  I  am

grateful for the many remarks which have been made

here   for  the  improvement  of  actions  against

inflationary  prices.  Of course,  some  of  these

remarks  are  fairly technical. For  example,  the

Member  for  River Valley and some  other  Members

have  suggested  enactment of  the  Protection  of

Consumers  Act.  This is one  which  will  require

fairly  considerable study by my Ministry. I  will

certainly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



give  consideration to the suggestion  to  monitor

the   standards  and  quality  of  products  being

imported    in    competition   with    our    own

manufacturers. I think it is fair that they should

be  of  a  quality no less than what is  certainly

available already from our manufacturers. However,

since   there   are   going  to  be   multilateral

negotiations on tariff and non-tariff barriers, we

have  to be careful in our actions to see that  we

do  not create what may be considered a non-tariff

barrier, thereby bringing us to the attention, and

possible    retaliation,   of   other   countries.

Nevertheless,  we  need to look into  this  matter

very carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time I would also urge the Member

for  River Valley, in view of his connections with

the  industry and employers, that he  suggests  to

and  urges the Singapore Manufacturers Association

and  fellow  manufacturers and  employers  to  set

standards    for   their   members   to    prevent

profiteering, whether of quality or  quantity,  as

any  defect in any product will merely  sully  the

reputation  of the whole of the manufacturers  and

employers,  and  not only the few responsible  for

poor quality or quantity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One suggestion which has been made by the Member

for  Telok Blangah was in relation to CASE and the

need  for  Government support. I need  hardly  say

that  we  welcome all the help that CASE can  give

and  we  are prepared, to the extent that this  is

needed, to support with sound financial assistance

the operations of CASE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one suggestion by the Member for Jalan

Kayu  which  I thought not quite relevant  to  the

problem of inflation, but he said it would be  one

method  of dealing with it. This is the idea  that

inflation would be curbed if action was  taken  by

Government  to  prevent rents from rising  through

unscrupulous landlords. As this idea  has  already

been  put  in  a  Question to  my  colleague,  the

Minister for Law and National Development, I  need

not touch on this particular suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee made rather

emotional  remarks on profiteering.  I  hope  that

profiteers will take note



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



of  the  very  strong  feelings  which  have  been

generated  not  only  in him but  also  among  the

public.  I  can  only say that we  shall  try  and

accentuate  the measures which we have taken,  and

we  shall see that there will be punishment to fit

the  crime  where  the  crime  is  not  caused  by

external factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein raised some questions on

wage  earners. He said that wage earners were most

badly  hit  as compared with hawkers, shopkeepers,

and  others. Like the Member for Moulmein, I  have

very  considerable sympathy for the  wage  earners

and   I  hope  the  National  Wages  Council  will

consider    their    position    suitably     when

recommendations are being made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I think the Member for Moulmein

also  thought  there is a need for increasing  the

savings  of  wage  earners by increasing  interest

rates.  If there are sufficient funds for  savings

through the Post Office Savings Bank, and  so  on,

his   rather  innovative  suggestion  for   higher

interest  rates of 7 or 8 per cent would certainly

draw  these  savings out, although I would  rather

hope  they are already in the Post Office  Savings

Bank  or in the Central Provident Fund. Of course,

some  of these savings, like the CPF savings, come

to  Government, when the Government issues  bonds,

at  certain  interest  rates.  If  the  Government

should increase the interest rates to 7 or  8  per

cent,  it  would mean that, for example, it  would

lend  to  the  Housing  and Development  Board  at

higher  interest rates. Thus the low  wage  earner

who  wants to buy a Housing Board flat would  have

to  pay  a  higher price for the flat.  Therefore,

there  are  consequences to his  suggestion  which

require to be gone into with some care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these were the more critical areas which

Members  have considered necessary for  Government

to  deal with. But there were also suggestions  on

manufacturing industries and trade. The Member for

River  Valley has suggested that we have not  done

enough  to attract supporting industries. While  I

am   conscious   of  the  need  to  attract   such

industries -. I have in fact offered incentives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



and  financing from a $100 million fund which  has

been  set up-he is quite right in saying that  not

very much has been spent from this fund. But I  do

not  agree  with him that we have neglected  these

industries for the more glamorous industries which

he  thinks we are trying to promote. In fact, some

of   the   more  glamorous  industries   and   the

multinational   industries   require    supporting

industries,  and  have  made  inquiries  on   what

facilities are available. In my Budget Statement I

mentioned  that  of the new industries  which  are

being  attracted, a considerable number  are  very

highly  efficient and highly technical  supporting

industries  which I was very glad  to  notice  are

among the investments which have been committed. I

hope  the result of our promotion efforts will  be

evident in the next one or two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a suggestion that the training of

our workers needs to be improved. I fully agree to

this.  I  am  always  conscious  of  the  need  to

increase   skills  and  to  increase  our   brain-manpower. Now, the analysis of why we have not got

sufficient  skills  and  brain-manpower   is,   of

course,  rather  more difficult.  The  Member  for

River Valley suggested more inducements and awards

to  teaching  staff for research  to  improve  the

morale   of   the   lecturers  in   our   tertiary

institutions, and he suggested a $2 million  grant

for  research.  These  are all  very  praiseworthy

suggestions, and perhaps they ought  to  be  given

fuller  consideration  than  I  can  do  just   by

listening to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu suggested that further

export  promotion might be carried  out.  I  fully

agree  with him that we can do more in the  coming

year and will give adequate financial support  for

this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were quite a number of other points which

were  raised,  dealing with education,  hospitals,

health,  social services and so on. Perhaps  I  am

not in as good a position to deal with them as the

Ministers  in  charge who will no  doubt  be  very

fully   questioned  and  who  will  give  detailed

answers to all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



points  which have been raised by Members. Perhaps

some  of the criticisms are not always pointed  at

the  right direction and some may be based on  the

lack  of comprehension or misunderstanding of  the

policy   of   the  administrative   machinery   of

implementation. Some of them may he simply matters

of  misinformation. For example,  the  Member  for

Anson  raised the question of fees for  outpatient

treatment. I believe the fee per attention  is  $2

and, of course, he made very much play of a family

having  colds and having to pay $3 per  person  in

the  family  so  that the total  charge  would  be

exorbitant.  Perhaps that is an  exaggeration  and

maybe  the particular family is more hypochondriac

than most of us are. Nevertheless, his points  are

those  which  members of the public  feel  perhaps

very  strongly, and no doubt they will be  pressed

again in the questions which are addressed to  the

Ministers at the appropriate time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some mention of the transportation

system   and  of  bus  services.  In  an   earlier

question,  there was suggestion that  I  mentioned

that  the  management  had  been  corrupt.  Anyone

reading  my Budget Statement carefully  would  see

that I did not make such an allegation, but that I

thought   that   institutional   management    was

necessary  and  that  we did not  want  conditions

obtaining  as  were  prevalent  in  the  Singapore

Traction  Company  days. I think  all  of  us  are

agreed  that some emphasis should be laid  on  the

solution   of   the  transportation  problems   in

Singapore.  Quite a number of Members  touched  on

this subject as well as on other matters connected

with  transportation, like the mass rapid  transit

system and the long-range traffic solution. I need

only  say  that  as  far as  I  am  concerned  the

financing  of  solutions  to  this  problem   will

receive  special  attention  in  my  Ministry.  My

Ministry  is  involved in both the Road  Transport

Action   Committee   and  in  the   financing   of

transportation  by international bodies,  such  as

the  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and

Development,  the  Asian  Development   Bank,   or

perhaps  from  local  funds.  The  remarks   which

Members have made on trans-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



portation generally will receive attention from my

Ministry as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to mention the Member for

Sembawang's   remarks   on   the   inadequacy   of

allocation  for  social services. I  thought  that

when  preparing my Budget the amounts which I have

allocated for economic development this  year  did

not, in fact, come to as much as my allocation for

social  services generally. Perhaps  this  is  not

quite  the best sort of allocation, so that  maybe

next  year  rather than increase  social  services

relative to economic development, I will  have  to

consider  some reduction. But perhaps in  absolute

terms  the Member for Sembawang will get  what  he

wishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finally, I would like to end

this  debate  by stressing again the necessity  of

all  of  us pulling together in order to  overcome

the difficulties that we expect in the coming year

and  to  achieve  a satisfactory growth  rate  for

1974.  When  I  made  my forecast  in  the  Budget

Statement of perhaps a 10 per cent growth rate for

the earlier part of this year at least, I must say

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



outlook  for the second half of the year  was  not

quite  as  promising  as now  we  have  reason  to

expect.  The developments in the possible  lifting

of  the oil embargo and the highest (Nixon-Shultz)

level of economic forecasting in the United States

show  that  the  second half  of  the  year  would

improve  on  the first half of this year.  Whether

that   kind  of  economic  forecasting  would   be

correct, only time will tell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of

the  Government for the financial year 1st  April,

1974 to 31st March, 1975.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with paragraph (7) of Standing

Order No. 87 (Main Estimates) and paragraph (5) of

Standing  Order  88  (Development  Estimates),  Mr

Speaker has fixed the undermentioned times on each

allotted  day at which consideration of the  heads

of   expenditure  in  the  Main  and   Development

Estimates, in respect of which amendments stand on

the   Order  Paper  Supplement,  shall,   if   not

previously disposed of, be concluded.



<br><br>Notes:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The "guillotine" time shown against a

head   of  expenditure  is  the  time  when

discussion of that head shall end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If discussion of a head of expenditure is

concluded  before  the  "guillotine"   time

stated,  the  head next following  will  be

entered into straightaway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Provision for a suspension of a sitting

for  about  30 minutes has been taken  into

account  in  fixing the "guillotine"  times

marked with an asterisk.
