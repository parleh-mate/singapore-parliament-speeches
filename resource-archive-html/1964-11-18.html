this  year. The lists were presented to the Ministry of Education

in August. I am sure the Ministry must have got the figures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems that the Member

for  Thomson is asking for the number of students to be admitted

the four language streams are:

primary  schools will the Government build or plan to  build  in

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 1965 the Government

proposes to commence building 10 primary schools. It is

expected that another 6 primary schools will be at the planning

stage in the same year and will be ready for construction in

1966. The media of instruction in each of these schools will be

decided on the basis of actual demand. It is the policy of the

Government to allow parents to choose the medium of instruction

for their children.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Development Estimates of Expenditure of the State

of Singapore for the year 1965, as contained in Paper Cmd. 25 of

1964. For the convenience of hon. Members, I intend taking the

total for each head of expenditure as it appears in the third

column of the Summary of Expenditure on page 7 of the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing now with the heads of expenditure in respect of which

amendments stand on the Order Paper Supplement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps for the convenience of Members, and in order that we

might not have difficulties over the content of the speeches

which Members will make, I have to inform Members that they must

not repeat arguments which have been used on the Estimates or on

matters which they had rightfully discussed on the Estimates.

These are Development Estimates and the debate should proceed on

a completely different line from that of yesterday. If Members

will keep that in mind, we will make great progress.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 01 -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The first amendment is Head D 01 - Land Office.

There is one amendment standing in the names of three Members,

Messrs. Ong Lian Teng, Tan Cheng Tong and Ong Eng Guan. As Mr

Ong Lian Teng's amendment was received first, he will move the

amendment first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D 01 be reduced by

$100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise two questions under this head. I hope the

Minister concerned will give a reply. First, the Government's

acquisition of land from 1st January, 1961, up to 30th of June,

1964. How much land was acquired by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



the Government during this period? How much of it belonged to

private land-owners and how much was military land? How much

money was spent on them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at what prices did the Government acquire private

land? According to what standard did it acquire the land?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan Cheng Tong. The Member need not speak now

if he does not want to. He may speak afterwards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not wish to

speak now.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Prime Minister replying to this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir.

If the Member wishes to have the information he seeks of a

detailed nature from 1961 to 1964, I suggest he table a question

in that respect. Under this particular head of expenditure, I am

here to explain why we have put in a vote of $10 million for

acquisition of private lands for public purposes for the year

1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the assessment of valuation, I think really he ought to

consult his legal adviser. The law on the acquisition of land is

quite clear. There is at present before a Select Committee of

the Assembly a new Land Acquisition Bill some provisions of

which may well have to be altered, or otherwise provisions will

have to be made in the constitutional articles relating to

acquisition of property, to remove any doubt as to the

constitutional validity of some of these provisions. I do not

wish to go into the intricacies of the law on land acquisition.

The Member ought to know, from the representatives of his Party

on the Select Committee, what is the present position and what

we hope to do by an alteration of the law on land acquisition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to make

only a few comments under this heading. I feel that $10.5

million voted for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



acquisition of land is an over-estimated provision. My  feeling

is  that  not  so  much should be spent in 1965  because  of  the

following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that there are periodical fire sites to be

compulsorily acquired, and the Government pays to the land-owners

only a small fraction, perhaps 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the

market price of land, and pays to each fire victim a few tens  of

dollars  as  fire relief at the most. As far as my  memory  goes,

there are already four big fires in the past four years, say, one

fire for each year. If the Government has to pay the market value

for these lands, adding to it the cost of removing the squatters,

the  inhabitants, and perhaps spend many years in removing  them,

then  these lands in the four fire sites will cost the Government

perhaps many hundreds of millions of dollars.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the resettlement compensation paid by

the  Government to villagers and squatters of lands, through  the

Housing  Board, is much below that paid to squatters  by  private

developers, perhaps only one-third or half of the market price of

evicting the squatters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that since the Government intends to pass

its  Land Acquisition Bill which, as the Prime Minister has  just

indicated, is even subject to certain alterations, the Government

is  only  required  to pay land-owners a small  fraction  of  the

market price of the land it has compulsorily acquired



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know, under the provisions of the Bill,

that  the  Government can pay land-owners perhaps even  $500  per

acre ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The provisions of that Bill are now before

the Select Committee and they should not be discussed here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is for these reasons

that  I suggest to reduce the amount voted in the 1965 Budget.  I

feel that even $2½  million or $3 million would be sufficient  for

1965.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

when the Government acquires land, it does not pay attention to

the welfare of the people concerned, nor does it look after their

interest. In Paya Lebar, when the Government was repairing and

extending the road, we saw that the residents along the road

suffered much. About $300 compensation was paid to each family.

In the past, these people had been renting attap houses. Every

month ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have stated to hon. Members before the

debate  on the amendment started that the arguments used  in  the

Estimates  should not be used here. These are merely  Development

Estimates.  What  is  in  order is for  the  Member  to  ask  the

Government  questions relating to the Development  Estimates  and

not  to discuss what arises out of them, what harm it will  cause

the  people as a result therefrom. These matters should have been

discussed  yesterday and not today. So if the Member will  please

remember that and proceed with his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in discussing the Development Estimates, we are concerned about the condition in which the people find themselves as a result of the acquisition of land by the Government, which has never been mentioned in the past. These people

have  been  forced  to  remove because of Government's  plan,  or

actual  implementation  of the plan, to extend  and  build  roads

there. Each family has been compensated to the sum of about $300.

That  is  not enough to resolve their difficult position. Because

in the past they have paid only a few dollars for rent ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not want to stop the Member from

making  his  speech. But I think he should pay some attention  to

the  Chair's ruling. These are matters which properly should have

been discussed yesterday or the day before, but not today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, this matter which I am raising now  was  not

raised  yesterday  or  at any sitting in the  past.  This  matter

concerns ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member should pay some attention to my

ruling. These questions could have been raised yesterday and they

should have been. If they were not, the Member will not raise

them today on the Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I respect

your  ruling  and  I  will not mention it any more,  namely,  the

widening of Paya Lebar Road after acquisition of land there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on another matter. The day before, I asked the

Prime Minister certain questions. He did not give me a reply  and

the  other  Ministers were also not able to  give  me  any  satisfactory  reply. This matter concerns a piece of land in  Tampines

11  milestone  which  has been acquired by  the  Government.  The

Government have mentioned that this piece of land has been sublet

to others. In fact, there is no proof and ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. These are Development Estimates for the

year  1965.  The  hon.  Member is touching upon  a  matter  which

relates  to  some  items of expenditure which have  already  been

incurred. He will see that he is completely out of order.  He  is

not  being  relevant, in the first instance, to the  topic  under

discussion. Will he proceed to some other point relevant  to  the

issue before the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I

will  dwell  on the question which I have just raised.  I  regret

that  the Prime Minister did not give me a reply point by  point.

Instead he touched on a certain Bill which is now before a Select

Committee. The Bill is called the Land Acquisition (Amendment No.

2)  Bill.  I  just want to know how much land the Government  has

acquired  during the period I have indicated and at what  prices.

According to my knowledge, the land acquired by the Government is

mostly  private land. I would like to ask whether the  Government

intends   also   to  acquire  land  belonging  to  the   military

authorities,  such as the War Department and the Naval  Base.  In

fact, the British military authorities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



can  be  described as one of the largest landlords in Singapore

and  the  Government  dare  not touch  a  single  hair  of  these

authorities.  Judging  by the vote of $10  million,  if  we  have

sufficient power to take back all or part of the land occupied by

the  military authorities, I believe there will be a great saving

in  this  vote.  The  saving,  I  think,  can  be  put  to  other

development purposes. The Prime Minister dare not give me a  full

reply to my questions. I think he is afraid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really

bewildered. On  the  one hand, I am urged by the Member for Hong Lim to

give more  money  away  to  land-owners.  He  regrets  the  fact  that

Government has been able to acquire fire sites at 20 per cent the

value  of  the  land.  I do not know what  he  really  wants  the

Government  to  do.  Take  this public money,  give  it  away  to

landlords who have fortuitously got their land cleared of tenants

by  fire,  the burden of rehousing and resettling of  whom  falls

upon the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I get the Barisan Sosialis Member for Bukit

Panjang  saying  that it is a great pity that we  should  acquire

private  land.  I  would have thought that,  being  upholders  of

socialism, they would have been against private ownership of  all

land.  That  is one of the basic tenets. We accept the  facts  of

life  as  they are. In so far as we can in our mixed economy,  we

try  to mitigate the acquisition of fortuitous wealth by just the

possession  of land, particularly to prevent people from  getting

windfall  gains as a result of public expenditure on development.

But  just in case people will accuse the Barisan of lack of

anti-colonial  fervour, back again we come to military land  holdings.

The Member has not read last year's proceedings of how we went to

London and got back over 300 odd acres of land, and got a payment

made  of $10 million for use of T.O.L. land which belongs to  the

State and to which the Army had no title. What does he want us to

do?  Take back the Naval Base and close it down? Take back Changi

Airfield and close it down? What are the facts of life?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we really feel that it is wrong to have military bases and,

therefore, we ought to scrap them and grow vegetables instead  on

them? These are dead issues, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I wish to say on the amount set aside, $10 million, is that

it has been set aside for the last few years, and the expenditure

over the 1960s - 1961, 1962, 1963 and 1964, up to November -  has

ranged  between  $4  million and $8 million, depending  upon  the

exigencies that arise in the course of these years. Whilst we may

not spend the $10 million, I think there is no particular harm in

making  provision for $10 million. I do not know what will happen

in  1965.  The  estimation is that we shall be acquiring  certain

parcels  of  land for slum clearance and improvement schemes.  We

shall  have to meet additional payments after a final  survey  of

acquired  land.  There are certain contingency  awards  of  legal

costs  which will have to be met arising out of the reference  to

court  in  respect  of several objections made  by  owners  under

collective awards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, my colleague,

the Member for Bukit Panjang, has spoken on behalf of my Party to

the  effect  that the Prime Minister should be urged to  save  on

public  funds  and acquire more land belonging  to  the  military

authorities, so that some of it may be distributed for the use of

farmers facing resettlement, so that they will have more land  in

which  to do some farming. This is a good idea in my opinion.  As

far  as I know, Mr Speaker, in my own constituency and in  Sembawang constituency, or even in the Nee Soon area, there is a great

deal of land occupied by the military authorities. This land  has

not  been properly put to use and is deserted. Although there are

some squatters scattered about in these areas, one must note that

the  quit  rents  paid by the farmers are paid  to  the  military

authorities.  This  is unreasonable because  if  we  are  heading

towards independence, then this land should be taken back by  the

Government, and whatever is paid by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



farmer should be paid into the Government coffers instead of  the

military  authorities. That means the British are  now  occupying

our land and taking money from our people.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a great deal of land - a few hundred acres - occupied

by  the Naval Base, and a few hundred acres also occupied by  the

War  Department.  Some of this land is not properly  used  or  is

never used at all. So the idea put forward by my colleague  is  a

good one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point arises when land is acquired for general

purposes.  Some farmers in Geylang Serai are faced with  eviction

and resettlement in Sembawang. In this respect, I notice that the

land given by the Government to these farmers is insufficient for

their  farming, only about three-quarters of an acre. So  if  the

farmer  and  his family were to depend on this bit  of  land,  it

would  not  be  enough  for farming. I hope the  Government  will

consider this matter and give more attention to the needs of  the

farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the average, if a farmer has to maintain his family by

farming  - say, a family of three or four persons - then at  least

the  piece of land required should be more than an acre in  area,

otherwise the yield is not sufficient to maintain the farmer  and

his family. Production from a small piece of land is far too low,

and we must give the farmer more land to increase his production.

If  you  force  the farmer into the jungle to cultivate  a  small

piece of land, say, three-quarters ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are again going back. I did inform hon.

Members  not  to  go  back  to what should  have  been  discussed

yesterday.  I have let the hon. Member mention this - to  suggest

to the Government what use is the land to be put to. I think that

is  perfectly in order. But to go on developing the theme of  the

farmer, which should have been developed yesterday, is completely

out of order today. Will the Member please remember that?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The other suggestion I wish

to make is that there are big landowners in Singapore. I hope

that the Government, when acquiring land, will not acquire it

from small landowners or small holdings, unless such small

holdings are actually necessary for development purposes. If it

can be avoided, we should not force the small landowners out of

their land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one company in Sembawang Estate which occupies a big

piece of land. The Government has not taken action to acquire it.

I  suggest that in case of acquisition, the Government should pay

more  attention to big landowners, because it will then bring  in

more  profit  for  the people and for the Government.  These  big

landowners  will  not  suffer badly from the acquisition  because

they  are  rich.  So it is my hope that the Government  will  pay

attention to what I have said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister

has said just now that after merger he was able to take back some

300 acres of land from the British. I do not know whether he will

continue  to do this in future, that is to say, to get back  more

land  from  the military authorities. As a matter  of  fact,  the

Member for Jalan Kayu has said that the military authorities  are

occupying  the  land  of the people of Singapore  for  no  useful

purpose at all. This is a point worthy of attention. I think  the

Prime Minister cannot deny this fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the areas of land occupied by the military

authorities,  some bombs may be stored. I do  not  want  this  to

happen  because they can always send their bombs back to  England

for  safe keeping. Our land should be used for farming and  other

uses  so that we can save more money on purchase of land. I think

this is a good suggestion worthy of Government's attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has just said that we have already acquired 300

acres of land and we can forget about the rest of it. This is not proper

because,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



as  a matter of fact, there is still a vast area of land occupied

by the British military.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, it is a very sad commentary

on  the Opposition - flogging all the dead horses, these issues  of large

and  vast  tracts  of land being captured by  the  British  armed

forces, greedily dog-in-the-manger squatting on them. The  Member

for  Hong  Lim  used  to flog this issue  in  every  one  of  our

sessions. We have gone through all that. In 1963 we went  through

it  in London before the final terms on Malaysia - every scrap of

land,  title  to  it,  user being put to. I welcome  any  further

suggestions  from  Members of the Opposition  in  regard  to  any

specific piece of land which they think the Army is not using but

just squatting on with a view to denying Singapore its user.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to remind Members opposite that there have

been some fundamental changes in this situation. The problem that

will  arise  for us in the next decade is what to do  when  these

bases  are gradually scrapped away, as they will be in course  of

time,  maybe 10 years, maybe 15 years, but certainly  within  the

next  two  decades. These are not the problems.  The  problem  in

Singapore  will still remain - shortage of land. We  are  a  small

island  of 224 square miles. We are reclaiming land on  the  east

coast;  the whole of the foreshore from Bedok to Tanjong Rhu.  We

are  also reclaiming land in the Kallang Basin. We are reclaiming

land  in  Jurong, all the estuaries. We will willingly scrutinise

any further better ideas which the Opposition can offer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to suggest, as the Member for Jalan Kayu did, that we

should not acquire land belonging to small landlords - it is,  of

course,  the  Barisan  Sosialis philosophy that  small  landlords

should  be  protected  and  land  acquired  only  from  the   big

landlords. We do not want to acquire land unless we have to,  and

land  is acquired not whether it belongs to a small or a big landlord,  but  whether that particular area needs certain particular

facilities or amenities to be provided for, such as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



schools, hospitals, roads, circuses, fire brigade, fire stations,

and  so on. It is irrelevant whether the landlord is a big  or  a

small  one.  I  know the Member for Jalan Kayu considers  himself

reasonably safe in the definition of "small landowner".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to give Members this assurance: that the

$10  million will be disbursed in a business-like manner,  it  is

not  our duty as the Government to pay more than we have to  when

we  acquire land or to give largesse when removing squatters from

Crown land. We understand, Mr Speaker, Sir, that legally we  are

not  bound to give anything away when we ask people to  move  out

from  Crown  land. They are people who have squatted,  encumbered

lands.  The  Member for Bukit Panjang has mentioned the

compensation  paid  as  $300/$400. There are certain  rules  and

certain scales  - the area of the attap huts, fruit trees, and so on and

so  forth.  This  will  be worked out. We have  never  been  more

generous in the whole of the history of squatter resettlement. We

take this as a form of social welfare aid to resettle and rehouse

people. But there is a limit. Otherwise we may well and justly be

accused of encouraging more squatting on Government land for  the

purpose  of extracting or extorting resettlement prices when  the

land has to be cleared for development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these issues have been gone through ad nauseam every

time. The problem that still remains is one of insufficient  land

for the number of people in this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not pretend to be able to solve the problem of

agricultural land in Singapore. It is one of those problems which

are basically insolvable. If we succeed as the industrial base in

Malaysia, as we may well do in the next decade, then there is  no

place  for  either  grazing  land or  agricultural  land  in  the

popularly  understood  sense  of  that  term.  Singapore  is   an

industrial city, and the price of land is being determined on the

basis of a developing industrial complex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for head D 02 he reduced by the

whole sum in respect of subhead 002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the past when the Prime Minister negotiated on

the  White Paper Merger, he promised a loan of some $150  million

for  development  purposes  in North  Borneo,  that  is  to  say,

Singapore  has to pay some $30 million per year for  5  years  on

condition  that North Borneo must employ 50 per cent labour  from

Singapore.  The Prime Minister has mentioned this many  times  in

the past, but according to the Sin Chew Jit Poh of 23rd July, the

Chief  Minister of North Borneo, Dato Stephens, denied  this.  On

the 25th of July a spokesman for Sarawak denied this again in the

Sin  Chew  Jit Poh of 25th July. In this House on 16th  December,

1963,  the  Finance Minister also mentioned that we  were  giving

some  $30  million per year to North Borneo so that it  would  be

able to get some 8,000 labourers from Singapore every year.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister for Finance whether the promise by North

Borneo to engage workers from Singapore still holds good today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether, at the present juncture, the

Singapore Government is continuing negotiations with North Borneo

with  regard  to the employment of labourers from  Singapore  and

their terms of employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is this. If the North Borneo Government

finally refuses to engage workers from Singapore, why do we  have

a  provision for next year of a loan of $30 million to the  North

Borneo Government?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st November, the newspapers reported that Dato Pang Tet

Tshung, the Minister for Social Welfare of Sarawak, said that  he

was prepared to go to Taiwan to recruit labour. That being so,  I

ask,  why do we have a provision for next year of a loan  of  $30

million?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am not speaking on

the motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  not responsible for what the newspapers report about  what

Ministers say. I can only inform the Assembly what I know  for  a

fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present position is this. Discussions have taken place

between  officials  of  the  Singapore  Government,  the  Central

Government  and  the  Sarawak  and Sabah  Governments  over  this

matter. The Finance Ministry of the Central Government is  making

a  study  of the Development Plan of the North Borneo territories

of Sabah and Sarawak to find out how much labour content there is

in  this Plan; that is to say, if their development proposals are

carried  out,  then  how many workers will be involved?  On  that

basis,  50 per cent - it may be more or it may be less -  of  the

workers  they will employ in projects financed by the loans  made

from   the  Singapore  Development  Fund  will  be  engaged  from

Singapore. This is quite a complicated operation. The Ministry of

Labour  has asked people in the Unemployment Exchange whether  or

not  they  were prepared to work in Sabah and Sarawak,  and  just

over 8,000 persons have said that they were prepared to go there.

Therefore, the Singapore Government is making plans to  establish

reception  areas in Kuching, Jesselton, Sandakan and I  think  at

one  or  two other points, so that these people who want to  work

there  can  be sent there at Government's expense and live  there

until the call for their employment is made. We have agreed  with

the Central Government and the Sabah and Sarawak Governments that

the  cost  of  sending  workers  from  Singapore  to  the  Borneo

territories and the cost of maintaining them until they find work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



will  be  borne by the Singapore Government. If once  they  are

found  unsuitable after employment, then the cost of repatriating

them  back  to  Singapore will be borne by the Borneo  Government

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, this is a very complicated operation. The

officials  of  the  four  Governments  concerned  -  the  Central

Government,  the Singapore Government and the Sabah  and  Sarawak

Governments - are working out the details and I hope that we  can

reach  an early and satisfactory solution to this problem. If  we

can  find  jobs  for 8,000 of our citizens in Sabah  and  Sarawak

sometime next year, I think this will be a worthwhile achievement

to  relieve a lot of the distress and enforced idleness among our

young men and women. I do not think that this is too high a price

for  extending a $20 million interest-free loan and a $10 million

loan  with  interest. I am sure - whether we are in the Opposition

or  in the Government - that all we want to see is that young men

and  women  who  are unemployed will get an early opportunity  to

find useful work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, of course, we

all  hope that we can solve our unemployment problem. We  are  of

the  view  that  the  Government should  solve  the  unemployment

problem by solving the financial problem. We are granting a  loan

to  Sabah and Sarawak, and if they promise to give employment  to

our  youths,  then it will solve our unemployment  problem  to  a

certain extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the Prime Minister has said that our loan is tied

up  with  the  desire  of the Borneo territories  to  employ  our

people, but the Minister for Finance has repeatedly said that his

officials  have been carrying on negotiations. This seems  to  be

contrary to what the Prime Minister has said and the White  Paper

agreement.  Negotiations have taken place between  the  Singapore

Government  and  the North Borneo Government,  but  a  Government

spokesman of the Borneo territories has denied such negotiations.

It  is  reported in the newspapers that the Sarawak Minister  for

Social Welfare is going to Formosa



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



to  recruit  labour.  Therefore, we  feel  despondent  over  this

question. We must understand clearly that the loan money  belongs

to the Singapore Government. According to the Estimates, there is

a deficit of more than $20 million. We have been negotiating with

the  World Bank for loans to promote our industrial projects  for

example, the Jurong and Pasir Panjang projects - and yet  we  are

going  to  lend money to other people. If the loan is granted  to

North  Borneo  and  our people are not recruited  for  employment

there, it will be detrimental to the interest of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After merger and Malaysia, we have to contribute $127 million

to  the  Central Government. This is a great burden to the people

of  Singapore. If in addition to this we have to grant  a  yearly

loan  of $30 million to North Borneo without getting anything  in

return,  it  will be a bad deal. We have to look after  ourselves

first.  We hope that the Minister will take a firm stand  by  not

sacrificing  the interest of the people of Singapore when  making

the loan to North Borneo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Government to clarify whether the North Borneo

Government has agreed to recruit labour from Singapore.  If  not,

the loan must not be granted. This issue is one of the provisions

of  the  White  Paper.  For  the past one  year,  the  people  of

Singapore  have been in the dark with regard to the actual  terms

of  merger.  The Prime Minister is duty bound to reveal  all  the

facts. If North Borneo intends to do something detrimental to the

interest  of the people of Singapore, then we must point  out  to

her the terms of the White Paper agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 02 he reduced by $10 in

respect of subhead 003.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, subhead 003 refers to "Loan to Public

Utilities  Board".  What is the purpose of this  loan?  Has  this

something  to do with the loan (with interest) that we are  going

to  get from the World Bank for the Johore River Project and  the

Pasir Panjang Power Station Project?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Public Utilities Board is divided

into  three  main  service departments:  namely  the  Electricity

Department, the Water Department and the Gas Department.  As  the

population  is growing and the standard of living  is  going  up,

there is a continuous increase in the demand for more water, more

electricity  and  more gas. As a result, we  have  to  build  new

stations, to obtain new sources of water and build new plants  to

make more gas.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1965, the Public Utilities Board has a capital development

programme  of $83.3 million, of which the Electricity  Department

has  been  allocated  $52.2 million, the Water  Department  $25.4

million,  and the Gas Department $5.8 million. This rather  large

capital  expenditure will require finance from  several  sources.

There  are three main sources. The first is from the Board's  own

fund.  It  has  a  surplus in its operating accounts.  The  Board

itself  expects to finance its development projects to the amount

of $42 million. We expect to draw on the World Bank loans for our

electrical expansion as well as for our water expansion scheme to

the  amount  of  $20 million. The Government will, therefore,  be

called upon to provide an additional $25 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

what  the actual financial position of the P.U.B. is.   Recently,

many  citizens have complained to the P.U.B. that the  rates  for

water,  electricity  and gas have been increased.  Some  of  the

rates  have  been  increased to two or three times  the  original

rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months, meter-readers have not been sent to

various houses. The bills are based on past estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. There are some houses, especially in

Geylang Serai, which are vacant. However, the P.U.B. continues to

send out bills for water, light and gas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister will give an explanation on these

three points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many rural people are puzzled ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> On a

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think in this case, the Member for Thomson was

merely  trying to persuade the Finance Minister that  the  Public

I think he is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

it  is  being  raised. Will the Member please continue  with  his

speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, the P.U.B, has been receiving loans from the World

Bank and from the Government. However, there has been an increase

in  the  rates for water, electricity and gas. The Government  is

granting loans; hence the increase in the Estimates!

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first time I

have  heard  that  there has been an increase in  the  rates  for

water,  light and gas. I think what the Member probably meant  is

that  people have to pay more; their monthly bills have gone  up.

Of course, it could well be that their monthly bills have gone up

because they have used more water, light or gas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for meter-readers not doing their work properly, I think,

Mr Speaker, this is really not a development matter. If he feels

very strongly about it, he can raise the matter at Question Time.

He  should have raised it at the time when the ordinary Estimates

were being discussed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D 02 be reduced by $100.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under this heading, $88 million has been

provided in the 1965 Budget for development expenditure. Now,  if

this  sum of $88 million can help to relieve the increasing  pressure of growing unemployment in Singapore, I say that it is worth

it.  But  if  this sum of money is going to be wasted,  then  the

Government  should  be made responsible to the  businessmen,  the

clerks,  the  hawkers, the taxi-drivers and all the  citizens  of

Singapore who have contributed to this big amount of money. After

all, $88 million is not a small sum. There are three main items:

$31½ million for industrial development; $30 million for interest

free  loan  to Sarawak and Sabah; and a $25 million loan  to  the

Public  Utilities Board, presumably to complete the $100  million

Power Station or to start with the new water project.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the Government's

industrialisation programme is a flop. The Government  has  spent

$54 million up to several months ago. I have received the written

answers  to  my questions - and the figure given to  me  was  $54

million  -  which  is  in  addition  to  the  Government's  and

businessmen's investment in the scrap plant, the Jurong  shipyard

and the other 17 factories. I was told by the Minister that there

are   19  factories  now  in  production  in  Jurong.  All   this

expenditure has cost $100 million. I was told by the Minister for

Finance  that  in Jurong there were 1,851 people  working  as  at

August  1964. I have worked out the figures. In other words,  for

every  million dollar of investment in Jurong, we have only  been

able to create jobs for 20 persons - $1 million for 20 jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if this is additional employment for the

working  population in Singapore, it is not so bad.  But  in  the

case  of the Jurong scrap plant, the jobs created for 483  people

have  resulted  in the loss of jobs in other parts of  Singapore.

The  ban on the export of scrap has resulted in the loss of  much

employment  to  those people engaged in scrap collection.  Scrap,

which  used to come to Singapore from Johore, Malacca and as  far

as  Negri Sembilan, is now directed to Port Swettenham for export

to  Japan  as  it  fetches  a better net  price  despite  freight

charges. Mr Speaker, there are many people involved in the scrap

business.  They are lorry-drivers, workers and small businessmen.

All these people have now lost their jobs. Moreover, very soon, a

pig-iron  and  scrap plant will be built in Prai.  When  this  is

completed,  there  is  little prospect for  the  Singapore  scrap

plant. Mr Speaker, Sir, I must make clear the difference between

a  scrap plant and a steel mill. A scrap plant costs $10 million.

We can have a small one for as little as $2 million, like the one

in  Bukit Timah. A pig-iron plant costs $50 million. A steel mill

can cost anywhere between $500 million and $2,000 million.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, is it permissible for a Member to repeat a

speech  in  which precisely the same words were  used,  I  think,

about four or five days ago?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was coming to that, Mr Minister. I think the

Member for Hong Lim was merely trying to develop an argument.  If

he  will just mention these mills in passing, he will be able  to

develop his argument.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> That is right, Mr Speaker, Sir. With the new

data  in front of me given by the Minister for Finance about half

an  hour ago, I am going to prove to the people of Singapore that

all  this money has been wasted. We will get much from voting  an

extra  $88  million for 1965. Will our people get more jobs  from

the  $30  million interest free loan to Sabah and Sarawak?  I  am

afriad  that so far very few contracts in Sabah and Sarawak  have

been  awarded to Singapore contractors. Very few people have gone

over  there for jobs. How about the new power station  which  has

been started? This new $100 million power station, in my opinion,

will  be completely wasted if the Jurong Industrial Scheme cannot

expand to several hundred factories within a few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that during your time when

you  were  in  the  City Council, you had  a  grandiose  plan  of

building a new power station in the north of the Island.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Speaker has no past. He has just the

present and the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I am afraid, Sir, that if the Jurong

Industrial  Scheme  is a flop, we will see a  second  St.  James'

Power Station - a plant which has never been in operation and  on

which tens of millions of dollars have been spent. It seems to me

that the Government has been wasting public funds needlessly. The

Lim  Yew  Hock Government used to waste small sums of money.  The

P.A.P.  Government is one step above the Lim Yew Hock Government.

It is wasting big sums of money.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



I  will not be surprised if one day the whole  Jurong Industrial Scheme will be written off.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will take a few minutes to deal with the

scheme  in  Jurong  for which we are asked to  vote  another  $25

million.  This  is  the Jurong shipyard on which  more  than  $10

million have been spent. Can the Minister tell us how many  ships

have  been  built  so far? I understand that no ships  have  been

built  except some small tugboats. This job could have been under

taken  by three existing shipyards, Thornycroft, United Engineers

and  the  Singapore Harbour Board. Actually if the Government  is

more keen on practical results and the creation of employment and

less  keen  on propaganda and opening ceremonies, it should  have

provided  assistance to existing industries  for  expansion.  The

scrap  plant  in  Bukit  Timah Road can  be  expanded.  The  ship

building  and  ship  repairing industries of Thornycroft,  United

Engineers  and  the Singapore Harbour Board can  be  expanded  to

provide an equal number of employment opportunities as the Jurong

shipyard, and at only a small fraction of the cost. We would  not

have  been asked to vote for so much money. These are two of  the

few  instances of the Government's hare-brained scheme. After six

years  of  effort, the Prime Minister tells us in  this  Assembly

that  we  are  only  able  to  produce 43  "pioneer  certificate"

factories with a capacity to employ 6,687 people, when  they  are

in full production, not when they are operating now. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  most  of  the factories that are given pioneer certificates

before  Malaysia  Day  have not commenced building  but  are  now

adopting  a  wait-and-see  policy.  They  want  to  see  how  the

Indonesian  confrontation is going to be resolved. They  do  not

want  to  see their factories destroyed either by the possibility

of  enemy bombs or sabotage. They are also waiting to see whether

they  should  be  given Common Market protection by  the  Central

Government if they set up factories in Jurong. If not, they  will

go into the Federation. Although they are given work sites by the

Singapore Government, they are not eager to start



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



work.  But they must show that they are going to start, otherwise

their  pioneer certificates will be cancelled. The  only  way  to

keep  their  pioneer certificates alive is to spend a  couple  of

hundreds  of  dollars  performing  the  foundation  stone  laying

ceremony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it does not mean that Singapore cannot be

industrialised. Monies voted by this Assembly will not  be  lost.

Singapore   can   be  industrialised  as  Hong  Kong   has   been

industrialised. But such success depends on many  factors.  First

of  all, it depends on the goodwill and connivance of the Central

Government  because  it controls and issues pioneer  certificates

and  offers Common Market protection. As long as Lee Kuan Yew  is

the  Prime  Minister,  I am afraid the relationship  between  the

Central and the State will not improve ---



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Ong Eng Guan will be better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I believe the fight is a personal fight. You

have  no  brains to become Prime Minister. Do not worry, it  will

not come to you. I believe ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. "You" meaning the Speaker has no brains?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> No. Mr Speaker, Sir, I always have respect

for your brains.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Which particular brain was the Member referring

to then?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The Minister for Culture's, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Well, then you should say the Minister for

Culture's brains.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Thank you. Sir, I believe the fight is a

personal fight. That is why we had all these disturbances in July

and  September. It seems to me the Minister for Finance  has  the

brains.  He is a more acceptable chap. He stayed clear  from  the

Federal elections. He has always been taken along as a member  on

missions  abroad - Bangkok, Tokyo or the United Nations.  I  feel

that since the P.A.P. has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



sold us lock, stock and barrel, a change in the leadership of the

P.A.P. Government will not make any difference in the quantum  of

power  Singapore will have under the Constitution.  A  change  at

least  will  help to prevent further disturbances from occurring,

will  help to repair the relationship between Singapore  and  the

Centre,  particularly at a time when Singapore is bleeding  white

under  Indonesian confrontation. A change in the P.M.I.P.  Mentri

Besar  of Kelantan has done wonders and there is now more  active

co-operation  between the Centre and Kelantan. In  the  meantime,

the  present  Prime Minister can remain the Secretary-General  of

his  Party, the Mao Tse-tung of Singapore. Industrialisation will

be  much  easier and more jobs will be created. We only hope  the

Prime Minister will rise to the occasion. He has told me sometime

back that if ever there was one man in the P.A.P. ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have indications from the Interpreters

that the Member for Hong Lim is going a little too fast.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> He is excited!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> He has told me. Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime

back  that if ever there was one man in the P.A.P. who would  man

the  barracks with him should the time come when he fails, he  is

Keng Swee. I have no doubt, Sir, that the Prime Minister ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is this "Keng Swee" the Minister for Finance or

some other "Keng Swee"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he was then not the

Minister for Finance. It was some years back ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister for Finance is being referred to

by name, he must he referred to by title in this House. He is the

Minister  for Finance and he must be referred to as the  Minister

for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Sir. He mentioned that if the time comes

when the P.A.P. fails and he has to man the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



barracks, he expects all the people in the P.A.P, will  run  away

except  the Minister for Finance, who will stick with him to  man

the barracks.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no doubt

that  the  Prime  Minister can have trust  in  the  Minister  for

Finance, as Mao Tse-tung has full trust in Liu Shao-chi and  Chou

En-lai in China, to run his Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after solving that problem, the Government

should undertake war risk insurance to calm businessmen who  wish

to start industrial enterprises in Jurong. This should also cover

sabotage, particularly when we had reports only yesterday of Indonesian landings in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the relationship with the Central

Government  has improved, it is also necessary for the Government

to  reorganise  the Economic Development Board.  A  programme  of

industrialisation has to be drafted. Target dates for  completion

must  be set. General outlines of the plan of action have  to  be

laid  down  and published. I wish to outline briefly the  reasons

why  the Government's industrialisation programme has failed  and

why  therefore  it is coming back here year after year  for  more

money.  It  is  not  due  to  the  Communists.  If  it  were  so,

Government's industrialisation programme would have succeeded now

because  all  the  Communists have now  been  locked  up  by  the

Government. Neither was it the fault of the Indonesians.  Because

if  it  were  so,  before Malaysia Day, there was  no  Indonesian

problem.  The  Government's industrialisation programme  had  not

succeeded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's industrialisation policy has failed because:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. It has no set objectives. The Government works from day to

day,  on  the  basis of trial and error. There has never  been  a

master plan of industrialisation, because none of the P.A.P.  Ministers have any business or industrial experience.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.There is no difference between the Economic Development

Board and Lim Yew Hock's Industrial Promotion Board except the

change of name ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Good God!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> 3. The P.A.P. Government is unrealistic. It

is  only  keen  on  projects which can  bear  results  on  P.A.P.

propaganda, instead of establishing factories which  can  be  run

without  Government subsidies and providing more jobs per  dollar

of investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government should concentrate on

small-size and medium-size factories which have provided Hong Kong with

countless jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will summarise briefly the steps which Government should take

once  its  relationship with the Central Government has improved;

that  is,  if  the  Government  intends  to  accept  some  of  my

suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Government should find a man of the calibre of Teh

Chiang Wan as he is to the Housing Board -[Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time is up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, confronted by the farrago of nonsense

from  the  Member for Hong Lim, it is difficult for me to  decide

where  to start and where to end. He is like one of the  old  warriors using those mortars where you put in nails, springs and old

bolts,  and  fire at the target hoping that some damage  will  be

done.  Let me just deal with one or two falsehoods. He says there

is  no difference between the Economic Development Board and  the

former Government's Industrial Promotion Board. The difference is

so  tremendous that I cannot understand how a sane man  can  make

such  a  foolish and reckless statement. The Economic Development

Board  has  got 39 professional officers, engineers,  architects,

chemical  engineers, accountants and economists. Six of them  are

experts  sent by the United Nations, men of international  reputation. The rest are local people. Whereas the Industrial Promotion

Board  has  not got anybody. Really, they have not  got  anybody.

Perhaps they were just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



starting. Then he says our industrialisation programme is a flop.

Of  course, he is entitled to his opinion. One of the reasons  he

says  is  that  we have not got Mr Teh Chiang Wan. Members  will

recollect that two and a half years ago he said that our  housing

programme was a flop. Now when it is a success, he says it is due

to  a  genius, Mr Teh Chiang Wan. One does not want  to  detract

from  the excellent work done by this officer, but I think credit

is  also due to the Government and the Minister concerned in this

effort. So perhaps in another few years' time the Member for Hong

Lim  will say that the success of the industrialisation programme

is  due to the genius of Mr Hon Sui Sen, and has got nothing  to

do with the effort or the policies of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in my reply in the

Budget debate, I did point out the errors of these statements  in

regard  to  the steel mill. The Member for Hong Lim was  not  present.  Perhaps I may just be permitted to give briefly  what  the

facts are. He says that although some 480 workers are now working

in  the  steel mill in Jurong, it has not created any  additional

employment because about the same number of workers has been  rendered  unemployed  elsewhere.  That  is  absolute  nonsense,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir. As I have said the other day, the steel mill  buys

all  the  scrap  that is available here. In fact, the  supply  of

local  dealers  cannot meet the demand. They are buying  all  the

scrap  that  is coming from the Federation and the  prices  which

they pay are higher, 10 per cent higher than the f.o.b. price  of

similar grades of iron ore in Singapore. The whole thing has been

entered into the contract of agreement between the steel mill and

the  Economic Development Board, and in the event of  differences

between the steel mill and the scrap dealer, there are procedures

for arbitration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim says the Jurong shipyard is a waste of

time.  How many ships have they produced? Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

Jurong  shipyard became operational sometime in July  this  year,

about four months ago. Does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



he  expect  any  shipyard to be able to  produce  ships  in  four

months?  They  now have under construction some  small  craft,  a

water boat, which the Port Authority of Klang have ordered.  They

have  on  the  order books two or three larger  vessels.  In  the

meantime,  until the very large dry dock which they are  building

and  which will be able to accommodate oil tankers of up to about

80,000  tons is completed, business will be less than the  target

production. It takes some time for facilities of the shipyard  to

be  completed.  The Member says it is better to  help  the  small

shipyards  in Singapore and the small boat builders. He  mentions

Thornycroft  and United Engineers, some expatriate companies.  He

is  not  aware that we have already given assistance to  no  less

than  19  local ship builders and boat builders on  the  edge  of

Kallang Park, where it abuts on to the Geylang River. As a result

of  the facilities that we offer, these small operators have been

able to increase their activities considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Member for Hong Lim has made any other

constructive  comments, nor is there any substance in  the  other

points  he has raised. I think we have discussed the question  of

the $30 million loan to Sabah and Sarawak and have clarified the

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his ratio of $l million for 20 jobs in Jurong, I

think  he, being an accountant, knows what the real position  is.

He is deliberately trying to mislead and deceive the people.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the capital expenditure of $54 million spent on Jurong

covers  general development purposes, such as roads,  which  will

serve the whole area and not merely the 19 industries that are in

production now. The wharves and other facilities will  serve  the

whole  area  and these are long-term development facilities,  and

they  should not he imputed to the 19 factories that are  now  in

operation  in Jurong. Considerable sums of money have  also  been

spent on social services, which is part of Government's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



responsibility to provide the residents there. It is completely

incorrect  to  say that this should be related to the  number  of

people employed there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to argue with

the  Minister  for Finance as to whether a $1 million  investment

creates jobs for 20, 25 or 35 persons. What we know is that  vast

sums  of money have been voted year in and year out for the  last

four or five years for the Jurong industrial project. And today I

have been told that there are only 1,831 people working in the 19

factories. Mr Speaker, Sir, surely this figure shows that it  is

a flop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I am going to suggest ways and means to bring about an

industrial  revolution.  Once relationship  with  the  Centre  is

improved,  the Government should find a man, as I have said  just

now,  of  the  calibre  of  Teh Chiang Wan  to  master-mind  the

Government's industrialisation programme. We cannot eat the  cake

and still have it, Mr Speaker. In the case of the Housing Board,

I  am told it is not Mr Teh Chiang Wan or the civil servants who

should  get  the credit. It is the Minister. If Mr Hon  Sui  Sen

starts it, it is not he who claims credit. It is the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you remember, several days ago we had a

magnificent  episode  in  the Victoria Theatre  where  the  Prime

Minister dramatically caught a fly and put the whole blame on the

civil  servants.  He  put  the blame on the  civil  servants  for

meandering cows, stray dogs, beggars, flies, and the increase  in

mosquitoes.  Once upon a time Singapore could  claim  to  be  the

cleanest city in South-East Asia. Now everybody says this is  the

dirtiest city in South-East Asia, even surpassing Jakarta.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this: the key staff of the Economic

Development  Board  should not be civil servants  but  should  be

experienced  industrialists,  cost accountants,  economists,  and

hankers,  recruited  from  the business  world;  people  who  are

prepared  to sever all outside business connections and  dedicate

themselves to the country's industrialisation programme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that a general outline of Government's

industrialisation plan should be worked out and published. So far

we  have no plans whatsoever. There should be a complete stop  to

experimentation of factories by trial and error, which is such  a

waste  of public funds. At present the Government has no  policy.

The  Government has no plans. The Government has set no  targets.

It does not know what it is doing. Where are we heading for?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is this: a full list of all products which can

be  profitably  produced in Singapore should  be  worked  out  in

detail  and published. Last time the Government published details

of  three  types  of products, hoping to solve Singapore's  acute

unemployment  problem - generators, fire crackers,  and  mosquito

killers. These products are not practical. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  as

far as I know, no factory in Singapore has taken the cue from the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point: Government should give liberal loans to

small-scale  and medium-scale enterprises. I understand that at present

it is very hard for them to get loans from Government unless they

have  special connections. Mr Speaker, Sir, the only factory  to

get  a  liberal loan was, I understand, the ship-breaking factory

which  Government  helped with 2½ per cent interest.  There  have

been  complaints from other factories that it is  very  difficult

for them to get loans.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all this difficulty about

getting loans

a  string  of falsehoods and stupidity. Every week the Economic

Development Board considers loan applications, and, speaking from

memory, subject to verification, I think the Economic Development

Board  is committed to lending something like $35 million. It  is

really tedious to listen to all these falsehoods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this point about a list of products. The Member says we do

not have a list of products. We have a list of products. They are

called Study Papers. Dozens of Study Papers have been produced by

the Economic Development Board. They are not published



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



in  the  Straits  Times  because  nobody  generally   is

interested  in them. But they are circulated to manufacturers  in

their  respective  fields. As for electrical  products,  he  says

nobody  is taking the matter up. It has been taken up by  two  or

three firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On relationship with the Centre, his main thesis is this, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that in the administration of the setting up  of  a

common  market and general industrialisation policy, the  Federal

Government will not observe good faith. That is the basis of  his

whole  argument the Federal Government will go out of its way  to

do  in Singapore. If that were to happen, it would be not only  a

matter  of our industries not going up, but the whole of Malaysia

might  break up. I cannot see under what circumstances people  in

Singapore are going to put up with a Central Government that acts

in  bad  faith.  But  until that is shown, I think  it  would  be

utterly  wrong  for  the  Member for Hong  Lim  to  come  to  the

conclusion that the Federal Government is acting in bad faith. We

have  had  many  discussions  over  concrete  issues  on  various

matters,  and  we  have found that they acted in a  business-like

manner  and in good faith. I have no reason at all to  doubt  the

faith  of  the  Federal  Government  in  matters  connected  with

industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as for Jurong, the Member for Hong Lim says 1,800 workers

employed  in  six  years. I did make the  point  that  the  first

factory went into production on 31st January this year, and  that

the  1,800  workers was the count made in August.  In  fact,  the

total  now  will have exceeded 2,000. In addition to that,  there

are 2,600 workers engaged in various construction works in Jurong

-  factories, housing, new roads, and so on. So if the Member for

Hong  Lim still believes this is a flop, then, of course,  he  is

entitled  to  his own opinion. He cannot expect  many  people  to

agree with him on that point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really surprised that a

public accountant who is a Member of this Assembly could come  to

the  conclusion  that the success of any organisation,  like  the

Housing Board or the Economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



Development Board, could depend solely on the efforts of one man.

No  one has claimed that the success of the Housing Board is  his

own  solo  effort, except the Member for Hong Lim, who  now  says

that  the  Housing  Board is a success,  when  the  Minister  for

Finance has said that two years ago the Member for Hong Lim  said

it  was a flop. During the general elections in 1963, he stood up

and said, the Housing Board is a success because ---"



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Please give the quotes two years ago, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> An election speech. Now during the elections

in  1963, he stood up and said about his lieutenant, "The Housing

Board  succeeds because of Mr Ng Chee Seng." Now, Mr  Ng  Chee

Seng  and Mr Teh Chiang Wan - let me nail this lie once  and  for

all. Mr Teh Chiang Wan, Mr Ng Chee Seng, and a few other senior

oflicers  were brought by him into the Housing Board to help  him

build  houses and run the S.I.T. What happened? They made a  mess

of  it. The only one who is now left there is Mr Teh Chiang Wan.

The  Member had a good man there but he did not know how to  make

use  of  him. As for the others, Mr Ng Chee Seng was the manager

under  him. He was the chairman, Mr Ng Chee Seng was the  No.  1

man,  and  Mr Teh Chiang Wan was No. 2 man. When the  Board  was

reorganised,  his  friends  and  all  his  minions   were   found

unsuitable.  We  took them out. We only retained  those  whom  we

think  can  work. And we work as a team. So the  success  of  the

Housing Board is not due to the efforts of his picking out people

whom  he  cannot use, but is the result of the work of a team  of

young and very dedicated workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim says that the Government has got no

long-term  plans  or long-term industrialisation programmes,  and

that what we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



doing  is by trial and error. He is an accountant. He is in close

contact  with  the  business world and the industrial  world.  He

knows very well that our businessmen are not going to do anything

by   trial  and  error.  They  are  going  to  make  very   close

calculations before they embark on any scheme at all. You can  be

sure  that  when  a  businessman goes into  Jurong,  he  has  got

everything  analysed and the chances of his making a  profit  are

there. Otherwise he will not go in at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, actually there is no need

to  reply  to the Minister because he could just give quotes  but

could  not prove it. Nobody in the world can trust this  type  of

person. Now, he claims that nobody is responsible for the housing

achievement; not one single person.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I never said that nobody is responsible. What

I  said  was  that  no one could claim that only  one  person  is

responsible. I never said that nobody is responsible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you remember what was in

the  newspapers,  the Prime Minister said that the  Minister  for

National Development is the only person who broke the backbone of

housing  in Singapore. Now, I claim that it is not the  Minister.

It is Teh Chiang Wan who broke the backbone.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> If he can disprove it, come and tell me in

three minutes' time how he managed to break the backbone. I shall

wait for him. And if he cannot, I shall tell him in three minutes

how the backbone was broken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have never claimed that I

broke  the backbone of the housing problem. Probably he did claim

it  a  few  days ago, right in this House - that he is indirectly

responsible for it. I have never claimed it. I only said that the

housing programme was a success because of good team work among a

group of people.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, when the Assembly was

debating  the Development Estimates for the Ministry of Education

last  year, we had already raised these questions. Now I have  to

raise  again the same questions because the past shortcomings  in

the Ministry of Education are still existing today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various items on page 16 of the Development Estimates

from which we can see that the Government is making many plans to

build  primary schools and secondary schools. There are academic,

vocational,  technical and commercial types of schools.  However,

some  schemes  which  were started in  1960  have  not  yet  been

completed up till now. We are now talking about the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



Development  Estimates for 1965. A period  of  five  years  has

elapsed since the scheme was first mooted. There are three  items

under  subhead 002. They refer to secondary technical schools  at

Dunearn  Road, Ngee Ann Kongsi, and Serangoon Garden; $40,000  is

required  for  the Ngee Ann Kongsi vote to complete  the  school.

Does  this  reflect on the efficiency of Ngee Ann Kongsi  or  the

Ministry  of Education? Or does it mean that the sum allotted  is

not  enough? Where in one year the vote is not spent then in  the

following  year  the same sum will be voted again  for  the  same

project.  What sort of plan is this? Many schemes of the Ministry

of Education are useless. Their purpose is to serve as ornaments.

They  want to show others that Singapore is very progressive  and

that the Ministry of Education is being responsible in wanting to

spend a lot of money on various projects. I would like to give  a

point-by-point  criticism  of the various  items  of  expenditure

which are asked for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, under subhead 003, there is provision for

building a school called Wallich Street Primary School. The  idea

to  build such a school was started in 1961. But up till  now  it

has not yet been completed. Last year the Assembly voted $379,000

for  a  secondary  academic school at Jalan  Eunos,  Kaki  Bukit.

However,  this vote was not used at all. In the 1965  Development

Estimates  a  sum  of $421,000 is required for  this  particular

school. Last year, there was a plan for another school, but  this

year, this item has disappeared. This refers to the school in the

New  Market area. According to my understanding, nothing has been

done about it. Work has never been started on it. I would like to

refer  especially to the proposed academic school  under  subhead

003,  item  002. The sum which was allocated to build a secondary

academic  school at Jalan Eunos, Kaki Bukit, has not  been  used.

Under  subhead  004, there are three secondary  academic  schools

which  have  not yet been completed. In the 1963 school  building

programme,  which now appears under subhead 005, item 002,  there

were 3 secondary academic schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



proposed  to  be  built and which have not yet  been  completed

according  to plan. These various votes which have been  approved

in  the  past involve a big sum of money. However, they have  not

been used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago, I remember the Minister for Education asked

this  House to approve a supplementary vote because 6,000 pupils

were trying to enter academic secondary schools. There was a lack

of  accommodation. Other types of school buildings - technical

and  vocational schools - have had to be used to accommodate such

students.  But judging from this programme here, if the  Ministry

had  been able to complete their building plans, there would  not

have been a lack of accommodation at the moment. The outcome  now

is  that many pupils who left the primary schools were unable  to

find  places  in  the secondary schools. I am referring  to the

6,000  pupils  who  were  unable to join the  secondary  academic

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We remember in the past the Assembly approved a vote for the

building of schools just for this purpose. However, many  schools

have  not  yet  been  completed. The main  reason  is  this.  The

Government has never made full use of the money. I would like  to

know what is the factor which has contributed to this phenomenon.

Provisions  for various projects covering a period of five  years

have  been allotted to the Ministry of Education. Are they  being

used?  We  have  already  approved a vote  for  the  building  of

schools.  However,  the  Ministry of Education  is  not  able  to

complete the project. This shows that the Ministry is not able to

carry it out, it has not been making full use of the money.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In debating this amend merit, Members may speak

on amendments (2), (3), (4) and (5)

simultaneously.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are various

difficulties  connected  with the construction  of  schools.  The

delay  in  the  construction of schools  is  mainly  due  to  the

difficulties in the acquisition of suitable land and also in  the

clearance of squatters from the site once it is available. Once a

site is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



acquired  and  cleared, then a school can be put up  within  18

months.  These are actually the general reasons why some  of  the

schools planned for in 1960, 1961 and 1962 and so forth have  not

been completed to date.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, each one of these has its good reasons. I think just

now  the  Member for Thomson mentioned a number of schools  which

have  not  yet  been  completed since 1960,  1961  and  1962.  He

mentioned  specifically subhead 002 in respect of three secondary

technical  schools under the 1960 school building programme.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  these three secondary technical schools  are  the

Dunearn  Hill  Secondary  Technical School,  the  Balestier  Hill

Secondary  Technical  School and the Serangoon  Garden  Secondary

Technical  School. The construction work of these  three  schools

has  already  been  completed, except an assembly  hall  for  the

Dunearn Hill Secondary Technical School. Both the Balestier  Hill

Secondary  Technical  School and the Serangoon  Garden  Technical

School  are  now already functioning and the media of instruction

are Chinese and English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Thomson also mentioned Wallich School which

is included in the 1961 school building programme. The difficulty

here is that the site is under-sized and therefore it requires  a

special  non-standard size plan. Then when a special plan  for  a

school  in  this  particular area was prepared, work  had  to  be

stopped  at  the request of the Ministry of National  Development

which was then considering including this particular school  site

in  the  Urban  Redevelopment  Plan.  However,  the  Ministry  of

National  Development has now agreed not to raise any  objections

to  the  construction of the school and work  will  proceed  very

soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Thomson also mentioned several other

academic  schools which were included in the 1961, 1962 and  1963

plans, but were not completed to date. There are good reasons  in

each  one of these. In the case of the secondary academic  school

at  Jalan  Eunos,  Kaki  Bukit, more than  56  per  cent  of  the

construction work has so far



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



been  completed and the building is expected to be ready  early

1965. Then in the case of the secondary technical school at Upper

Aljunied Road, more than 70 per cent of the construction work has

already been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the three academic schools provided for under subhead 004,

that  is,  at  Still Road, Queenstown 3 and Whitley  Road/Dunearn

Road  junction. All these three schools are in various stages  of

construction.  In  the case of the Still Road  and  Queenstown  3

secondary  academic  schools,  more  than  70  per  cent  of  the

construction work has been completed. In the case of the  Whitley

Road/Dunearn Road junction secondary academic school, 65 per cent

of  the  work  has been completed. As I have said just  now,  the

delay  is  due principally to the difficulty of land acquisition,

difficulty of finding a suitable school site, and having found  a

suitable school site, the difficulty connected with clearance  of

squatters, and they the Barisan Sosialis are the persons who make

the clearance of squatters doubly difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although there are difficulties and delays in

work which cannot be helped, nevertheless, the important point is

whether  every  child of school-going age can  find  a  place  in

school.  If  no child of school-going age is denied  a  place  in

school, then I say we have succeeded. For the last five years  we

have  been able to admit every child of school-going age. To that

extent, Mr Speaker, Sir, I say our school building programme has

not failed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to differ with the

Minister  for  Education that the yardstick  of  success  in  our

school building programme is whether every child gets a place  in

school  or not. Mr Speaker, Sir, if we extend school classes  to

24 hours a day, I think there is no need to build schools at all.

We  can  still accommodate all children in schools. Now, we  have

two  sessions.  If we fail in our school expansion programme,  we

can  stretch  it  to  three  sessions for  one  school.  But  the

important  point  is  this.  Schools  are  built  not   only   to

accommodate children, but they are also built in order to provide

training in industrialisation, which is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



one  of  our main objectives. That is why, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we

supported the Government when they voted to build more vocational

schools  and  technical schools in the earlier  Budgets - in  1960,

1961,  1962,  1963 and 1964 - where provisions were made  for  the

construction  of vocational and technical schools. These  schools

will  complement the Polytechnic to produce technicians,  masons,

carpenters,  bricklayers, whom the Polytechnic does not  produce.

Mr  Speaker, in a colonial country technicians are not  required

because  a  colonial  country does not require industrialisation.

But  since Singapore from the time of the Lim Yew Hock Government

onwards  is  supposed  to have entered the phase  of  industrialisation,  we  must have more technical schools. It is  because  of

this  objective that the Lim Yew Hock Government has set  up  the

Industrial  Promotion  Board,  established  the  Singapore   Poly

technic,  built industrial estates and started building technical

schools.  Whichever government that comes to power will  have  to

carry  on  with the industrialisation of Singapore. This  is  the

pattern of economic progress in all developing countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation has become the yardstick of economic progress

and  the expression of economic nationalism. An industrial estate

is  a waste of money unless there are factories. A factory has to

he  operated  by  technicians. It is the task  of  the  Education

Ministry  to build technical schools to supply these technicians.

Industrialisation  can never be achieved  if  a  country  has  to

depend  forever  on foreign technicians. China would  never  have

been  able  to  produce an atomic bomb if it  had  to  depend  on

foreign  technicians.  The Education Ministry  must  prepare  and

publish  a  blue  print to replace all foreign  technicians  with

local technicians in the space of five years. I do not think  the

Government  has such a plan. If it has, it has not published  it.

It  is  very  disheartening  to see industrial  progress  in  our

country so slow, crawling like a snail. Mr Speaker, Sir, imagine

starting  to  build  schools  in 1960  and  they  have  not  been

completed yet! Hong Kong and Eastern



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



Australia  are examples of countries which have achieved  their

industrial breakthrough in less than six years, the time given to

the  P.A.P.  Government. The unquestionable supply of technicians

is  one  of  the  basic conditions to bring about  an  industrial

revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Polytechnic has not been expanded. The

technical  colleges have not been built. The Government  announce

gigantic  plans from year to year to build technical schools.  In

my opinion, I do not think any has been completed so far. One was

announced  this morning to have been completed.  It  was  in  the

Straits  Times this morning, Sir, in page 4, under  the  caption,

"The  Government  spending $18 million on 41 new  schools."  They

announced  that  one  technical  school  had  been  completed  in

Queenstown.  I  wonder whether it was completed this  morning  or

last  night. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think even the Queenstown

Technical  School which was announced this morning to  have  been

completed  has  been  completed, because  there  was  no  opening

ceremony.  To soften the weight of the Opposition attack  on  the

complete  failure  of the P.A.P.'s school-building  programme  in

today's  Budget  debate on schools, the Government  announced  in

this  morning's  papers of a $40 million plan to  build  so  many

schools. Why do the Government not wait for a few hours more  and

tell the Assembly this plan? Mr Speaker, Sir, it is like hitting

below the belt. It is an insult to this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the 1965 Budget we see everything very clearly. A

technical  school  started in 1961 is still  not  completed.  Two

technical  schools started in 1962 have still a long  way  to  go

before they are completed. Two technical schools for which  money

was  provided  in the 1963 Budget have not even got started.  Two

technical schools due to he started in 1963 have not even got the

plans.  From  1961 to 1964, seven technical schools  should  have

been  completed. Even if we accept that the Queenstown  Technical

School  was completed, according to today's Straits Times,  there

are still six behind time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not only in the technical schools section

that  the Government's school construction programme is  a  flop.

The  whole  school building programme is a flop.  The  reason  is

simple.  There are no plans, no organisation, no Teh Chiang  Wans

to carry out the school construction programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing Board also faces the same

difficulties as the Minister for Education has outlined just now.

Squatters'  problem, availability of site. They have  got  50,000

units  of  houses to build, not seven schools, Sir. There  is  no

harm.  Put  the  blame  on the P.W.D.! Before  the  elections,  I

remember  the  Housing  Board under Teh  Chiang  Wan  built  some

schools  for the Ministry of Education. That is why I  have  said

that so long as Teh Chiang Wan is there, houses will be built, no

matter  who  is appointed to be Minister in charge of Housing  or

whoever is appointed to be Chairman of the Housing Board,  though

he  might  be a nincompoop who does not understand the difference

between  a  brick  and a stone. Since 1961, we have  primary  and

secondary schools the building of which has either not started or

has not been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Budget, all the primary and secondary schools

in  the  1962, 1963 and 1964 school-building programmes have  not

yet been completed. Before the elections, the Government promised

free  secondary  education. How can we have free secondary  educa

tion  when  there are not enough secondary schools? Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  this is another of the P.A.P.'s broken promises. I ask  the

Government not to make more excuses when it comes back next  year

for  the  1966 Budget, but immediately to obtain the services  of

Mr  Teh  Chiang  Wan to organise a breakthrough in  the

school-building programme.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are solemn promises to the electorate which the

Government   must  fulfil.  Altogether  there  are  53   primary,

secondary, vocational, and technical schools which the Government

promised to build for the people before 1964. Unless this backlog

of schools is cleared -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



some  of  them started as early as 1960 - how can the  Government

start planning for the 19 secondary schools which

they have asked to be provided in the 1965 budget?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, just now the Minister

for  Education, in answering my questions, made some  excuses  to

cover  up his mistakes. He talked about the reasons for the delay

in  the  school building programmes for 1961-62-63. He also  said

that   it  was  because  of  difficulties  in  land  acquisition,

clearance of squatters, and, in particular, he mentioned that the

Barisan  Sosialis was trying to put difficulties in  his  way.  I

challenge  him  to  point out the areas  where  we  have  put  up

difficulties  to  cause a delay in the school-building  programme

for Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the difficulties mentioned are not

insuperable.  The real reason is that the Minister for  Education

is  not  too clever. He is not realistic in drafting the

school-building  programme.  They tried to build a  ship  behind  closed

doors.  They  found an unsuitable place. It is the responsibility

of the Minister concerned to know where to find vacant places for

school  buildings. They may say that they want to build a  school

in  the Clifford Pier or Asia Building area. If they cannot, then

they  will  say that they are not able to get any land.  So  they

have  no  time  to find out where they could get available  land.

They are trying to bluff the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no difficulties that cannot be surmounted. No excuse

can  be given for failure to build a school in five years. No one

will ever believe this excuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about land, its acquisition and the clearance of

squatters,  the Minister tried to put the blame on the  squatters

on   the  land  to  be  acquired  for  development.  It  is  very

unreasonable to put the blame on others. I can give  you  a  very

simple and clear example. I think I have mentioned it last  night

in  this  House. It is about the Chi Hua Chinese  School  in  Toa

Payoh.  I  found  that  the Government  had  no  difficulties  in

clearing the squatters in that area.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



The  squatters  were occupying the land near  the  school,  and

under  the development programme of Toa Payoh, the school had  to

give  way to this development. The school was asked to move  away

from this place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us to another matter, i.e., if the Government has a

plan  to build a school and that plan is found not realistic,  if

the Government is not able to build enough schools to accommodate

all  the students. On the other hand, the Government tries to  do

away  with  some of the existing schools apart from the  Chi  Hua

Chinese School which has been in existence for a long time. There

are  some  other  cases.  Sometime  this  year  the  Ministry  of

Education  had  to do away with a school in the Joo  Chiat  area.

This  was  the Min Yee School. For no reason at all, it  was  done

away with. The directors and governors of the school ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member is in great danger of

getting back to yesterday's debate. Will he keep that in mind and

come back to the subject before the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I was just trying to

draw  an analogy to show how and why the Government is unable  to

complete  the  school-building programme. On the one  hand,  some

schools  were  put out of existence. On the other hand,  the  Government  has not been able to build any new schools. This closely

ties up with the development programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about Min Yee School in Joo Chiat, I think sometime in

August  or September, a notice was given to the school  to  close

down.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member can

show  that  the  closing  down  of  schools  will  advance  his

arguments  on  the topic under discussion, then  he  will  be  in

order.  But  if he is going into the merits and demerits  of  the

closing  clown  of  schools, then he will be  completely  out  of

order, and I shall stop him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): There is one other school, Mr

Speaker, which was closed down last year or the year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



before.  This was Chung Kuok School in the neighbourhood  of  the

General  Hospital.  The Government promised  to  accommodate  the

students of the school in another school nearby. So it called  up

the  governors of this school and said that the students had been

occupying the Government school building for one year and if they

were  unable  to provide alternative accommodation  for  the  students,  then  the students would have to be transferred  to  some

integrated schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned three cases of schools having to close

down.  This  is  to show a contrast that, on the  one  hand,  the

Government  has not completed its school-building programme  and,

on the other hand, schools are being closed down so that students

of  these  schools  are  absorbed into  Government  schools.  The

shortage  of schools has therefore become acute. This is  a  very

serious mistake made by the Minister for Education. He should not

try  to  bring  extraneous matters into the education  field  and

should not try to give excuses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I do not wish to

go further into these allegations of our failure to carry out our

school-building programme. I have already said just now that  the

difficulties lie in land acquisition and in looking for  suitable

land, it is difficult to find vacant space in the city to  build

schools.  This  is  well known to all. Even if  you  can  find  a

suitable  plot  of  land, it will take some time  to  acquire  it

because  you  will have to bargain over the price. And  when  the

deal  is  concluded, it will still require some time  to  put  up

plans and to survey. Even after the land has been acquired, there

may be squatters on the land. And to clear them will require more

time. So it is not that we do not want to build schools according

to  schedule, but because of difficulties beyond our control.  In

spite  of that, I have already said that up to date we have built

enough  schools  to accommodate every child of school-going  age.

There  is  no child of school-going age who is denied a place  in

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has said just now that if we wanted to

find more accommodation, we could extend the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



time  for  schooling. Instead of having two sessions, we  could

have  three  sessions,  or even have classes  at  night.  He  has

suggested that we should have three sessions instead of  two.  He

has  also  said that if this were done, then we could  have  more

accommodation.  I want him to give one instance  where  a  school

runs three sessions in Singapore. Otherwise his suggestion is far

too  fantastic.  As  a matter of fact, there is  no  shortage  of

school accommodation. In fact, we have more than enough. In  some

rural areas there are vacancies in primary schools, so the use of

the  school building is enough for the morning session. There  is

no  need to run afternoon classes because of the vacancies in the

morning session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim then said that some technical and

vocational  schools were not completed according to  schedule.  I

have  already  pointed  out the difficulties,  and  I  have  also

pointed out that the majority of technical and vocational schools

were completed, some by 70 per cent and some by 50 per cent,  and

some  have  already been opened. Yet he said that none  has  been

opened. If he is not day-dreaming, I do not know what it  is.  He

also  said  that  in Queenstown there was one  technical  school

which was not completed although a newspaper reported that it was

opened. In fact, if he is not day-dreaming, I can tell him that I

myself opened that school. I officiated at the opening ceremony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then referred to a news item in the Straits Times of today

about  Government's intention to spend so much money on  building

schools.  He  complained that this was given to the Press  before

the Assembly convened. Mr Speaker, this news was not released by

me  and I did not instruct anyone to give such information to the

Press   and  I  will  not  be  held  responsible.  But   whatever

construction  work that the Government is doing  should  be  made

known to the public. I should bring this point to your attention.

So  there is nothing wrong for the Government to tell the  people

what it is doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Hong Lim also said just now that if

Singapore  wanted to succeed in its industrialisation  programme,

then we should train more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



technical personnel. No one quarrels with him on this point. This

is  precisely  what the Government appreciates and is  doing.  We

know  that to bring industrialisation to a successful conclusion,

we must have more technical personnel. That is why we are putting

up so many technical and vocational schools under the first

Five-Year  Plan.  It  is  all  very clear, as  we  can  see  from  the

Estimates.  We have plans to put up vocational and technical  and

secondary schools.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, without realising the importance of trained and skilled

personnel,  how  would one expect the Government  to  incorporate

such plans in the first Five-Year Plan? We would not have put  up

our programme for so many technical and vocational schools if  we

had  not appreciated its importance. As a matter of fact, in  the

secondary vocational, and technical schools, there are more  than

enough  vacancies to meet the demand of students. Not only  that,

we  also  have plans under way to expand our Vocational  Training

Institute. We intend to put in a vote of $2 million to expand the

Vocational  Institute with a view to training more technical  and

skilled labour to meet our industrial requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson just now said something about Toa Payoh.

He  mentioned this yesterday and he is still mentioning it today.

He  said  that we closed down Chi Hua Chinese School because  the

Housing and Development Board wanted to acquire the land on which

the  school  stood,  and the school was asked  to  move  away  to

another  school. Mr Speaker, we have built a new school  in  the

neighbourhood  of  this particular school. It  is  known  as  the

Balestier Hill West School. The idea is to absorb students of Chi

Hua  Chinese School and of other neighbouring schools  into  this

school. If the residents of Toa Payoh, on the other hand, have to

move  away from this area to some other places, then some of  the

students  may not be able to go to the neighbouring schools  that

we  have built. In that case, we are prepared to find alternative

schools for these students. We have tried as far as possible,  to

put  them  in schools nearest to their homes. There is no  single

school student who is forced out of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



school because of the Government's land acquisition programme  in

Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson also mentioned the Chung Kuok School

near the General Hospital. He said the Government was responsible

for  closing  it down. He said that we forced the school  out  of

existence  with the intention of absorbing it into the Government

Silat  Road School. As a matter of fact, two or three months  ago

the directors of this school wrote me a letter - to the Ministry

of  Education, to put it more precisely - asking the  Ministry  to

take  over  this  particular school. The  Ministry  of  Education

thought it was a good idea, because there was already a school in

Silat  Road, which has enough accommodation to start  classes  in

the  Chinese  stream.  So  we met the request  of  the  board  of

directors of this school and we shouldered our responsibility. As

a  result,  Silat  Road School will become an  integrated  school

catering for Tamil, Chinese and English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in planning the building of schools, all that we

can do is to estimate how many schools we should build every year

to  meet  the requirements and demands, and how many  schools  of

what type should be built to absorb the increasing student population.  It  is  impossible for us to look after the  land  of  the

school  at  the same time, in the Development Estimates  we  have

plans to build certain schools, and once the vote is approved, we

have  to start looking for school sites. I have already said that

in  Singapore, particularly in the city area, it is difficult  to

find land to build schools. In spite of that we have been able to

meet the demands of parents by building enough schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the situation is

very  clear. Although plans have been drawn up, the schools  have

not  been  built  in  accordance with  actual  requirements.  The

Minister  for  Education has said just now that there  is  enough

accommodation in the schools for all the pupils. From what he has

said,  we can also see that the building plans had not been based

on actual needs. Had it been so, there would not have been pupils

accommodated in other types of schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to stress is that the Minister for Education is

somewhat  exaggerating the sum to be voted for school  buildings.

Such an attitude on the Minister's part is not quite proper. Now,

look  at  subhead  018 of Head D 04, relating  to  the  Singapore

Vocational Institute at Balestier Road. We see that the 1964 vote

was  $84,000 for this particular item in respect of furniture and

equipment for this school. But we see that not one cent has  been

spent.  Also, under subhead 019 and subhead 020, there  are  some

contradictions.  Subhead 019 - "Teachers'  Training  College"  is

meant  to  complete the building scheme, but so far not a  single

cent  has  been used from the $750,000 entered in last year's  Development  Estimates. And now there is a new item of  expenditure

under  subhead  020  "Second Teachers'  Training  College  (First

Phase)".  In this case, last year's vote was $1,000,000 but  this

money  has not been used at all and the Government wants  to  ask

for some more money! What is the actual situation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



Not a single cent has been used from the past year's votes, and

yet the Government has come forward to put another plan before us

and ask us to approve the new sums to be voted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year under the Head - Ministry of Education - the

Development Estimates totalled $24,358,780, but according to  the

figures  given in the 1965 Development Estimates, only  one-third

of last year's provision has been utilised. There are cases where

large sums of money have been voted for last year and which  have

not  been  used, and yet the Government is asking us  to  approve

more  funds  for similar expenditure! Thus, every year  the  sums

voted for the Ministry of Education appear to be very impressive.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember last year when I was giving my views on matters

relating to the Ministry of Education, the Minister for Education

said  that  my  criticisms were merely a waste of time.  At  that

time,  I  told him that the Government's plans were not  in  line

with  the  actual  state  of affairs.  Now,  the  same  thing  is

happening  again. Of course, he may be able to explain  that  the

plan  will ultimately be completed, that several million  dollars

out  of the sums allocated have already been spent to prove  that

some  work  has  already been done. But this sort of  explanation

cannot  satisfy  us. In principle, of course, it  is  right  that

there  should  not  be any wastage of the vote approved,  but  in

actual  fact, what has been spent to complete the plan is  a  far

cry  from the actual vote approved. I have already said that only

one-third  of  the vote approved for last year has actually  been

spent.  This  shows that the plan has not been realistic.  During

the  debate  last year also, when I alleged that there  were  not

enough  secondary schools, the Minister for Education  said  this

was not a fact. I said that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



existed such a situation last year. Six thousand pupils were  not

able  to  find  places  in the right type  of  schools.  One  can

therefore  see  what  the  actual  position  is.  The  Minister's

intention is just to present us with impressive figures  to  fool

the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In debating amendment (7), the discussion may

range over amendments*  (8), (9) and (10).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*See footnote at cols. 725-6.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Thomson  has  said just now, according to his  calculations,

that out of the total vote for last year's Development Estimates,

only  one-third has been used, and that the remaining  two-thirds

have been incorporated in next year's Estimates. Mr Speaker,  as

a matter of fact, it is not true that we have only used one-third

of  the  money voted for last year's Estimates. The  majority  of

school  buildings were completed this year and all  the  expenses

incurred  will  be  put before the Government  early  next  year.

Therefore,  the  payment of bills will only be  made  early  next

year.  It  is  true  that the actual payment  is  less  than  the

original   estimate, it  does  not  mean,  however,   that   the

expenditure  for  last year was not used to the fullest  possible

extent. Furthermore, the vote approved by this House can only  be

used  when  the work has actually started. For example,  we  have

drawn up certain plans for next year but the work cannot commence

early next year. The same applied to the plans drawn up last year

and work was supposed to commence this year, but it could not  be

carried  out due to some difficulties and delays. So we  have  to

postpone the commencement of such work to next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has also referred to the Singapore

Vocational  Institute  in Balestier Road, saying  that  the  vote

approved for last year has not been used at all. Mr Speaker, the

Singapore  Vocational Institute at Balestier Road presents  some

difficulties because the plans have not been drawn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



up according to specification. It is not an easy task to put up a

proper  plan  for  this Institute. It is an altogether  different

plan from that of an ordinary school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has also mentioned the Teachers'

Training College. The same reasons apply in this case because the

expansion  of  the Teachers' Training College is a  new  type  of

work,  and the plans have to be considered carefully before  they

are  approved.  This takes time because of the expansion  of  the

workshops  for  the  teachers who will be  trained  to  teach  in

vocational and technical schools. The expansion actually  relates

to  equipment  and  the  building of the  Science  Block  in  the

Teachers' Training College workshops. In addition, there is  also

the  construction of a hail, a library, etc. This work is  rather

technical,  and  so more time is required to complete  them.  Now

that  all the plans have been drawn up, I think work may commence

sometime  next year. The foundation may be laid in December  this

year and the actual construction may start next year. I think  by

1966,  the  whole  work will be completed. The expansion  of  the

Teachers'  Training  College and the  construction  of  a  second

Teachers'  Training College are two different  matters.  We  feel

that  according to present needs, for the next five years we will

not  be  able  to meet the requirements of schools  if  we  train

teachers  in  only one College in spite of the expansion  of  the

existing  Teachers' Training College. This is because at  present

half  of the number of teachers, i.e. some 15,000, have not  been

trained.  Some  of  these teachers are in the initial  stages  of

training.  If  we want to meet the requirements of  schools,  one

Teachers'  Training College is not enough and so  we  have  plans

under  way to put up another Teachers' Training College. We  only

ask for a token vote in next year's Estimates in respect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



of  this  Second Teachers' Training College because we intend  to

try  to get financial and technical aid from other sources in the

construction of the second Teachers' Training College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, if I remember correctly, the Member for Thomson has

also  referred  to the 6,000 students who were unable  to  go  to

secondary  academic schools. I think I have already mentioned  in

this  House that these 6,000 students have not been kept  out  of

school  entirely.  They desire to attend the  secondary  academic

schools  but  because there is not sufficient  accommodation  for

them,  we  have  therefore to make use of  school  buildings  for

technical  and  vocational schools in order to accommodate  them.

So,  although they are not schooling in secondary academic school

buildings,  they are nonetheless pursuing courses of an  academic

nature  in  these  buildings. So, in future, when  we  have  more

academic  schools  built, say next year, these students  will  be

transferred to suitable types of schools. Therefore,  it  is  not

true  to  say that the 6,000 students are not in school  now  and

that they have been forced to take up courses other than those of

an academic nature as alleged by the Member concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is an amendment No. (11) standing in the

names of Mr Chia Thye Poh and Mr Lim Huan Boon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 04 be reduced by the

whole sum in respect of subhead 023.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is at page 19. Under this item a sum of

$1  million is to be voted for the Nanyang University in order to

help  it  set up a new library building. On the face  of  it,  it

appears that the Government is really sincere in helping Nanyang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



University  to  develop. It appears also that the  Government  is

trying  its  best  to  foster the growth of higher  education  in

Singapore. But I feel that if one looks deep into the matter, the

House  must, of necessity, be very careful in dealing  with  this

vote.  It  must be pointed out that there is some impropriety  on

the  part of the Government in implementing policies against  the

interests of higher learning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should give our constructive criticisms. In Government's

asking for a vote of $1 million for Nanyang University to build a

library, one must bear in mind that the matter is one which  will

attract the attention of the public at large, particularly  those

who have the interest of Nanyang University at heart. We remember

that  in  the  past  some  actions  were  taken  against  Nanyang

University  and  this  gave rise to a feeling  of  despair  among

members  of the public. Furthermore the Government is making  use

of  public  funds to interfere with academic freedom  and  higher

learning.  The Government even goes to the extent  of  trying  to

make use of Government funds for its selfish political ends.  All

these measures ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I heard this argument yesterday and the

day  before.  I have already indicated to the House  before  that

arguments  of  that  nature would be out of order  on  a  subject

matter  such as this. I am not quite sure whether the  Member  is

against the provision of this $1 million or is in favour of it. I

have not quite followed him yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am just trying

to  point  out  that this vote of $1 million  asked  for  by  the

P.A.P., the Party in power, ostensibly to help Nanyang University

in  the building of a Library, has some hidden motive. I want  to

air my views about it. I think it is necessary for the Government

to  let us know all the facts and circumstances surrounding  this

vote. In this way, we shall be able to understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



better  how the P.A.P. Government has made use  of  public

funds to achieve its own party ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Nanyang University is controlled by the P.A.P.

through  the  Government. The Government at one time  refused  to

give  a  single  cent  to help Nanyang University.  But  when  it

decides  to resort to undemocratic means and shamelessly  imposes

re-organisation on Nanyang University in order to assume  control

of  it, it now wants to give $1 million to the University. Before

this,  the  Government  also  promised  to  obtain  pan-Malaysian

recognition of Nanyang University degrees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government tried its best to give publicity to the

proposed  aid to be given to Nanyang University, one  finds  that

soon  after this the P.A.P. asked the Central Government to  send

troops and police to arrest Nanyang University undergraduates  in

the  middle  of the night. As a result of this, many students  of

Nanyang University have been arrested. And following this, the

P.A.P.  Government,  by an underhand way, got  some  people  to

coerce   the  ex-Vice  Chancellor  of  Nanyang  University   into

resigning.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I really cannot relate the coercion of

that gentleman to the contribution by the Government of a million

dollars. If the Member can do so, then I shall hear him on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I think these two

matters  are  related the $1 million contribution by  Government

and  the  resignation of the ex-Vice Chancellor  of  Nantah  took

place  almost at the same time, so the public will know there  is

some connection.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member seems to have assumed that because

of this $1 million contribution, the Vice Chancellor resigned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I  believe that if I continue, the Minister for Education  will

understand.  On the one hand, the Government took forceful  means

to  reorganise Nanyang University. On the other hand, it declared

that  it was helping Nanyang University with $1 million. So after

the  publicity  about this $1 million, we find that  the  ex-Vice

Chancellor was forced to resign. That gives rise to the suspicion

that  Government must have tried to snake use of some  people  to

force  the Vice Chancellor to resign, otherwise the same fate  of

the  ex-Vice  Chancellor  of the University  of  Singapore  might

befall  him. Then there was the so-called committee to take  over

the  place  of the Vice Chancellor. And after this committee  had

been   set   up,  a  lot  of  members  of  the  staff  and   some

undergraduates were expelled from the University.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member is really discussing

the  Nanyang University set-up, the way in which the  Government

is   interfering  with  Nanyang  University,  the   way   Nanyang

University is objecting to Government's interference. Now,  those

are  matters  which  were  discussed yesterday,  I  believe,  and

properly discussed. Today the question is about the provision  of

$1  million to Nanyang University. What the Member is entitled to

say  is that the Government should contribute to it or should not

contribute  to it, or should increase it, say, by $5  million  or

something like that. That might be relevant to the issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am trying to

sketch to you the circumstances behind the vote of $1 million and

give my criticism, because this criticism is very important. From

what  I  have  already  said, it is  very  clear  that  when  the

Government wanted to give the $1 million to help Nantah, this was

done  in order to cover up its intention to reorganise the set-up

of Nanyang University, thereby

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



creating  an  impression  among the people  that  giving  the  $1

million  was the real intention of the Government to help Nantah.

This  is a smoke-screen. I think I have already made myself clear

on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, following this, made use of a Government

officer  to  sit on the Nantah Committee, thereby causing  direct

interference with Nanyang University, and this gave rise to  some

discontentment among the staff. So we see the Government wants to

give  $1  million to help Nanyang University build a new  library

and, as promised, wants to help Nantah obtain recognition of  its

degrees  from all the States in Malaysia. I do not know  to  what

extent  the Government has succeeded in doing so, in  so  far  as

recognition  of  degrees is concerned. As  far  as  I  know,  the

Government  is  not  taking positive steps to achieve  this  end.

Perhaps  it has forgotten about it. Or is it because  it  has  no

courage to face the Central Government?



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

regrettable that the Member for Jurong has taken up some time  of

the  House  without giving an indication whether he is  objecting

to,  or agreeing with, the Government in giving $2 million as aid

to Nanyang University for the building of a new library, purchase

of  equipment,  furniture  and books.  Is  he  objecting  to  the

Government for doing this, or otherwise? He has taken  some  time

without being able to tell us this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, on a point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have already indicated very clearly that if the Government is sincere in wanting to help the growth of higher education and in helping Nantah, then nobody will object. I have already mentioned the circumstances relating to this vote to show that the

Government  has  been  using public funds to  assume  control  of

Nanyang University by interfering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



with  academic  autonomy.  I  have  already  stated  my

disappointment  and  raised objection to this  behaviour  of  the

P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, the point that the Member for

Jurong  is making is that the Government, by providing $1 million

will  be  interfering  with the autonomy of  Nanyang  University.

Perhaps the Minister would like to answer that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, it is a pity that

the  Member for Jurong has not asked the Government not  to  give

this  sum of money to help Nanyang University. He has a suspicion

that  the Singapore Government's intention to help Nantah is  not

sincere. He is suspicious of our sincerity. If we are not sincere

in  wanting to help Nantah, then we will not have asked for  this

vote of $2 million to help it in 1965 to build a library and  buy

scientific equipment and books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the past, when Nanyang University was in the

hands  of pro-Communist elements like the Member for Jurong,  the

Government had no obligation to help in the training of more

pro-Communist   students  to  undermine  the  democratic  system   in

Singapore. Nobody in his right senses would do this. This applies

to the Government too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will remember to carry out our promise that, after the

reorganisation,  we  will try to get the  Central  Government  to

recognise  the degrees of Nanyang University. But the  point  is

that  Nanyang  University  has not completed  its  reorganisation

work. It is only in the initial stage. At the right time, we will

carry out our promise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also talked about our using public funds

to  interfere  with  the academic freedom of the  University  and

about the ex-Vice Chancellor who was forced by us to resign.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  these  people are not really  interested  in  the

autonomy  of  the  University. They are not  concerned  with  the

academic  freedom of the University. All they are concerned  with

is  the  question of how to turn the University into  a  training

ground for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



pro-Communist  elements.  They  are  only  concerned   with   the

indoctrination   of  Communist  ideas  in  the   minds   of   the

undergraduates. They are only concerned with the freedom to carry

out subversive activities. All this ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have ruled the Member for Jurong out of

order on that. I have allowed the Minister to dwell on it just to

reply to him, but I would not like the Minister to take it beyond

the reply. So will the Minister get on to his next point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, unfortunately I

have no opportunity to say what I wish to say. But, in short,  on

the  question of Nanyang University, the Central Government  has

already  issued  a  White  Paper about  the  activities  of

pro-Communist elements in Nanyang University. Mr Speaker, since  you

have  made a ruling that I should not dwell on it any further,  I

shall go on to the next point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong said that we tried to create an

impression  on  the  people.  He  himself  tried  to  create   an

impression that he was very interested in Nanyang University  and

in its autonomy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since the reorganisation of Nanyang University and

the  appointment of an ad hoc Administrative Committee,  we  have

discovered  that  a great deal of damage has  been  done  to  the

hostels and the canteen. We have evidence to show that wires have

been  pulled  down, chairs and tables damaged, bulbs  broken.  We

have  pictures  to  show  the damage done  by  the  pro-Communist

elements. They are undermining the University. If the Barisan are

interested,  I  can show them the pictures. Their so-called  love

for  the  University is really a desire to see it  damaged.  When

they  failed  to  turn the University into a  hive  of  Communist

elements, they tried to damage it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the

Minister to answer one question. He talked about the Government's

effort to get the Central Government to recognise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



the  degrees of Nanyang University, and said that the recognition

should depend on the reorganisation of the University, which  has

not  been completed. I would like to ask what he meant by the  reorganisation of the University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is an absurd question. If

he  has seen the agreement signed between Nanyang University and

our  Government on the reorganisation of the University, he  will

know  that  if  the  reorganisation is  in  accordance  with  the

recommendations of the Review Committee, then the  reorganisation

has been completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): How many per cent of the

reorganisation has been completed?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with some training in

statistics,  may  I  say  that these are matters  which  are  not

quantifiable?  Therefore, the question is  really  a  nonsensical

question! [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, I think the Member for Jurong, if I remember rightly, is also a Member of Parliament in Kuala Lumpur.

In  his  speech,  he  has raised a number of questions  regarding

Nanyang University which I think should rightly be raised in  the

Central  Parliament. Has he ever raised them, or does he  propose

to raise them in the forthcoming Budget sittings in Kuala Lumpur?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A good question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for Health has suggested that I should raise  these

questions in the Central Parliament. I was merely criticising the

Government  for their failure to honour their promise  of  asking

the  Central  Government  to recognise  the  degrees  of  Nanyang

University. This promise has not been honoured, as the Government

has  not  taken  any positive step to recognise  the  degrees  of

Nantah.  I was merely criticising the Government for its  failure

to carry out its promise.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member assumes that no steps have been

taken to persuade the Federal Government to recognise Nantah  and

to  give assistance to Nantah. Why should he assume that this  is

the   case?  There  are  certain  matters,  Mr  Speaker,   where

discussions  and  persuasion are best done  quietly  and  without

publicity.  This  is  the  initial  way  in  which  the   Central

Government  should be approached on this matter. Surely  we  have

discussed  this matter with the Central Government. We  have  put

forward  the  merits of our case, but it is quite unnecessary  to

make it a political issue. If we do that, we can be sure that  it

will  endanger the success of the policy we hope to persuade  the

Central Government to follow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been listening to the

two  Opposition Members for the last half an hour.  As  you  have

pointed  out,  Sir, the particular provision  is  quite

clear  - Public Library Building: $1,000,000. They have been beating about

the  bush,  but  they have still not said whether  they  are  for

voting this $1,000,000. Do they approve of it? Do they want  more

or  do  they want less? They have not answered that. It is  quite

clear that their so-called love for Nanyang University is to  use

this  University purely for their political ends. In fact, it  is

quite   clear  now  that  the  Communists  are  out  of   Nanyang

University, they would like to see it destroyed. What they cannot

get,  they  will  not  like others to get. As  my  colleague  has

pointed out, the Member for Jurong is a Member of Parliament.  We

have had about four sessions. He has a burning desire ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of information, or on a point of

order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has given way. Mr Chia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, the Minister for

Culture has pointed out that I am a Member of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



Parliament,  and  that  I have not raised this  question  in  the

Central  Parliament. If the P.A.P. Government admit that they  do

not  have  the courage to raise it, then I will raise it  in  the

Central Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Jurong is different from us. We

talk  directly  with the Central Government. We do not  publicise

it.  We  are  negotiating, but he does not know. He assumes  that

nothing is being done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chia Thye Poh, will you please resume your

seat?  When you rise up, please do not press the button.  It  not

only  interferes with my hearing what is being said, but it  also

interferes with the interpretation system of the whole House, and

the  record cannot be properly produced. I am glad that you  have

given  me this opportunity, because I had wanted to mention  this

to the House for a considerable time. When you do rise on a point

of  order, just rise and stand there until you catch my eye. Now,

Mr Chia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has given way. Mr Chia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Minister for

Culture  has  said  that  the Singapore Government  have  quietly

talked  with the Central Government and that they do not want  to

make  this  public  for fear of endangering the negotiations  and

discussions. I would like him to tell this House what steps  have

been  taken  by  the Government. How many official or  unofficial

discussions did this Government have with the Central  Government

on the recognition of Nantah degrees?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister for Finance has indicated to the

House that there are ministerial discussions going on between the

Central Government and the State Government of Singapore, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



that it would be premature to disclose them at this juncture. The

Member  should be satisfied with that answer for the time  being.

Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Chairman, he said just now that he had got

information.  He  never gave information. All  he  did  was  give

further comment --- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I would still like to ask the people who

love  Nanyang University, to say clearly so that the people will

know  whether  they approve of giving $1 million to  improve  the

library  facilities  of  Nanyang. A very  simple  question,  Sir.

Everybody would like to know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> $2 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sorry, Sir. $2 million. For a library building

and  for scientific equipment and library books. Let them say now

-  do  they  approve  of giving $2 million for  this  purpose  to

Nanyang  University, or are they going to make political  capital

for   their   Communist  friends  outside  and  inside   Nanyang

University?   Now,  I  understand  most  of  them  are   outside.

[Laughter] That is all I am asking, Sir, and I am quite sure that

the  public  would  also  like to know, where  do  these  Barisan

Sosialis Members stand in regard to positive aid, not just verbal

aid  -  which  they give from time to time - "lovers of  Nanyang",

"supporters  of  Nanyang"  -  and  may  I  say,  Sir,  that  very

interestingly  enough, Radio Jakarta has also  been  saying  that

Government is interfering with Nanyang University. And  if  Radio

Jakarta  takes such great interest in Nanyang University,  I  can

understand  why the Members of the Barisan also follow  the  same

line.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Culture  has once again talked about our attitude towards Nantah.

We   want  to  make  ourselves  clear.  Towards  any  educational

institute  which can train our people to become competent  people

and useful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



citizens,   we  will  give  our  support.  But  we  object   to

Government's  using  this sum of money for  their  own  notorious

purpose, it is very easy and simple to answer this question.  For

example,  the P.A.P. Government has asked for a provision  of  $2

million out of which $1 million is to help Nantah build a library

and  the  other $1 million is to help Nantah purchase  scientific

equipment,  and  library books. But we must not just  simply  say

that  we object to or agree with this vote. What we want to  know

is  when was this money asked for? Their purpose is to show  that

they  are  helping Nanyang University and they make  use  of  the

money  to  cover  up their misdeed. They are giving  sugar-coated

poison to Nanyang University, a poison which contains $2 million,

and  now they are asking us whether we support or object to  what

they  are  doing. What I am pointing out is their  motive  behind

asking  for  this vote. The P.A.P. are not able  to  answer  this

question.  When they are not able to do so, they talk  about  the

Communists.  That is what they are in the habit of  doing.  After

the  P.A.P. have  carried  out the reorganisation,  let  us  see

whether  it has become better. After the reorganisation,  I  hear

that  there  has been no improvement. The P.A.P. have  used  the

students in Nanyang University, it is an open secret. It is  said

that  an  assembly of some students, closely connected  with  the

P.A.P.,  has carried out illegal yellow activities, has organised

parties and dinners ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us get back to Nanyang University and

the library.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): There is no need for us to talk at

length  on this. I am merely trying to make a comparison  between

Nanyang  University  before and after reorganisation.  They  have

made  a  promise that they want to get the other territories  and

Governments  to  recognise Nanyang degrees, that discussions  and

negotiations have been quietly carried out behind the scenes. All

this is a smoke-screen. The Ministers are clear about this. There

is no need to talk about the secrecy of these discussions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, with this vote amounting to $2 million, which is to

help  the  library building and to buy scientific  equipment  and

books  for  Nanyang University, the Government  intends  to  help

Nantah.  It  also shows that Nanyang University,  in  respect  of

academic  standards  and other fields, has already  come  to  the

right  track. And it is a good thing. But the Opposition  Members

have voiced their doubts and suspicions in our providing this sum

of  $2  million. I say that if the vote had been  asked  for  two

years  ago  when the Barisan elements were doing their  worst  in

Nanyang  University, then they would have agreed. Now  that  they

are not able any more to control Nantah, they say that the grapes

are  sour,  and  have  described us as handing  out  sugar-coated

poison  to Nantah in this vote of $2 million. In fact,  when  the

Government  wants  to give financial aid to  Nantah,  it  has  to

ensure that the money is used in a proper way, put to proper use,

and  in all justification, it should not be handed out when these

pro-Communist elements are in control of Nantah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Well, the Minister has already sat down. So you

may proceed, Mr Chia. On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Minister for

Labour has said that before Nanyang University came under the

control of the Government, it was under the control of the

Communist United Front. I want to ask the Minister whether the

former Vice-Chancellor and the Chairman of the Management

Committee were also members of the Communist United Front.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will not permit the Minister to answer that

question  because, by that means, we will enlarge  the  scope  of

this  debate.  So let us get back to Nanyang University  and  the

library. Mr Jek Yeun Thong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Now a chance is offered me to

tell the inside story. The ex-Vice Chancellor, because of his own

weakness,  was  not  able to control them, but  this  is  another

matter.  But  if we were to use public funds to aid a  University

when it is under the control of undesirable elements, that is not

right.  When  these  people were having  their  way  in  Nanyang

University  and  carrying out illegal activities, the  Government

should  not  give public funds to aid the University. When  these

people  were  controlling the undergraduates there,  people  were

threatened.  The  situation  was that  when  the  under-graduates

agreed  with them, they allowed them to continue. Otherwise  they

would  be  suppressed by them. Let us take the graduate assistant

lecturers. If a graduate assistant lecturer were on the  side  of

the  Students Union and agreed to their political ideology,  then

he  was  quite all right. But if undergraduates dared  to  differ

from  such a controlling clique, then this lecturer would  deduct

marks from their examination papers in order to fail them.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us get back to the subject of Nanyang

University and library facilities. Mr Jek Yeun Thong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): After the reorganisation we

have full confidence in the future of Nanyang University, knowing

that  it  will  no  longer be under the control of  the  previous

clique. We know that the vote is in the right direction, and that

Nanyang  University will in future become a higher  institute  of

learning befitting its name.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember that last year

when  the  Assembly was having sittings in December, the  Members

for  Thomson  and  Jurong were trying their best  to  attack  the

Government,  especially on the question of Nantah,  and  accusing

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



of  being  undemocratic and of trying to  curb  academic

freedom.  They  also  said the Government did  not  want  to  aid

Nantah. But now they have changed their tactics, and are shouting

about  academic freedom and freedom of assembly, as  though  they

want  to  reject this vote for Nantah. In the past they  attacked

the  Government for not wanting to help Nantah, hut now that  the

Government wants to give financial aid to it, they turn round and

attack it for not giving academic freedom to Nantah.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, at that time, they wanted to prevent the Nanyang

University  Council  from  carrying  on  negotiations  with   the

Government  in  respect of the organisation of  Nantah.  This  is

because  at that time they wanted to control Nantah. They accused

the  Government of trying to control Nantah instead.  Their  main

purpose  then was to allow the Communists to keep on  controlling

Nantah. Their real purpose, which is evident now, is to make  use

of academic freedom as a pretext and as a smokescreen to carry on

with their Communist activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has asked me what has been achieved

after  the  reorganisation. He said, "How much has been  achieved

after  the  reorganisation?"  We can  tell  him  that  the  under-graduates  of  Nantah  can now study in  a  peaceful  environment

without interference from Communist elements. This is a situation

they  have  never  dreamed of before. Before the  reorganisation,

Nantah  was a campus for the pro-Communist activists.  But  after

the  reorganisation, it has become a suitable institute  for  the

undergraduates  to  pursue  their  higher  studies.  Before   the

reorganisation  Nantah  was  in a  topsyturvy  state.  After  the

reorganisation,   things  returned  to  what  they   should   be.

Discipline is restored and maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the vote of $1 million for buying scientific

equipment and library books, this sum could, of course, be put to

other use. In providing this vote for Nantah, it is our hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



Nantah  will  be worthy of its name as an institute  of  higher

learning. Under the ex-Vice Chancellor, Dr Chuang Chu  Lin,  the

annual vote for this item was put to other uses. Dr Chuang built

a  theatre  in the University. The $1 million, which comes  under

the  annually  recurrent expenditure vote, was used  in  building

this  theatre. In the end, the payment of the salaries of Nanyang

University  professors and lecturers became a  problem.  However,

the  theatre  cannot be used now in spite of  the  fact  that  $1

million has been spent on it. According to the original plan  for

the  theatre,  it  should be air-conditioned.  But  although  $1

million has been spent on it, there is no air-conditioning in the

theatre. According to reports submitted by the architects, if the

auditorium  were to accommodate more than 300 people, then  there

is   the   danger  of  suffocation.  There  are  no   ventilation

facilities. That is the way they were using public money at  that

time.  All these things happened before the reorganisation. After

the  reorganisation  things have become better.  I  have  already

given  them  some  photos to show that before the reorganisation,

the  pro-Communist  under-graduates were  engaged  in  subversive

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was invited by the Students' Fellowship of Nantah to speak on

the  occasion of Malaysia Day. When I was there. I found that the

wiring  and equipment were all torn up and broken. The  furniture

too  was  damaged. There were no lighting and no loudspeakers.  I

understand a big sum of money had been spent on such things.  But

this only goes to show what the pro-Communist elements did in the

University  campus. $3,000 musical instruments  were  also  lost.

Nanyang  University  was  set up through  donations  by  hawkers,

trishaw riders and people from all walks of life. The purpose  of

setting up Nantah is to educate our youths in order that they can

serve  the country. The Barisan claim that they love and  support

Nantah.  In  actual  fact, we can only see  sabotage  in  Nantah.

Equipment  was damaged and musical instruments were  lost.  These

are facts surrounding the situation in Nantah.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister for Education has

wasted a lot of the time of this House by mentioning irrelevant

matters. In the short time available, I wish to reply only to the

more important points. He says that after the reorganisation,

Nanyang University has got academic freedom. But I wish to ask him

this. How is it that the Government has to send one of its

officials to participate in the work of the Administrative Committee? He receives directives from the Government and interferes

with the administration of Nanyang University. Why should this be

so? Does it mean that Nanyang University has no other persons to

sit on the Administrative Committee so that one official from the

Ministry of Education has to be a member of the Administrative

Committee? This only goes to show further interference by

Government and the undermining of the autonomy of Nanyang

University. They also claim that the administration of Nantah is

going along the right track. They say the old days have gone. The

question still remains whether Nantah is in fact going along the

right track. We should not waste much time. He says that the

administration then was deteriorating and in a topsyturvy state.

I think such remarks are an insult to the academic staff who were

responsible for Nanyang University in the past. We know that

there are still some members of the academic staff who were in

Nantah before the reorganisation and who were responsible for its

administration. Their work was appreciated by the public at

large. To say that these people have brought Nantah to a chaotic

state is a great humiliation to those who love Nantah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also mentioned about the theatre in Nanyang University. He has mentioned about the damage done, and the useless condition of the theatre now. We know that when the hall

was  built,  it  was through donations coming  from  the  Hokkien

community. Of course, this theatre was to meet the urgent need of

Nanyang University for a place where the undergraduates can  hold

their convocation and other necessary gatherings.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, urban development involves a great sum of money,

namely,  $20  million. I only want to ask the Minister  concerned

two  questions.  First,  does this sum  of  $20  million  include

compensation  to be paid to those who have been affected  by

re-development projects?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is this. Will those affected by

resettlement schemes be given proper accommodation? Are they in a

position to carry on their business as usual in their alternative

accommodation? Of those affected, how much compensation is  given

to  cover their losses? Are they given any rent subsidies in  the

new  accommodation?  A more important consideration  is  that  in

areas such as New Bridge Road, which is a business centre for the

Chinese  and  other communities, I wonder how the  Government  is

going to provide them with alternative places of business.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people carry on business which has a direct bearing on

the  livelihood of the people in Singapore. My concern  in  these

matters  is  that  the Government may not be able  to  deal  with

matters carefully and satisfactorily. In fact, some people may be

greatly  affected by this re-development programme. I  think  the

Minister  should be able to present us with a comprehensive  plan

and give us some idea about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the North Bridge Road area, because of the Alliance and the

P.A.P. shedding crocodile tears, some difficulties have arisen. I

do not know whether there is going to be any change



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



in  respect  of the development programme for the North  Bridge

Road and Minto Road areas where two major races live together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to know whether the Central Government has any

right  to interfere with our urban development programme. I  want

the Minister to give me a satisfactory answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Chairman, in reply to the first question

of  the  Member  for  Jalan Kayu as to whether  the  $20  million

earmarked  includes compensation or not, I wish to  say  that  it

does  not include compensation. Compensation comes under  another

heading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to his second question, i.e. have those people who

are  affected been given proper accommodation, I say that in  our

resettlement  scheme, the people affected are  always  given  the

choice of accommodation and, for his information - in spite of the fact that they will not face realities, they

say that our compensation scheme is rejected by the people, it is

inadequate,  it  is causing great suffering -  I  would  like  to

inform  him that, for instance, in Kallang Basin, there  are  750

families  living mostly in stilt houses. To date 700 odd families

have been cleared. They have all accepted the compensation scheme

and alternative accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the Redhill cemetery site, 397 squatters are

affected  by  clearance in this 60-acre plot. About 350  families

have accepted accommodation offered to them and have moved away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, it can be seen that in our resettlement scheme,

most  of  the  families affected have accepted  the  compensation

offered.  It is only in the minds of Opposition Members that  our

compensation scheme is not a just and equitable one.  Of  course,

in any resettlement, in any large-scale moving of people from one

place to another, there usually will be some hardship. But it  is

a  question of time before people get settled down in  their  new

surroundings. I think, on the whole, the people of Singapore  are

public-spirited  enough  to understand  that  what  little  incon

venience  is  caused  to them now is all  for  the  good  of  the

community and for the future generation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asks whether they are given rent subsidies. For businesses we have what we call a rent rising system. That is, if a

man  who  is doing business in one area is moved or has  accepted

Housing  Board  shops  in  another  area  to  continue  with  his

business,  he  is  only  charged 70 per  cent  of  what  we  call

"assessed  rent", and it will rise by 10 per cent  until  on  the

ffourth  year  he  will  be paying the full  assessed  rent.  What

alternatives  are to be given to people who are to be  moved  out

from  the  New Bridge Road and North Bridge Road areas for  urban

renewal?  In  the  North Bridge Road area, Minto  Road,  Crawford

Road, there is alternative accommodation given to them. The first

choice is that they are given flats in Tanjong Rhu; or if they so

want  to, they can choose any flat which is under the control  of

the  Housing Board anywhere in Singapore. Here, I would  like  to

inform  the  Member for Jalan Kayu that quite a  number  of  ship

chandlers have been moved from Beach Road and Crawford to Tanjong

Rhu.  At  first they protested that the rent was higher than  the

rent  which  they paid in the rent control houses.  But  now  the

majority  of  them  are happy because in their new  surroundings,

with  a  larger population, in better shops, they  are  having  a

larger  turnover  than they ever had before.  Therefore,  in  all

these  resettlement schemes, people will sometimes find they  may

have  to  pay higher rents, incur a bit more expenses  than  they

used  to  in  their  old surroundings which were rent-controlled.

But,  on  the  whole, they find that because of better  locality,

better  facilities,  more people in the new  surroundings,  their

business is better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the New Bridge Road area, we have cleared part of Outram

Gaol and there is quite a large area of land which we can work on

first.  Then, as we go on, we will be able to remove  the  people

around the area that we want to redevelop into buildings which we

will he putting up for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His last question is whether the Central Government has any

right to interfere in our planning programme. The plans which  we

put up are our own for the improvement of the standard of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



living  of our people, and whether it is the Central Government

or  the  Barisan  boys opposite, if they have got  better  plans,

better  suggestions to make, they are welcome. If he thinks  that

by  this  it  is interference, then I say yes, everyone  has  the

right to interfere with our plans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, the P.A.P.'s

urban redevelopment plan has met with difficulties even before it

is  carried out, because this redevelopment project is not a

comprehensive one. It cannot take into account the problems  of  all

those people who are going to be affected. The Minister says that

the people who were affected were satisfied with the Government's

compensation. This is a falsehood. Those who were affected in the

various areas did not want to accept the compensation. They  were

forced  to  accept it because, otherwise, their houses  would  be

demolished. Under such circumstances, these people had  no  alternative  but  to  accept such compensation  and  move  into  other

alternative  houses.  This  is the most  barbaric  way  of  doing

things. It is killing a man and saying that he is asleep.  I  can

give  a  very  concrete example to show whether  the  people  are

willing  to accept the Government compensation or not.  This  was

stated  by the former Rural Dwellers' Association. They  were  of

the  opinion  that the compensation of the P.A.P. Government  was

not  equitable and just, be it in the rural area or  urban  area.

The question of urban redevelopment gave rise to the disturbances

in  July  and September because there are many loopholes in  this

plan ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order. I think the Speaker has

ruled the topic of the July and September riots to be sub judice.

The Member is making reference to it again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock):</b> I think the Member should

not   make  any  reference  to  the  July  and  September   civil

disturbances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, Sir, I was not

dwelling  on  these  two disturbances. I was merely  saying  that

before these two disturbances,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



there  were people who were staying in the Crawford  area

who  were  not satisfied with the compensation rate paid  by  the

Government,  thus  resulting in some extremists creating  disturbances. I was merely pointing out the defects and shortcomings  of

this  compensation rate. Before it was revised, the  compensation

rate  was even worse. The people in Toa Payoh, Kallang, Wee Choon

Village,  Geylang, and Aljunied have not forgotten the  treatment

they  got  from the Government when they were asked to  resettle.

They  got  only  a  few  hundred  dollars  as  compensation   for

resettlement.  But  then  there were two rural  organisations  in

those days which could fight for the people affected. But in  the

urban  area  there  was  no such organisation,  apart  from  some

parties  and civic organisations which were not in a position  to

fight  for  the  people affected by urban redevelopment.  In  the

past, the rural organisations, in fighting for the benefit of the

people, were  very cautious in their approach because  in  every

affected area, there were mixed races. They did not make  use  of

racial issues to deal with this problem. Therefore, in the  past,

no  matter  how the Government abolished the houses in the  rural

areas, the action did not meet with any trouble.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the Government says about the Country People's

Association  and the Rural Dwellers' Association, that  they  are

Communist  front organisations, they fought for the interests  of

the  people,  especially those who were affected by resettlement.

The  Government now says that most of the people who are affected

by  the  resettlement scheme are willing to accept  compensation.

This is not true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, to the boys opposite,

everything  that  the Government does is wrong;  even  giving  $2

million to Nanyang University is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of order. Mr Chairman,

Sir, the reply given by the Minister is rude. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



has described us as "boys". He should withdraw his remark.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock):</b> Will the Minister refer

to the Opposition as "Members"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Well, hon. Members who behave like boys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is worse than saying they are boys.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Anything that we do is wrong; even giving $2

million to help Nanyang University is wrong. It has already  been

explained  in this House that we give compensation to  these  peo

ple,  although  legally we do not have to give them compensation.

It  is  because  we want to minimise the effects of resettlement,

the  effects of disturbances that we give this compensation.  And

there must be a limit to which one can give compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the so-called champions of the poor - the Rural

Dwellers'  Association  and  the other  organisation  which  they

have - championed  the  poor and offered them  everything,  in  any

scheme  that you carry out, there are a few dissenters  who  will

not  be  happy  with  whatever you do.  And  here,  these  people

promised them the moon. But we are the Government and we are  responsible  for expenditure of public money. We have to stand  here

and   justify  to  the  Opposition  every  cent  that  we  spend.

Therefore, we have to he very careful in how we do it and why  we

do  it.  Because of that, we set about it carefully. Some of  the

colleagues  of  the Members opposite are not  here  now.  But  we

worked out a compensation scheme which we thought and still think

is  equitable. Here we get these chaps coming up to say,  "People

are  only  paid $300." Here are people who are really experts  at

distortion.  We have not only been paying people $300,  but  some

are  paid $10,000 and $15,000. Do you know that? Why do  you  not

mention that? You have just mentioned $300, which is an allowance

for  them  to  move out. From the percentage of acceptances.  Mr

Chairman,  it can be seen that the majority of the people  accept

our compensation rates. And what interests us most is that it  is

the majority who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



accept,  and  not  a few dissenters like them  who  try  to  make

political capital out of political bankruptcy now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member says that quite a lot of people did not accept. Our

record shows that the majority of them have accepted. I have just

enumerated  two areas where most of the people have accepted  our

compensation  scheme and moved away, public  spirited  enough  to

know  that  they  have  got  to put  up  with  a  little  bit  of

inconvenience for the good of the future generation and  for  the

good of the community as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, regarding the Toa Payoh area, the Member says that the

compensation  rates  were unfair. The first  compensation  scheme

that  we put up, I think, did not have an equal anywhere else  in

the  world. We offered a terrace house of over 1,000 square  feet

in  area, costing at least $7,000, for a ramshackle squatter hut.

What  could be fairer than that? And they are the chaps  who,  in

spite  of this good offer, went round and tried to put a stop  to

it.  But  the squatters were wise enough and realistic enough  to

see  that  it was a good offer and they accepted it straightaway,

in spite of the machinations to stop our progress of development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have already said, if our compensation scheme is not

fair,  then how is it that in Kallang Basin, out of 750 families,

700 families have already accepted? He says that we are doing  it

by  force. Can you force 700 families, consisting of about

4,000- odd  people to move out? Did he see the police moving in to force

these  people out? He is just daydreaming and talking  a  lot  of

nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Honourable Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, just now the

Minister for National Development has claimed that there were  no

forced  removals.  Of course, recently there have  been  no  such

incidents.  But  we  have seen that in certain  areas  where  the

Government issued eviction notices and when the people refused to

move, riot squads would turn up. Then, of course, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



people feared the presence of the riot squads and dared not  stay

any longer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development has said that some families

were given compensation amounting to more than $10,000. I  would  like to

ask why certain other families were only  given $20 or $30. I can cite a

case. A person was asked to move out and was  offered compensation of

$50, while there were families  that were  offered $300 compensation to

move out. Is this compensation rate  enough for them to rehabilitate

themselves? Formerly  these people  stayed in attap huts at a rental

of $20 or $30.  And  now the  Government  wants them to stay in flats

which  cost  them  a rental  of  $200  or  $300. Is that the way to

help  the  people affected by eviction?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of housing, the substitution of flats for attap huts

will increase the rents.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. We are discussing the

Development  Estimates. All these arguments about houses,  rents,

and   so   on,  are  completely  irrelevant  to  the  Development

Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock):</b> Will the Member come back to

the  subject  of Urban Redevelopment, and not dwell too  long  on

attap huts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, I mention those

points  because the Minister for National Development has  raised

them. And now I am only airing different views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Urban Redevelopment, we can also see that the people living

in  attap  huts are suffering the same fate of incurring  losses.

The  Minister  has claimed that the people who are  affected  are

most  willing to accept compensation. In actual fact, in the past

the  Government met with resistance put up by representatives  of

rural organisations. But these organisations no longer exist, and

so  these  people do not have a representative body to speak  for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also claimed that such removals are in the interests

of society. But I would like to ask, if  that  is  the case,

then why should the Government not look to the interests of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



these  people  who had to remove? Why should they not  get  their

legitimate rights and protection safeguarded? Does it  mean  that

the  Government is doing things only for the interests of the people   at   large,  and  disregarding  the  people   affected   by

resettlement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Chairman, Members of the Government have

been  rising  time  and time again trying to explain  matters.  I

think  it  is very difficult to get our explanations to percolate

through their thick skulls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines says that we are not looking after the

interests of the squatters. I have already explained that legally

we  do  not have to compensate. But I repeat again: it is because

we  want to minimise whatever difficulty that might arise out  of

resettlement that we have worked out a scheme of compensation for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that the affected people belong to two

organisations  who fought for them, and that these  organisations

have  now disappeared. Of course, they have disappeared. Does  he

know why they have disappeared? Because you are not fighting  for

their  interests. You know you are delaying development  and  you

are  preventing them from living a better life. We are  providing

better  houses,  better  roads, schools, community  centres, and

factories, all for the betterment of the people. But you tried to

bluff them and said, "Don't move out. Don't get out, but stay  in

the field."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock):</b> Order. Will the Minister

please address the Chair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sorry. Mr Chairman. Well, that is why

their organisations have disappeared, because the people now know

that these organisations were there not for the interests of  the

people  but  for  their  own  political  ends.  Therefore,   they

disappeared  overnight because they did not have the  support  of

the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time is up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head D 06 having expired, the following

amendment, standing in the name of Mr Ong Lian Teng, was not

proceeded with:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 06 be reduced by the

whole sum in respect of subhead 008.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $125,034,050 for Head D 06 ordered to stand part of

the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 07 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head D 07 be reduced by

$100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this head, I would like to put forward a suggestion. It

seems that under this head nothing is allocated to help the  fire

fighting  squads in the rural areas. I hope that  the  Government

will  allocate  some  funds  to provide fire-fighting  equipment,

pails, etc. to the fire-fighting squads in all the rural areas. I

feel  that if such fire-fighting facilities are provided, it will

be better than asking the Fire Brigade to prevent the outbreak of

fires  or  to  fight  them. The reason is that  whenever  a  fire

occurs,  the  Fire Brigade engines and firemen have to  travel  a

long  way to reach the fire site. Sometimes due to a traffic jam,

the  fire  engines are not able to reach the fire  site  in  good

time.  For  instance,  the fire engines will  take  at  least  15

minutes to travel from High Street to Lorong 1, Geylang. From  my

knowledge, by the time the fire engines reach the fire site, many

houses  will have been completely burnt down. Therefore,  if  the

Government will allocate fire-fighting equipment for installation

at  various  rural  areas, it will be  of  great  help  in

fire-fighting.  In this way, I feel that the efficiency of  the

fire-fighting squads in the rural areas will be improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is the vote for the Toa Payoh Fire Station on

page 26 of the Development Estimates. How is it that there is  no

provision for the building of a Toa Payoh Fire Station? There  is

only  a token vote of $10. This refers to subhead 004, items  001

and 002.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, shall I answer the last point

first?  As we know, a number of areas have been developed or  are

developing  rapidly with housing and industry, for  example,  Toa

Payoh, Thomson, Sembawang and Nee Soon. It is proposed to erect a

new  fire  station for Toa Payoh where 50,000 housing  units  are

expected  to house about 250,000 people. This will be a  standard

fire  station  with  4  fire engines,  one  ambulance  and  three

firemen. It will be provided with staff quarters. A token vote of

only $10, however, has been provided for this fire station in the 1965

Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the first point raised just now by the Member for Bukit

Panjang,  we  all know that there are five fire stations  at  the

moment  strategically placed in various parts of Singapore,  such

as  Hill Street, Queenstown, Bukit Timah, Serangoon Road and Paya

Lebar, with an operational strength of 600 men. The fire fighting

capacity of these stations has been found to be adequate for  present needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member just now has said that we should provide some funds

to  equip  the voluntary fire fighting squads. In fact,  we  have

already  done so, as we told them yesterday. So we need not  have

to answer this question again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

refer  to  the speech made yesterday by the Minister  for  Social

Affairs.  I do not know whether he has promised any more  aid  to

the  fire-fighting squads. The Parliamentary Secretary says  that

the answer has been given, but if I remember correctly, no answer

has  been  given. If any answer has been given, no aid  has  been

given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary says that the five fire stations are

manned by 600 men. I do not doubt this. But I think that  in spite  of

their efficiency, more aid should be given to the rural

fire-fighting  squads.  We know that  in  the  Geylang  fires  at

Lorongs 1, 5 and 21, a few hundred houses were burnt down causing

a  few thousand people to be homeless. All these facts show  very

clearly  that  if  more help is given to the rural  fire-fighting

squads,  the situation may be quite different. Such help is  very

necessary.  We feel that if the Government wants to  improve  the

situation, then it should give the squads more aid and  equipment

so that they will be more efficient in fire-fighting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $730,920 for Head D 07 ordered to stand part of the

Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 08 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head D 08 be reduced by $10 in

respect of item 001 of subhead 009.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards drainage at the Geylang Serai

Malay  Settlement,  a plan to allow the free flow  of  water  has

unfortunately  proved to be difficult. Sometimes a  scheme  which

has  been worked out for such a purpose cannot be implemented for

various reasons. Nevertheless, if the authorities concerned could

clean the drains along Chye Chee up to Geylang River, it would be

a  good  thing. The water in these drains does not  flow  freely.

Previously, the Work Brigade carried out the job of cleaning  the

drains,  but at the moment this work has stopped. In  order  that

there  may  be a smooth flow of water in the drains,  I  ask  the

authorities  concerned to remove the rubbish and dirt  which  are

choking the drains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, during a heavy rainfall the water remains

stagnant, resulting in houses being flooded and causing a lot  of

inconvenience  to  the  residents there.  The  farmers  are  also

affected, and they face losses during a heavy rainfall. So I  ask

the  Ministry concerned to look after these drains  so  that  the

water in these drains can flow freely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Kampong

Kembangan has got the whole picture quite correctly when he  says

that because of several reasons we are unable to proceed with the

Pelton  drainage scheme in Geylang Serai. This is so because  one

of  the  reasons is that there are thousands of squatters  there,

and  if  we  are to proceed with providing adequate drainage  for

this  very  low-lying area, then all these squatters have  to  be

moved.  In the meantime, while it is not possible to do this,  we

are  providing partial relief by improving the minor drainage and

also  reconstructing the culverts across Jalan  Kembangan,  Jalan

Bijaya  and Lengkong Tiga, which are of adequate size to  prevent

back  flooding. This year, Sir, it is estimated that $10,000 will

be spent on all these works and another $6,000 will be spent next

year. However, it is our objective to see that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



is  a  through  flow of water in every public drain  and  if  the

Member can bring to my notice or to the notice of my Ministry any

specific instance of a drain being clogged, we will send  men  to

see that it is put right.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

explanation  given  by  the  Minister,  I  beg  to  withdraw   my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek your

guidance  with reference to amendment (2)*. Can I deal with  both

amendments (2) and (3)+ at the same time?



<hr size="2" noshade>

+Amendments (3) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 08 be reduced by $10 in

respect of item 006 of subhead 0l5.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It seems to me to be all right if it suits the

Minister's convenience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, the hon. Member will move amendment (2) and

he may speak on amendment (3) too.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 08 be reduced by $10 in

respect of item 001 of subhead 0l5.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this subject of the improvements to

agricultural  and kampong roads, in particular, Jalan  Kembangan.

Jalan  Angteng and Jalan Ladang - roads which link up  with  Jalan

Eunos - are  in a bad state because heavy vehicles such as  lorries

carrying timber are using them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the disturbances, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Police and the

military  authorities could not make use of these roads  and  the

residents  in these areas lived in a state of fear. Although  the

people  at Jalan Angteng and Jalan Ladang are peace-loving people

who  cannot be influenced by the Indonesian Communists, they  are

still  frightened because radio patrol cars cannot go round these

kampongs due to the bad roads. These roads are in constant use by

the residents living in the eastern part of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



Singapore. Therefore, I think it is time that these  roads  are

repaired  so  that  they can be used by people who  normally  use

them. However, to my knowledge, an amount of $26,000 was spent on

improvements to these roads in the early part of 1964. In view of

the  further  expenditure allotted to the  improvement  of  these

roads, I request the authorities concerned to let me know when it

is possible to repair them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, as regards agricultural roads and kampong  roads,

the  Urban and Rural Services Consultative Committee has  already

taken  steps  to  investigate the need to  repair  the  roads  in

Kampong Kembangan, Jalan Angteng and Jalan Ladang. For this  year

the  Committee has already approved repairs to the roads, bridges

and  other facilities in Kampong Kembangan. The sum approved  was

$110,000. This goes to show how much attention the Government  is

paying  to the roads, drains and bridges in the rural areas.  Mr

Speaker,   because   such   attention   is   paid   to    various

constituencies, it is not possible to improve all  the  roads  of

one  constituency within one year. The reason is very simple. The

funds  have  to  be fairly allocated so that other constituencies

are  covered. But I can give an assurance to the Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan that the two roads mentioned by him have  already

received   the   attention  of  the  Urban  and  Rural   Services

Consultative Committee and that repairs will be carried out  very

soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to inform the House of the Government's

intention to repair all kampong roads in Singapore. This year  we

have  already repaired 176 kampong roads, involving an amount  of

$943,000. These roads are in Aljunied, Bras Basah, Bukit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



Panjang,  Bukit Timah, Changi, Choa Chu Kang, Crawford,  Farrer

Park.  Geylang  East, Geylang Serai, Geylang West,  Jalan  Besar,

Stamford, Tampines, Tanglin, Telok Ayer, Telok Blangah,  Thomson,

Toa  Payoh,  Ulu  Pandan and Upper Serangoon, in  these  35  constituencies, 176 roads have been repaired by the Government. Some

other roads are still under repair.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> During the debate on Government's financial

policy,  Opposition  members tried to make out  that  Singapore's

pioneer  industries were being monopolised by foreign capital.  I

made a point in reply that the majority of capital subscribed  in

these pioneer industries is local capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome this question from the Member for Hong Lim as it

provides  me  with  an opportunity for giving full  details.  The

Schedule  setting out the particulars in respect of each  one  of

the  119  pioneer  firms will be sent to you in  due  course.  To

summarize  the  aggregates, the total subscribed capital  in  all

pioneer  industries amounts to $221,967,000. 57 per cent of  this

capital  is  provided by local businessmen and 43 per  cent  come

from  abroad.  Among  the  pioneer industries  are  a  number  of

international  oil  companies.  Their  total  subscribed  capital

invested  comes to $49.8 million and the enterprises  are  wholly

owned  by  them.  If we deduct the enterprises set  up  by  these

companies - there are only five oil companies involved - the ratio

of  local  capital to foreign capital is 73 per cent  to  37  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of workers who will be employed by these industries

at  the initial stage of production is estimated at 10,032.  When

these  firms  are  in  final production the estimated  number  of

workers employed will increase to 18,128.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are 19 firms in production in the

Jurong  Industrial Estate. The paid-up capital comes  to  $41  .3

million.  Sixty seven per cent of the subscribed capital  belongs

to  our  local businessmen, 33 per cent comes from overseas.  The

number  of workers in employment at the last count made in August

this year was 1,851. The present total is likely to exceed 2,000.

In  addition to this, some 2,600 workers are employed in  various

construction works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of clarity, I should mention that not all the

firms  in  Jurong  are  pioneer industries nor  are  all  pioneer

industries in production located in Jurong. In fact, the majority

of pioneer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



industries  in  production are located  outside  Jurong.  As  I

stated  in my Budget Address, 43 pioneer firms are in production,

involving  a total capital investment of $132.5 million  and  the

creation of 4,195 new jobs as at the end of August this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attach a Schedule* setting out the details of

firms  in production in Jurong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> asked the Minister for Finance to give a

list  of  all  industrial  enterprises in  Singapore  established

before  5th  June,  1959, stating name of firm; products  manufactured; and number of workmen employed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I regret to say that no lists are available

which  set  out  the  required details. However,  the  Honourable

Member  may  be  interested  in  the  report  on  the  Census  of

Industrial  Production, 1959, compiled by the Chief Statistician,

Singapore,  printed by the Government Printing Office,  published

in  1963, and available to the public at the price of $2 a  copy.

The  Government conducts a Census of Industrial Production  every

year since 1959.
