<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE FEDERATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF MALAYA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  last week the Barisan  Sosialis  in

Singapore   issued  a  statement  in   which   they

violently  attacked the Federation  Government  for

the   proposed   amendments   to   the   Federation

Constitution now before the Federation  Parliament.

The Federation Government can and doubtless will in

due  course  take  care  of  such  violent  attacks

themselves. But in the course of the statement, the

Barisan  Sosialis made a wild allegation  that  the

purpose  of one of the amendments was to facilitate

removal  of  the  reserve powers of  the  Singapore

State  Government,  with  particular  reference  to

reserve State powers in education and labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their campaign to create confusion among the

people  over  their constitutional  position  after

merger, they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



recklessly  first demanded merger as a  12th  State

like Penang arid offered to surrender education and

labour to the Central Government. Now, on realising

that  the  people wish education and labour  to  be

reserve  powers of the State, they are  taking  the

contradictory  line  that  these  reserve   powers,

though valuable, will not be left alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now publish for information of Members an

exchange  of letters between myself and  the  Prime

Minister of the Federation of Malaya. These letters

were exchanged at the time prior to the publication

of  the White Paper on 11th November, 1961.  In  my

letter, I wrote:



<br><br><b>TEXT OF THE LETTER FROM THE PRIME MINISTER, MR LEE KUAN YEW, TO THE FEDERATION'S PRIME MINISTER, TUNKU ABDUL RAHMAN PUTRA AL-HAJ. DATED NOVEMBER 11, 1961</b>



<pre>



       `My dear Prime Minister,



            You will be leaving for London on 16th November,

          1961, for  discussions with the Prime Minister  of

          the  United Kingdom on your far-reaching proposals

          for  the  creation of the Federation  of  Malaysia

          comprising  the  eleven  States  of  the   present

          Federation of Malaya, the States of Singapore  and

          Brunei  and the territories of Sarawak  and  North

          Borneo.  You  carry with you the  support  of  the

          people  of  the Federation of Malaya and  also  of

          Singapore.  We in Singapore have always recognised

          that  the  destiny of Singapore lies in  a  merger

          with the Federation of Malaya.



            I  am happy that we have reached agreement on the

          constitutional framework between Singapore and the

          present Federation of Malaya in the new Federation

          of Malaysia.



            I  shall  be  publishing as  a  White  Paper  the

          memorandum which you and I have agreed upon. May I

          record  your assurance to me that these  heads  of

          agreement  will be  amended only after  preliminary

          consultations between us, and only after agreement

          would  the  matter  he referred  for  approval  of

          Parliament by the majority of members.



            When  you set out in your last mission to  London

          in  January 1956 you brought hack Merdeka  to  the

          Federation  of  Malaya,  and  with  it  peace  and

          prosperity  for  the  people.  May  your   present

          mission  bring stability, prosperity and happiness

          for all the people of Malaysia.



                                          Yours sincerely,

                                       Signed: Lee Kuan Yew.'

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his reply of the same date (11th November,

1961),  the Prime Minister of the Federation  wrote

as follows:



<br><br><b>TEXT OF REPLY FROM THE FEDERATION'S PRIME MINISTER, TUNKU ABDUL RAHMAN PUTRA AL-HAJ, TO THE PRIME MINISTER, MR LEE KUAN YEW, DATED NOVEMBER 11, 1961</b>



<pre>

        `My dear Prime Minister,



            Thank  you very much for your letter of the 11th

          November, 1961, in which you conveyed the  support

          and  good  wishes of the Government and people  of

          Singapore   for  the  success  of  my  forthcoming

          discussions  in London with the Prime Minister  of

          Britain.



            With  regard to the memorandum which you propose

          to  publish as a White Paper, I am to confirm that

          the heads of agreement including State and Federal

          responsibilities  should  serve   as   the   basic

          proposals  for  merger and  the  extent  of  local

          autonomy to be retained by Singapore.



            Of  course  in  the  light of experience certain

          amendments,    modifications,   alterations    and

          revocations  may  have to be made  in  respect  of

          those  proposals, in particular  the  Federal  and

          State  responsibilities. However, when such action

          is contemplated  there   should   be   preliminary

          consultations between us and only after  agreement

          would  the  matter  be referred  for  approval  of

          Parliament by the majority of members.



            May  I wish you and your colleagues all the best

          in  the coming Legislative Assembly when you  will

          be  launching this historic debate which no  doubt

          will  have far reaching effect for the future well

          being  and security of Singapore and Malaya  as  a

          whole.



                                      Yours sincerely,

                           Signed: Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra.'

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the letters record that the heads of

agreement contained in the White Paper Cmd.  33  of

1961  spelling out the reserve powers for Singapore

can be amended only after preliminary consultations

between  us,  and  only after agreement  would  the

matter  be  referred for the approval of Parliament

by the majority of the members there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his letter confirming this, the Federation

Prime  Minister made reference to the fact that  in

the   light   of  experience  certain   amendments,

modification, alterations and revocations may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



have  to be made in respect of those proposals,  in

particular the Federal and State responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No modification is contemplated for education or

labour.  The  modifications that may arise  in  the

light of experience refer to the other subjects and

responsibilities, other than education and  labour,

which have been entrusted in the heads of agreement

reached  between the Singapore and  the  Federation

Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of example, the working Party has now

reached   agreement  with  the  approval  of   both

Governments that shipping should be placed  on  the

concurrent  list, but that fisheries, which  was  a

pan-Malayan  department before the war,  should  be

placed on the Federal list. These two subjects were

left out of the Schedule published in Command Paper

33 of 1961 as there was then still discussion as to

the  ultimate division of responsibility  in  these

two subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If and when alteration is contemplated, there

will be prior consultation and prior agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, at the meeting of the Malaysia

Solidarity  Consultative Committee in Kuala  Lumpur

10  days  ago, the Minister for Health  and  Social

Welfare  of the Federation of Malaya, as leader  of

the  Federation  delegation,  agreed  in  reply  to

questions submitted by delegates from North  Borneo

and  Sarawak  that constitutional  safeguards  were

desirable  and  that an individual State  which  is

given  autonomy in respect of a particular  subject

not conceded as a State subject in the other States

in  the  present Federation can have constitutional

safeguards  to  be  worked  out  by  constitutional

experts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have put in copies of the

exchange of letters for the information of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the letters handed in to the Clerk.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That statement, of course, is open

to  question, if any. No questions? The Clerk  will

now proceed to read the Orders of the Day.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MERGER AND CONSTITUTIONAL FUTURE (SINGAPORE)</b></div>



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of motion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly views with grave concern and

anxiety the exclusion of the Opposition Parties  in

the current "merger" negotiations, and demands that

the   Government  convene  forthwith  an  All-Party

Conference  to discuss and to agree  on  all  basic

questions   on   the   constitutional   future   of

Singapore; and failing agreement, demands that  the

Government  seek without delay a new  mandate  from

the people.' -(Dr Lee Siew Choh).



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  the  House  rose  yesterday,  I  was  briefly

touching  on the shameful record of the  P.A.P. in

the  merger  negotiations. I showed the House  that

the  letter  from  the Deputy Prime  Minister,  the

Acting   Prime  Minister  at  that  time,  to   the

Opposition leaders on the 1st September, 1961,  was

a  cheap  political propaganda stunt calculated  to

deceive  the  people  that  all  Parties  had  been

consulted  in their sell-out merger. I was  saying.

Sir,   that  even  the  reactionary  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government  had  the  decency to  consult  all  the

Parties  and  had agreement with them in  principle

before  proceeding to negotiate  with  the  British

Government in 1958.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> So

you prefer the Lim Yew Heck Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But now, the Lee Kuan Yew

Government must make it a one-Party affair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Petir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, in view of all this, we

then  urged the Acting Prime Minister at that  time

to place the matter before the people. The Workers'

Party  and the United People's Party both supported

our   stand.   The  Workers'  Party  implored   the

Government   to   call  the  House   into   session

forthwith. The United People's Party asked for  the

convening of an All-Party conference without delay.

I  listed six instances yesterday with dates,  Sir.

Now I come to the seventh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The next chapter (this is the seventh) of

this shameful record of dictatorial rule opened  on

the 6th of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



September,  1961,  when the Acting  Prime  Minister

said, "If an All-Party conference is to be of value

to   assist  and  guide  the  Government   in   its

deliberations on the constitutional arrangement for

merger,  there  must  be  unanimity  on  the   main

points."



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Correct.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, simple logic tells us

that  you cannot know if there is agreement  or  no

agreement  unless  and  until  there  is  a  coming

together  for at: exchange of views. In  this  case

there  was never consultation of the views  of  the

Opposition Parties at any stage of the negotiations

to  date.  So  it is nonsense for the Deputy  Prime

Minister to presume there was no unanimity  on  the

main  points.  Whether we agree or not  is  another

matter.  What  concerns us at the  moment  is  that

there  is arbitrary and dictatorial action  on  the

part of the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) On the 16th of September, 1961, the second

joint  statement  of  the two Prime  Ministers  was

issued   and  on  the  following  day,  a   further

confusing  Press interview was given by  the  Prime

Minister  of Singapore. But this is the  point:  of

official news from the Government to the Opposition

Parties,  there  was nothing. Even the  Member  for

Farrer  Park complained in the radio forum of  21st

September, 1961, when the question of an  All-Party

Conference was discussed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> One forum you will not forget

for a long, long time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Finance was

told  in no uncertain terms that the P.A.P. should

not treat everybody as fools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) On 12th October, 1961, the Member for Tanglin

after  much serious thinking also came out  with  a

call  for  an  All-Party  Conference  of  political

Parties in the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Following this, on 6th October, 1961, three

Opposition  leaders  the Member  for  Hong  Lim  on

behalf of the United People's Party, the Member for

Anson on behalf of the Workers' Party -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> A one-man Party.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and myself on behalf of the

Barisan  Sosialis  jointly sent  a  letter  to  the

Leader  of  the  House  urging  the  Government  to

convene  a  meeting  of the Assembly  forthwith  to

consider  and  debate the basic principles  and  to

appoint an All-Party Conference.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> For what reason?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But what did the D.P.M. say?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But what did the who say?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Leader of the

House  knows the rules of debate. If he wishes  for

clarification,  he should please stand  up  and  he

will get clarification. I cannot allow this running

commentary from the ministerial Benches.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, he said that there was

no necessity and that it was all plain nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from all this, it is apparent that the

Opposition  Parties  have been deliberately  denied

the right to participate in charting the course  of

our  own constitutional future. We do not seek  the

right  solely  to decide Singapore's constitutional

future.  All  we ask is the right of participation.

Notwithstanding  this,  the  P.A.P. has  seen  fit

solely  to  decide on the constitutional future  of

Singapore. It is now quite clear to the  people  of

Singapore  that the P.A.P. has committed the  whole

future of Singapore over the question of its phoney

merger  because the P.A.P. is an active sponsor  of

the Malaysia scheme. Malaysia is the only political

objective of the Tunku. He has made it quite  clear

that  there  is  going  to  be  no  acceptance   of

Singapore if there is no Malaysia - a very consistent

stand  of  the Tunku. Singapore therefore  is  only

wanted for the sole purpose of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as political events unfold themselves, the

people   of  Singapore  are  becoming  increasingly

confused and confounded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Today the people find

themselves in an extremely extraordinary situation.

They  feel that their future is being decided  step

by  step  by the Tunku, the Prime Minister  of  the

Federation.  First, when he made a  lengthy  speech

during   the   October  session  of   the   Federal

Parliament last year. Then again when he  addressed

the U.M.N.O. delegates at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur

on  4th  November. And again when he flew to London

in   mid-November  1961  for  exploratory  Malaysia

talks. I mention this, Sir, because there is a very

widespread impression that the British position  in

Singapore   will  be  replaced  by  the  Federation

Government  and  that  that  is  going  to  be  the

constitutional future of Singapore whether we  like

it or not. Sir, this impression regarding -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

information.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this impression -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Is the Member giving way?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir. This impression

regarding the transfer of power has spread  as  far

as   all  the  Borneo  territories.  It  would   be

reasonable  to  expect that if  our  constitutional

future  is  going to be tied up with  the  Malaysia

scheme  and not just a question of merger with  the

Federation in isolation, there would have  been  at

least  an  All-Party  Conference  to  discuss   the

various implications of this scheme from the  point

of  view  of  Singapore  in  accordance  with  past

practice in 1956 and 1958. But no. All we know  was

a   statement  of  support  for  Malaysia  by   the

Secretary-General  of  the  P.A.P.  And  then,   of

course, we learned of the formation of the Malaysia

Solidarity  Consultative  Committee  at  its  first

meeting  in  Jesselton on 24th August, 1961,  which

was  supposed to have been a meeting held at C.P.A.

level. You will remember, Sir, that I wrote to  ask

if  you,  as  the  President of  the  C.P.A.,  knew

anything  about  it  and  your  answer  that   your

knowledge of the matter was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



as  gathered  from  the  newspapers  is  sufficient

testimony  of  the dictatorial rule of  the  P.A.P.

Government. One would have thought that the  P.A.P.

would  have had the good sense to hold an All-Party

Conference  to  decide on the stand that  Singapore

should adopt at this Conference and to agree upon a

truly  representative delegation so that  the  true

voice  of  Singapore could be heard. But again  no.

The  P.A.P. did not hold an All-Party  Conference,

nor   was   Singapore  represented   by   a   truly representative  delegation at this  forum.  It  was only  after  criticism  was  directed  against  the P.A.P. and  after  you,  Sir,  had  insisted   on representation from the Barisan Sosialis -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Queenstown has got it wrong. It was no question  of

insisting.  It  was a question of a  conference  or

discussion  and  in any event that discussion  took

place  in  a  Committee meeting of the  C.P.A. and

should  never be made public except by  consent  of

the Executive Committee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will not mention that

episode, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Apologise.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, it was only after

criticism  was directed against the P.A.P. that  a

Member  of the Barisan Sosialis was included  among

the Singapore delegates to Kuching recently and  to

Kuala Lumpur too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If we had taken him to

Jesselton, no progress would have been made.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The tragedy of the situation

is  that  the  P.A.P. believes that the  future  of

Singapore  should  lie  in  the  fruition  of   the

Malaysia scheme and its phoney plan, and because of

this -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been listening to this

description of the proposed merger which  is  being

referred   to  as  a  phoney  merger.   Does   that

expression mean the terms of agreement as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



contained  in Cmd. Paper No. 33 of 1961  which  was

debated in this House?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I mean that one, Sir, but if -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then I must remind the hon. Member

that  that  Paper has been accepted by  this  House

and, therefore, to describe that Paper as phoney is

a  reflection  on  this House. Therefore,  no  such

epithet  should  be  used in connection  with  that

Paper.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because of this, the P.A.P. -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Because of what?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - has without hesitation

proceeded   to   commit  the  whole  of   Singapore

accordingly. Its basic assumption is  that  in  the

whole  of Singapore the P.A.P. and the P.A.P. alone

knows  what  is  best  for  Singapore.  The  P.A.P.

leadership  believes that the people  of  Singapore

should  not even query the P.A.P.'s decision  about

their  own future, How can the P.A.P. say that  the

people will be given an opportunity to decide  when

the P.A.P. has already decided for us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of all this, I have no doubt that

history  will  record this phase of  our  political

development -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As a folly of the Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sell-out.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - as a chapter of autocracy in

pseudo-democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people know only one road of

constitutional advance, and that is that the future

of  Singapore should be planned and decided by  the

people  of  Singapore themselves  and  not  by  one

political Party in conjunction with people  outside

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the last sitting, as you have reminded

me,  Cmd. Paper No. 33 of 1961 was adopted  by  the

Legislative  Assembly. There was no  difficulty  in

getting  the  Assembly  to pass  those  merger  (in

inverted commas) proposals of the P.A.P. -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Even the inverted commas have

an innuendo and must

not be used. These are merger proposals vvhich have

been accepted by the

Assembly and must be referred to as such.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - as the P.A.P. is now hand in

glove with the

S.P.A. and has the help of seven or eight, extra

votes. We in the Barisan

Sosialis, and I hope other Opposition Parties as

well, have unequivocally

rejected the White Paper. But if the P.A.P.

respects democracy, then let us

come together on an All-Party Conference now

[Laughter]. The P.A.P. laughs.

It never had any mandate from the people on such

Malaysia proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Have you got one?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not understand why there

is this running com-me'ntary from the opposite Benches

[Interruption] Order. When the Speaker is speaking,

there must be silence. I

would suggest that the Member for Queenstown be

given an opportunity of

making his speech without unseemly interruptions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Thank you, Sir, I would ask

the P.A.P. that we should

now try and seek an agreement on the

constitutional advance of Singapore on

a different and an entirely new basis from the

White Paper, Paper Cmd. 33.

If this conference fails to produce a common

agreement, then there should

be general elections to resolve this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Prime Minister laughs, and the

P.A.P. has said that a general

election is not the way to resolve this problem

because the voters, according

to the Prime Minister, will be further confused by

the multitude of election

programmes and party stands on Singapore's

constitutional future. The P.A.P.

says so, of course, simply because it is not

confident of its stand and its pro-gramme being adopted by the majority of the voters.

We in the Barisan Sosialis

are not afraid of the voters. We are confident the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



voters will not be confused

by the multitude of election programmes and party

stands. We are confident the

voters will know what programme and what party

stand to reject. We are

confident the voters will know what programme and

what party stand to

accept. We trust the wisdom of the people and we

feel sure the P.A.P. will

be trounced good and proper in a general election

now. Whichever Party

that comes into power after a general election

should be in a better position

to plan and decide the constitutional advance for

Singapore in a truly

democratic way through consultation by way of an

All-Party conference and in

close consultation with the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly views with grave concern and

anxiety the exclusion of the Oppo-sition Parties in the current 'merger'

negotiations, and demands that the Government

convene forthwith an All-Party Conference to

discuss and to agree on all basic questions

on the constitutional future of Singapore; and

failing agreement, demands that the Govern-ment seek without delay a new mandate from the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to second the motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is no necessity to

second the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Thank you, Sir. Mr, Speaker,

Sir, though the P.A.P. has

gone so far in its secretive manoeuvring to push

through its phoney merger

plans -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind the Member for

Havelock that I have

over-ruled that type of expression in connection

with this merger plan which

has been accepted by the Assembly. If he has a

prepared script, I suggest that

he cancel the word "phoney".



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though the

P.A.P. has secretly

manoeuvred in pushing through its merger plans and

cannot retreat now

witho'ut losing face with the Tunku, we are

nevertheless insisting on calling for

an All-Party conference to discuss this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



extremely important national issue of merger. The

P.A.P. which professes to

believe in democracy has unfortunately set a very

bad example by the way it

has carried through the so-called merger

negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not intend to repeat what

my Party Chairman, the

Member for Queenstown, has said, but I wish to

emphasise that for the P.A.P.

to treat a national issue as a private party affair

is, to say the least, extremely regrettable. Our people have seen the successful

functions   of   All-Party

delegations in the past in advancing the

constitutional status of Singapore. What

we have been seeking so far is that the Parties

should first get together to decide

on certain basic principles and then to proceed as

a united body to negotiate

for our constitutional advancement. The P.A.P.

unfortunately has done things in

exactly the opposite manner. Firstly, it wants to

negotiate secretly with the

Federation  Government  and,  after reaching

agreement   on   so-called

principles, then make a pretence of consulting with

the other Parties. What

sort of consultation is this when we are told of

arrangements after they have

already been agreed upon by the Governments of the

two territories?

The P.A.P. is now treating the merger question as a

way out to salvage its own

political future. It has a vast interest, so to

speak, to see that some kind of

political link-up be brought about as soon as

possible before the deadline of

1964 when it has to face the people again. The

P.A.P. is now hoping, as has

been pointed out before, that such arrangements

will allow the Federation

Government to purge its political opponents before

the next general

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps it is useless to appeal to the

P.A.P. to refrain from going on in

this secretive manner in dealing with a national

problem. We know that with

the meagre one-man majority in this House, the

P.A.P. can do anything it

wants. But that does not mean that it is morally

justified in conducting the

affairs of our people in this manner.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



The P.A.P. leaders have repeatedly declared before

'that they would not

govern without the moral support of the people. Can

they say that they now have

the moral support of the people? An All-Party

conference would have given

full expression to the various opinions on the

question of merger. If the P.A.P.

leaders believe that by pushing through this merger

scheme they can save their

own political future, then they are going to be

sadly mistaken. The real way to

stay in power is to go with the people and heed

their views and aspirations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is utterly nonsensical for the P.A.P. to

suggest that the people will

be confused during a general election. The Prime

Minister has said that there

will be dozens of political Parties with hundreds

of candidates at a general

election and the people will all be confused. But,

Sir, during the last general

election, there were 11 political Parties and about

200 candidates contesting for

the people's votes. Were our people confused? Were

they confused by the

various parties and dubious characters springing up

on the eve of the general

electioo? No. Sir,Instead of being confused, they

made a clear-cut decision.

The P.A.P. was returned with an overwhelming

majority. And we who have

been in the P.A.P. know that the people voted the

Party to power because

of its uncompromising stand against colonialism.

The people were then utterly fed up with the previous Government which had

conspired with the colonial

and reactionary elements to bring widespread

repression and suffering to the

people of Singapore. The people in 1959, Sir,

looked towards the P.A.P. in the

hope and expectation that they would get rid of,

once and for all, the oppression and repression they had suffered at the hands

of the Lim Yew Hock

Government. But now they see that this P.A.P.

Government, on whom they have

placed the trust, are trying its level best to

juggle with and manipulate the constitutional future of our people in such a manner

that will result in a return of

the dark days of the Lim Yew Hock Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let the P.A.P. leaders not think that they

can escape responsibility for

the oppression and suffering of the workers of

Singapore that will follow

the merger scheme. Let them not think that just

because it will be the Federation Government that will be doing the dirty work,

they will escape responsibility. Those who conspire with and make it

possible for others to carry out

repression of our people will themselves be equally

responsible for these acts of

repressions. The people are not fools who cannot

see through this intricate

conspiracy between the P.A.P. and the the

reactionary elements in the Federation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is ridiculous for the P.A.P. to say that

just because it has merger as

one of its many election platforms, it therefore

has the people's mandate to

bring abo'ut any sort of political link-up with the

Federation. For that matter

,merger was on the platform of practically every

political Party at that time. The

people want to be merged with the Federation but

with equality, mutual

respect, and mutual benefit, not this present

completely one-sided arrangement. The people want to be married with the

Federation, and not to be

taken in as a mistress.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to me that the

Member for Havelock is going

back to the debate on merger. We are now debating a

motion which complains

about Opposition Parties not being consulted. That

is all. We cannot go

back on the debate on merger. It took us long

enough.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the P.A.P. leaders are refusing elections not

because the people will be confused

but because the P.A.P. leaders know it will be

vanquished. That is the real

reason. But, Sir, we are not insisting that a

general election must be held so

that the P.A.P. can be defeated and that we in the

Barisan Sosialis can form the

government. No, Sir, we are not interested in

becoming Ministers and

what-not. All we are interested in is that the

people must be consulted on their

constitutional future. All we are insisting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



on is that this question of merger should  be

treated as a national issue and not a one-Party

issue. We are not so much interested in who is in

power as in what they are doing. So long as those

in power carry out their job properly and follow

the wishes of the people, we will

always give them our wholehearted support. We are

concerned with deeds,

Sir, and not with personalities. Let us appeal to

the P.A.P. Government not to

play politics with the affairs of our people. Let

the people be consulted as

far as possible at every stage of their

constitutional advancement.



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We cannot have too many hiatuses or

"hiati". If no Member

wishes to speak, then I will put the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, yesterday when the Member for Queenstown opened this

motion which he himself

admitted had gone stale, he made reference to

closing the stable door after

the horse had bolted. I was going to use the word

"stolen". Sir, stealing is not

a weakness on this side of the House, but

invariably, having regard to what

has been going on in some of our branches, I would

say that it is an art

practised adeptly on the other side of the House.

But -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of

privilege, Mr Speaker, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I rise to complain of an abuse of

privilege by the Minister in

alleging that Members on this side of the House

indulge in stealing. I make this

a formal complaint.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not aware of any imputation of

that nature. If there has

been an imputatio'n of that nature, then, of

course, the Minister is completely

wrong. But I certainly will not at this stage refer

the matter to the Committee

of Privileges. The Member for Anson is, of cpurse,

at liberty to file the usual

motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir, I was just using a

simile because of this talk about

bolting the door after the horse has been stolen. 1

was just merely following upon

that in a similar strain.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> By the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> But as far as the motion is

concerned, the main complaint of the Barisan Sosialis is that the previous

Government - what they call

the Lim Yew Hock Govemment - consulted Opposition

Members, but that we,

on the issue of merger, did not consult the

Opposition Members, and did not

form an All-Party Committee. The difference is

this, Sir. On the specific

issue of constitutional change, it arose as a

result of a motion passed in this

House which was not part of an election programme,

and, therefore, it was

felt that because of that, an All-Party Committee

should be formed to change

the Constitution sooner than it was intended. But

in this case, the P.A.P.

Government was elected on the merger platform. It

was known to everybody.

Just to refresh the memory of the 13 ex-P.A.P.

Members who were elected on

the P.A.P. ticket - they forgot they were elected on

the P.A.P. ticket, on the

P.A.P. platform - they signed a pledge which

included reference to the Fourth

Anniversary   Celebration   Souvenir Number, in

which this was said, in a

long article. I will just read the extract:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The creation of an independent, democratic, non-Communist, socialist Malaya, Federation plus Singapore,'



<br><br>Then we went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To achieve freedom in an island, we must

achieve merger.'



<br><br>Then we went on to say later on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We must face up to the fact that the Alliance

leaders who represent the bulk of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay people',



<br><br>and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We must allay these fears and create the

conditions for merger.'



<br><br>This testament was subscribed to and signed by

every P.A.P. candidate who

stood for election. It is quite clear, Sir, that

we are carrying out a specific mandate which the people know, and, therefore, there

is no need for us to have an

All-Party Committee to carry out an election

programme. If that is the case,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



then every time the Minister for Finance devises

his Budget, he sets up an All-Party Committee. Or any time the Government

announces a programme to im-plement its election promises, there must be an All-Party Committee. Merger is

basic to our programme. What has happened that has

really annoyed them, Sir,

is that merger has come sooner than they expected

or sooner than their

friends expected - the friends who are not here.

They are terrified of merger.

There is no doubt that they are temfied of merger,

as we will see very soon. One

reason why they cannot stop merger -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> rder. Here again, I

think the Minister is going back on the merger

debate. I think he should concentrate on perhaps the reasons why the Opposition

Parties have been excluded.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, because we were elected on

this programme, therefore, we say, politically and morally, we have

every right to negotiate to carry

out our election programme, and there is no need

for us to have an All-Party

Committee to decide vvhether or not we should

implement our political pro-gramme. The real reason why Members of the Barisan

Sosialis are insisting on

All-Party Committee discussions and soon is simply

this. They want to delay

merger, and the only way they can do so is by

having an All-Party Committee. As

you know, we discussed merger for nearly a

fortnight, and it was quite clear that

a Committee of that kind would never reach

agreement on merger. That was

the basis of the demand for an All-Party

Committee. It is to delay merger. "Let

us have discussions." Then there will be talk

about six months, two years or

three years, because there will be no agreement on

the kind of merger we

could have or we should have. Therefore, merger

could be postponed indefi-nitely. In any case, what is the point of still

asking for an All-Party Committee?

We had an All-Party Committee discussing this in

this Assembly. As far as I

know, Sir, the merger proposals were passed in

this Assembly without dissent.

The reason, is that the 13 Barisan Sosialis

Members, on the pretext that some of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



their Members were afraid to go home late at night,

or because they had no

cars, left this Chamber -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Minister

is in order in mentioning

that incident. I think he is in order in mentioning

the fact that the merger proposals have been accepted by this Assembly. Having

been accepted by the

Assembly, it is a fait accompli, as far as the

Assembly is concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The point I wanted to make was

that they said that an All-Party Committee should be called to discuss the

merger proposals. For two

weeks this Assembly was converted into an All-Party

Committee to discuss the

question of merger. They could have taken a stand

and said, "No, we vote

against it." But as far as we know, when it came to

the test to say whether they

were for or against the merger proposals,they were

not here. That was the point

1 vvanted to make. So what is the point of calling

another All-Party Committee

when obviously the Barisan Sosialis are not

prepared to make a stand? All they

want is to prolong things and reopen the question

now. As the Member for

Queenstown has said - his solution now is this - let us

reopen the whole question,

conduct merger negotiations on a new basis, and if

it fails - and definitely

it will fail because we know what their stand is - then they say, let us have fresh

elections. That is the proposal now being put

forward. But as far as we are concerned, Sir, the merger proposals have been

approved by the Assembly and the

course of events will proceed whatever stand the

Barisan Sosialls might take,

or if they stand in the way, then that is their

unhappy misfortune.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points made by the Member for

Queenstown was that, again as

evidence of the dictatorial attitude of the P.A.P.

Government - dictatorial in this

sense - it is carrying out its election pledge

without reference to the Opposition. Another instance, he pointed out, was that

even in the case of Malaysia,

there was no consultation because nobody supported

it. When the Tunku

announced the merger proposals, only the P.A.P.

supported it. The leader of

the Socialist Front, Mr Boestaman,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



supported it. In fact, he came to see the

P.A.P. After the Tunku had announced the Malaysia

proposals, Mr Boestaman

thought it was a very good thing and he came to see

the P.A.P. and said, "What

about having a socialist conference on the matter?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the C.P.A. conference - one Member

of the Barisan Sosialis

(he was not a member of the Barisan Sosialis then; he was just an ex-P.A.P. member at that time) was in the C.P.A. conference - we all discussed Malaysia.

Arising out of the conference, two Members of the

Borneo delegation proposed

the formation of a Malaysia Solidarity Consultative

Committee. As the Government, we issued a statement saying that we

supported the formation of a

Malaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee. For the

first meeting, in Jesselton, the Government sent representatives. As a

courtesy, we asked the Opposition whether they would like to send somebody.

At that time there was no

Barisan Sosialis. There were 13 ex-P.A.P.

gentlemen. We consulted the Op-position and they nominated the Member for Geylang

Serai. Then there was

a complaint by the Member -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Correction, if I may, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am not aware of the Opposition

having nominated the Member for Geylang Serai, Sir.

In fact, I was informed, in answer to my own

question in this Assembly, that it was the

Governments choice and the Governments appointment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As an act of courtesy, we

approached the S.P.A. U.M.N.O. Alliance and said, "Would you nominate

one?" As I said, it was

purely a Government nomination. We did not have to

appoint anybody. Because at that time, the Member for Anson did not

make his stand on Malaysia. He did not even say yes or no, as far as I

could recollect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole purpose of the Consultative

Committee when it was announced

was that only those who supported Malaysia should

be members of that

Committee. That was made quite clear. There were

certain complaints. Then we

decided on a second conference in Kuching. We had

representation at the

C.P.A. level where the C.P.A. would elect a number

of people from the Government side and a certain number of people from

the Opposition side to the

Committee where it was stated quite plainly that

only those who believed in

Malaysia should join the Committee. The Barisan

Sosialis insisted and the

Member for Thomson was nominated for the Barisan

Sosialis -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> By you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir. It was not by me; it was

by the C.P.A. In

fact, the Barisan Sosialis insisted they must be

represented, or, at least,

the Opposition must be represented, on  the

understanding   that   they

supported Malaysia. Now, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In fairness to the Barisan

Sosialis Member who was appointed, I think that was not the understanding. I

think it must be made quite

clear that the Executive Committee just appointed

five people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the minutes of the first -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The minutes are quite clear on the point.

I understand that. But I think, in fairness, the Executive

Committee just appointed five people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As I say, in Kuching where the

Consultative Committee had

its first meeting, it was made quite clear that all

those who believed in Malaysia

were the only ones who should belong to the

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And he said he believed in

Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> And it was made quite clear that

he himself said he believed in Malaysia. So, therefore, to say that in

the case of Malaysia we were

acting dictatorially is completely false.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points repeatedly made is that somehow

the Barisan Sosialis represent the people - the people this, the people

that. They are only 13 Members. There are 26 here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They were elected on the

P.A.P. ticket.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> And they were elected on the

P.A.P. ticket. To that extent, they have gone under false pretences and they

are still sitting there under false pretences. They keep on talking about the

people, the people. In fact, the

Member for Thomson, when he was at the Malaysia

Conference in Kuching,

got up and repudiated the delegation. He said he

had nothing to do with the

Government  delegation  because - he said - "I speak

for the people of Singapore. The other four who are there ... ".

He more or less implied 'that he was dissociating

himself from the rest, so much

so that the Member for Geylang Serai had to get up

and pointed out that the

Member for Thomson only represented 13 Assemblymen

who were formerly

elected on the P.A.P. ticket. Nobody knows whether

the people still approve

of the Barisan Sosialis. They have not been tested.

So to keep on talking that

the people of Singapore want this or want that,

just because the Barisan

Sosialis want this or want that, is not the same

thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker has just now said that even though we

have been elected on the

merger platform, we should still consult the people

before the merger proposals

are put through. Do they mean consult the people - 13

Assemblymen - or is it

the suggestion, as they have always put fonvard,

that if we cannot do that, well,

let us have elections?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. will decide what to do and when

to consult the people in its

own way. But what it will do is to carry through

its election programme without

any reference to whatever the Barisan Sosialis

might say. In fact, the Barisan

Sosialis, unlike us, when they are in difficulties,

do not consult the people.

As you know, Sir, they went to the U.K.

Commission secretly to con&ult and clarify. At

least we never did that. We

brought our proposals to this Assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



after having negotiated terms which we think are

fair and just, and we put it to

the whole Assembly to decide whether they approved

of them or not. There is

nothing secret; there is nothing furtive. The

Member for Havelock suggested

that our negotiations were secret and furtive and

that there were secret manoeuvres. Where was the secrecy? We negotiated some

terms. We published the

White Paper and we discussed it for two weeks. We

are still discussing it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, this motion before the House is

like many things that the Bari-san Sosialis is doing in catching up with history.

This motion is past history. The

merger proposals have been approved in this

Assemhly and now we move for-ward. If the Barisan Sosialis are tailing behind

what I once called the "loco-motive of history", then I am very sorry.

By the time -



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> By P.A.P.

machines!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - the merger train crosses the

Causeway, passes Batu

Pahat and Gemas and reaches Kuala Lumpur, the

gentleman will still be

panting away in this island of Singapore.



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

was in June 1960 when

the Chairman of the former Hong Lim Branch, at a

Party conference of 43

P.A.P. Assemblymen and Party Branch delegates,

raised the question of the re-vision of the Singapore Constitution because not

only the people felt but I,

from my personal experience, during my work, could

feel the inadequacies of the

Constitution; that we were hamstrung everywhere by

those inadequacies. Also,

1 had formed the opinion that the forces of

colonialism were still strong. The

P.A.P. leadership then, as they are now, were not

prepared to fight these forces

but were prepared to join and work hand in hand

with them. Mr Speaker,

Sir, our proposal was to discuss the principle of

revision of the Constitudon,

at this Party Conference, and later to submit to a

Select Committee which

would go into minute details. But unfortunately,

Sir, this proposal to revise

the Constitution was rejected then by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



40 of the Assemblymen present and only

three of 'them were courageous enough to come out

and support the then Hong

Lim Branch. Many of the delegates present were

covved because of the presence

of police personnel and other measures of terror

present at the particular con-ference, and our proposal was rejected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, later we brought the proposal

to this Assembly. And when

the Hong Lim 16 resolution.s were put to the

people during the Hong Lim by-election, they were enthusiastically supported.

We are happy to state today that

rnany of those who disagreed with our  views are

now coming slovvly to our side

and they agree that there should be some form of

constitutional revision to give

more adequate powers to the people of  Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the defeat of the P.A.P.

in two by-elections - the

Hong Lim and Anson by-elections - the P.A.P.

leadership was, we could feel,

trying to save its skin by working out some sort of

constitutional somersault.

This is contained in the White Paper, which the

P.A.P. with the support of the

S.P.A. have adopted in this Assembly. But it is one

thing to discuss a Bill or

any constitutional proposals or any motion in this

Chamber and another

thing to discuss them dispassionately and

objectively clause by clause, and in

detail, in the calm and serenity of an All-Party

conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> No doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir,

there will be as many

Parties debating in this Assembly, as there will be

in an All-Party conference.

But it is one thing debating issues here and

another thing disoussing issues, for

instance, in the coolness of the Select Committee

room.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have from the very beginning

asked this Government to

put forvvard its merger proposals to an All-Party

conference. Even the former

discredited S.P.A. Govemment, which was then the

Labour Front, put forward

their proposals for constitutional reforms to an

All-Party conference. In

addition, it was an All-Party delegation which was

sent to England to discuss



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



with  the  British  the details  as  based  on  the

general  principles adopted by the  conference.  In

our  opinion, Sir, even though the White Paper  was

passed  in  this Assembly by the P.A.P. Assemblymen

and the S.P.A. Alliance Assemblymen, when 17 of the

Opposition Assemblymen staged a walk-out,  I  still

feel  it  is  not  too late for the  Government  to

submit  its  White Paper proposals to an  All-Party

conference for further discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the Government is

hesitant  to  subject itself to the detailed  close

scrutiny  of  an All-Party conference because  they

have  something  to  hide. Sir,  radio  forums  and

Chamber  of  Commerce  forums are  not  necessarily

adequate for a close scrutiny of the minute details

of the P.A.P. merger proposals. In the same way,  a

debate  in this Assembly is not adequate enough  to

probe   into  the  details  of  the  P.A.P. merger

proposals.   Therefore,   every   Party   in    the

Opposition - and I am sure, for this matter, even the

S.P.A.,  though  it  has  already  voted  with  the

Government - will support the convening of this  All-Party conference. We sincerely and honestly ask the

Government  to reconsider the position  and  submit

its  White Paper and all its other proposals to  an

All-Party conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have asked the Government,

after discussion at an All-Party conference, to put

forward  its  proposals  to  the  people   in   the

referendum.  After  having been  pressed  by  three

Parties in the Opposition in the last few days, the

Government  withdrew  the  Second  Reading  of  the

Singapore National Referendum Bill. The Government,

now hard pressed, has given us an assurance that it

will  continue  with the referendum.  We  prefer  a

referendum  and  this  has been  supported  by  all

Parties in principle -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not by the Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> We support a referendum to

thrash out the merger issue. Because it is only one

issue, a referendum would be more suitable. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



Liberal Socialist Party has the same views  as  the

Workers' Party, the Barisan Sosialis and us on  the

merger  proposals   - Automatic citizenship  for  all

Singapore  citizens. But in a general election,  if

the  people  want  to  vote for  automatic  Federal

citizenship for all Singapore citizens,  they  have

to  make  up  their minds whether to vote  for  the

Liberal-Socialists  or the Singapore  Congress  who

have  the  same stand, or to vote for  the  Barisan

Sosialis  or  the  Workers'  Party  or  the  United

People's Party. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it  is

on  that basis that we have called for a referendum

to  thrash  out this matter of merger. I will  even

say  that the convening and the supervision of  the

referendum  should not be by Government  alone  but

also by the same All-Party Conference, which should

decide on the words, and the way the referendum  is

to be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order that the referendum

would be fair and properly conducted, the All-Party

Conference   should  also  extend  its   work   and

supervise the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Take over the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure

that that would not be long.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Barisan, watch out!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion

before the House contains three problems. First:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly views with grave concern and

anxiety the exclusion of the Opposition Parties  in

the current "merger" negotiations'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we support this first part of

the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the motion reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly demands that the Government

convene   forthwith  an  All-Party  Conference   to

discuss and to agree on all basic questions on  the

constitutional future of Singapore.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  likewise, as we have already  raised

this  matter in the Hong Lim Resolutions,  we  also

support this part of the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and failing agreement, demands that the

Government  seek without delay a new  mandate  from

the people.'.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, we do not support the third part

of the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are a wise man.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we know the

tricks  of the Government. I have been long  enough

with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have said, a referendum is the best way to

find out the views of the people on merger. When we

fought  this present discredited P.A.P. leadership

in  Hong Lim, we fought on the basic principle that

we  will come to this House to press the Government

to carry out its mandate which they had in 1959 and

to  see that they will carry on as an honest, clean

and  responsible  Government and  that  we  in  the

Opposition  will egg them on. We have this  mandate

and, other than the Member for Anson, we have a new

mandate.  We do not consider the issue  of  calling

for  fresh elections at the moment. However, in our

present  assessment if there is a general  election

no Party is going to command a majority -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So you do not represent the

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - and it might lead to the same

chaotic  condition  as France. But  when  the  time

comes  for us to call the Government to resign,  we

will do so.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was deeply intrigued to

listen  first to the leader of the Barisan Sosialis

and  even  more  now to the leader  of  the  United

People's  Party. If we are asked seriously  in  all

earnestness  to  convene these groups  together  to

seek common agreement -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Knock their heads together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - and if common agreement

cannot   be  reached  either  because  the  Barisan

Sosialis cannot reach agreement, then you go back



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



to  the people for a general election. And here  he

has the answer right in front of him. The leader of

the  U.P.P., to whom I will concede on  one  point,

speaks  with a better mandate than the  Member  for

Queenstown because he has renewed it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> After thrashing the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, that may be so, but, I

tell  the Member for Nee Soon this. The Member  for

Hong  Lim,  whatever  his shortcomings - and  he  has

quite a few for which he has paid bitterly and will

pay  over the years even more bitterly - is  a  very,

very  deep man. He understands the art of survival.

But  the  Member  for Queenstown,  being  a  rugger

forward,  does not. He rushes blindly forth,  which

is a great quality in a rugger forward -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we had the

support of the people of Hong Lim and I do not need

the compliment of the Kiss of Judas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would feel a little bit

squeamish  if I were asked to deliver  a  kiss.  It

might be mistaken for -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Adultery!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> - various dishonourable intentions. Never mind, we will let that pass. Honestly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I doubt whether if one of the qualifications of being allowed to speak in this privileged Chamber was a medical examination by a psychiatrist -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would you survive?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Maybe not. Sir, but I am

quite prepared to submit myself to one and I think,

if  we all submitted ourselves to it, the people of

Singapore would be less confused and less inflicted

with all the lunacies and hallucinations -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is all this necessary? Let us

come  to  the  debate which is a  simple  one.  The

Barisan   Sosialis  complain  that  the  Opposition

Parties  have not been consulted. That is all.  Let

us not talk about lunacies, hysteria, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

others did not do these things, we would be talking

on the debate. There were three major speeches from

the Opposition and they did not talk on the motion.

They  spoke incidentally on the motion. One  talked

about  the  Hong  Lim Resolutions.  Another  talked

about   a  mandate  from  the  people  and  general

elections.  And I have to reply because  it  is  my

duty  to  reply to these things. If you  feel  that

these things should not be replied to because  they

are not the subject of the debate -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am suggesting to the Prime

Minister  that  all  these personal  allusions  are

completely irrelevant and out of order.  I  do  not

know why these personal allusions are creeping into

this debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Since you have asked me the

question,  I  have  to give you the  reply, it  is

because  it is in the nature of this House.  And  I

say if the House continues to conduct itself as  it

has  only  yesterday  over the  Banking  Bill,  the

Government  was  egged on to  be  more  democratic,

zeroes  were being added, and so on  - we  will  soon

reduce democracy and this legislative Chamber to  a

figure  of fun. I want to say in deadly earnestness

to  the Members of the Opposition now, "Cut out the

hypocrisy  and  let us really come  down  to  brass

tacks."  Everybody knows that things are  going  to

happen in 1962 - not just merger and Malaysia;  other

things  are  going  to happen. The  leader  of  the

United  People's Party knows for his own  political

survival that certain things had better happen.  He

is  no  innocent. He was a member of  the  Internal

Security Council. He knows what this is all  about.

He has remained silent. He is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



hoping not for general elections now  - it is bad - but

after   the   inevitable  denouncement   is   over.

Everybody knows that - so does the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of information,

please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

whether  the  Prime Minister was talking  from  his

personal  experience as a Member of the  Opposition

in  the  Lim  Yew Hock Government days. There  were

rumours  in  town  that  he  got  the  Member   for

Cairnhill  to  do  certain  things.  And  I  wonder

whether he was relating his experience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He was a member of the

Central Executive Committee of the P.A.P. then  and

we  calculated wisely and well. That is why we were

able to set the pace. Let me inform him, the Member

for  Anson, and the Member for Havelock  that  this

time  it is different. I will tell them why  it  is

different, because this time it is no longer  anti-colonialism.   They   are  going   to   fight   the

nationalists this time. They are not just going  to

fight a dying anti-colonial regime. And I say  when

they   have   to  fight  their  own   people,   the

proposition they are confronted with is a different

one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me speak on the main purpose of

the  motion as it was drafted. Nobody wants to take

any   responsibility  for  having  to  reduce  this

chaotic   situation   in  Singapore    - economically

untenable, politically chaotic. From time to  time,

these  things  will recur until it  has  found  its

place  as  part of a larger whole. The  Member  for

Hong  Lim subscribed to it in toto as a member  of the  Central Executive Committee of the P.A.P. when

we  issued the Fourth Anniversary Souvenir  number.

Every  Member  on the Opposition side  - the  Barisan

Sosialis  and  the United People's  Party - signed  a

pledge  before  they were candidates  in  the  last

election  and I read the one signed by  the  Member

for Queenstown.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir. Are these pledges relevant to the issue before

the House?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Prime Minister can

explain how it is relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the right of the

Government to do what it is its duty to do is being

questioned. It had no mandate to discuss merger. It

should  have  consulted  the  13  Barisan  Sosialis

Members - the  people. And what I want to  show  very

simply  is  far from that, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  They

undertook   solemnly  on  oath  and  under   seal - a

photostat  copy of the original is still  with  the

Treasurer  of  the P.A.P. - to abide  by  the  Fourth

Anniversary policy statement. This is the pledge of

Dr Lee Siew Choh, the Member for Queenstown.

and  Policy".  Let  me now read  from  page  2  the

relevant extracts to show beyond any doubt that  we

are   honour  bound  to  carry  out  what  we  have

promised - to  bring about a reunification  of  these

two territories:



<pre>

           `On November 21, 1954, we stated, "Though, because

          of  the division of Malaya into two territories, we

          are  technically  a  political party  operating  in

          Singapore,  we  shall in all our  approach  to  the

          problems    of    this   country   disregard    the

          constitutional   division.  We  are   as   actively

          interested  in the problems of our fellow  Malayans

          in  the Federation as we are in those of Singapore.

          When Malayans in the Federation who agree with  our

          aims, join us, we shall work throughout Malaya."



                                *  *  *  *  *



            We  must face tip to the facts, that the Alliance

          leaders  do represent the bulk of Malay  people  in

          the Federation, in that their attitude on the issue

          of  merger is a reflection of the present fears  of

          the  Malay  raayat. It is, therefore, our  duty  to

          clarify  the  position of the people of  Singapore,

          principally the Chinese. We must allay these  fears

          and  create the conditions for merger. This is  our

          immediate task. To achieve freedom it is no  longer

          just a simple question of fighting the British.  We

          must  also  resolve the two fears  which  make  the

          Malay  majority  in  the Federation  not  want  the

          Chinese majority in Singapore.



                                *  *  *  *  *



            This is  even more true now than four years  ago.

          For to achieve freedom in an island we must achieve

          merger.  Singapore  by itself,  an  island  of  224

          square  miles  with  a population  of  1.5  million

          living mainly on its trade with the Federation  and

          Indonesia, cannot hope for anything more  than  the

          status of Hongkong or Taiwan.



                                *  *  *  *  *



            Let there be no doubts on this point. The problem

          after  merdeka in the Federation is quite different

          from  that  before merdeka. Now for the first  time

          the  people  are confronted with the  vital  issues

          that will determine the shape and character of  the

          Malaya to come. And the first issue is the question

          of language.'

</pre>



<br><br>and so on. Is there any doubt what we stood for - the

basic and principal aim of the party? To the Member

for  Queenstown: if he keeps on repeating  that  he

represents  the people, I say, here is  a  covenant

signed under seal. Although it is a bit belated - six

months -  honour it!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You go along to Tanjong Pagar

and I will resign.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am still in the P.A.P.,

Sir.   I  am  still  carrying  out  the  aims   and

objectives of the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Let me answer the Member for

Havelock. I think, whoever wrote his speech  - he did

not  write it; I mean let us be fair. I want to  be

fair  to  the  man. The English  is  not  his,  the

thoughts  are  not his, but he understands  that  a

grave  error  of judgment was made. All  that  they

have done really was to help bring about merger  by

convincing the Federation that the 1960 analysis of

the  P.A.P. was absolutely correct. This  was  the

Central  Executive Party policy statement published

in the 6th Anniversary issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown often wonders why

these  things  have happened in the  way  he  never

expected them to happen. So does the Member for Nee

Soon.  I can understand why they feel, in the words

of  the motion, "grave concern and anxiety". It  is

written  on  their faces, everyone of them.  "Grave

concern  and anxiety" and the perilous  steps  they

have   taken  in  jeopardising  and  exposing   the

intentions  of their manipulators, not of  them,  I

have  stated publicly, not in the privilege of this

Chamber, where everyone stood. The only man on  the

Opposition benches now in the Barisan who I say has

made   up   his   mind   mainly   for   ideological

considerations  is  the  Member  for  Thomson.   He

believes that the Communists will win. He  told  me

that. He also told the Minister for Culture and the

Minister for Finance. And he is not going to take a

stand against them. He decides to go with them. But

the  others have decided for different reasons. The

Member for Havelock - for a different reason from the

Member  for Queenstown; and he for a very different

reason from the Member for -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

We keep coming back to the pet subject of the Prime

Minister.  Could we restrain him to the  issues  in

respect of the motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Prime Minister is, in

fact,  going  into too much detail in  touching  on

this  particular aspect of the motion. Let us  come

back to the broad principles of the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely, Mr Speaker. I am

asking  Members  of  this Assembly,  including  the

Member  for  Anson who finds all this  distasteful,

this  question.  Does anybody  in  his  right  mind

expect   that   if  one  brings  to  an   All-Party

conference  all  these  minds,  there  will  be   a

concensus of minds? For two weeks, to the point  of

utter  tedium  and  boredom, we heard  nothing  but

tirade after tirade which can leave nobody with any

doubts  that if anybody can bring about a concensus

of minds on merger, he must be either a superman or

a   hypnotist  to  take  them  out  of  their   own

personalities. The Member for Anson may or may  not

believe  this, but he at least makes a pretence  of

it  for the show of it -  discussion, and so on.  The

Member for Queenstown does not bother about it.  He

is  a  bit new and straightforward. He tried rugger

as a rugger forward, and a very good rugger forward

he  was  too, I was told. I will tell him  now  why

these things have happened in the way they did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960 we analysed for him and he read this with

approval -  "Long-term objectives", page 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In following and countering the twists and turns

of  the  political propaganda of opposing  parties,

let  us  never  forget that the people  will  never

trust a party which breaks faith with them.'



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have clearly stated that we stand for an

independent,  democratic, non-Communist.  Socialist

Malaya.  We  have never said that we stood  for  an

independent,  democratic, non-Communist,  Socialist

Singapore. First because an "independent Singapore"

was  never our objective. Second because we realise

that   a   Socialist  Singapore  is   an   economic

impossibility. We can analyse this in  detail  when

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



discuss  the  political  line  recently  tried   by

certain  Left-wing  adventurers on  an  independent

Singapore.'



<br><br>And  then we went on to tell our followers  in  the

P.A.P. and outside why merger is inevitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To go forward blindly on the simple anti-colonial

line,  after  the Federation has been divided  from

Singapore  and has achieved political  independence

is  to  go  into a blind alley. As we said  in  our

Party  statement:  "To achieve  freedom  it  is  no

longer  just  a  simple question  of  fighting  the

British".  That is not to say that we  should  stop

fighting the British colonialists. But if  that  is

all  we  do  then we deserve to fail  for  our  own

stupidity.  These Left-Wing Adventurers are  driven

by  the  logical consequences of their argument  to

only fight the colonialists and to do nothing which

is constructive until complete independence, to say

that   they   want  to  fight  for  an  independent

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realised after 31-8-57 that only to fight the

British  and do nothing constructive until complete

independence cannot produce an independent  Malaya,

because the Federation was already independent.  It

can only produce an independent Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... But we say that an independent Singapore once

established  cannot lead to merger by  consent.  If

merger  comes it would then be by the  conquest  of

one  over  the other. For an independent  Singapore

once  established, even for an interim period, will

create a situation whereby vested interests,  based

on Chinese appeals, will become permanent. For once

independence  is achieved in this island  city,  75

per  cent  of  whose  population  is  Chinese,  the

logical  consequence  would  be  that  the  Chinese

chauvinist  sentiments which are at  present  being

muted and slowly dissolved because of the objective

of  independence  through merger, will  openly  and

aggressively come to the fore.'



<br><br>Page 6:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Let us face the facts. An independent Singapore

will  not  result  in  merger, for  Singapore  will

become  an  increasingly Chinese City with  Chinese

from   the   Federation,  and  perhaps  some   from

Indonesia as well seeking refuge in Singapore...



<br><br><i>Merger inevitable</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger between the Federation and Singapore is

historically inevitable...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is simply that the Federation cannot

afford to have a hostile Singapore. So far we  have

emphasised  the  importance of  the  Federation  to

Singapore.  Lest there is any danger of  forgetting

it,   let  us  remind  people  that  Singapore   is

important   to   the  Federation   militarily   and

politically.'



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And economically.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Militarily and politically Singapore and the

Federation  are one unit. Colonialism  has  made  a

technically  international frontier on the  Straits

of  Johore  and created two states. But no  soldier

can devise a front to make Singapore and Federation

two  instead  of  one military  situation.  He  who

conquers  Malaya conquers Singapore.  The  Japanese

proved  it.  And conversely he who holds  Singapore

absorbs Malaya. Stamford Raffles proved it. Perhaps

it  is  worthwhile remembering that it is the  same

British Army, on both sides of the causeway, though

on the Federation side it is there by invitation on

friendly  defence treaty with the Federation  Army.

And  no  politician  has yet devised  a  method  to

prevent  news and events from spreading across  the

causeway. Every political action in the Federation,

in  language,  education, taxation, and  all  other

fields  of government, affects and has repercussion

in Singapore.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know how much longer

the  Prime  Minister is going to  read.  The  Prime

Minister  is  only entitled to read  extracts.  And

possibly these are details which are going a little

far away from the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have, Mr Speaker, Sir,

eight more lines to go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`And the converse is equally true however much

people may try to minimise the reactions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tacit proof of this was the extremely sensitive

Federation  reaction to a Russian trade mission  to

Singapore to the E.C.A.F.E. Conference. It  was  an

acknowledgement  that Singapore was  vital  to  the

security  of  the Federation. If a  Russian  rubber

buying trade delegation can cause all this anxiety,

what  would  happen if hostile forces captured  the

Singapore  Government  and actively  subverted  the

Federation  from  across the  causeway.  A  hostile

independent  Singapore must  lead  to  retaliation,

conflict   and   in  the  end,  to  conquest.   The

Federation  can sit back and say they do  not  want

Singapore  only  because  the  British  forces  are

ensuring  that  no hostile or Communist  Government

takes over power in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this delicate balance cannot last forever, The

present  balance of power and forces is an  interim

one.  For  finally  the  Singapore  and  Federation

positions  will  have  to  be  contained   by   one

authority, or the Federation will run the  risk  of

having Singapore fall into hostile hands and  later

have  to face more dangerous military and political

consequences.'



<br><br>And   I   thank  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and  their

manipulators, principally the Secretary-General for

the  fierce  statements he has issued, in  bringing

home  that  thesis  conclusively during  Anson  and

after  Anson.  Let us draw aside all this  veil  of

public pretence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock knows what the future

holds in store. So does the Member for Hong Lim. So

does the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I do not know what these threats

mean,  and  I am rising to object to this  straying

from the main issue. Can we please come back to the

motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated that those extracts

were  perhaps going into details and were, in fact,

straying  away  from  the  motion.  But  the  Prime

Minister was going on a different theme and I  have

not  had a chance to make up my mind on what he was

going to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What I was going to say, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  is  simply this. Nobody  really  is

bothered about an All-Party conference.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If the Member for Anson is, I

say  to him, he has got one here everyday. He moved

a  motion  yesterday.  He was  unable  to  get  the

Opposition  to be with him on a simple  thing   - the

whole of the Opposition. The U.P.P. was against it.

He  pleaded passionately. He finally found  himself

abstaining when the Barisan Sosialis voted  against

a  Commission  of  Inquiry to investigate  specific

allegations  which the Member for  Upper  Serangoon

had  made  and which the Member for Tea  Payoh  had

made.  Does anybody in his right mind believe  that

an  All-Party conference of the same people here in

this  Chamber, just because they will meet in  some

other  chamber,  whether it is cool  or  hot,  will

produce   anything  other  than  the  most  riotous

confusion?  Everybody is interested in  having  his

say. We have allowed everybody to have his say  two

weeks  of it and more. We are still talking outside

this  Chamber, explaining, arguing, explaining  and

more explaining.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the desire just to create confusion,

to   which  the  Member  for  Anson,  wittingly  or

unwittingly, lends himself, the Member for Hong Lim

also   wittingly  lends  himself,  because  he   is

definitely one who is well versed in these  matters

of  propaganda. He talks about automatic conversion

of  Federation  citizenship. He  knows  it  is  not

possible.  There  have been clear  and  categorical

explanations, clear and categorical statements from

the Tunku.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> If we have an All-Party

conference,  Sir, the Government will  be  able  to

tell  us whether it agrees to the principle or not.

Whether  the Federation will give in or  rot  is  a

different  matter.  But if an All-Party  conference

accepts automatic conversion, then we can negotiate

with the Federation for automatic conversion. Would

the Prime Minister state his stand as to whether he

agrees to the principle of automatic conversion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I stand for everything. I

take  anything people want to give me on behalf  of

the  people  of  Singapore. If they  want  to  give

automatic citizenship to Singapore citizens, surely

we will welcome it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> You should ask for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But do I want to prove that I

deliberately want to wreck negotiations? Do Members

of  the  Opposition  believe for  one  moment  that

Members  of  U.M.N.O. sitting here in this  Chamber

are  going  to agree to this? And if  there  is  no

agreement, says the Member for Queenstown -   general

election. What is all this about? They know what it

is all about. Everybody wants to meet the Tunku and

discuss matters. Surely, most of all the Secretary-General  of the Barisan Sosialis, who has tried  to

fix  two  appointments with the Tunku and  has  not

succeeded - one via the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



Geylang Serai. He wants to explain that he is not a

Communist  and why he is in support of merger,  and

another via other sources, other friends. I  say  I

am  quite happy. I mean, if that is what he  really

wants - an All-Party conference in order to fix  this

opportunity for explanation and disavowal  of  evil

intentions - I will try my best. Everybody  in  Kuala

Lumpur  knew the Member for Anson went up  to  have

lunch with the Tunku. The Press knew it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is not true that the Press knew

it.  I  think,  Mr Speaker, you have informed  the

Prime  Minister that it is out of order to  mention

the  private conduct of a Member outside. There are

matters, Sir, which are not derogatory but which it

is improper to make public for some reasons, and  I

do ask that the order of the House be enforced.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have, in fact, ruled that the

personal  conduct of a Member must not be  referred

to  except  on  a  substantive  motion.  The  Prime

Minister  must abide by the decision of  the  Chair

until he files a substantive motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On this particular point - I do

not want to press it unless it is of any importance

at  all. But I say in that case he will compel  me,

because this is public conduct. I am not interested

in   the   Member  for  Anson's  private  life.   I

congratulated  him  when he was  given  a  daughter

recently.  I  am not interested in  that.  But  the

moment  the  former  Chief Minister  goes  up  with

members  of  the Malaysia delegation and  meet  the

Prime  Minister  of the Federation  of  Malaya  for

lunch, I say it is public conduct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> File a motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have accepted the statement

of  the  Member  for Anson that it  was,  in  fact,

personal  conduct. He might have just gone  up  for

lunch.  I  do  not know, but I have  accepted  that

statement.  Having  accepted  that  statement,  the

ruling must follow. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



the  Prime Minister wishes to challenge that ruling

on  that evidence - that the Member for Anson has  in

fact  stated  openly in this Chamber  that  it  was

personal   conduct   and  I  have   accepted   that

statement - the Prime Minister is at liberty  to  do

so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That was what I stated, Mr

Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Will the Prime Minister give way on

a matter of explanation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I want no misunderstanding, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,I went up entirely unofficially.  It

was  not  intended that there should be  any  Press

communiques,  any  statements,  any  publicity.   I

regret   that  the  information  which  the   Prime

Minister  had  because  of his  personal  relations

should  be made public of what I consider to  be  a

personal approach to the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Am I to believe then that the Member

for  Anson does not consider that personal conduct?

Is that the impression he gave me?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry. I do not quite follow

that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Standing Order which I

referred to and which was not dissented from by the

hon.  Member  for  Anson  was  Standing  Order  46,

paragraph (10), which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose.'



<br><br>And  I understood the Member for Anson to say  that

it  was,  in  fact, personal conduct not  connected

with  his  public affairs, On that basis,  I  ruled

that  any reference to that visit to the Tunku  was

out  of  order. If I have misunderstood the  Member

for  Anson,  then, of course, that ruling  must  be

revoked.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, let me clarify. My

visit to Kuala Lumpur and to the Prime Minister  of

the  Federation  was, in fact, connected  with  the

public affairs of the State. But I repeat that I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



do not think it is proper for the Prime Minister to

divulge information he has obtained confidentially.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In that case it was not and

it  cannot  be  a point of order for the  Chair.  I

think  the  Member  for Anson probably  misled  the

Chair. That ruling, in the light of what the Member

for  Anson  has  now  said,  must,  of  course,  be

reversed. What the Member for Anson asks the  Prime

Minister to do is not the concern of the Chair.  If

the  Prime Minister, in spite of the request of the

Member  for  Anson, wishes to refer to this  visit,

then he is at liberty to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, therefore,

I would be glad if I may, from time to time, have a

little  forbearance from this House, because  I  do

not press a point unless I am prepared to press  it

to  its logical conclusion. I have no intention  of

embarrassing the Member for Anson. But I have every

intention to see that there is no double  talk  and

double  think  and  double  presentation.  That  is

important.  I  do  not  claim  privilege  in   this

Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is the Prime Minister suggesting

that I have been indulging in double talk or double

think? I am not a P.A.P. member yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If he were, he would not be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What is the purpose?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is quite simple. To

clarify issues before the public. Here is a  wicked

Government,  by  the implications of  this  motion,

supported  by the Member for Anson and  the  Member

for  Hong  Lim, that does not wish to  consult  all

Parties,   that  wants  to  railroad   the   merger

proposals through. I mentioned his going up to  see

the Prime Minister of the Federation not because  I

got the information from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



the  Prime Minister of the Federation, but  because

the  whole  of the Press at the Malaysia conference

knew it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So be it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What did they know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Minister for Culture

knew.  Yes, everybody knew it. That is part of  the

troubles  of  the Member for Anson. The  things  he

does  not  want  people to know  often  are  public

knowledge. But whatever it is, he is well informed,

and he knows it -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Of what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He knows what the views of

the  Tunku are on many things. He knows that  there

is no question of automatic citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Does the Minister for Culture tell

you that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No. He does not have to tell

me  that. I would suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, we all

would  be  better  off if instead of  an  All-Party

conference, when only pandemonium will  emerge,  we

all  sat  down and wrote out honestly and sincerely

what we all believe in.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Can you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely. And then the sheep

will  be parted from the goats. Whether it  is  the

P.A.P.  Government  in office, whether  it  is  any

other  government, I tell the Member  for  Havelock

this: there will be merger; there will be Malaysia;

and  there  will be a conflict between  nationalism

and  communism, and those who stand on the side  of

the  Communists must expect the nationalist  forces

to  collide with them because the Communists attack

the nationalists -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What about the socialists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Ah, the socialists. It

depends  upon  whether they are  non-Communists  or

just anti-colonial Communist socialists -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Pro-Communist songs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Or those who sing pro-Communist

songs.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What is this?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There seem to be backseat

drivers  egging the Prime Minister on. I would  ask

him  now to get on with the motion. I think he  has

made his point, and he appears to be repeating what

he started to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And we are asked at this late

stage,  Mr Speaker, Sir, to: try and get  together

with the Barisan Sosialis to reach a new basis  for

agreement.  There  can  be no  agreement  with  the

Barisan  Sosialis for the simple reason  that  they

cannot  afford to agree to merger. It is as  simple

as  that.  They  have agreed here, yes.  They  have

agreed  in  the  Fourth Anniversary Souvenir,  yes.

They  have agreed in a statement signed by Mr  Lim

Ching Siong and five others when they were released

from  prison, solemnly pledging that they supported

the  stand  of the Party in the hope - but of  course

this  is never going to happen since the Tunku does

not want merger, so it is quite safe to agree to  a

nationalist demand for reunification - but  the  time

has come when reunification will take place even if

the  P.A.P. disappears, even if the P.A.P. decides

to  fight against it. This is as inevitable as  the

rising of the sun. We analysed that - why it is going

to happen. We are asked to sit down with people who

cannot afford to have merger because they know that

the Central Federation Government has made no bones

about this. That they, in turn, when the time comes

intend to put a check to Communist activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown may have been puzzled

why  he  was  led up the garden path into  breaking

away  from  the  P.A.P. and  joining  the  Barisan

Sosialis with a group of Communists who assured him

he  was  going to be in power. The Member  for  Nee

Soon,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



Deputy  Prime  Minister; the Member  for  Havelock,

Finance Minister. They are not interested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  do  forgive my repetitious request  that  the

Prime Minister confine himself to the issue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suppose the Prime Minister is now

winding up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He has the liberty in a

democratic  chamber to wind up in his own  fashion,

Mr Speaker, Sir. And if he wishes to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister is

entitled in a democratic fashion to wind up, but he

must be relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have to reply to the Member

for  Havelock,  Mr  Speaker, Sir.  He  made  these

points. He is not interested in being a Minister. I

am  just telling him why his ambitions did not come

true  and  why we are now asked to meet and  confer

with  them  to reach agreement, which is impossible

because  they cannot afford to agree to  merger  in

order  that  then,  according  to  the  Member  for

Queenstown, there could be general elections, which

according to the Member for Hong Lim, would lead to

a chaotic "French" situation. Is there any sense in

all this'? In the end, I say, like in the words  of

a  famous refrain, "Whatever will be, will be." And

good luck to those who made the wrong decisions for

the  wrong  reasons and the wrong time in  a  wrong

manner.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all

that  the  Prime Minister was trying to do  was  to

beat around the bush -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Did you not sign the pledge?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - and create a lot of vague talk in the

hope that the basic issues that were raised by  the

Member for Queenstown will be lost. There is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



no  point  for  the Prime Minister  to  waste  time

talking of the P.A.P. manifesto containing the fact

that  the Party stands for unification of Singapore

with  Malaya, because nobody in this House has ever

said that we are against the unification of our two

territories.  Sir, I think you will agree  with  me

that  we  spent more than two weeks putting forward

our  case, and in none of our speeches did we  ever

say  that  we were against unification of  the  two

territories. But for the Prime Minister  to  equate

unification of the two territories with the sort of

sell-out plan that his Government has worked out -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. By using the expression "sell-out plan", is the Member referring to the

memorandum  setting cut the heads of agreement  for

merger as contained in Cmd. 33 of

1961?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am referring to the White Paper, Sir,

which sets out -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If that is so, then I have

indicated  already in no uncertain terms that  that

memorandum  has been accepted by the Assembly  and,

therefore,  to  say  that  what  the  Assembly  has

accepted is in the nature of a "sell-out plan" is a

reflection on the Assembly and cannot be allowed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The point that I want to make is quite

simple.  If  it  is  the  intention  of  the  Prime

Minister or the P.A.P. Government to try and equate

the  sort of merger plans that have been negotiated

by  them  with  the desire of the  people  to  have

genuine unification of the two territories, then  I

say  it is titter nonsense because, Sir, as  I  was

saying,  in the course of two weeks in this  House,

those  of  us in the Barisan Sosialis explained  in

great  detail  why we thought the  terms  that  the

P.A.P.   Government   had  negotiated   would   not

constitute  genuine reunification. Sir,  I  do  not

want  to be like the Prime Minister and quote pages

from  P.A.P. propaganda documents. I do  not  think

this  is  the  place  or the  time  to  indulge  in

theoretical  arguments  over  certain  theses   the

P.A.P. leaders have made.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



But  all  that I want to state here in  very  clear

terms is this. Nobody doubts the fact that in 1959,

when  the  P.A.P. ran for the  elections,  it  had

merger  as  an  issue. If we  go  through  all  the

election documents, speeches made by all the P.A.P.

Ministers during the elections, one will note  that

there  was no definition of this word "merger".  At

that  time,  the Prime Minister did  not  tell  the

people  of  Singapore  that when  the  P.A.P. said

merger, they were thinking of a sort of merger that

they  have  now negotiated. They did not  tell  the

people of Singapore that in their merger plan  they

wanted to make the people of Singapore second-class

citizens -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Thomson

is now going back on a debate which we have had. As

he  has indicated, we did have a 14-day debate.  He

can  just touch on that in passing, but not go into

details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Actually, Sir, it is not my intention

to  go  back  to the debate. I just  want  to  make

replies  to  some of the points the Prime  Minister

raised  just now. As I was saying, the  main  point

here  is  that  during the elections the  form  and

substance  of  merger was never  explained  to  the

people, for one simple reason, and that is that  at

that  time nobody thought merger would be what  the

P.A.P. says merger is now. Ever since  1946,  ever

since  the  separation of the two territories  when

the call for unification of the two territories was

made, everybody accepted the fact that merger means

Singapore going in as one constituent State in  the

Federation of Malaya, enjoying the same privileges,

enjoying the equal status as any other State in the

Federation  of  Malaya. Today, the arrangement  the

P.A.P. has made is quite definitely not merger  in

the  sense of the word. Therefore, I think it is  a

waste  of  time for the Prime Minister or  for  any

other   Minister  or  any  other  Member   of   the

Government  at  this stage of the  debate  on  this

motion  to  try  and say that this was  the  P.A.P.

pledge and that the Barisan Sosialis have gone away

from the P.A.P. and therefore they have broken  the

election  pledge.  We are all associated  with  the

election  pledge, and we state quite  categorically

that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



stand  for  merger.  But for complete  and  genuine

merger which will bring about genuine unity of  our

people and not for any other arrangement which will

bring about greater disunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion before us indeed is one that is

long  overdue for debate. Sir, you will  appreciate

it  is not the fault of the Barisan Sosialis.  This

motion  was  filed  a long time ago;  a  long  time

before the White Paper was debated here. If  it  is

only  possible  to debate this motion  today  here,

then  I  am  sure the Government Members themselves

know  the  reasons. Sir, although we know that  the

terms and conditions for the so-called merger  have

been  negotiated by the P.A.P. Government, although

perhaps  it  is too late for the Prime Minister  of

Singapore  to  go  back  and  reopen  negotiations,

nevertheless,  we feel, for record  purposes,  this

motion must be gone through and our views recorded.

Sir,  merger, or for that matter any constitutional

advancement,  is  not something  that  affects  the

interests  of  the Prime Minister  alone.  Sir,  if

merger  were to mean the Prime Minister  getting  a

Dato or a Tun, then we say it is immaterial. We are

not  concerned  with  what  happens  to  the  Prime

Minister  of  Singapore  on  merger.  We  are   not

concerned  with what happens to the Prime  Minister

in   a  situation  where  there  is  constitutional

advancement.  Sir, we are concerned with  the  fact

that  if  you  talk of constitutional  advancement,

then the people's views must be fairly assessed. It

is  important  that you talk of the desire  of  the

people   when   you  negotiate  for  constitutional

advancement.  It is useless for the Prime  Minister

to  say that he had negotiated these terms, come to

this  Assembly, and put them forward  saying,  "You

agree or you do not agree - these are the terms."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the principle of having an All-Party meeting

and having a common decision before negotiating for

constitutional  advancement  does  not  imply  that

Government  negotiates,  arrives  at  a  settlement

first and then tries to push it down the throats of

the  people  of  Singapore. I am  sure  the  P.A.P.

Government  will  admit that in spite  of  all  the

failings  of  the previous Government - a  Government

which I consider to have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



more  reactionary  than  the  P.A.P.  Government - at

least  it  had  the courtesy to call  an  All-Party

meeting;  at least it had the courtesy to  take  an

All-Party  team  to  London  to  negotiate  for   a

constitutional arrangement. The simple point is  if

we  are  talking  of merger or any  other  form  of

constitutional change, we must bear in mind that it

is bound to affect the lives of all the people. And

in  a  democratic  society with  various  political

groups  operating, it is not the  monopoly  of  the

P.A.P. to go and negotiate on its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we regard merger as a national issue and we

would like to see the Government treating it  as  a

national  issue. I say that we want  to  be  merged

with  the  Federation of Malaya and  not  submerged

into the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have said in the motion here that if

there  should  be  no agreement  in  the  All-Party

meeting   on   all  points  of  the  constitutional

arrangement, then the Government should seek a  new

mandate.  Sir,  I  wish  to explain  here  that  we

pressed  for  elections before. We still  tell  the

Government   that   if  they  cannot   fulfil   the

aspirations  of the people, then they  should  quit

and resign.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You resign first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But we do not want people like the

Prime  Minister to say all sorts of things and  get

away  with  them. Sir, we would like to  say  quite

categorically that we told the Government to resign

not  because we want power, not because we want  to

be   Ministers,   Prime  Minister,   Deputy   Prime

Minister,  etc.  Sir,  so long  as  any  government

represents  the views of the people,  we  lend  our

support   to  it.  We  are  satisfied   that   this

Government does not any longer represent the  views

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the excuse that the P.A.P. gave for not

wanting to hold elections to determine this  merger

issue  was that, according to them, there would  be

too  many candidates and too many symbols  and  the

people  would  be  confused.  This  is  an  utterly

ridiculous excuse, because if you follow that, then

it  must  logically  mean that in  1959,  when  the

P.A.P. stood  for election, the people  were  also

confused because there were also too



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



many  candidates and too many symbols. It is a lame

excuse  that the P.A.P. is putting forward  to  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were disturbed to note that even the

Referendum  Bill has now been deferred.  I  do  not

know  but there is a rumour in town that the  P.AP.

is  quite fearful of holding a referendum now.  But

we  tell them this quite clearly, that it is better

for them to consult the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has said very clearly

today -  this was the only part of his speech that  I

thought  was  relevant to the debate; in  the  past

whenever  we said that the Government was preparing

for repressive action, whenever we said they wanted

to  take  anti-democratic repressive action against

their  political  opponents, he said  that  it  was

Communist  propaganda   - coming  from  the   horse's

mouth,  that so many things are going to happen  in

1962. He said, not merger but "so many other things

are going to happen in 1962." I think it is correct

to   say   that   everybody  has   a   very   clear

understanding  of exactly what the  Prime  Minister

has  said. Sir, I do not know the purpose of  that.

All  that  he  means is that in  1962  perhaps  the

Barisan  Sosialis may not exist. All that he  means

is  that  maybe  some of us will  disappear,  maybe

taken   away  as  the  guests  of  honour  of   the

Government -   maybe Changi Gaol, Batu Gajah;  we  do

not  know where. But as I was saying, Sir, I do not

know  the  purpose of the Prime Minister by  saying

it.  But  if  he  thinks  that  he  is  trying   to

intimidate  us, then I say that he is  wasting  his

breath and his time, because people like us are not

easily  intimidated by repressive talk.  The  Prime

Minister ought to know it, Sir. He was at one  time

fighting  a very repressive Government.  I  do  not

know  what  private arrangement  he  had  with  the

former  Chief  Minister but, nevertheless,  on  the

open   front   he  was  fighting  tl1e   repressive

Government.  He knows that all this talk  does  not

frighten people. All that I want to tell the  Prime

Minister  - he is not here but the Deputy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister is here - is that as people who  have

for  some  time  worked in muss organisations  they

ought  to  realise  that the more  repressive  they

become  the more they "anchor" the people.  You  do

not  frighten  and muzzle the people  into  bending

down  because  you talk of guns  and  gaols  in  an

intimidatory tone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no doubts whatsoever in our minds.

The  Tunku  has  said - I do not have the  newspapers

with  me-in the Federal Parliament, "Singapore  has

more  strikes  in one month than the Federation  of

Malaya  has  in  three  years.  We  want  to   help

Singapore to reduce the number of strikes. I do not

know how to do it. But my Minister for the Interior

says  that he knows how to do it." It is  all  very

clear. But what is important here is this. All that

the  Prime  Minister has said has merely  confirmed

what  we  have  been  saying.  Because  the  P.A.P.

leadership today finds itself isolated, it does not

have  `the  guts, like the previous  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government had, to take direct action by itself. It

wants  to  work  out  a constitutional  arrangement

whereby someone else will do its dirty job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is no use for the P.A.P. to talk of being

a socialist Party, anti-colonial, nationalist, etc.

It  is  very  simple. In this talk  of  merger  and

Malaysia, the P.A.P. has proved by its own  actions

very clearly that it is isolated from all socialist

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has not worked and seen eye to

eye  with the Socialist Front in the Federation  of

Malaya. It has not worked and seen eye to eye  with

the  Party  Ra'ayat in Brunei. It is the same  with

the  Sarawak United People's Party. Sir,  the  line

can  be easily seen today. The P.A.P. stands on one

side  today  with the S.P.A., the British  and  the

Alliance Government of the Federation of Malaya. On

the other side, you see the socialist Parties. I am

sure, Sir, you will not allow me to expound on  the

theory  the  Prime Minister was trying to  develop,

that  the P.A.P. are nationalist and that all those

who  disagree with them are necessarily Communists.

But  I tell them this, Sir, if they want to measure

the  extent  of  nationalist feelings  amongst  the

people,  let them not use their type of  merger  as

the yardstick because that is not the yardstick.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to say very much in conclusion

except  that  I had the impression that  the  Prime

Minister - Sir, right now, I do not know whether  you

believe in magic but I -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> The Minister for

Culture is one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes, but far from being a magician, all

that  the  Prime Minister is trying  to  do  is  to

juggle with words. The latest jugglery is by  using

words  like "merger", "Malaysia", "Communist",  and

"nationalist".   Sir,  as  far  as   Singapore   is

concerned,  I  do  not know why  the  Minister  for

Culture was talking just now about what happened in

Kuching. For a moment I was wondering whether  this

was  a  debate  on the Malaysia motion  or  on  the

motion moved by the Member for Queenstown. I do not

want  to  reply in detail to what the Minister  for

Culture  said on Malaysia. But all that I  want  to

say  is  that  insofar as Singapore  is  concerned,

Malaysia  and  merger mean one and the  same  thing

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- i.e. P.A.P. type of phoney merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are nearing tea-time and

probably I will be saved the trouble of standing up

to  over-rule the word "phoney" in connection  with

this merger debate. That word must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I withdraw the word. Nevertheless, the

point is that merger and Malaysia to the people  of

Singapore   mean   the  same  thing - the   sort   of

arrangement that they have come to and  the  people

know what it is.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is time to suspend. I will take

the Chair again at half-past five.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>5.00 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, merger is the natural

and  simplest  form  for our  political  evolution.

Today the issue of merger is tied up with the issue

of Malaysia, a very worthwhile concept not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



only  for  us and for the Federation, but also  for

the  neighbouring territories in Borneo.  In  these

circumstances, the issue of merger takes on  a  far

wider  meaning and graver importance than even  our

own political needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore rejects a referendum on the P.A.P.

proposals,  then not only will there be  no  merger

between  Singapore  and the Federation,  but  there

will  be no Malaysia at all, for Singapore  is  the

pivot  and  the  cornerstone of  Malaysia.  Let  us

recognise  its  importance in this context  and  in

this  concept. There is reason to believe  that  an

honest   referendum  put  to   the   people   would

uncompromisingly result in a rejection of the White

Paper proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has bungled the negotiations with

the  Federation Government and the presentation  of

the  proposals to the people and to this  Assembly.

It  is remarkable, Mr Speaker, that in a matter of

such  grave national moment affecting not only  the

people   of  Singapore  of  today  but  all  future

generations, this Government should act  as  though

Singapore  was  its  property and  its  people  the

slaves of the Prime Minister, to be disposed of  at

his  pleasure and according to his own  concept  of

what  is  good for us. Singapore is not a  personal

fief  of the Prime Minister and, Mr Speaker,  even

if he were a popular Prime Minister and even if the

P.A.P. had  the  respect  and  confidence  of  the

people,  it  would  be wrong not to  associate  the

Opposition  in an issue of such ultimate importance

to  the whole people. Democracy does not mean  that

the  majority  should steamroller the minority  and

impose  its will on it. Though this may not be  the

language    of    `the   Minister   for    Culture,

nevertheless, Mr Speaker, the essence of democracy

is that it must respect and take into consideration

minority  views and interests. It is not  democracy

but  Fascism  when it seeks to steamroller  through

major  issues without reference to or  respect  for

these  minority views and interests. But  far  from

being a popular leader, and the Government far from

having  the confidence of the people, they must  be

conscious that today they are viewed with more than

suspicion and anger, even reaching to contempt,  by

the vast



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



majority of our people. I had hard words to say  of

the  Member  for  Cairnhill when lie  hung  on  to

power. I cannot understand the present Front  Bench

being  able  to support the burden of this  massive

contempt and yet clinging on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the people are conscious that the Prime Minister and his Party are politically bankrupt. The people know that the Prime Minister and his Party know that they would never survive another election. In this context, Mr Speaker, for the Prime Minister to seek to negotiate off his own bat the future of this island is legitimately

viewed  with grave suspicion. I ask him to look  at

the  way  he has presented these proposals  to  the

people.  I  say that it is impossible  to  contrive

anything  more  tortuous - even  the  genius  of  the

Minister  for  Culture for the tortuous  could  not

conceive  anything more messy than the  strip-tease

method  of  revelation, bit by bit,  of  issues  so

vital  to  our future. The letters from the  Deputy

Prime  Minister purported to seek the  co-operation

of  the  Opposition,  but were blatantly  used  for

propaganda purposes, particularly the second letter

wherein  it informed the people that we would  have

equal  status, privileges and powers as  all  other

States  in  the  Federation with  more  portfolios,

concealing  consciously the vital aspect  that  not

one  of  us  would be a citizen of the  Federation.

That  is  not  clever, Mr Speaker, I have  another

word  for it and I have used it in public, inviting

the Deputy Prime Minister to sue me. He has not.  I

say  it is not clever and it is not even necessary.

Maneuvers and tactics of so cheap a character based

on  the  theory that the people are blind  chickens

are not decent and are not necessary in the context

of  these proposals. Finally, Sir, the tactics that

were  indulged in which so messed up  these  merger

proposals  when finally they conceded  our  request

for  a  sitting of this Assembly. You will remember

what transpired. You will remember the use of their

powers under the Standing Orders to manipulate  the

time  during  which the items could be debated  and

the interventions in the debate. According to their

likes, Mr Speaker, that was clever propaganda. But

to  my  mind,  if there had been an  honest  and  a

simpler



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



approach to a difficult but honest problem, instead

of this messy approach, we might well have obtained

the  sympathy of the waverers instead  of,  through

this  approach, having made waverers of  those  who

were believers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems pathologically impossible for the

Prime  Minister to understand simplicity or to  act

with  simplicity. I am almost convinced that  every

ruler  on  his  desk  must  have  the  shape  of  a

corkscrew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Mr Speaker, we have reached a point

where  there  is  a  real danger  that  the  entire

concept  of  Malaysia will be nullified because  of

the  tortuous  approach of  this  Government  to  a

simple  issue. But it is so important and so  vital

to  our  welfare that I think it would be wrong  to

give up hope. I think it would be wrong not to  try

and keep on trying. And I say it is not too late to

salvage this concept and the spirit of this  motion

which  seeks  an  All-Party team and  provides  the

means of salvaging the concept of Malaysia from the

rubbish  heap of lost ideals. We of the  Opposition

are  aware that the Government are of the view that

only their Prime Minister is capable of intelligent

political thinking, clever thinking, and that we of

the   Opposition   have  nothing   to   contribute.

Nevertheless, I ask them to recognise  that  it  is

important  that  the Opposition,  even  though  the

Government  think us stupid, should  be  associated

with  these  negotiations in order that the  people

should  be  satisfied that these  negotiations  are

honest  and not negotiations intended to  rescue  a

bankrupt crew. If Opposition Members are associated

with  the  negotiations, they  can  both  test  the

strength of the feelings in the Federation,  and  I

am convinced that many in this House are not really

conscious  of the strong feelings in the Federation

in  respect of some of the matters that are raised.

Perhaps  if  they  knew of the  strength  of  those

feelings,  they  themselves would  temper  to  some

extent  their  own  demands. I am  in  the  curious

position  of  not belonging to either  of  the  two

major races. I can see and I do sympathise with the

approach  of  each of them. I can understand  their

point  of  view.  I can recognise the  validity  of

their fears on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



each  side,  even though I may disagree,  as  I  do

disagree,  with the approach, at times intransigent

of  both  sides.  But I say that if the  Opposition

Members   are  associated  in  a  team  honest   in

negotiating the merger proposals, we may `be  in  a

position  to be of assistance, because, let  it  be

recognised  that  the  White Paper  is  not  beyond

amendment. Nobody has suggested that - not  even  the

Prime Minister. It may be that we may be able to be

of  assistance, when coming back, to  explain  both

the  difficulties that are to be met on  the  other

side  and the intensity of the earnest efforts that

are  being  made  by  our side to  explain  to  the

electorate and to satisfy them that this is  not  a

shameless   effort   at  personal   rescue   of   a

discredited political party and an egomaniac leader

but  an  honest effort at reunification  with  many

disadvantages. I think it is not unfair to ask  the

Government  Benches at least to pay lip service  to

the    possibility   that   the   Opposition   have

constructive ideas. I ask them to cast their  minds

back to other constitutional conferences from which

they  were  not shut out, and let them  admit  that

persons   now  in  the  Opposition  did  contribute

constructively  and  perhaps at  times  in  greater

measure  than their super-duper leader,  the  Prime

Minister. Whatever our disagreements, Mr  Speaker,

we  of  the  Opposition say to the Government  that

however  strongly we resent individually the  cheap

insults that stem from the fountain-head of  P.A.P.

culture,  let us recognise that there is  sincerity

on our part in seeking the welfare of Singapore and

its  people,  and  that we can meet  in  the  quiet

committee rooms in the interchange of ideas so that

we  may  perhaps  better  appreciate  each  other's

sincerity.  I would like to believe that  there  is

sincerity  and  not merely empty  sounds  from  the

Government  Benches. I say that it  could  be  very

valuable and it could do no harm to have this  All-Party team.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you know as well as I do that constitutionally even a majority of one is adequate for the P.A.P. to go it alone. Of course, they have the power to hand over Singapore to the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



even  without  a referendum and without  consulting

the people. They have broken promises before and  I

myself -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of correction.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have no doubt that if it means

their  survival they will make promises again.  But

if  they  do this, then I say to you that  this  is

immoral,  more immoral than anything  I  know  this

side of Hitler. With a foundation of this character

there  could be no hope of a happy Malaysia.  As  a

Member of the Opposition and as a representative of

the  people   - one  of  the  51 - I  demand  that  the

Government should recognise the rights of those who

have  no  faith in the P.A.P., but who nevertheless

are  honest  and decent citizens of this territory,

and  who are entitled to have their representatives

made   fully  aware  of  and  assist  in   national

negotiations  with  the Federation  so  that  they

should  know the truth, so that they would be  able

to come back and fully advise the electorate, apart

from  assisting  in  every way they  could  in  the

achievement  of  a  common  objective.  The   basic

fallacy of the thesis of the Prime Minister and his

Minister  for  Culture is, as pointed  out  by  the

Member for Thomson, to equate merger with the White

Paper proposals. Merger has always been understood.

Of  course, we all have a mandate for merger, which

is a complete reunification of our two territories.

But  there is no question but that they never  have

or ever had any mandate for this type of absurdity.

Mr  Speaker, an All-Party team is constitutionally

necessary.  It  is  the  main  avenue  to  dissolve

suspicion and antagonism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Law has asked whether I do

not   any   longer  believe  in  independence   for

Singapore.  You know. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it  is  at

times  agonising to seek to get an idea  through  a

marble  skull. I do not know the material of  which

the upper part of the Minister for Law is made, but

I have said in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



House  repeatedly  and  I should  have  thought  it

rather boring to have repeated once more the  basic

platform  of  our  Party, the very  first  and  the

unchanging, that unless -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of information, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Absolute coward!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Now the Minister is

completely   unparliamentary.  The  word   "coward"

should  never be used of a Member of this Assembly.

Will he please withdraw?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I withdraw, but I am not afraid -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister must not

disregard the authority of the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I was going to say

that  the basic platform and the unchanging one  of

our  Party is that we should have merger  with  the

Federation,  and if that is not possible,  then  we

should  have independence, complete and unqualified

independence. I repeat in this House that it is  my

genuine  view  that the shortest  cut  to  complete

merger is through independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on a point of explanation to this House, in respect of the procedure of giving way on a request for information, I trust - I may be wrong - that I have at all times extended equal courtesy to that which I have received. But you yourself were the witness yesterday, when I did give way, out of courtesy, to the Minister for Law,

of the manner in which that courtesy was repaid.  I

think  you  can  understand  the  reasons  for   my

rejecting his request.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not intend

to be frivolous or personal on this debate. I would

like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



confine myself to one simple point, and that is the

call for an All-Party conference made by the Member

for  Queenstown.  In  opening the  motion,  he  has

quoted  letters  which I wrote to him  and  he  has

concluded that I was never sincere in obtaining his

ideas  on  what merger should be. Let me  say  this

right  from the beginning. It is because  I  really

believed  that  all  Members in this  Assembly  can

contribute  their own ideas to the problem  that  I

entered   into  correspondence  with   leaders   of

political  Parties  represented in  this  Assembly.

Assuming  that  I  treat  the  whole  lot  on   the

Opposition  side  as nincompoops, as  people  whose

opinions are not worthy of consideration,  I  would

not have written to them at all. In all my letters -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That was for the Press.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> In all my letters, I have been

very  simple  and polite. In return I get  insults.

Perhaps if I may quote the Member for Anson, it  is

more than a passing insult - hysteria and ravings  of

what   you  would  expect  only  from  people  with

hallucinations. I entered into correspondence  with

leaders  of the Opposition Parties on 26th  August.

It  was a very short and simple letter. All that  I

asked them was this:

<pre>

            `Dear Mr Marshall,

             Dear Dr Lee,

             Dear Mr Ong,

             Dear Tun Lim'.

</pre>





<br><br>I will quote only just the relevant parts:



<pre>

     'I  enclose a copy of the joint statement made

on Wednesday,   23rd   August,  1961,  between

the Federation Prime Minister and the Prime Minister

of Singapore.



     Before the Working Party begins to delve into the

details, I shall be glad if you will be so kind as

to advise me whether on principle you agree to

these two basic points:



     (a) That defence, external affairs and security

             should be with the Federation, and



     (b) That there be local autonomy for Singapore in

             education and labour.



When I have received all the replies  showing  agreement

on  these  two   basic points,  I  hope  to invite all

parties  to  submit their views on other matters so that

the Government will have the advantage of the views of

all parties represented in the Assembly in order to assist

and guide it in its deliberations.'

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



Sir, this is a very polite and courteous letter. On

1st  September, I received a reply from the  Member

for  Queenstown.  I  will quote only  the  relevant

parts:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I attach for your benefit a copy of the statement

issued to the Press clearly outlining the stand  of

the Barisan Sosialis on our constitutional future.'



<br><br>And  in the enclosed statement which he had already

issued to the Press, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way ahead for real reunification for our

country  and  our people is one of two  directions:

(a)  an  immediate, full and complete  merger  with

Singapore  joining the Federation as a  constituent

state  like Penang or Malacca; (b) as an autonomous

unit   within  a  confederation  with  the   Borneo

territories coming in when possible.'



<br><br>Continuing from his letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You now ask for our views on your proposals. But

how  is  the  Government going to  accommodate  our

views  when they are fundamentally opposed  to  the

Government's proposals, or are you just  trying  to

give  the impression to the public that we are  all

being consulted on the matter.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consultation with the Barisan Sosialis means

accepting their demands. Two parties can come to  a

meeting  and either they come with fixed  views  or

they  come with an open mind that if they come they

have  to  agree or they come to disagree. Here  the

Barisan Sosialis have stated in writing that  their

views are fundamentally opposed to the Government's

proposals.   Therefore,  how  can   the   Singapore

Government accommodate their views? In other words,

there  was  no  sincerity at all when  the  Barisan

Sosialis  said they wanted an All-Party conference.

Sir,   we   are  not  prepared  to  be   like   the

Disarmament  Conference in Geneva  which  has  been

sitting for the last couple of years and has  never

come  to any conclusion. Tons of paper have  passed

through  that Disarmament Conference and no  result

has  been achieved. And the reason is simple.  When

you have two diametrically opposed views present at

the  conference table, then it is difficult, if not

impossible, to arrive at any firm conclusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear too, Mr Speaker, that the

differences of opinion between the P.A.P. and  the

Barisan  Sosialis did not originate on the  1st  of

September, when the Member for Queenstown  sent  me

his letter together with a statement outlining



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



the  aims of his Party. It originated much  earlier

before  the 13 Assemblymen broke away from  us.  On

3rd  June  a  statement was  issued  by  six  trade

unionists, one of whom is now the Secretary-General

of  the  Barisan Sosialis, who stated quite clearly

that   they   wanted  an  internal   self-governing

Singapore  without the Security Council,  but  that

they   were  prepared  to  leave  foreign  affairs,

defence  and  the base in the hands of  the  United

Kingdom. Did those six trade unionists ever consult

us?   Did  they  consult  any  of  the  13  Barisan

Assemblymen  who are sitting on the opposite  side?

Did  they  consult  the people?  Did  they  have  a

mandate  from  the  people when  they  issued  that

statement?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Now, they come here to this

Chamber  and  move a motion demanding consultation.

Consultation to them means accepting their demands.

That  is  the  meaning  of  "consultation"  in  the

Barisan vocabulary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let other 12 members (excluding the Member

for  Thomson  who was a party to that statement  on

3rd  June) ask themselves: were they consulted when

those  six  trade unionists asked for  an  internal

self-governing Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not possible to understand the minds,

the  twists and turns of the Barisan Sosialis  when

on  3rd  June they put out a statement  asking  for

internal  self-government for Singapore,  but  that

foreign affairs and defence be left in the hands of

the  United  Kingdom; and on the 1st of  September,

the  Chairman  of the Barisan Sosialis  sent  me  a

statement  outlining a completely different  stand.

Can  a  conference between us and the Barisan,  or,

for  that matter, can a conference between  us  and

the  five other Opposition Parties come to a common

agreement?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, it has been very clear

from   my  correspondence  with  Opposition   Party

leaders that at no time at all did they ever  state

clearly  or  give me a courteous reply to  tell  me

what their points of view were. Instead. I had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



only  a  tirade from them, in particular  from  the

Member for Anson. The difficulty of my relationship

with  the  Member for Anson is that  in  his  saner

moments I am quite prepared to listen to him,  but,

unfortunately, his periods of sanity are punctuated

with hysteria and I just -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir, which must

be obvious to you. I shall as of now take objection

to  every  abusive phrase and I am taking objection

now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Standing Order is that it will

be  out  of  order to use offensive  and  insulting

language about Members of the Assembly. If a Member

gets  up  and  says  that he is being  offended  or

insulted by any language used, then, of course,  it

conies  within  the ambit of that  Standing  Order.

Therefore,  the  allegation  that  the  Member  for

Anson's sanity is also mixed with hysteria has been

taken  as  being offensive by the Member for  Anson

and  must be withdrawn. But, I must add that  there

have  been  perhaps expressions used by the  Member

for  Anson  which might have been equally Offensive

and insulting to other Members of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> As I say, Mr Speaker -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Leader of the House

withdraw?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I withdraw, Sir,I will

however add that if I am prepared to take,  then  I

must  also be prepared to give. But the Member  for

Anson  is  a man who is prepared to give,  but  not

prepared to take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He has always lacked courage, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

in respect of the Minister for Law's interruption - a

provocative interruption  - which, if he  would  like

to repeat it outside, I can deal with. But I cannot

deal  with it here and I ask you to deal  with  it,

Mr  Speaker, alleging lack of physical courage  on

my  part,  which none of the Front Bench  has  ever

displayed. Physical courage is completely -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Did the Minister for Law

repeat the word "coward"? I never heard it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister for Law

repeated  the  word "coward", then  he  is  out  of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the word?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It was a matter of lack of courage.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Lack of courage, I suppose, is not as

offensive  as  coward. I do not think the  Minister

should be asked to withdraw that expression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Minister for Law like to repeat that outside? I can

then deal with it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Now I think the Member for

Anson   is  coming  very  close  to  a  breach   of

privilege,  intimidating a Member  of  this  House.

Therefore,  I think we had better slide  over  that

incident for the time being.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He was a coward.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister for Law must take

notice of the indication of the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Again on the 6th of September,

1960,  I  wrote to leaders of the political Parties

on  the  Opposition side, and I  will  quote  again

relevant  passages - very  courteous.  I  raised  two

points which I sought explicit clarification of the

stand of each political Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1. Do you agree that in the merger arrangements,

defence,  external affairs and security come  under

the  control  of  the Central Government,  a  point

considered basic by the Federation Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Singapore should retain autonomy in education

and  labour,  a point considered essential  by  the

Singapore Government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In none of the replies was there any answer to

these  two points. All Parties chose to evade these

two points.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker. Would

he read the Workers' Party reply because -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

because  that  is  an  allegation  which   is   not

substantiated. He has got the reply of the Workers'

Party. Would he read it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is not a point of order.

I  am  just quoting a letter which I wrote to  him.

That is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the point is that the

Member for Anson seized on the phrase "that none of

the  Opposition  Parties made a reply  to  the  two

points  raised", and the Member for Anson considers

that the Workers' Party did, in fact, make a reply.

That is the point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What I am reading is a letter

which  I wrote to the leader of the Workers' Party - a verbatim quotation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Deputy Prime

Minister has forgotten that he went on. He went  on

and  said, "None of the Opposition Parties  gave  a

straightforward reply." That is the phrase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I misunderstood, Sir, I think

the leader of the Workers' Party should listen more

carefully.  I  did not say that the leader  of  the

Workers' Party never replied. I said in none of the

replies  was there any answer to these two  points.

The respective stands of the four political Parties

in the Assembly are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Barisan Sosialis stands for complete

merger  as  a twelfth State on the basis of  Penang

and  Malacca.  Its  second  preference  is  for   a

confederation between Singapore and the  Federation

and  the  three Borneo territories in which defence

and external affairs, excluding security, go to the

Central Government. Security is to remain a subject

for local autonomy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Alliance of S.P.A.-U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.-M.I.C. gives no answer but raises a query

as  to  whether the arrangements amount to a merger

or a confederation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The United People's Party stands for complete

merger as a State in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Worker's Party wholeheartedly believes in

merger    with   the   Federation   and   considers

confederation a very valuable concept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is what we replied.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes. That was your stand. That

was your reply. Is it correct?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Deputy Prime Minister is

getting  perhaps a little heated. He is  addressing

the Chair and not the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am sorry, Sir,I am so used

to lecturing [Laughter] that I forgot -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Where? Classroom?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - where I am. [Interruption]

And I concluded -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the Member for

Anson  does  not interject, we could  get  on  much

quicker with this debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And I concluded again very

politely:



<pre>

            `I shall  be  obliged if you will give  me  direct

          answers to the two points I have raised in my  last

          letter:   whether  you  agree  that  (1)   Defence,

          external  affairs  and  security  come  under   the

          control  of  the Central Government. (2)  Education

          and labour come under Singapore local autonomy?



            Further, can you clarify -



             (a) Does your Party stand for complete merger?



             (b) If  so,  will you state categorically  that

          your Party understands  that  this  means education

          and labour  are  under  the  control of the Central

          Government?



             (c) If you do not stand for complete merger, do

          you  agree  that  there should be  merger, but with

          local  autonomy  in  Singapore  in   education  and

          labour?



                                           Yours sincerely,'

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6th October, instead of receiving an answer to

my  very  polite letter, I received a  joint  reply

signed  by Dr Lee Siew Choh, Mr Ong Eng Guan  and Mr David Marshall

in which they said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We call on the Government to convene forthwith a

meeting of the Legislative Assembly to consider and

debate the basic principles and to appoint an  All-Party Conference.'



<br><br>Sir,  the  request -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of

order, Sir. A misquotation is a point of order, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,It  is not true  that  he  did  not

receive  a reply and it is not true that  that  was

the reply. He has a reply - a telegram from me - in his

files.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Oh yes, I must apologise to

the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A very long telegram.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I must say this. If I

have  made  a  mistake,  I am  generous  enough  to

acknowledge it and rectify it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But I am not in this sense

like  the Member for Anson. Does he want me to read

the  telegram which he sent to me? I will  read  it

for him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Deputy Prime

Minister   could   give  us  the  salient   points.

Otherwise -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am quite satisfied, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will give you the salient

points. I wrote a very polite and courteous  letter

to  all Members of the Assembly to which I received

a telegram -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> From where?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - from Sydney, New South Wales.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It cost $300.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> How much - $300? This is the

sort of reply I got from the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Keep it salient.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> All right, I will keep it

salient:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am deeply stirred by your statements that the

arrangements  between Singapore and the  Federation

are  those  of merger as a State in the  Federation

and  that the only difference between Singapore and

any  one  of the other States in the Federation  is

that  there  will  be  more powers reserved  to  the

Singapore  State  Government. If this  is  true  my

Party and I despite the past will support you  with

all our heart and energy in sincerity and humanity.

If this is lying party political propaganda we will

fight you and damn you even from prison.'.



<br><br>As I told the Assembly at the last sitting, when he

sent me this telegram, he was not in prison but  on

a honeymoon [Interruption]. It reads on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Reply your specific questions my Party stands for

complete merger with the Federation.'



<br><br>Then he ended up with:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore should not seek special privileges

which   would   set  us  apart  from   our   fellow

citizens...'.



<br><br>As  I  told the House in November, it is easier  to

follow Alice in Wonderland than the March Hare, but

I must now add the Mad Hatter too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, this call for a debate in the Assembly

on  the basic principles of merger was heeded.  The

Assembly  was  reconvened. A debate  on  the  White

Paper  was  held  in  November  and  it  lasted   a

considerable amount of time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



It  took  us  12 days to arrive at some conclusion.

Where  then  is  the complaint that the  Opposition

political Parties have not been consulted  or  that

they  have  not been given a chance  to  air  their

views?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> From July to November.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Beginning from 26th August,

when I first wrote to them, up to November, when we

had   the   debate  on  merger,  there  was   ample

opportunity given to them to express their views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister has said just now, it is

important that if an All-Party Conference is to  be

convened,  then  it  is  important  too  that  some

concensus of opinion should be arrived at.  But  as

we have seen from the correspondence and the debate

itself,  no possibility exists that five  political

Parties  in  this Assembly can come to  one  common

agreement. In fact, the debate in the Assembly last

November  highlighted considerable  differences  of

opinion  among  us. The Members of  the  Opposition

referred  to the ex-Chief Minister -  the Member  for

Cairnhill - who  did  call for an  All-Party  meeting

before  he  proceeded to the second  constitutional

talks.  That is quite correct. But when we were  in

the  Opposition  at that time, we  never  came  out

publicly   with  our  own  stand   of   what   that

constitutional conference should arrive at. We  had

the  decency  to answer his call and  to  meet  him

privately in his office. I was a Member of that All-Party  team and I issued no statements on what  the

P.A.P. would   ask  for  at  that  constitutional

conference because that would have jeopardised  the

All-Party Conference. We adopted the same stand  at

the  first All-Party Conference led by the ex-Chief

Minister, the Member for Anson. Perhaps he acted in

good  heart, but what were the results of that All-Party  Conference which was led by the  Member  for

Anson? The team went to London in 1956. They fought

and  squabbled  with each other in  London  and  it

ended   up  with  the  isolation  of  the  ex-Chief

Minister, the Member for Anson. Finally, the  talks

collapsed because he wanted his way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



and  the other political Party leaders wanted their

own   way.   The   result  was   that   the   first

constitutional  conference led by  the  Member  for

Anson  was a miserable failure. It is vivid  in  my

memory from the reading of the papers and from  the

accounts that that first constitutional conference,

led  by the Member for Anson, ended up with the ex-Chief Minister going to an opera together with -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not suppose the Deputy

Prime  Minister  will allege that  that  is  public

conduct.  That,  to  my mind, is  personal  conduct

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- going to an opera.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> If I say he wore a carnation,

would  that  be his private conduct or  his  public

conduct?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Deputy Prune Minister must learn

to  behave himself. He is now endeavouring to  slip

in  something which he knows to be out of order  by

way of a question which is completely wrong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am just speaking about what

was public knowledge. The Member for Cairnhill will

bear me out. Will the Member for Cairnhill bear  me

out?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please address the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Very well, Sir, the thesis

which I put forward is simple, and that is an  All-Party  Conference  can only be  useful  if  certain

conditions  are first obtained. One  of  the  first

conditions  is  that  no  Party  should  adopt   an

inflexible  attitude  before  the  conference.  The

second  condition is that when you  arrive  at  the

conference, you arrive with sincerity that you will

come  to an agreement, and not to come to disagree.

As  the  Member for Queenstown has asked, "How  can

the  Government accommodate our views when you well

know  what  the stand of the Barisan Sosialis  is?"

Will such an All-Party Conference be useful?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to reply to the Member for Anson.

He  made  a  reference to the postponement  of  the

Second Reading of the Referendum Bill to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



March.  He said that we were avoiding a referendum.

I  say that he is telling here a bare falsehood. We

never  said that we were avoiding a referendum  and

that is why when the Member for Anson -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. In the face of

this  Assembly,  he  is  himself  indulging  in   a

falsehood.  What  I  said  was  that  there  was  a

possibility  that  the  P.A.P. would  dishonour  a

promise  in  holding  a  referendum.  If  you  will

remember, Mr Speaker, it is on the record.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order.

It is a matter of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And that is what I say, that

he  is  telling a falsehood. It is a falsehood.  We

said that the Second Reading of the Referendum Bill

would  come after March and that there would  be  a

referendum.  Is  he  a crystal-gazer  or  is  he  a

prophet? Sir, I have heard of many prophets in  the

Bible, but I know that David is no prophet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say that the motion moved by

the  Member for Queenstown asking for an  All-Party

Conference only expresses their insincerity  simply

because  they  never  wanted any  agreement  to  be

arrived  at  even  if an All-Party Conference  were

called.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, you will notice from what

I  said  that  I  moved this motion  on  a  factual

approach. I never went into frivolities and I never

smeared  or  ridiculed. The whole speech  was  made

from the point of view of an All-Party matter. If I

had  wanted to bring in the letters that the Deputy

Prime  Minister sent to me and the letters that  we

sent  back to him, I would have taken a much longer

time.  But  since he has mentioned  some  of  those

letters, Sir, I think it is only fair that  I  also

must  mention  them. In fact, of all  the  speeches

from  the  Government Benches, the only person  who

argued  against the points which I raised  was  the

Deputy Prime Minister. He was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



trying  to  say that he was sincere and that  there

was   no   cause   for  asking  for  an   All-Party

Conference. He mentioned quite a number of letters,

Sir,I will answer him first. If you will remember

even  in the speech I made, I had already mentioned

that the Deputy Prime Minister had sent letters  to

leaders  of the Opposition Parties only  after  the

principle  had already been agreed to  between  the

two  Prime  Ministers. Now if  there  is  any  real

intention  to  consult anybody,  you  do  not  send

letters  to ask for details. First of all, you  ask

for principles to be agreed to before you ever come

to  the  details. In this particular case  the  two

Prime Ministers had already agreed to the two major

principles  when  they  issued  their  first  joint

statement.  The first joint statement came  out  on

23rd August. The Deputy Prime Minister, then Acting

Prime Minister, sent us a letter on the 26th, three

days later. As I have said, it was an afterthought,

just  to guard themselves against anything that  we

might  say against them, and to give the idea  that

they  did really consult the people. Where  is  the

sincerity of consultation'? They never asked us for

our views. So how could we give them our views?  If

the Deputy Prime Minister says that he is going  to

take  note  of  all  the  views  published  in  the

newspapers,  then  I  say he  should  not  even  be

sitting in this Assembly here today. Because if  he

had taken cognisance of the views expressed outside

this  Assembly  and unofficially published  in  the

newspapers, he would not have the face to come  and

tell us that he is still sincere or that the P.A.P.

today has the support of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in all the P.A.P. attacks so far, the Deputy

Prime  Minister when he talked about what we  wrote

to  him as regards the constitutional future, again

tried to link it up with what we said about Malacca

and  Penang. Sir, let me clarify this here in  this

House.  We  could well have said, "like  Johore  or

Trengganu, or any other State". The only  reference

which we made to Penang and Malacca was that Penang

and  Malacca were colonies before. That  was  about

all, on general principles. But we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



made  sure  there  was no misunderstanding  of  our

stand   when   we  also  said  in  the   succeeding

paragraphs   that   we  wanted  automatic   Federal

citizenship.  That  was in the same  statement  and

appeared just one or two paragraphs below the  main

heading.  But  the  P.A.P. has  been  mischievously

singling out just one portion of our statement  and

now tries to attack us on that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

What  about the radio forum? You did not understand

that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister also

said  that we did not reply to him. I did not raise

any  objection when he said all this, because I can

easily  prove that when I in fact wrote to him,  he

never even bothered to reply. When the Deputy Prime

Minister  wrote  to me on 6th September,  we  wrote

back  to him on the 11th and asked him a number  of

questions.  To this day, Sir, that letter  has  not

been  replied to. We do not want to press  him  any

further  because we know he does not want to  reply

to  those  questions, as they are all  embarrassing

questions. He would rather the people did not  know

the P.A.P. attitude in regard to those questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, in all the speeches of the

Government  Benches  there was no  actual  argument

against   what   I   have  said  as   regards   the

desirability of an All-Party conference.  Even  the

Minister for Culture adopted the attitude that they

would consult the people only in their own way.  He

also talked of terms which "we think are bad".  All

these  words smack too much of the ego,  smack  too

much  of arrogant people who think they can  decide

the  future for all the people of Singapore. I have

already made reference to this in my speech, namely

that  the  P.A.P.'s great fault is that they  think

they are the only people who know what is best  for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the other arguments have already been

answered  by my colleague, the Member for  Thomson.

But  great play has been made of the pledge we gave

to the P.A.P. That was the same pledge given by the

Member for Hong Lim, and we know what happened. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



do not have to answer to the P.A.P. That pledge was

given  to  the people and if at any time the  Prime

Minister,  or,  for that matter, the  Minister  for

Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister, wish  to  go

back  to  the country and prove to the people  that

they  have  their  trust  and  confidence   - Tanjong

Pagar,  Kreta Ayer, or Rochore - we will  go,  and  I

will go.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We would like to tell the

Ministers sitting opposite that they made a  pledge

to  the  people which is much more important.  That

pledge  is  in their Five-Year Plan. And  yet  they

talk  so  much  about election promises!  They  say

merger is one of their election pledges. But as has

already  been said, what type of merger'?  When  we

joined the P.A.P. and when we supported merger,  we

never  for one moment thought that we would  get  a

type  of  merger that would give Singapore citizens

no  Federal citizenship. We never expected that  if

there   should  be  merger  there   would   be   no

proportionate representation. This is not a  merger

of  equality. This is not the type of  merger  that

gives  justice to all the people. During  the  last

general  elections,  I  remember  the  Member   for

Cairnhill used to say that merger was only possible

if the S.P.A. was the government and -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Member for

Queenstown will agree with me that he is straying a

bit far away from the motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am only answering the Prime

Minister's  point, Sir. At that time  the  P.A.P.'s

answer  was  that if there was merger, then  merger

must  come  about  only when the  peoples  of  both

territories agreed to merger. But today,  you  will

find a lot of people very unhappy about merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to make much reference to the

referendum but in passing, at this stage, I can say

that  although the Deputy Prime Minister  has  just

given   an   assurance  that  there   will   be   a

referendum - I  take  it  that  I  have   heard   him

correctly -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - that although the intention

was  to  have  a quick referendum, the  P.A.P. now

realises that if they had this referendum  at  this

particular stage, they would lose it, and therefore

they  want to postpone it. And what better  way  of

postponing  the  referendum than by postponing  the

National  Referendum Bill itself? That  would  give

them time to wrangle some of the arguments and  see

if  they  could  in  some  way  or  other  chip  in

something  new to try and help their  cause.  As  I

have  said,  Sir, they made great play of  pledges.

They said merger was one of their pledges. But  let

us ask them: what about the other pledges? Do they

ever  think  of them? Do they realise why  we  left

them? It is because they have not really kept their

election promises. It is because they have -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us confine ourselves to

one  pledge. If I am going to allow the Member  for

Queenstown to make these allegations, then that  is

not  strictly in reply to what has been said.  Only

one  pledge has been mentioned by a Member  on  the

Government side, that is, the pledge signed by  the

Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think most of of the people

in  Singapore know the many pledges that the P.A.P.

have not kept, Sir, I will not refer to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as regards this merger, Sir, and this

Malaysia  which they have tried so hard  to  boost,

have  they  got  a  mandate  from  the  people   of

Malaysia? Have they ever talked to the people about

Malaysia?  They now say that they must  keep  their

promise  about merger. Well, why do they  not  keep

their  promise about Malaysia as well? If they  did

not  consult the people about Malaysia before,  why

do   they   not  consult  the  people  now   before

undertaking  any drastic step that  will  lead  the

people  of Singapore, the Federation and the Borneo

territories into paths which may lead to a  lot  of

unhappiness?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> For the Communists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There will not be a happy

Malaysia. There will be a lot of unhappiness. If we

want  to  stick to the Prime Minister's words,  the

greatest  amount  of  happiness - I  think  he   said

that - for  the  greatest number of  people,  then  I

would  ask him and his colleagues to consider  what

they  have done. Go back - according to some  Chinese

saying   - and  think about it. Put up their  pillows

and think about it. And they will realise that what

they have done will not be to the best interests of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister made mention of people who play rugger as rash rushing forwards. But one thing

is  certain: whether a rugger player plays  forward

or  wing three-quarter, he always knows how to  get

the  man down. And we get the man down and take the

ball  across the line. That should tell the  Deputy

Prime  Minister where he stands today. He tries  to

smile. That is his only consolation, nothing  else,

because if he should go back to his Rochore -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes. Sir, he is intimidating.

He  is  talking about getting people down. I assure

you none of us here is a rugger ball!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Chair always

looks  to the Leader of the House for some lead  to

assist  him  in  keeping  order.  And  a  frivolous

objection like that will not help.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was saying about the Deputy

Prime  Minister going back to Rochore.  Even  if  I

should not be there to get him down, somebody  else

will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, Sir, since he could not find

a  good  reply,  adopted  the  familiar  tactic  of

smears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Charge him in court.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> First of all, he said that we

wanted   to   be  Prime  Ministers  and  Ministers,

alleging    that    we    are   all    opportunists

[Interruption] -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already remarked time

and, again that this running commentary  from  the

Ministerial  Benches is completely  disorderly.  If

that  is  the  type of debate that the  Ministerial

Benches  require, I suggest they use their majority

to amend the Standing Orders so that there can be a

running commentary from both sides.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Since he has found that

smearing us could not get us down, he tried the pro-Communist  and the Communist front line, and  since

he  could  not get us down that way, he  tried  the

familiar tactic of praising one Member and  running

down  another in our Party, hoping thereby to cause

misunderstanding  amongst us.  These  are  familiar

tactics.  We  know all of them. We can see  through

them  right away. They are transparent.  I  do  not

have  to have X-ray eyes to see how many bones they

have  in  their body. Everytime the Prime  Minister

speaks  about the Communist menace and things  like

that, he refers to his Fourth Anniversary Souvenir.

He goes to great lengths to read passages of it for

everybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spoken very much about reunification of

the   two  territories.  Although  I  have  lightly

touched  on it before, I would like now to  enlarge

on  it  a bit here. As to why we really broke  away

from   them,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  had  already

explained  that in our rallies and in our  speeches

on  the 20th of July. They wanted us to follow them

blindly,  but  that  is not the  way  to  go  about

things.  They  should expect a  certain  amount  of

intelligence  at least from us. We  all  understand

things  in  a certain way. The Prime Minister  says

that  we  had  read those passages  and  understood

those  passages.  We understand those  passages  to

mean  that if there should be reunification of  the

two  territories, it must be on a basis of  genuine

equality, justice and democracy. There must  be  no

domination  of  one  section  of  the  people  over

another section. There are a lot of unfounded fears

in   the   Federation,  and  the   P.A.P. leaders

themselves  realise that those fears are unfounded.

But,  unfortunately,  today they  have  gone  about

enlarging  on those fears and trading on  them.  We

hope  they will not play the communal line  because

every time they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



talk  of  people who are anti-merger,  they  always

link  it up with the word "anti-nationalists". That

is  a very dangerous line, Sir, and it can cause  a

lot  of friction between the various races in  this

country.  It is a funny thing that when  the  Tunku

said  that he was anti-merger, the P.A.P. and  the

Prime Minister of Singapore never dared to say that

the Tunku was anti-national. But now they have seen

fit  to  smear  us  with  such  a  word  as  "anti-nationalist".  I do not think it  is  fair,  and  I

would  urge the P.A.P. leaders to desist from  this

line.  It  is  not fair to us, it is  not  fair  to

themselves, and it is not fair to all the people of

Singapore as well as of the Federation. They ask us

to support their merger proposals. It is impossible

for  us  to support merger proposals which  do  not

give  us  those basic rights, and especially,  Sir,

when   we   see  new  amendments  to  the   Federal

Constitution now before the Federal Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Queenstown is straying far away from the motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will not touch on those

things,  Sir. Let me tell the Prime Minister  this.

He  talks  about the garden path and all that.  All

the  time he has been leading people up the  garden

path.  At this stage, I might be permitted to refer

to  the  few words I had with him before  we  broke

away from the P.A.P. He asked me, if he had merger,

would that mean a fulfilling of the promise made to

the  people? I said to him, "Merger, yes. But what

type  of merger?" Then he said, "You know socialism

is not possible in Singapore." I said, "Yes, how is

it you never had any contact with socialist Parties

in  the  Federation?" And he said that  if  he  did

that,  he  would  be stepping on the  toes  of  the

Tunku.  When I reminded him - at that time there  was

the  Anson by-election - that the Tunku was  already

joining hands with the S.P.A. against him, he could

not  reply. And I said, "You are leading the people

up the garden path. You have given us to understand

that  you  are  going to fight for  the  rights  of

equality  and justice for the people.  But  if  you

want  to  go  on  a merger that is going  to  bring

inequality and injustice, then the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



will disown you." That was what I said to the Prime

Minister about "leading people up the garden path."

I  do  not  wish  to  go  further  into  the  other

anecdotes.  I  wish to confine myself  now  to  the

actual All-Party conference itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said already, Sir, merger is a national

issue.  It is not a one-Party issue. If the  P.A.P.

want   the   people  to  believe  that   they   are

democratic,  then they must practise  democracy  so

that  everyone  can  see it in practice.  Preaching

democracy and not practising it will give democracy

a  bad  name and is in reality a dictatorship.  Our

walk-out, which was referred to by the Minister for

Culture -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Betrayal.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - is a clear indication of the

dictatorship that the P.A.P. is trying to  practise

even  inside this Assembly Hall. Democracy is  only

democracy when it is practised by people  who  hold

power.  If,  in holding power, they go  by  Fascist

methods,  then all this talk of democracy  is  very

hollow,  and  nobody can take them very  seriously.

They   have   often   talked  about   parliamentary

democracy  being on trial here. They hope  that  it

will  not  fail.  But it will fail  if  the  P.A.P.

persists in its attitude of going about things that

are national affairs on a one-Party basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that the final decision of the future of Singapore must rest with the people. Well, let them consult the people. One of the ways of consulting the people is to have an All-Party conference where all the views can be put forward. We do not ask for a general election just because we want to come to power. It has

already  been explained that we want to  make  sure

that  if  it is going to be a government that  will

look after the national question, then it must be a

government  that  will not only practise  democracy

but  can  also  really say that it  represents  the

people.  Everybody  knows that  the  P.A.P. is  an

unpopular  Government  and  completely  discredited

and, of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



that  is  the  reason why it dare  not  go  for  an

election.  In  the past the Prime  Minister  always

used  to  challenge Members of the  Opposition  and

even  Members  of the Government. I remember  there

was a challenge issued by the Prime Minister to the

Member for Anson on a simple question. Yet now on a

major issue, they dare not even mention it. We  are

not against a referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We are ready for the

referendum. But we would ask the P.A.P. not to play

politics   where  the  future  of  the  people   is

concerned. It must always place national  interests

above  party politics and personal interests.  Only

then  will  democracy have meaning.  If  I  may  be

allowed  to  quote  again a small  passage  of  the

speech  which I read cut in the beginning.  Just  a

few lines. I said this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This call for an All-Party conference will serve

its  purpose if it will help to show the P.A.P. its

past  mistakes.  If the P.A.P. should  admit  these

mistakes  and  take appropriate  steps  to  rectify

them, then the time of the House will not have been

wasted in debating this motion.'

<br><br>7.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, this motion* was tabled

some two months ago -



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly calls upon the Government to recommend the appointment

of a Commission to enquire into the Government's Education Policy,

its content and administration in all fields other than vocational and

technical education, and to make recommendations.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member moving?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir, unless it

is  more convenient to postpone it till tomorrow if

I  can be informed that the Minister would wish  to

make a Ministerial statement. I wrote him as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



suggested by the Prime Minister yesterday,  and  he

may  well not have had the time to study the  issue

and reply, but I will be very happy to give way  if

he wishes to make a statement.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Minister prepared for a

statement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, this motion was tabled

two  months ago and on the 19th of December, as the

Prime  Minister  informed  you,  I  wrote  to   the

Minister  for Education urging upon him my  anxiety

to  avoid  making this topic a matter for political

debate.



<br><br>7.14 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><B>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</B></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was anxious that there should be a generally

non-political  approach;  rather  that   he   would

consider   making   a   statement   appointing    a

Commission,  in  which event I would  be  happy  to

withdraw the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in view of what had occurred immediately prior to that date, I suggested amendments and the basic amendment was that, in addition to the terms of reference which should include the six-day week, we should have the political activities and machinations in primary and secondary schools, the extent thereof, and the

persons and organisations responsible therefor. The

Minister was good enough to make a statement a  few

days  later  assuring us that he  would  appoint  a

Commission  in  the  spirit  of  those   terms   of

reference. However, on Monday, Mr Deputy  Speaker,

Sir, somewhat to my consternation, I heard from the

Prime   Minister  that  the  appointment   of   the

Commission  undertaken  would  not,  in  fact,   be

carried  out forthwith but would be on  the  never-never  plan in the nebulous future, because of  the

need to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



have  a  High Court Judge and an inadequate  number

was not available to chair the four Commissions  he

had  in mind. I pointed out then that the main part

of the motion did not require a High Court Judge - in

fact, it would be rather inappropriate - and that the

second  part of the motion could well be tagged  on

to  the terms of reference of the Commission he had

in mind, which was, in his own words, "to look into

the  agitation in the Chinese middle  schools  over

the  conversion from the 3: 3 to 4:2  system  which

led to the organisation of the attempted boycott of

the  first  secondary  certificate  examination  in

December  last  year with particular  reference  to

Communist  cadres  behind  the  scenes  responsible

therefor".   It  seemed  to  me  that   they   were

associated  and the proper thing was co make  those

two terms of reference -  if in fact the two terms of

reference were necessary - into one and leave that to

the High Court Judge and not delay the question  of

the appointment of the Commission on Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that when the Minister

for    Education   promised   this   Assembly   the

appointment  of the Commission, he  made  it  plain

that  the  provisions he had contemplated  for  the

relaxation of the six-day week would no  longer  be

put  into  effect, and therefore the  six-day  week

would  continue to plague parents and educationists

who are taking very strong exception. And everybody

in   Singapore   was  entitled  to  believe   that,

particularly   in  view  of  the  action   of   the

Government  in not implementing proposals  for  the

relaxation  of  the six-day week, it would  proceed

with   expedition  to  the  appointment   of   this

Commission  and not make it an excuse for  refusing

to carry out measures which it itself recognised to

be  necessary and to be  called for. I  repeat,  Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not my desire that there

should  be - and I hope there would not be   - any

attempt to criticise or praise or otherwise indulge

in  statements  with reference to  the  educational

policy, because I am deeply anxious that the matter

should  be left to non-political educationists  and

public  men who could give us an impartial  picture

which may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



well  be  complimentary to this Government   - and  I

hope  also  to preceding governments - in respect  of

their   efforts   in  the  field  of   multilingual

education  which was and is a brave  experiment  in

this  area. But this Commission should be  appointed

forthwith and the purpose of my moving this  motion

is   to  obtain  an  assurance  which  I  have  not

obtained,  that  in  fact the  Commission  will  be

appointed speedily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in

reply to the Prime Minister, who said that in  view

of  my suggestion I should write in to the Minister

for  Education, I did, on the morning of the  16th,

which was only yesterday, write an urgent letter to

the Minister for Education repeating my suggestion.

I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would appreciate an indication from you by way

of Ministerial or Press statement on the subject if

possible  before the time for consideration  of  my

motion is reached.'



<br><br>The  purpose of my request, Mr Deputy Speaker, was

to  avoid  a debate on this motion if the terms  of

the  Press statement or Ministerial statement  were

adequate.  I  have  not  received  a  reply  either

written  or orally from the Minister, and you  will

have noted that he refused an opportunity to make a

Ministerial statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore move the motion standing in my name.

I  do  hope  I will obtain from the Government  not

merely  the assurance that this Commission will  be

appointed  but its honest support of the motion  in

an  indication  as  to when it is anticipated  that

this Commission will be appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> The Member  for

Joo Chiat is absent. Dr Thio.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  the question of education and the welfare  of

our school children is so important that I think it

should  be above party politics. I therefore intend

to speak very briefly in a constructive manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that it is a very difficult task to

try  to  solve  the  problem  of  education  in   a

multiracial and multilingual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



society,  and if the Government have not  been  one

hundred per cent successful in their attempts. I do

not  think  we  should blame  them.  But  there  is

nothing so good that it cannot be improved.  If  we

could have an independent Commission of Inquiry  to

go    further   into   the   problem    and    make

recommendations,  I think it will  all  be  to  the

good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many respects, we agree with the aims of

the   Government - for  example,  education   towards

common identity and loyalty. The Government want to

promote  a common national language which  children

will learn and understand with respect and love for

one another and with a common identity and loyalty.

That   is  in  the  Sixth  Anniversary  Celebration

Souvenir 1960 magazine of the P.A.P. However,  Sir,

I  have  once stated before and I reaffirm that  my

conviction is that, although a national language as

a  common  language  is highly desirable  and  very

important  to facilitate communication of thoughts,

it  will  not necessarily promote unity and harmony

as  we  have seen in this very Chamber where people

speaking  the  same language can get  rattled.  For

instance, in the international sphere, we have  Red

China  and Formosa practically at war although  the

people  in both places speak the same language.  In

the  history  of America, the British and  American

colonialists  were at war although they  spoke  the

same  language. Perhaps the Commission  of  inquiry

could  go  further and find out how the  Government

could  supplement the policy of one common national

language  with other means to deve1op a  spirit  of

tolerance,  goodwill  and  harmony  so  that  while

speaking the same language they can also be on good

terms with one another. I am sure that although  we

can  disagree, yet we need have no ill-will towards

one another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective of the Government is stated

as  education  with  common content,  and  that  is

interpreted as the preparation of common syllabuses

for  all  the schools in the different media.  Sir,

one   question  that  could  be  referred  to   the

Commission is whether this policy should be rigidly

adhered  to.  There  is  a danger  that  if  common

syllabuses are rigidly drawn up for schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



in  the  different  media,  then  we  will  produce

citizens with a one-track mind. Perhaps there could

be room for diversity so that, with the approval of

the  Ministry,  if schools like to diversify  their

syllabuses and depart from those laid down  and  if

there  is  nothing subversive they may do  so.  The

Government  could perhaps agree to  the  Commission

going into this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is again the abolition of inter-school

sports.  While  we are in favour of  inter-district

sports,  the  feeling among the school children  is

that  the abolition of inter-school sports deprives

them   of  the  development  of  loyalty  to  their

schools. The result has been that very poor  crowds

go  to these inter-district sports, whereas when it

comes to inter-school sports, arrangements are made

so  that  Chinese, English, Malay and Tamil  medium

schools  can  all participate because children  are

such  that  their  loyalty  to  their  schools   is

stronger  than  their loyalty to  their  districts.

After  all, what is a district to them?  A  country

yes, but when children come from different parts of

Singapore  to  a  secondary  school,  it  is   very

difficult to develop loyalty to a district.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Government-aided schools and

their future, there is a danger that the Government

is  inclined to promote State schools as a sort  of

"their"  schools. The Government might forget  that

there must be free competition even in the field of

education, otherwise qualities and standards  might

suffer.  In  the  interest of the  welfare  of  the

children  and  in  order that  the  wishes  of  the

parents might be complied with, I should think that

every  encouragement should be given  so  that  the

Government-aided  schools would  be  allowed  every

chance  to  grow  and make good  progress.  At  the

moment,   there  are  more  and  more  difficulties

because  the  Government imposes  almost  the  same

conditions on aided schools and yet when  it  comes

to  buildings, they are asked to provide  half  the

cost.  It  is very difficult to approach people  to

provide  half  the cost of the buildings  when  the

rules  are  so rigid that it is the same whether  a

boy goes to a Government school or to an aided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



school.  I  think in the case of the aided  schools

there should be more leeway in regard to curriculum

and  other activities, so long as the standards are

maintained  and  there  is no  subversive  activity

going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then comes the question of private schools.

Is  there not room for good private schools in this

country?  The demand for education in this  country

is  so  great that I think it is even greater  than

that in Western countries. We Asians almost worship

education.  Parents who have grown-up children  who

should be employed still want their children to  go

to  school  if they are not employed.  So  we  have

these young people, who are 18 or 19 years old, who

still  want  to  go  for  education,  in  secondary

schools  or  high schools although they  should  be

working.  And  the  parents' complaint  is,  "Well,

since they cannot get employment and the Government

provides only evening schools, what are they  going

to  do in the day time?" They prefer these children

to  go  to day schools until such time as there  is

full  employment. If these parents want their  sons

and  daughters  to  continue  in  high  schools  or

secondary schools and the Government finds  it  too

difficult  or  expensive to have more secondary  or

high schools, perhaps good private schools could be

encouraged. We find that in the Philippines they do

that,  and standards can be maintained by a  common

examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of the full six-day week will

be.  I  think, considered by this Commission and  I

hope  that  opportunity will be  given  to  parents,

teachers,  unions, and others interested to  submit

their views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing missing in our educational

policy, and that is that we assume that in a multi-racial  and multi-lingual society, people  speaking

one language can come together easily. Sir, we find

even  in  this  Chamber it is not so  easy  to  get

people  to  reach agreement. I think democracy  can

only  work  if we have the development of qualities

of character such as tolerance, goodwill,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



integrity, charity, and the spirit of service,  all

of  which are very important. Because many  schools

are  keen to compete in school examinations and get

good  results, the education system tends  to  fill

the  minds  with  just intellectual  facts  without

effecting  any  change in a person's character,  so

that  we  produce  not good citizens  but  educated

rascals.  In the interest of this country  and  for

the  future  of  this country, I do hope  that  the

Commission appointed will go into this, matter  as

well.



<br><br>7.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am in full

support  of having such a Commission of Inquiry  to

look  into  the education policy of the Government.

But  this Commission of Inquiry should not  indulge

in politics. It should be concerned purely with the

education  policy of the Government.  Because  this

.policy  has many shortcomings, it has led to  many

difficulties  and  confusion at  the  moment.  This

confusion   has  been  created  by  the  Government

itself.  For  example,  the  4:2  system.  If   the

Government could have postponed the holding of  the

public Secondary IV Examination for one year,  then

there  would not have been such trouble  and  there

would  not have been any boycott of the examination

at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are several

matters  worth investigating in this Commission  of

Inquiry. First, we should look into the past as  to

whether the Government have assisted the Government-aided  schools in respect of their development  and

progress, because we know that many of the  Chinese

schools  are aided by the Government. Many  of  the

English schools are Government schools. The private

aided  schools  are meant to help  the  Government.

This  is, correct, and the Government should  make

use of public funds to assist the aided schools. In

the  same way, private' individuals are helping the

Government to develop and bring advancement to  our

education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point concerns teachers. In many aided

schools teachers who have reached retiring age  are

not  well  taken care of, especially in  regard  to

their after-care, so that in their retirement these

teachers are more or less unemployed. So they  have

financial problems in their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point concerns the future of students.

We  know  that of the students who have passed  the

Secondary  IV  public examination  and  the  Senior

Middle  III examination, some are still unemployed.

Also   some  who  have  passed  the  Secondary   IV

examination  are  not given  a  chance  to  go  for

further studies. So how are we going to think about

their future? We know that this year the Government

does  not  seem to want these graduates  to  become

temporary teachers. It seems that it wants to  wait

for  the  result of the examination  `before  those

students  who  have  sat for  the  examination  can

become teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point concerns Nanyang University. We

all know that the Minister in the forum convened by

the  Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce answered

questions  in  regard to Nanyang  University.  The

Minister  said  that after merger he could  request

the  Government of the Federation to recognise  the

degrees  of  the Nanyang graduates. I do  not  know

whether  the  Singapore Government, which  has  not

officially   recognised  the  degrees  of   Nanyang

University  graduates, can ask  the  Federation  to

recognise such degrees `before it does so. How  can

the  Government  do  such a  thing?  In  fact,  the

Government  itself  should take the  initiative  to

recognise Nanyang University degrees before it  can

expect others to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I want to raise is that we are in

doubt  whether the Government wishes to change  all

the schools on the lines of English schools. I hope

this  point  can  be looked into  as  well  in  the

Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>7.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at

the  last sitting in December, to be exact, on 21st

December,   1961.  I  had  occasion   to   make   a

Ministerial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



statement  to  indicate  that  the  Government  was

prepared  to  appoint a Commission  of  Inquiry  in

accordance  with  the spirit of the  motion  before

this  House. Mainly to spare Members of the  House,

both  on  the Government side and on the Opposition

side  after a marathon session, I agreed to make  a

statement at the request of the Member for Anson so

as  to cut short the debate on the motion. In fact,

he had proposed an extension to his original motion

to  include  the six-day week, and added  political

activities   and   machinations  in   primary   and

secondary  schools to the extent thereof,  and  the

persons  and  organisations  responsible  therefor.

This  extension of the terms of reference  for  the

Commission   of  Inquiry  was  also   accepted   by

Government. So since there is to be a Commission of

Inquiry into not only the educational policy of the

Government but also the six-day week, it  would  be

highly improper for my Ministry to proceed with any

amendments to the six-day week if the Commission of

Inquiry is to inquire into the six-day week. So  in

my  statement  I  did  specifically  mention  that,

arising  out  of the decision of the Government  to

have  this Commission of Inquiry, the intention  to

bring  about a revised version of the six-day  week

for  1962 for primary schools would have to be cold

storaged.  After I made that statement, Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson was gleeful  and

happy  and volunteered to withdraw the motion.  The

Speaker then told him that he could do so under the

ordinary  rules  of the House. Then  comes  another

letter from the Member for Anson to tell me  a  few

other  things.  Well,  I  have  already  given   an

assurance  that  a Commission of  Inquiry  will  be

appointed.  But if the Member for Anson  thinks  he

can  write letters to me telling me to do this  and

that  before he withdraws the motion, if he  is  to

appear  like a weather cock which twists and  turns

at  every puff of the wind, I must tell him that he

is taking things too much for granted. I can assure

him  that  the proposed Commission of Inquiry  into

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



examination   boycott   could   include   political

activities   and   machinations  in   primary   and

secondary  schools.  This  proposed  Commission  of

Inquiry  would  be   headed by a High  Court  Judge.

There  would be a second Commission of  inquiry  to

look  into  the  educational policy other  than  on

vocational  and technical education,  because  that

has  already received the attention of a Commission

of  Inquiry.  I  do not think I need  make  further

assurances whether that Commission of Inquiry is to

he  formed.  It will be formed at a time  when  the

Government  has  been able to find the  members  to

form this Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Sir, that on 21st December.

1961, the Member for Anson asked for one Commission

of Inquiry to bring everything in, and I said, "No,

there  should  be  two Commissions to  go  into  the

issues  apart." I think the Member  for  Anson  now

accepts that. That is what the Government will do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various points mentioned by the Member

for  Tanglin. I disagree with him when he says that

it  is  not enough just to have a national language

to  bring about unity, but that it is necessary  to

have  other  languages  as  well.  I  think  it  is

essential, if there is to be nation building  in  a

muti-racial  society,  that the  national  language

must be the language to bind all the people of this

country. It is along this line that the question of

the  Federation of Malaysia is proceeding  - that the

national  language would be Malay for the  proposed

Federation of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin next touched upon the fact

that  a common content in syllabuses might tend  to

some  form of regimentation. The tragedy has always

been  that there has been no common content in  our

schools,  thereby resulting in different  standards

and  different ways of thinking. So  not  only  are

syllabuses  to  be  of a similar  content,  but  we

should also have a common loyalty, and that  is  to

have  syllabuses Malayanised. That  work  has  been

achieved within the first two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



years  of office of the present Government  in  the

Ministry of Education. I disagree with him when  he

says  that the abolition of the inter-school sports

in  favour of inter-district sports has not brought

about  a large response from students because  they

tend  to have greater loyalty for schools than they

have for districts. The reason for abolishing inter-school  sports and substituting in its stead inter-district  sports  was  purely  to  break  down  the

communal  barriers  so  long  as  we  have  English

schools,  Chinese schools, Malay schools and  Tamil

schools.  But with the creation of more  integrated

schools - by  that  we mean more than  one  language

medium     of    instruction    in    one    school

building - perhaps the time would come when we  could

come back to inter-school sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin then raised the perennial

question of aided schools to allow for competition.

It has never been denied that there is value in the

educational  system of Singapore for the  existence

of  aided  schools.  In fact, in  the  past,  aided

schools  have  played  a great  part  in  providing

education for the children of Singapore.  But  that

was  the  distant past when the colonial Government

failed  to  shoulder their full responsibility  for

the  education of all its children. It is. I think,

elementary  knowledge  that an  elected  government

must be prepared to shoulder the responsibility  of

educating  all its children. Therefore, whether  we

like  it  or  not, it is the responsibility  of  an

elected  government to build more and more  schools

and to provide facilities for education so that the

time  will come when the majority of children  will

receive their education in Government schools,  but

those  wishing  to  send their  children  to  aided

schools may do so. It is a question of free  choice

in  as  much  as parents are allowed to choose  the

language  medium of instruction for their  children

every  year  when children of six  or  seven  enter

school for the first time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin

next   raised  the  role  of  private  schools   in

Singapore. Here again, the Ministry has not  placed

anything in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



way   of  private  schools  opening  and  providing

education if people do join such schools. But it is

still  the responsibility of the Ministry to ensure

that private schools do charge reasonable fees  and

not  exorbitant fees; that the teachers they employ

are  qualified  for their task, and  that  they  do

not - as many do - give the students a certain type  of

education  which does not really prepare  them  for

recognised   examinations.  To  take  an   example,

private   schools   might  train   their   students

especially  those who have failed in their  primary

school  leaving  examinations, and  allow  them  to

proceed  to secondary classes, but they stop  short

at  Secondary III level and not Secondary IV level,

when  if they were in English private schools, they

should   be  prepared  for  the  Cambridge   School

Certificate  examination. It  just  shows  this.  I

think  they  know quite well that the students  who

attend  their classes might fail miserably if  they

do  take the Senior Cambridge examination. That  is

the  thing we want to stop. If private schools  are

genuine  in  their  desire to coach  people  for  a

recognised  examination and get  them  through  the

classes  satisfactorily from Secondary I, II,  III,

and  IV, we have no objections at all. But  I  must

say  that the Adult Education Board, that  is,  the

Lembaga   Gerakan  Pelajaran  Dewasa,   is   making

strenuous  efforts  to provide secondary  education

for adults, so much so that more than 5,000 are now

attending  ten  centres for secondary  classes.  In

fact,  there are more applications than  the  Adult

Education Board is able to handle. However, we feel

that  this  is  meeting a great  need  because  the

Ministry's  and the Government's view  is  that  we

should not try to deprive people of the opportunity

for education, be it secondary or higher education,

if  they wish to do so in the evenings to catch  up

on what they have missed during their younger days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be remembered, Sir, that when the

University  .of  Singapore  Bill  was  before  this

House, Members of the Opposition were quite pleased

with  the  new  provisions  in  the  University  of

Singapore Constitution which permit the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



University  to  grant external  degrees,  something

which colonial universities were most unprepared to

give.



<br><br>7.59 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do think that the policy which the Ministry of

Education  has  been following is along  the  right

lines   although   it  is  common  knowledge   that

education is education for the next generation.  So

whatever  we  do today we may not see  the  results

next year or a few years after. But when all of  us

are perhaps no longer in this House, we are able to

reflect on past history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin touched upon the six-day

week, which is part of the education policy of  the

Government  that  will come  under  review  by  the

proposed  Commission of inquiry. There is no  doubt

at  all  that interested parties, be they teachers,

parents  or even politicians who are interested  in

this subject, would be invited by the Commission to

submit  their views and that would be  followed  up

with  the giving of evidence in person if it is  so

desired  by the Commission. I am wholly in  support

of  the  view put forward by the Member for Tanglin

when  he  said that it is not enough that education

is  schools should be confined to school  subjects,

and  that  it is very dangerous if all that  we  do

produce  in schools would be  children who  are  too

examination conscious. Character forming is  indeed

an important aspect of education -

<div align="center"><b>THE 179% PETROL DUTY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, in presenting his

Budget  speech, the Minister for Finance  indicated

that  petroleum has proved a disappointment.  "Once

again,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



there  is a short-fall, this time probably  in  the

region  of  $1.3 million. There has been  a  switch

from  petroleum engines to diesel engines to  power

vehicles."  Again, a little later on, Mr  Speaker,

he  said,  "The falling trend in the collection  of

Petroleum Duties is reflected in the decrease of $2

million shown in the 1962 estimate against the 1961

estimate of $38.5 million."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary picture of a falling revenue

arising   from  petroleum  duties  with  increasing

registration  of  motor  vehicles  prompted  me  to

investigate, and I have, with considerable  trouble

and   several  days'  research,  obtained   certain

figures  which I have taken the liberty  of  having

cyclostyled and circulated. I must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



say,  Sir,  that I am delighted that my  action  in

doing  so has brought about, with commendable speed

on  the part of the Minister for Finance, what seem

to  be  corrected figures, although my own  figures

are  from  official sources with certain additional

material.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I can trust my original sources, but

I  do  not  wish to quibble, and I am  prepared  to

correct  my figures to follow those of the Minister

for   Finance;  the  differences  are  small,   and

particularly,  Mr  Speaker,  certain   differences

arise from the fact that in respect of revenue  for

certain  years,  I  could only  obtain  revenue  in

respect of petroleum and kerosene; 5 cents duty  on

kerosene  per gallon, whereas I gather the Minister

for  Finance has been able to lay his hands on  the

exact figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, let us look at the figures as they

are:



<pre>

                       Consumption

           No of       (Million         Revneue

          (Oct)

</pre>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, for 1962, we, of course, have no

figures  as  to  the  increase  in  the  number  of

registered motor vehicles, but you can see from the

figures  which I have given and which the  Minister

for   Finance  has  given,  that  there  have  been

successive  increases year after year of registered

vehicles  without a break, from 61,000 in  1955  to

115,000 in 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is to be noted that despite the

continually  increasing number of registered  motor

vehicles,  the  consumption of petrol  has  dropped

since  1959  and  is continuing to drop.  In  1959,

90,000  vehicles and in October 1961,  115,000  (in round numbers),

an increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>

of about 23 per cent in the number of

vehicles, and

a  fall  in consumption of petrol of about  15  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the reason for this fall in the

consumption of petrol? We are told, and  accurately

told,  that  there  is a switch  from  the  use  of

petroleum engines to the use of diesel engines. But

why  has this happened since 1959? You will  notice

that  petrol  tax was increased by 20 per  cent  in

1959.  The petrol today costs per gallon 67  cents.

The  duty  is $1.20, which is 179 per cent  of  the

sale price, bringing the price of petrol to $1.87.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in presenting these facts in statistical

form,  I  do so because I have learnt the  Minister

for  Finance,  is, in fact, a statistician  and  he

understands   statistics,   and   as   the   person

responsible  for the petrol tax, it  is  my  desire

particularly that he should understand  what  I  am

seeking to explain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the figures statistically prove that the

moment his Government increased the petrol tax from

$1  to $1.20, consumption immediately began to fall

by  a  switch to diesel, and therefore, it  can  be

reasonably inferred that a $1 tax on petrol is  the

point of diminishing returns in economic terms. Now

that  this is made clear, Sir, I would like to draw

attention to the fact that at the time of  imposing

this additional 20 cents tax, the P.A.P. Government

received   from   the  Singapore   Taxi   Transport

Association and the Singapore Hired Car Association

a  petition  pleading that "the  increased  tax  of

petrol has adversely affected our livelihood",  and

the  two  Associations  asked  that  their  members

should  be  exempted inter alia from the  increased

taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am in a position to table and I shall forward to your Clerk a copy of this letter*,

signed  by  the Presidents of the two Associations. As  can be expected, Mr Speaker, the letter had no effect.  The  taxi drivers did not understand  that the Minister is not interested in other than facts;

humanity has no place in his calculations.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Letter  tabled by Mr Marshall on  17-1-62  and

copies circulated to Members for their information.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he has the figures, Mr Speaker, and the

figures  prove  irresistibly  that  the  20   cents

increase  in  the  petrol  tax  introduced  by  the

Government  has,  in  fact,  been  responsible  for

diminishing  our  revenue  from  that  source.  Mr

Speaker,  the  Minister  in supplying  the  figures

indicates that there is an offset in respect of the

increase  in revenue from diesel engines.  That  is

perfectly  correct. The position with reference  to

diesel engines, as I understand it. Mr Speaker, is

not  a  tax on the diesel oil that they use, but  a

somewhat  heavy tax on the existence of the  engine

itself.  Sir,  if  a diesel engine  has  to  pay  a

substantial tax, nevertheless



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



that tax may well be worth while because diesel oil

is cheap if a considerable distance is travelled in

the period of a year. But what would be the revenue

to this State if, instead of using diesel oil, that

considerable  distance  were,  in   fact,   to   be

travelled   on  petrol?  There,  Mr  Speaker,   in

fairness, I must say that I am not in possession of

actual  figures nor am I adequately  an  expert  to

indicate  with  certainty that  there  would  be  a

greater increase in revenue than that shown by  the

offset  in  diesel engines. But I  do  ask  you  to

notice  certain  very interesting particulars,  Mr

Speaker. In 1956, the total number of vehicles  was

67,000  and  the petrol consumption was28�  million

gallons.  Sir, today we have 115,000 vehicles,  but

the petrol consumption is only 30� million gallons.

When  I  say  "today" I am talking of "the  end  of

1961".  Mr  Speaker, the comparative  figures  are

startling - really startling, and I would  urge  that

if   the  consumption  were  to  be  maintained  in

proportion  to  the rate it was  at  in  1956,  our

revenue  would be considerably greater from  petrol

than   the   small  offset,  specious  and   really

misleading,  which we find from diesel  engines.  I

say  this with some diffidence, Mr Speaker, but  I

do  generally have the impression that the increase

of  20 cents in petrol tax by this Government  has,

in  effect,  resulted in decreased revenue  to  the

State by encouragement of the increased utilisation

of  diesel engines instead of petrol engines. It is

in   these  circumstances  that  I  would  ask  the

Minister  whether  he is considering  the  position

with  a view to easing the tax both for the benefit

of  our revenue and for the benefit - if I might urge

this  on him though it may have no meaning  - of  our

taxi-drivers  and  lorry-drivers and  the  motoring

public  at  large who, it is true, are not  in  the

category of poverty of the first two classes. But I

do  want  to emphasise this - and I speak as one  who

introduced  the  luxury tax  of  ten  per  cent  on

cars - that  today  motor transport is  an  essential

aspect of our life. To travel by bus and taxi is no

longer  a  question of luxury. It is a question  of

necessity. We would seek to avoid imposing what may

amount to a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



prohibitive tax on the consumption of petrol, which

is  taking  advantage, perhaps unintentionally,  of

the  need of the people. If you will notice, at the

time  I increased it, I think it was from 68 to  73

cents,  and  even  in  November  1956  when  I  was

associated  with the Labour Front, we increased  it

to   no  more  than  80  cents,  although  in   the

Federation at that time I think it was a dollar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might interest you to know the figures in

other  territories. I would like to take  first  of

all - as I have said, I have circulated them for the

convenience  of  Members;  figures  are   difficult

things  to  retain in one's mind unless  one  is  a

statistician - Brunei, for example, Sir, which is a

happy  country. I am taking first those territories

which  are not only close to us but which  we  hope

will be our partners and brothers. In Brunei, there

is  no  tax  at  all on petrol. In the neighbouring

territory of British North Borneo, it is 25  cents.

It  is  not  that  they do not need money.  British

North  Borneo  is  not rich.  Brunei  is,  but  not

British  North  Borneo. In Sarawak where  money  is

very  tight - the  Government has to make  strenuous

effort to get it - the petrol tax is no more than 50

cents.  But let us go further afield, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,In Australia, it is 32 cents. In South Africa,

I  think  it is 50 cents. In Tanganyika, it  is  32

cents. In Uganda, it is 43 cents. In Kenya,  it  is

53  cents. Now, Sir, I do not know whether  I  have

given one other figure which, in fairness, I should

give  hut which I seem to have omitted from my  own

lists: in India, it is $1.17 cents and in Hongkong,

it  is  79 cents. Now, Sir, India comes closest  to

us. I do not know why it was omitted from the list,

hut  I do remember it accurately, and I ask you  to

notice,  Mr  Speaker,  that  according  to   these

figures,  Singapore  and the  Federation  have  the

highest  duty  compared to all of these  countries.

Now the Federation has different financial problems

to  ours -   and  very difficult problems  they  are,

which  fortunately  do  not  apply  here,  and  the

circumstances are different here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do urge, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in the light of

these  statistics, which have highlighted the issue

that our tax in going beyond the dollar has reached

the  point  of  diminishing returns,  the  Minister

would  give consideration both for the sake of  our

revenue and for the sake of our people. It is  very

rarely that one can both please the revenue and the

people  hut  in this instance I think that  miracle

can be achieved.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

congratulate the Member for Anson for the pains  he

has  taken in this piece of research and the  lucid

manner in which he has presented his case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I think I have no quarrel with most of his

arguments. I think by and large they are  valid.  I

think  he  has  not attempted to conceal  from  the

House any facts which would prejudice his case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are agreed on the main fact that there

may  be  differences between the figures he put  up

and  the  figures I gave, but that may  be   due  to

differences in definition. I suspect it may be  that

his   figures  of  revenue  included  the  one   on

kerosene,  whereas mine did not. Where the  figures

of  registered vehicles differ, the reason  may  be

that I took the figures as on 31st December of that

year,  except for 1961 when it was towards sometime

in  October. There could be differences  in  dates.

But  generally I think we are agreed on the  facts.

Now what conclusion do we draw from the facts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for An son drew particular attention

to  the revenue position between 1959 - that was  the

time when the additional tax was imposed -  and 1960.

That  may  be a valid period for the comparison  of

tax changes in response to changes in the rates  of

tax.  But I would rather take a longer period.  The

first  conclusion I would say is that if  you  take

the  year 1956 and aggregate both the tax on petrol

and  the  special tax on diesel engines, you  would

get a total of $22.7 million. By 1961, the total of

both the petrol and the diesel engine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



tax  went  up to $41 million. The increase  in  the

revenue  earned  with regard to these  taxes  is  a

shade more than the total increase in the number of

vehicles  between 1956 and 1961. Between  1956  and

1961, there was a 70 per cent increase in the total

number of registered vehicles. The increase in  the

petrol tax itself was of the order of 72 per  cent.

And  if you include the tax on diesel engines, that

might bring it up well over 75 per cent. So by  and

large,  the  yield of duty has kept pace  with  the

number  of  registered vehicles. But as the  Member

for  Anson rightly pointed out, the consumption  of

petrol  has  not.  The actual  quantity  of  petrol

consumed,  in spite of the tremendous  increase  in

the  number  of registered vehicles, has  increased

only from $28.5 million in 1956 to $30.5 million in

1961.  He  said  that  if only the  consumption  of

petrol  could have kept pace with the  increase  in

the  number of registered vehicles, then of  course

the  Treasury  would  have  been  overflowing  with

money.  And  that  is  quite  true.  But  what  has

happened is this. If you will look at the third set

of figures I gave - the number of registered vehicles

classified by types -  you will find that the largest

percentage  increase has been in respect  of  motor

cycles.  The  number  of  motor  cycles  registered

between  1956  and  1961  has  nearly  trebled.  Of

course,  the term "motor cycles" includes  scooters

and  light two-wheeled machines which consume  very

little petrol. Therefore, whether we increase the tax on petrol or not, it is hardly possible for the

quantity  of petrol consumed to increase pari  passu

with  the  number of registered vehicles for  three

reasons.  First,  the number of  motor  cycles  has

increased much faster than the others. Second, even

in  the case of motor cars, there has been a switch

from  cars that consume a lot of petrol to  lighter

models  like - I should not mention names - small  cars

that are very economical in price. Then, of course,

there  is a general technological progress  whereby

even for the same make of cars, engines of improved

compression ratios



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



are  made,  and  generally  petrol  consumption  is

lowered. Therefore, although one cannot be  certain

about this  - just as the Member for Anson said  that

he  was  not  sure that if the duty  on  petrol  is

retained  at its present level the duty might  well

increase - it  could have increased or it  could  not

have increased. One does not know. My guess is that

it  is  very  likely that if we had maintained  the

same rate of petrol duty all these years, one might

have  induced  an  increase in the  consumption  of

petrol.  Motorists  would have driven  more  often.

Possibly,  more people might have bought more  cars

and  motor  cycles. But as against that, there  has

been a switch from the larger types of cars to  the

smaller  types  of  cars and there  has  been  a  tremendous  increase in the popularity of  scooters

and motor cycles. So it could well be - and in fact I

am  almost  certain - that if  we  had  for  instance

retained  the  duty  on  petrol  tax  at  the  rate

existing,  say in 1956, the effect would have  been

that the consumption of petrol would certainly have

increased - by what proportion one does not know. But

it is doubtful whether it would have increased fast

enough  to  yield  the  revenue  that  we  are  now

receiving   from  petrol  tax.  For  the  petroleum

revenue   to   remain  at  the  1961  figure,   the

consumption of petrol would practically have had to

double  from 1956. I think that would have  been  a

most unlikely event.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petroleum duty in Singapore and in the

Federation is high - one of the highest in Asia.  The

rate of petroleum duty in India is practically  the

same  as  ours.  My  calculations  show  that   the

percentage of petroleum duty is 179.2. but we  will

say that it is the same. In Ceylon it is about 167.

But  other  than  these  two countries,  the  other

countries in Asia have much lower petroleum  duties

than ours. Japan has just over 107. Hongkong has  a

duty  rate of 97 on the retail price. On the  other

hand,  there  are other countries  which  pay  much

higher duties than we do. Of course, Australia pays

much  less than that. It is a developed country.  I

can  of  course quote the case of France where  the

rate  of duty is 287 per cent of the retail  price.

South Africa



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



pays  less  duty  than we do. On  the  other  hand,

Italy,  for instance, pays more than we do. So,  by

and  large, some countries pay more and others  pay

less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a moot point whether we have reached the

point  of  diminishing returns. It is  certainly  a

point  that is worth investigating. Of course,  the

way to get a full and complete investigation of the

effects  of tax on yield of revenue requires  quite

advanced techniques of practical analyses.  Bearing

in mind that the physical consumption of petrol has

not increased in the last seven or eight years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



in  spite of the increase in the number of cars,  I

think  the  Member for Anson has a point that  both

the  Singapore and the Federation Governments might

well look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at Eight

o'clock  p.m.,  and  the  time  appointed  for  the

termination of the sitting (half-past Eight o'clock

Assembly  without  question put,  pursuant  to  the

Standing Order.
