<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27-(cont.)

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on clause 27 - an amendment in the name of the Member for

Queenstown,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page All, line 13, to leave out "declare" and insert "announce the result

of  the  voting  in  detail electoral division by electoral division  before  he

declares".



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, when the House rose last Friday night, I was explaining why  I

moved the amendment and that was in order that we might have an honest record of

the result of voting. I explained to you, Sir, how the original intention of the

referendum  immediately after Hong Lim was to test public opinion as to  whether

or not it still supported the P.A.P. and, what was more important to the

P.A.P.     Ministers at that time, to allow the P.A.P. to find  out  the  actual

strength  of the various electoral divisions because, if the result  of  certain

divisions  came  back showing a heavy majority margin in favour of  the  P.A.P.,

those were the seats that would be considered very "safe" seats and those with a

not so clear majority margin for the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



would be less "safe" seats and those with an uncertain majority margin would  be

considered third-class "unsafe" seats. Consequent on that, I also mentioned  the

fact  that the original intention of the P.A.P. was to pose one question to  the

people -   namely,  "Do  you  support the P.A.P. or  do  you  support  the  P.A.P.

Government?" and the answer was supposed to come back with a simple yes or no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some time when there was widespread opposition to the sell-out that we

had  exposed, the P.A.P. switched their original intention and decided  to  pose

two  questions  to the people instead. I pointed out that that  switch  occurred

before the National Referendum Bill had its First Reading in the House. At  that

time,  Sir,  as I have already said, the intention was to have a snap referendum

posing two unacceptable questions to the people with complete prohibition of can

vassing. But since then, the P.A.P. had realised that the posing of two unaccept

able  questions to the people would result in a certain reaction and  that  reac

tion  would be translated into the return of blank or uncertain votes. And since

the  P.A.P. did  not like the people to know the exact number  of  those  blank

votes,  it was the intention of the P.A.P. not to let them know how they  voted.

Therefore,  the intention was to hide the shame of the P.A.P. from the  eyes  of

the people. At that stage of my speech, I was tracing the arguments which appear

in  column 388 of the Official Report of the Select Committee of 16th May, 1962,

and I wish to resume from where I left off. I was tracing the arguments that the

Ministers  gave in defence of not wanting the people to know the truth.  If  you

will  remember, Sir, at column 388, the Minister for Home Affairs  gave  various

excuses. First of all, he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...because the result, according to the proposed Schedule, would be declared

division  by  division whereas, as I think I have said earlier in  this  Select

Committee,  the  result o the referendum would be declared for  Singapore  as  a

whole.'



<br><br>That was the first excuse, Sir. The second excuse given was that the details  of

the Form were not in order. Then the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>





third excuse given was that it was

a general Referendum Bill. The fourth excuse given was:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The declaration of the result of the poll is an administrative matter, and it

is for the Superintendent to compile the statement in the form best suited for a

particular referendum.'



<br><br>The  last excuse given by the Minister for Home Affairs was again that it  is  a

general  Referendum Bill. I asked whether they accepted the principle  that  the

truth  and  the result should be clearly presented to the people, and in  column

389,  the  Minister for Home Affairs again said that it is a general  Referendum

Bill  and  he gave me the assurance "that whatever form the statement takes,  it

will be clear and understandable to the people".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these piddling objections were overcome in spite of the Minister for

Home Affairs repeating in column 392:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, I personally think it is impossible. In fact, I consulted

my  officials  on this matter and they advised against it, because  no  one  can

anticipate  what type of referendum or what kind of question will  be  posed  in

future, and it is difficult to design a set Form in the Schedule to this Bill.'



<br><br>Sir, all  these  excuses of it being impossible, difficult and unnecessary  and

leaving  the matter to the Superintendent can be summarised in one neat sentence

which  was used by the Member for Cairnhill, namely, "It allows flexibility  for

dishonest  manoeuvres."  In fact, Sir, all these excuses  came  to  nothing.  We

accepted  the  legitimate  excuse of the details  of  the  statement  not  being

correct.  If you will remember, Sir, even you, as Chairman, thought  that  there

was no political undercurrent. I refer you to column 391, Sir, where you said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If that is the only point of difference - I take it there is no political

undercurrent in this because if there is any political undercurrent, then I -'



<br><br>The Minister for Finance then said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am quite sure that both sides of the House are -'.

<br><br>Then you said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'At one. Can I suggest then that possibly instead of saying "number of ballot

papers  cast in the affirmative or negative," just say "number of ballot  papers

cast in respect of each question," and then the Member for Anson's amendment  to

the amendment to clause 29 will take care of how that is to be worded.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present amendment which I have moved to this clause embodies all the

suggestions made in Select Committee. If the Government were really  sincere  in

those objections appearing in the pages of the Official Report, then they cannot

say  that they do not want to accept our amendment today. But of course we  must

always remember that there is in the background this P.A.P. referendum plot - the

plot  of stealing the votes of the people and calling those votes as "supporting

the  P.A.P.". Alt this can be revealed in the words of the Minister for Finance.

When we pressed for the result to be known, he said in column 393 - somewhere  in

the middle:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...we are absolutely going to give no undertaking on the manner in which the

results will be announced.'



<br><br>Of course, he gave his reasons, but they have all been rebutted.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present Bill clause 29, sub-clause (2) says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The number of such ballot papers shall be included by the Superintendent in

his declaration of the result of the referendum.'



<br><br>I  mentioned  that the word "included" was very vague. But, of course,  we  have

learnt  since that it was meant to be vague. The fact that I did not  know  that

the actual detailed results would not he announced did not show that we were the

only people to have been bluffed. I must mention the Straits Times editorial  of

4th June, 1962. The editorial referred to the Referendum Bill. The last sentence

of the second paragraph in the third column reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These "votes" [that is, the blank and uncertain votes] will be declared by

the Superintendent of the referendum in a category of their own.'



<br><br>That shows, Sir, that even the Straits Times editorial writer was confused;  the

Straits  Times  editorial writer did not know the intention  of  the  Government

really  was  not to reveal the exact details of the voting of the referendum  to

the people. Of course, the true intention is as I will now outline.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer you, Sir, to the Plebeian of 8th June, 1962 (that is our official

Party Paper), at page 4, col. 6, where I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To ensure that no one will even know the exact number of blank and uncertain

ballot  papers, there will be no provision for blank and uncertain votes  to  be

counted separately.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have been following Members who have read extracts from

certain documents, and I think a line must be drawn somewhere. If, in fact, this

statement which is now being read is the Member's own statement, I do not  think

he  ought to read it from any document. He should now tell the Assembly what his

own  view is of the whole matter and not something which he has himself  written

down on paper.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will, therefore, not quote from the Plebeian, but instead

tell  you  the plot of the P.A.P. which has been exposed by us. Sir,  when  they

talk  of declaration of the result of the referendum, there was no intention  of

letting  the people know the exact number of votes that have been cast  for  the

P.A.P. nor the number of votes that are blank, nor the number of votes that  are

uncertain  or other votes. They intend to mix all the blank and uncertain  votes

from the various divisions, together with the votes supporting the P.A.P. merger

proposals  and  then in the end make one single announcement  saying,  "So  many

hundreds  of  thousands of votes have been cast in favour of the  P.A.P. merger

proposals." In this way, Sir, even if only 10 per cent of the people really vote

for the P.A.P. and 90 per cent cast uncertain votes, the P.A.P. will be able  to

announce  to the world that 100 per cent of voters have voted in favour  of  the

P.A.P.'s  merger proposals. Then no one will be able to lodge any  objection  or

complaint  of unfairness because of lack of evidence, because nobody  will  know

the true state of affairs and also because nobody will know how many blank votes

there actually are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explains why the perfectly legitimate amendment moved by me to introduce

a  Form  in  the  Schedule for a statement of the results of the referendum  was

rejected by the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



Sir, in any election, there is a statement of the poll after the counting of the

ballots.  There  is  such a form - Form Election 17 - in the  Singapore  Legislative

Assembly Elections Ordinance (Chapter 53). There are similar forms for  a  statement  of  the  results of the poll in other countries. And any  government  with

nothing  to  hide need have no fear about publishing the results after  counting

the  ballots. In fact, as I have already indicated, it is the duty of all honest

governments to disclose everything there is to disclose to the scrutiny  of  the

people.  In  this  amendment, we merely ask for a statement to  show  the  exact

number of votes supporting propositions A, B, C or D; the number of blank votes;

the  number of uncertain votes; and the number of tendered votes. The people  of

Singapore have the right to know the true position - good or bad, favourable or

otherwise - so  that  anyone dissatisfied with the results of the  referendum  can

proceed  to  petition the Referendum Judge against the result of the  poll.  Now

there is provision for referendum petitions, but the true and honest results  of

the  count will be kept secret - conveniently kept secret-so that no one  will  be

able  to  complain to the Referendum Judge for lack of evidence. And, with  this

provision - the  discovery that came after nights of secret meetings  with  Machiavelli - the P.A.P. Ministers are now satisfied that the loophole of blank votes is

plugged.  The  arguments put forward by the Ministers in Select  Committee  only

show the Fascist thinking of their whole makeup.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance under pressure had to say that he would not be wil ling to reveal the manner in which the results would be announced. When we

pressed  him further, he said that he would not only not reveal the  results  of

the voting but also reserve the right to disclose or not to disclose the results

of  the  voting.  I  refer  you, Sir, to col. 471  [Official  Report  of  Select

Committee of 17th May, 1962], where you said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The point made by the Minister for Finance is that the Government, I think,

reserves to itself the right either to disclose or not to disclose the number of

uncertain and unmarked votes. That is a fair statement of what the Minister  for

Finance says. That is all.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



And  the Minister for Finance heartily agreed. He said, "Yes". No Government  if

it  calls itself democratic will ever reserve to itself the right to disclose or

not to disclose the result of the voting. Only dictators will do that. This is a

concrete  example of the Fascist streak in our Ministers. And yet  the  Minister

for Health and Law had earlier on said - on the first day, I think - that he wanted

to base our Referendum Bill on the general parliamentary Practice of the British

system. Which British system ever says that the government reserves its right to

disclose or not to disclose? Which British system says that the results  of  the

voting  must  not  be  disclosed  to the people?  Can  the  Minister  quote  any

precedent?  Can he give any example of such a state of affairs? I  see  that  he

cannot even answer. He cannot even look up, because -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Who told you that?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have already said time and again that Members are

addressing the Chair and not Ministers on the Opposite Benches. Whether they are

looking  down or looking up makes no difference. It is the Chair the  Member  is

addressing.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This was a shameful state of affairs, Sir. So shameful that

even  the Member for Cairnhill suddenly woke up. At column 472, in the last  two

lines, the Member for Cairnhill said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...if it is going to be an embarrassment to the Government, they will not

declare. If it is not so, then they will declare.'



<br><br>And to add to the shameful record, the Minister for Finance said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the record, there is nothing for the Government to be embarrassed about.'



<br><br>Of  course, they have nothing to be embarrassed about. They are now  so  thick-skinned  that  they  will do anything. They have no more  principles  left.  The

Minister  for Finance himself admitted that all these provisions were  based  on

unconstitutional and illegal principles. What else have they got to say?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> If you are not thick-skinned, you should have resigned!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All these shameful revelations, Sir, only prove one point.

The PA.P. Ministers have always contended that it is the Communists who want  to

destroy  democracy. They call on the Communist bogey and hope  to  frighten  the

people  of  Singapore. But this Bill has proved to the hilt that it is  not  the

Communist bogey that is destroying democracy in Singapore, it is those  Fascists

who  hold power and who do not know how to practise democracy who are destroying

the very foundations of democracy in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, Sir, there is widespread apprehension in the whole of

Singapore.  There  is already the Council of Joint Action of Opposition  Parties

both  inside and outside the Assembly. The Council of Joint Action have  already

mapped out a programme of action, but it looks as if the Government may want  to

put  obstacles in the way of the Council of Joint Action. Let them  not  prevent

legitimate and constitutional means of opposition from the people. If the people

are  denied their peaceful and constitutional means of expression, then all  the

P.A.P.  Ministers  as  well  as  the  Back  Benchers  will  have  to  bear  full

responsibility for their provocative action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> What action?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not think I need explain further, Sir, except to give

one  final quotation to remind the Minister for Home Affairs of what he said  on

the  14th of March. 1962, during the Second Reading of the Bill. On page  2,  at

the third paragraph [Vol. 17, No. I col. 68]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With regard to the procedure for the holding of a referendum, the procedure

has  been  largely  based  and  modelled on  the  provisions  of  the  Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance ...'.



<br><br>I  have  moved the amendment, Sir, entirely based and modelled on the  Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance. Then at the fifth line from







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



the end of the same paragraph [col. 69]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the Superintendent shall declare the result of the referendum and in

accordance with clause 29 he shall forthwith, after the result has been declared

by him, compile a statement of the referendum and shall cause the said statement

to be published in the Gazette.'



<br><br>That statement, Sir, is in the amendment which I have moved in the Schedule. May

I  quote you again, Sir, on page 3, paragraph 3 [col. 70]? The Minister at  that

time  was talking about amendments moved by the Opposition. He said at the third

sentence of the third paragraph on page 3 [col. 70]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Firstly, those amendments which intend ostensibly to ensure propriety in the

conduct of the referendum, the Government is prepared to accept.'



<br><br>I do not think the Minister can ever contest that my amendment is entirely meant

to ensure propriety in the conduct of the referendum. Further on, Sir, somewhere

in the middle of the same paragraph, he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'However, in order that there can he no doubt about the propriety of the

conduct  of  the referendum, the Government accepts the amendments  [of  puffing

things like polling agents, and allowing polling agents to affix their seals] -'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was under the impression that the hon. Member was

quoting.  I cannot see "puffling" mentioned in the Hansard. I think he ought  to

quote and then say that they are puffling, if he thinks they are puffling.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I quote, Sir, somewhere in the middle of the paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'However, in order that there can be no doubt about the propriety of the

conduct  of the referendum, the Government accepts the amendments of the  Member

for Queenstown...'.



<br><br>Then  he  went  on  to say that he would accept the amendments  with  regard  to

polling  agents,  to allow polling agents to affix their seals.  And  the  final

quotation from the Minister for Home Affairs. On page 4 [col. 71], in the  first

paragraph, somewhere in the lower third paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the Government has accepted the amendment of the Member for Queenstown so

that no one can question the propriety of the referendum.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>

Sir,  if  they  do not want to declare the result in detail to the people,  then

everyone  will query the propriety of the referendum. I have already  challenged

them  to produce any precedents where other countries do not let the people know

the  result of the voting. I do not think they will be able to produce a  single

one.  We  have repeatedly said, Sir, that we want an honest, a just and  a  fair

referendum. Let the people know exactly what happens, it looks as if the  P.A.P.

want  to  steal the votes of the people and not want the people to know, because

they fear the temper of the people against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only ten per cent of the votes support the P.A.P. and if 90 per cent of the

votes  are  blank or uncertain votes, as a result of two unacceptable  questions

posed  in  the referendum, then the P.A.P. hope to declare to the world  that  a

hundred per cent of the people support their merger proposals. 'The only snag is

that they just do not want the people to know that they have pinched 90 per cent

of  the  people's  votes.  That is the dishonesty in  the  P.A.P.  It  shows  up

everywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Back Benches, I would tell them this. If the Front Benches persist in

this  dishonesty, and the Back Benches abide by this dishonesty and support them

in this dishonesty -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must stop

this  intimidation of the Back Benchers. The Back Benchers are there  to  decide

according  to  their conscience what they should do, and I do not  think  it  is

right  for  any  Opposition Member to voice any veiled threats or  indicate  any

veiled intimidation in their speeches.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is no intention to intimidate, Sir. I just want to

remind  them  of their responsibility to the people. That is all. Nothing  else,

Sir.  Anyway,  I  will close now by saying one thing: that  the  result  of  the

referendum in detail must be divulged. The Government have a duty to inform  the

people and the people have a right to know. If the Government want to show  that

they  are  responsible in this respect, then there is no reason why they  cannot

accept the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been moved as an amendment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A11, line 13, to leave out "declare" and insert "announce the result

of  the  voting  in  detail electoral division by electoral division  before  he

declares".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated the other day, the debate may range over the suggested amendment

to clause 30:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 25, at end, to add "Such statement shall be, as near as may

be, in the Form in the Second Schedule to this Ordinance.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate will then range over the proposed Second Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the opinion of the Members of this side  of  the  House  has

already been made known to the people at various meetings, rallies and forums in

regard to the matter under debate in this House. What I want to say now is  that

democracy does not mean that everybody must make a noise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also heard the arguments from Members of the Opposition, especially

the  Members of the Barisan Sosialis. It would appear that the argument of every

Member  is the same. They are just like repeating gramophones, so much  so  that

many  people would not even turn to look at the newspapers. That was why I  said

just now that  I would not add too much to that.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown mentioned at the meeting of Parliamentary

Secretaries  that  there was a secret discussion between the  Parliamentary  Secretaries

and the Prime Minister relating to certain safe seats. That is  why  I

avail myself of this opportunity to tell the House something of that. Of course,

the  Prime  Minister used to have an exchange of views with  the  Ministers  and

sometimes  with the Parliamentary Secretaries. Sometimes we had  a  cup  of  tea

together  and,  sometimes, when we were hungry, of course, we  would  take  some

food.  But  these occasions were termed by those turncoats now  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  as  certain  secret dealings. That is a most shameful  way  of  saying

things.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can all remember that during the Hong Lim by-election those so-called

heroes opposite us were all P.A.P. Members. They used to say that they were  100

per  cent loyal to the P.A.P. They also said that the P.A.P. was a 100 per  cent

good  and honest Government. In the Hong Lim by-election, the question  we  were

faced  with  was whether we should resign because at that time many sections  of

the  people were of the opinion that the P.A.P. should resign. But certain other

sections of the people were of the opinion that we should not resign. The  Prime

Minister  then consulted the opinions of all the Parliamentary Secretaries.  You

all  remember that at that time there was no such concept as Malaysia.  At  that

time, the P.A.P. leadership was of the opinion that there was only a meagre hope

of  merger.  We did not see much possibility of having a merger and  we  thought

that  if  we were to continue to govern, it would be difficult for us to justify

ourselves to the people. Everybody understood that. Certain of those people  who

are  now opposite did not want to resign. I myself also did not know why certain

Parliamentary Secretaries did not want to resign at that time. We also discussed

at  that time certain things, but they were not relevant to the holding  of  the

national  referendum,  because Tunku Abdul Rahman only  mentioned  the  Malaysia

concept at the foreign correspondents' luncheon. The Parliament gave support  in

principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Hong Lim by-election, we disclosed officially our principles relating to merger, education and labour. But the holding of a national referendum

was something that originated later on, and, therefore, it was wrong to say that

we were trying to make use of this national referendum for our own purposes. The

impression  I  got  from  the  meeting was that  it  was  a  secret  meeting  of

Parliamentary  Secretaries and the Prime Minister. It  was  held  at  the  Prime

Minister's Office. I also attended the meeting. The atmosphere was that  certain

Parliamentary  Secretaries, especially the Member for Queenstown,  were  of  the

opinion that if the Prime Minister resigned, then the







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



Parliamentary  Secretaries  should take over the  reins  of  government.  I  was

shocked to hear that. The leaders of our Party -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know how this is relevant to the amendment. The

Parliamentary Secretary has made his point. He has answered the allegation  that

there was talk about a referendum being held to gain safe seats. I think he  has

answered  that point. Now he is going into details which will open out a  debate

which is completely irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am not prepared to go into details to disclose the  details

of  that  meeting. What I want to say is that at that time there was  already  a

plot  underway to take over the reins of government. Therefore, the  Member  for

Queenstown mentioned that we had a meeting for the purpose of finding  out  safe

seats  for  the  Ministers and to say that this had something  to  do  with  the

holding of the national referendum. But I will rebut it as nonsense. If what  he

had  said  was true, then why from the Anson by-election up to now did he  never

mention it? Mr Speaker, Sir, the result of this national referendum is based on

one  or  two questions posed to the people and is, of course, different  from  a

general election. Because during a general election the people may want to elect

individuals and may not elect a Party. Because, perhaps, some political  Parties

may  be  strong,  then people in certain constituencies may want  to  vote  such

political  Parties.  But others may want to vote individuals.  That  is  why  we

cannot mix these two issues together. We cannot mix a national referendum with a

general  election  together.  That  is why the  general  result  of  a  national

referendum can reflect generally the views of the general populace.  On  this  I

would add that the Barisan Sosialis have been in the habit of accusing us of not

willing  to  let  the people have a chance of freedom, i.e.,  to  express  their

opinions  and  views.  We  should know that everybody here,  including  everyone

outside, and all political Parties have agreed that we should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>

have  a  merger. Now, if we ask only one question, whether they want  the  White

Paper  merger, then, according to the Barisan, they will say no; then  it  will

mean there will be no merger. That is why -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon.

Member  has gone away from the amendment. The amendment merely seeks to  suggest

that  the  Superintendent  should  make a  declaration  of  the  result  of  the

referendum in detail electoral division by electoral division. We have completed

the debate on whether there should be a yes or no.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I mentioned that I wanted only to add something more.  I  did

not  intend  to carry on with details. The Member for Queenstown a little  while

ago  said  I  mentioned a certain so-called Tripartite Joint Action Council.  We

never  thought the Barisan could have been of such stuff without a stand of  its

own.  Because during the Hong Lim by-election, Mr Ong Eng Guan also  criticised

that  the  Liberal  Socialists were a pro-Western,  capitalist  and  colonialist

Party.  But today, for the purpose of making use of a political Party,  they  do

not care whether a Party is pro-capitalist or pro-colonialist. They now want  to

co-operate with such political Parties. All those who have read stories relating

to Hitler and Fascists in Germany can understand what is meant by Fascism, it is

strange  that the words and phrases used and the meanings in relation  to  those

phrases  could  only  be found in their dictionaries. If  we  were  Fascists,  I

believe  the  Member  for  Queenstown and the  representatives  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis would not be so free nowadays to hold rallies and conduct meetings  and

shout here and there. Perhaps they might have vanished without a trace. If  they

want  to talk about democracy and if they want to show that they really want  to

preserve and uphold parliamentary democracy, I believe they will not have  given

aid  secretly  to  students  to  prevent other  students  from  going  into  the

examination  centres  to sit for their examination, if that  is  their  kind  of

democracy -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Now, that is irrelevant. Let us come back to the amendment.



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I was just mentioning those points in passing in order to  re

fute  their  accusation that we are dictatorial. To sum up, I am of the  opinion

that the Member for Queenstown is trying to avail himself of this opportunity in

this  House to create trouble and to accuse us of using this national referendum

to  prepare  to  secure  safe seats for Ministers. All this  talk  from  him  is

nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, quite frankly I do not understand this amendment. If I  may  read

it. It says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'to leave out "declare" and insert "announce the result of the voting in

detail electoral division by electoral division before he declares".'



<br><br>3.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the general effect is that if the amendment is carried, you get this

position.  There are 51 electoral divisions in Singapore. One could  reach  this

position - 26  divisions  in favour of the proposition, 25 divisions  against  the

proposition, and yet the votes cast in favour of the proposition in 26 divisions

could  be less than those cast in the 25 divisions. And vice versa it could  hap

pen  the  other  way, Mr Speaker. So that you could get the position  where  26

divisions favour, from a division point of view, the proposition; yet the number

of  votes cast in those 26 divisions could be very much less; and the votes cast

in  the  25 divisions could be very much more. Surely the position is an  absurd

one.  Now, this is a referendum, Mr Speaker, Sir,It is to ascertain  how  many

people - counting  heads -   are  for a proposition  and  how  many  are  against  a

proposition. It may be that in one division 90 per cent of the electorate  might

be  against it and only 10 per cent for it. And yet on a count of the  electoral

population throughout Singapore the majority of the population might be for  it,

so  that  the  exercise  here  is not to ascertain division  by  division  which

division  is in favour of the proposition, but to find out how many more  people

favour the proposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>

than  are  against  it. So on that basis it seems to me, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

effect  of this amendment could mean that we might get to a situation  where  26

divisions are against it and 25 are for it, and yet on votes counted, the result

could  be  otherwise.  I  do  not know what the  intention  of  the  Member  for

Queenstown was - whether the whole purpose of this amendment was merely  to  force

the Government into categorising votes. I suppose what he wanted was to know the

number  of blank papers. He wanted a count on that. He wanted to know the number

of  spoilt papers. He wanted a count on that. He wanted a count on votes  "for".

He  wanted  a  count on votes "against". But the way he has moved the  amendment

merely  brings about a situation where we get the position as I have delineated,

and that position would be most undesirable.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You will see, Sir, that the P.A.P. Ministers dare not

answer  our points and it has to be left to the Member for Farrer Park to answer

for the P.A.P. We have already said -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am not a Member of the Government -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it on a

point of

order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - so how can I answer for the Government?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On a point of order, yes, Mr Speaker. Is it proper for the Member

for Queenstown to accuse me of being in the Government when I am not?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think the Member for Queenstown has accused the Member

for  Farrer Park of being in the Government. I think he alleges that the  Member

for Farrer Park is, in fact, speaking on behalf of the Government which can,  of

course, be controverted by the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That was my point, Sir. The Member for Farrer Park is now

speaking  on behalf of the Government, and the Ministers of the Government  dare

not even get up to speak on their own behalf.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Surely that is a misrepresentation. We are in Committee

and  if the Member for Queenstown had been patient, I am sure that perhaps  two

or  three  Ministers might have stood up. I do not know. But he Cannot say  that

the Ministers dare not get up. We are in Committee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> However, Sir, I think the Member for Farrer Park did not

hear  any explanation the other night of how the P.A.P. intended to get the safe

seats  for  the  Ministers. Since he was not present and since the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education is also querying, let me explain  again,

Sir, how this plot came into being. As I said, at that particular time -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> If you allow that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was under the impression that Members of this Assembly

at  least know the Standing Orders well enough, if a Member rises on a point  of

order,  he cannot speak unless the Speaker sees that no other Member is  on  his

feet.  So if the Parliamentary Secretary is rising on a point of order, he  just

says "On a point of order," and the Member for Queenstown must sit down. Is it a

point of order?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> The Member

for Queenstown has already explained in detail the so-called reasons even though

the Member for Farrer Park was not here. I ask you, Sir, whether it is right  to

repeat the same thing.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Standing Order, of course, says that there shall be no re

petition  if  that repetition is tedious, and I do not know whether  the  tedium

carries  on from Friday night. I am not quite certain. But I ask the Member  for

Queenstown to spare the Assembly any repetition which is unnecessary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the objection of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education shows

how sore they are on this particular point -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Parliamentary Secretary was perfectly entitled to

rise on a point of order. Whether he is sore or not makes no difference. I think

we  have had enough of this "plot" which really is irrelevant. This part of  the

"plot",  I  think, is irrelevant to the motion we are now discussing,  which  is

whether  or  not,  in fact, details of the returns should be  published  by  the

Superintendent.  I  think I have indicated that the debate can  range  over  the

amendment proposed to' clause 30 which sets out the details required in the  pro

posed Second Schedule. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not intend to repeat the story in toto, Sir, but just

to  let  the  Member for Farrer Park understand because he seems to be  under  a

misapprehension.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I have heard it all, Mr Speaker, I -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He was giving examples of certain divisions. He was giving - I cannot remember the figures - 30 against 25, or something like that, But he

has missed the point. What we want are the detailed results in order to show the

actual strength of the voting. What we want to know is how many people in  every

division  have supported the P.A.P.? How many people have cast uncertain  votes?

How  many  people have cast blank votes? And how many people have supported  the

alternative  which the Government is proposing to the people?  That  is  all  we

want,  Sir,It makes no difference. It does not say that we want to know  which

division is won and which division is lost. All we want is a declaration of  the

results in detail. That is all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



And  that explains how the P.A.P. hopes to get the safe seats for the Ministers.

Because  depending  on  the  majority margin,  they  will  know  which  are  the

strongholds  of the P.A.P. and which are the weak supports. And, mind  you,  the

plot  about this is that only the Government Ministers will know and no one else

will know, not even the Back Benchers of the other side. Only the Ministers will

know. That is the nub of my story and I

can see that none of them has dared to deny it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Why do you not give us a chance to speak?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to mention one thing, Sir, because the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education has jibed at  the  Barisan

Sosialis  for joining the other political Parties in Singapore. Let me  explain.

It  is a very important principle. It is not that we have changed our stand.  It

is  that  all of us in Singapore, irrespective of our political stand,  have  to

fight  for the survival of democracy in Singapore. It is because of that - let  me

read  to  you,  Sir, a small section of the Common Declaration by  the  Liberal-Socialist  Party, the Barisan Sosialis, the Party Raayat, the United  Democratic

Party and the Workers' Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Towkay Party of -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I can table this

afterwards. It says: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A call to the citizens of Singapore. We

the   Liberal-Socialist  Party,  Barisan  Sosialis,  Party  Raayat,  the  United

Democratic  Party  and the Workers' Party, now comprising the Council  of  Joint

Action,  being fully aware of the desperate efforts of the P.A.P. Government  to

force  through  the  undemocratic Referendum Bill,  hereby  declare  our  common

objects. One, to channelise all Opposition

views  on matters of national importance. Two, to demolish once and for all  the

P.A.P. smear  that  all  those opposing the P.A.P. Government  are  Communists,

Communist stooges or racialists.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think I can allow the whole document to be read.

It  is completely irrelevant to what the Member is doing. I am sure he will have

the opportunity on some other occasion to inform Members of this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>

House  of the contents of that document, but I think he has made his point.  Let

us come back to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If you will allow me, Sir, there is only one paragraph and

it is the vital paragraph which has got to be got across to the Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it relevant?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is very relevant to the question that he put, Sir. And

the  third  objective - it  is  only a few lines - to  prove  to  the  people  of

Singapore  that political Parties in Singapore are conscious of their  duty,  to

sink their individual political differences in times of national crisis in order

to preserve the basic human democratic rights of all citizens and to counteract

constitutionally and peacefully all the facets of Government actions to  mislead

and  to  force  through the undemocratic Referendum Bill  and  the  White  Paper

proposals.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are now dealing with detailed announcements by the

Superintendent. I do not know how the hon. Member can say that what he reads  is

relevant  to  the  issue whether or not the Superintendent is to  make  detailed

announcements as shown in the proposed Schedule. Number of ballot papers issued.

Number  of ballot papers cast. Number of unmarked ballot papers cast. Number  of

uncertain  ballot  papers  cast. Number of tendered  ballot  papers.  And  those

numbers are asked for each electoral division.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the last bit that I read out to you was

in  direct answer to the query from the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for Education. That is all, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we heard stories of plots behind this

Referendum Bill as given by the Member for Queenstown last Friday and also  this

afternoon,  And  in  view of what he has said about this plot,  this  evil  plot

behind  this  Referendum Bill, I think you will permit me a few minutes  to  run

briefly  through this so-called plot. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member  for  Queenstown  alleged last Friday and also this afternoon that the threat to  resign  by

the P.A.P. Government was not sincere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, how can he say that this intention to resign was not serious when he, more than anyone of the 13 present Barisan Assemblymen, came kneeling to us

and  begged us not to resign? Further, all the 38 trade unions of the SATU group

appealed  through the Press and their couriers to persuade us not to resign.  If

the  threat  was not real or serious, then why all this bother? All  the  P.A.P.

traitors now in the Barisan Sosialis said, with one voice at that time, that  we

as  a Government should ignore public opinion. They said that so long as we were

working  sincerely  for  the  people we should  proceed  with  the  business  of

government  in spite of some dissatisfaction expressed by the people because  of

malicious  rumour and unfounded criticisms spread by our opposition.  They  said

that  the  people would understand in time that what we were doing was  for  the

long-term  interests of the people. So, far from our being afraid to go  to  the

people, the 13 traitors now in the Barisan Sosialis were genuinely anxious about

their  political future and fearful of the prospects of losing their  status  as

Parliamentary Secretaries and Assemblymen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown alleged that if the number of

unmarked  and  uncertain ballot papers is not announced, then the referendum  is

improper.  The  Member  for Queenstown is only specifically  interested  in  the

number  of  unmarked  and  uncertain ballot papers.  Obviously  the  Member  for

Queenstown  has failed to notice that it has been specifically provided  for  in

the  Bill  that  unmarked or uncertain ballot papers shall be deemed  to  be  in

support  of the decision of the Assembly on the matter referred for the  referen

dum.  This is found in clause 29. It is also provided that the number of  ballot

papers  shall be included by the Superintendent in his declaration of the result

of the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are in black and white for the public to see. There is nothing

secret about it. The meaning of unmarked and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



uncertain  ballot  papers is known beforehand. If there  are  people  who  still

persist in casting their votes in this manner, then they should be well aware of

the way in which their votes will be treated. Where is the unfairness of it all?

How can the Member for Queenstown call these Fascist methods?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in calling us Fascists, the Member for Queenstown evidently

understands very little of the behaviour of Fascists. I have no doubt that in  a

very  short while he will swallow back this term, just as he had swallowed  back

the  term "neo-colonialist". We have not heard the term "neo-colonialist"  being

used  again.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Fascists do not do things in  public.  They

believe  in  secret trials. The Fascists are not in the habit  of  talking  with

their  opponents across the Floor. They have a simple way of dealing with  their

opponents, and that is to line up all the opponents against the wall  and  shoot

them.  How  can the Member for Queenstown call us Fascists when we  are  talking

with  them  across the Floor? And which shows how democratic we are! We  allowed

him to speak for 7½ hours in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> You

cannot stop him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Then the Member for Queenstown talked of the Council of

Joint  Action. Mr Speaker, it is quite typical of the pro-Communists  to  steal

the  name  of  some respectable organisation and claim it to be their  own.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, probably you are well aware that the Council of Joint Action,  20

years  ago,  was a combination of progressive elements and progressive  parties.

They had one specific objective, and that was to fight against colonialism.  But

today we see the kind of Council of Joint Action that they have. They have among

them  a  pro-colonial Right-wing reactionary Party, in the name of the  Liberal-Socialists. But it is quite common, Mr Speaker, Sir, for all pro-Communists  or

phoney  socialists  to sacrifice whatever lofty principles  they  have  for  the

ultimate interests, even to the extent of joining up with a pro-colonial  Right-wing reactionary Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have said that there is a difference between a national

referendum and a general election. In the case of a national referendum, no

candidates are involved; only national issues are concerned. In the case of a

general election, I can see the necessity of announcing the results, division by

division, because there will be several candidates competing with one another in

each of the electoral divisions. But I fail to see the necessity in the case of

a national referendum to announce the results division by division, because the

issue involved is a national issue, not an issue concerning any particular elec

toral division. It is the total results that count and not the results of each

particular division.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Second Schedule that was designed by the Member for

Queenstown. As I have said in Select Committee, this Form is not suitable for a

national referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> In this particular Schedule designed by the Member for

Queenstown, rejected ballot papers are not mentioned in the statement. Is the

Member for Queenstown thinking that the rejected ballot papers should not be

announced?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> By "rejected" ballot papers, does the Minister mean spoiled

ballot papers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes, rejected by the Superintendent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Spoiled ballot papers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> They will be spoiled.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a line there "Number of spoiled ballot papers". I do

not know whether -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> There is a

slight difference.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, I just want to put the record straight. That is all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> After a lot of

arguments, we all agreed that tendered

ballot papers should not be counted.

But here we see in the Schedule that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>

tendered ballot papers are to be included in the statement. As I have said just

now, clause 29 states that all unmarked and uncertain votes will be regarded as

willing to accept the Assembly's decision on the matter referred for the

referendum and therefore they will be included amongst the votes in favour of

the decision of the Assembly. So I see no necessity of having a separate item

for unmarked ballot papers and uncertain ballot papers.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have this afternoon received from the Office

of the Attorney-General of Western Samoa a letter and certain documents which

may be of assistance to this House. I will read two very brief passages, and

then the document which particularly affects the amendment now being discussed.

It was dated 25th June (last week):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A plebiscite was held under the authority of the Western Samoan Plebiscite Order, 1961.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I again remind the Member that that is being

translated?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A plebiscite was held under the authority of the Western Samoan Plebiscite

Order, 1961, a New Zealand Order-in-Council which was drafted in New Zealand,

but, perused in some respects and amended in the office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the United Nations group that came here for some weeks to report

on the manner in which it was conducted was quite satisfied that the people had

been given every chance to express their true feelings in the matter.'



<br><br>Sir, I shall be tabling this because I think the documents may be of interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Acting Attorney-General, Mr Penlington, was good enough to send me a

document "Plebiscite Form 20 - Instructions to Plebiscite Returning Officers, Deputy Returning Officers, and Polling Clerks on the conduct of the poll

pursuant to Western Samoan Plebiscite Order, 1961". I want to read only one

paragraph, Sir, that is, paragraph 31 - "Results of the Poll":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As soon as the number of votes recorded for and against each proposal has

been ascertained, the Deputy Returning Officer shall announce the results of

the vote counted at his polling booth, and then fill in the card



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



"Preliminary  Results"  included in your booth supplies.  Pin  tip  "Preliminary

Results"  card  in a prominent place outside the polling booth for  the  general

information of the public.'



<br><br>So  you  see, Sir, not only were the results declared division by division,  but

also booth by booth. And finally what were the details?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Returning Officers who have received instructions to radio the results to the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Returning Officer need only state in the radiogram the booth number,

the  number of votes recorded for or against each proposal, and the  number  of

informal  votes  recorded  for  each  proposal.  Specimen  telegram  is   shown

hereunder :-

<pre>

   'Chief Returning Officer, APIA [that is the town, Sir], Booth No....



      Proposal 1         For .....................

                         Against .................



      Proposal 2         For .....................

                         Against .................



      Informal [that is to say, void papers] .....



      Total Voting Papers counted ................



                                 (Signed) SMITH'

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Farrer Park is a little concerned at the theoretical possibility. But I indicated that the fact that the majority of the

divisions - shall  we say, the majority of the divisions are  against  the  White

Paper; but the majority of the citizens are in favour - are  against the White Paper would have no legal effect. It is a  question  of

the majority of the people.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of having the results

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- and this would concern, shall we say, Sir, the major Parties in this House

rather  than  those  of us at the back of this side of the  House - is  that  'lie

Government  being in possession through its Superintendent of information  which

would  indicate the divisions which may be favourable to them, such  information

should  also be available to the other major Parties who may wish to plan  their

election campaigns which would be coming after the polling with reference to the

merger  referendum. That seems to me the entire issue, Sir. It is not  vital  in

itself.  What is important, Sir, is that you have referred us, and permitted  us

to refer, to the Second Schedule. Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs, whose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



pathetic  ineptitude was so classically displayed in this Assembly last  Friday

afternoon,  has  forgotten  that  before  the  Select  Committee,  he  protested

vehemently  that  that Schedule was inappropriate because  this  was  a  general

Referendum Bill. Today he puts up another equally pathetic effort at saying that

it  is  not  applicable because he wants to delete one line and insert  another.

Sir,  I  would  like  to  say  this. I am not associated  with  this  particular

Schedule. If the Government were to indicate that they accept an amendment  to

the  amendment  to  delete "Number of tendered ballot papers" and  therefore  to

substitute  "Number of rejected ballot papers", I would be very happy  to  offer

such  an  amendment.  Only,  Sir, by now I will not  waste  my  breath  on  the

Government. I know their dishonesty. I know their lack of sincerity. I know that

they merely want to find specious excuses. If that is all they wanted they could

have done it themselves. That is just a piece of humbug - another smokescreen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has now been made clear that it is not acceptable to the Government to

have  the  unmarked  or  uncertain ballot papers numbered.  They  say  that  the

Superintendent  must be allowed to count them surreptitiously and  add  them  to

whichever  he  thinks  is the Assembly decision. It is a curious  position.  The

Superintendent  is  the one who is to decide where all the blank  and  uncertain

ballot  papers go; no doubt under the direct controlled supervision and guidance

of  the  Minister.  Are we to understand that in this particular  instance  the

Minister  will  have his finger in the pie and tell him where  to  attach  those

blank and uncertain votes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tells you, "How can I be a Fascist?" In the classic words of the gentleman

who  says  that his Party is not racialist, our Prime Minister, and who publicly

in  the  University  said.  "If I were a Fascist, the final  solution  to  David

Marshall  would have been achieved long ago."; using, Sir, the classic words  of

Hitler  with  reference  to the Jewish people. That is the  non-racialist  Prime

Minister  who complains of others being racialist. Now the answer to  the  Prime

Minister is not that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



he has a kind heart. The very fact that he can conceive of so obscene a parallel

and  would wish to lust for Hitler's powers is an indication that he is far from

having  any  decency  left. It is merely that he has a  lack  of  power  because

Singapore  still  works  under a constitution, and under that  constitution  the

powers  of the Prime Minister and of our pathetic Minister for Home Affairs  are

limited - not  too  limited,  but limited in certain respects.  They  cannot,  for

example, prevent us in the Opposition, if there are two of us who want to debate

a motion, from debating a motion. It is no thanks to their kind hearts that they

are  listening to us here. They are compelled to, by virtue of the constitution.

But I want you to notice when he says, "How can we be Fascists? The people know,

and if they insist that they want to cast blank votes, they know in advance that

they will count for the Government P.A.P.

proposals. So how can we be Fascists?"

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, if the P.A.P. pass a law that anybody who  wears  spectacles

shall  go to prison. Does that make it legitimate, a democratic law that  people

shall  not  wear spectacles because they know in advance that if  they  do  wear

spectacles, they will go to prison? That makes them no Fascists. If they pass  a

law  to  say that anybody who worships in a Confucian temple shall go to prison.

Is that any the less Fascist because people know in advance that they will go to

prison  if  they seek to discharge their obligation to their Maker in accordance

with their conscience?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the issue here is not a particular amendment of the Member

for Queenstown which has no vital importance. Frankly, I could not care less, as

a  very  minor Party, whether I know the power strength of the different Parties

in the different divisions or not. I do not think that even if I have the honour

of being a member of a major Party, I would really care.

That is a matter for tacticians. That

is  a  matter  which  surely  the Front Benches  of  the  Opposition  should  be

particularly interested. No, Sir, the importance of this part of the  debate  is

centred round the Second Schedule. If

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>

you  will  remember, Sir, the entire, exclusive objection to that Schedule  from

the Minister for Law, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Home Affairs

in  the  Select  Committee, was directed to the fact  that  this  is  a  general

Referendum  Bill, which has now been completely given the lie  to  and  given  a

quietus with a most inelegant provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that that has been disposed of, we have got something new. They do not

like "Number of tendered ballot papers". They want the number of rejected ballot

papers.  That  is  very easy, Sir. When we come to clause 30, if  there  is  any

indication that they would rather not move an amendment to it themselves,  I  am

happy  to  move it. Let us have it right now. Would they accept the Schedule  if

that amendment is made? It is a simple question. I sit down for a simple, not  a

P.A.P. corkscrew, answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to a lot of "cock" from the Member for

Anson,  I  do not propose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am wondering whether the word

"cock" is parliamentary or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Minister

will  explain what he means by "cock" then I will decide whether or  not  it  is

parliamentary or unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is a lot of "hooey" if you will allow me to associate "cock"

with "hooey".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. "Hooey" is not the same as "chop suey", is it? Let us

forget all those words and get on with the business of the day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Chairman, the Member for Queenstown has made the astonishing

charge  that the absence of a direction to the Superintendent in sub-clause  (7)

of  clause  27 of the Bill that he should announce the result of the  voting  in

detail electoral division by electoral division before he declares the result of

the  referendum, serves to confirm certain inside knowledge he has of  a  P.A.P.

plot to use the referendum to find out where the Party is popular







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



and to reserve the popular seats for Ministers in a future general election, and

the  less popular seats for Parliamentary Secretaries and others. He claims that

the  Party  wants  this information to be suppressed. Hence  the  absence  of  a

direction  to the Superintendent so that it can hide this information  from  the

public  and  place  the Ministers in constituencies where the returns  are  most

favourable  to the Party, leaving the rest of the Party candidates to  fend  for

themselves  in the less favourable areas. I have so often heard him say  in  the

Assembly  that  the P.A.P. is doomed and has no following at  all,  having  been

completely eclipsed by the Barisan Sosialis, that it is strange to hear from the

lips  of the Member for Queenstown himself an admission that there is still  so

much  life in the Party as to make it worth while and possible for this plot  to

be sustained by the ruling clique in the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also asked, how could there be a recount if the

results  were not announced electoral division by electoral division before  the

result  was declared by the Superintendent? Sir, in the Select Committee on  the

Singapore  National  Referendum Bill, this point was taken and  the  Member  for

Anson  said  this in column 292, Official Report of the Select Committee  No.  5

dated 15th of May:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... any recount can only refer to a particular division by virtue of the

preceding provisions of clause 27.'



<br><br>The  Member  for  Anson  later moved an amendment to  restrict  the  recount  to

electoral divisions only before the Superintendent makes the declaration in case

the  counting agent proved to be difficult and demanded a recount of the  entire

51  electoral  divisions  for  no apparent reason.  The  Member  for  Cairnhill

disagreed that there should be an announcement of the result of voting electoral

division  by  electoral division, as counting stations were set up in  the  Bill

each  embracing a number of electoral divisions, and the Superintendent may want

to announce the results for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>

each  of  the counting stations before declaring the final result of the referendum. The Member for Anson also agreed that detailed results are never announced.

The  Minister  for Home Affairs said that this question of a recount  should  be

left  to  the  good  sense of the political Parties, and the  Member  for  Anson

withdrew  his  amendment  stating  that he  was  happy  if  the  Government  was

satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to the Second Schedule proposed by the Member for Queenstown, this is

an adaptation of the statement of the poll in Form Elections 17 in the Singapore

Legislative  Assembly  Elections Ordinance, it is  obvious  that  in  a  general

election  or  a  by-election,  as  there  is  a  contest  among  candidates   in

constituencies, a statement of the poll in the Form Elections 17 is necessary to

show  the  number  of votes cast in respect of each candidate for  each  of  the

electoral divisions -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is some difficulty in the translation. Will the Minister

be a bit slower?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> In a referendum there is no such contest and it is only necessary

for the Superintendent to show the total results of the referendum in respect of

the questions put to the electorate and any other details which he considers  to

be  necessary  in the statement which he is obliged to publish  in  the  Gazette

under the provisions of clause 30 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you look at Form Elections 17 of the Singapore Legisla

tive Assembly Elections Ordinance, the statement of the poll is given, electoral

division  by electoral division, and the Form provides for the number of  ballot

papers  which are issued to be indicated, and the number of ballot  papers  cast

for  each  candidate in the particular constituency: also the number of rejected

ballot papers are shown: the total number of ballot papers found in the box; the

number  of  unused ballot papers undetached from the books; and  the  number  of

spoiled  ballot papers. An indication is given in this Form of what  a  rejected

ballot is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Rejected ballot paper means a ballot paper which has been handed by the

presiding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>

officer to an elector to cast his vote but which at the close of the  poll,

has  been  found  in  the ballot box unmarked or so  improperly  marked  it

cannot he counted.'



<br><br>Now, a spoiled ballot paper is indicated

on the Form:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Spoiled ballot paper means a ballot paper which, on polling day, has

not  been  deposited in the ballot box, but has been found by the presiding

officer  to  be spoiled or improperly printed or which has been  handed  by

the  presiding  officer to an elector to cast his vote, and  (a)  has  been

spoiled in marking by the elector, and (b) has been handed back to the presiding officer and exchanged for another.'



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in a referendum the issue before the electorate is the

issue  of  the question or questions. And as there is no political  contest

amongst  candidates in constituencies, there is no reason  why  the  return

should  be  declared  division  by  division.  It  is  sufficient  for  the

Superintendent  of the referendum to publish a statement at  the  close  of

the  referendum  giving the information which he is required  to  do  under

clause 30 of the Bill.



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Health and Law has very conveniently

forgotten  to  deal  with the amendment moved to clause  30.  He  has  been

talking about the amendment to clause 27.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Member for Anson has stated, comparatively speaking, the

amendment to clause 30 is far more important than the one to clause  27.  I

merely wish to say a few words on the amendment to clause 30.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Prime Minister once said that blank votes and uncertain

votes  would only constitute a negligible percentage. That is not going  to

be  necessarily true in the case of a referendum, particularly in the  case

where  the  P.A.P. type of referendum is going to be held. In  the  general

elections  and  by-elections  in the past it  is  true  that  blank  votes,

uncertain  votes,  spoilt votes, votes recorded to be declared  void,  were

negligible. But in the referendum which the P.A.P. is proposing, where  two

unacceptable  alternatives are going to be posed, by their  own  admission,

where the people are not going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



be  given  their basic right to reject or abstain, the chances are that  the  un

marked votes are going to be predominant. Sir, this is not because a voter  does

not  want  to  exercise his right of voting for one of the propositions;  it  is

because  he is going to be faced with two propositions that he does not want  to

choose from.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was wondering whether the Member for Thomson would like

to  reserve  those remarks, which are in detail, until we come to  the  proposed

amendments to clause 29 themselves. It is the Member for Anson who suggests that

in  page  A12, line 19, after "be", to insert "counted and shall be separately".

So that sub-clause (2) of clause 29 will read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The number of such ballot papers [i.e., the unmarked and uncertain ballot

papers]  shall he counted and shall he separately included by the Superintendent

in his declaration of the result of the referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Member for Hong Lim has suggested an amendment, in page A12, line

19, to leave out "included" and insert "announced". So that that sub-clause will

read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The number of such ballot papers shall he announced by the Superintendent in

his declaration of the result of the referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering whether all those remarks could not properly be passed when we

come to those amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was, in fact, Mr Speaker, not causing any argument in favour of

the  amendments that you have mentioned. I was leading up to the point  to  show

actually why the Government is objecting to the amendment moved to clause 30, in

effect, why they are objecting to the Second Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Second Schedule here is merely to let the people know how many voters

have voted for proposition 1, proposition 2 or 3, or what have they, and to show

how  many  people  have  put  in unmarked ballot  papers.  The  reason  why  the

Government is objecting to this Second Schedule is that they know in their heart

of hearts -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Have they got any?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - if the referendum is held along the lines they suggest they want

to hold, the number of votes the Government proposition is going to get is going

to  be  negligible. Sir, if we take a concrete example, that in  the  event  the

Government are doing what they have already indicated that they will do, if  the

Government proposition - the Government White Paper - gets 10 per cent of the votes,

and  if the second proposition gets 40 per cent of the votes, and if 50 per cent

of  the votes are unmarked, then the Government will probably come out and  say,

"There  you are, the people of Singapore have supported the White Paper  merger.

60  per cent of the people have supported it." True, 60 per cent as declared  by

the  Superintendent. But that 60 per cent will contain only 10 per cent positive

votes for the Government proposition and 50 per cent blank votes, not because 50

per  cent of the people are unable to decide or uncertain to decide, but because

they are unwilling to decide between one of two unacceptable propositions. That,

briefly, is the reason why the Government is objecting to this Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government have any decency left, then the natural thing for them to do

is  to accept this Schedule. If they are confident that the people of Singapore,

in  fact, support the White Paper proposals, if they are confident that all this

talk of second-class citizenship, all this talk of unfair merger arrangement  is

Communist  talk  and Communist propaganda and there are only 300  Communists - why

are  they  afraid to accept this amendment? Sir, we are not asking for something

that  is  unfair. As I have said, if these men have even a little decency  left,

they  have no other alternative than to accept this. And as I have said all that

the  Schedule seeks to do is to specify the number of ballot papers issued,  the

number  of ballot papers cast in respect of proposition 1, proposition 2,  etc.,

the  number of unmarked ballot papers, the number of uncertain ballot papers and

the number of tendered ballot papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis fully realise that if the Government want to,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>

they can push through their merger arrangements irrespective of the views of the

people.  But we tell them, Sir, that if they want outwardly to appear to consult

the people, then let them consult the people in an honest and sincere way. If it

is  going  to  be  such that they only get 10 per cent for  the  Government  pro

position  and,  in  fact, they want to push through the merger arrangement,  let

them  accept the Schedule and say only 10 per cent have voted for the Government

proposition,  while  40 per cent have voted against it, and  50  per  cent  have

abstained.  Let them say that, and then show their courage and push through  the

merger arrangements. And then, Sir, the people will respect them for showing  at

least a little bit of honesty; otherwise what they do is absolutely dishonest.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  have  mentioned the fact that they do not want to discuss this  because

they also have in mind the fact that it could serve them as a means to mark  out

the  safe  and  unsafe seats. That is not the real intention in this  particular

case.  The real intention here is that they just do not want the people to  know

the actual number of blank votes and the actual number of uncertain votes, votes

which  indisputably demonstrate that they cannot support the White Paper  merger

proposals  of  the P.A.P. There is hardly any life in the Party, unlike  what  the

Minister  for  Health and Law is trying to imply. The story of  the  safe  seats

relates  to a different period. It relates to the period immediately after  Hong

Lim; not today. But, nevertheless, they would also like to know things that  can

be  of  advantage  to them and possibly to the disadvantage  of  the  Opposition

Parties.  That will not help them today though I bring out the story  merely  to

show  you  the original intention of the referendum; not to show that today  the

same  thing applies. If today they go to any seat, Sir, they will probably  find

they will lose their deposit.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Why not arrange to call a contest?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It seems very

strange for the Speaker to pull up the Deputy Speaker for being disorderly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will just answer one other point which I forgot to men

tion and which was touched on by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Education. He was trying to tell you there was already a plot to take  over  the

Government by the Parliamentary Secretaries. Let me tell him, Sir, that that was

a  blatant falsehood. Let him come and face me and tell me there was talk of the

Parliamentary Secretaries wanting to take over the Government. There  was  never

at  any  stage  talk of the Parliamentary Secretaries wanting to take  over  the

Government. You see, the defeat in Hong Lim was such a devastating blow  to  the

ego  of  the  Prime Minister that we had to devise ways and means of  trying  to

raise  his prestige, in fact, Sir, I spoke to the Member for Upper Serangoon.  I

said,  "Kuan Yew habits! We must try and devise some form of petition  or  something  to  let  him get back some self-respect. Possibly then he might  want  to

carry on."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know

who  started these irrelevancies. As I have said before, irrelevance  breeds  ir

relevance.  Let  us try, as far as possible, merely to touch on  the  fringe  of

these things and come back to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will not touch

on  any further irrelevancies, Sir, except to say that I repeated the same story

to  the  Prime  Minister himself and he said, "Oh, I wish  I  had  known  of  it

earlier."

That is what he said, Sir, I am sure he would not deny it.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, about the Council of Joint Action again. I read out to you just now,

Sir, the third section -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think it is

about  time I stopped this reference to the Council of Joint Action.  I  do  not

think  that has any relevance to the amendment. I think enough has been said  up

to now about the Council of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>

Joint  Action. There may be other opportunities. So I think, for the purpose  of

this debate, enough has been said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, if I may refer you to column 293 from where I

started my speech on the amendment. Somewhere just below the middle, I asked how

they would announce the results, and the Minister for Finance said "45; 45; 10."

When I further pressed him, giving another example, the Minister for Health  and

Law  said 48, 47, 5, Yes. In other words, Sir, he was trying to tell us that the

actual detailed results of the votes in respect of marked votes, unmarked  votes

or blank votes, or uncertain votes, or votes in support of the White Paper would

be  announced. That is a clear implication, Sir; otherwise how can he  give  the

respective  figures  of  45, 45, 10 or 48, 47, 5? The implication  is  that  the

detailed results would be announced and he was deliberately, I think, trying  to

deceive  us  by  saying  that those results would be  announced.  See  what  has

happened  today? We countered and accepted the objections - the genuine objections

of  the unsuitability of the wording and now we have asked for a Schedule  which

says "as near as may be". In other words, if the Government think the wording is

incorrect, they can easily amend it to suit the actual conditions, and I am sure

all  of us would be only too happy to accept the amendment. All we want to  know

is whether or not they want to accept in principle that the result of the voting

should  be divulged to the people in detail, so that everybody will be  able  to

know  how many people have voted for the P.A.P., how many have cast blank  votes

and how many have cast uncertain votes. It is as simple as that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has said that the number of votes according

to clause 29 is known beforehand. Very good, that is what he has just said, Sir.

A  little  while  back he said that the number of votes, that is,  blank  votes,

uncertain votes and votes in relation to clause 29, is known beforehand. If that

is so, they should be known to the people, not only to the Government Ministers.

That is all we ask for.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I think

that  was  a misquotation - a distortion of what I said. I have said the provision

regarding unmarked and uncertain votes and the way in which these votes will  he

treated has been provided for in the Bill, and therefore is known beforehand. It

is  not  that  the number of blank votes is known beforehand. If the  number  of

blank  votes is known beforehand, even before the referendum has been conducted,

I think the Member for Oueenstown must he a prophet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for Thomson has said that a large number

of  blank votes would arise if the alternatives posed were both unacceptable  to

the  people.  I  submit,  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  that  it  is  not  a  question  of

unacceptable  alternatives but a question of an organised attempt  by  malicious

rumour and intimidation to influence the voters into casting blank votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, why should the people cast blank votes?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Could we reserve that part of the debate until we come to

clause  29?  I  am sure the Minister will have the opportunity to  say  what  he

wishes to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I am repeating the question again. It seems to fall

on  deaf ears. The Minister for Home Affairs says the Schedule to clause  30  is

unacceptable because it provides for the number of tendered ballot papers to  he

declared and it does not provide for the number of rejected ballot papers to  be

declared. I have asked him a very simple question. If I move an amendment  which

would remedy that, would the Government accept it? Can we have a simple answer,

not a

P.A.P. corkscrew answer? Can we have an answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I think either

the  Member for Anson is unable to understand what I have spoken just now or  he

has missed the point I have made. I have said just now that there k provision in

clause  29  for the way these unmarked and uncertain votes will be treated,  and

that is, these votes will he deemed to be in support of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



decision made in the Legislative Assembly on the matter referred to referendum.

In his declaration, the Superintendent will include these unmarked and uncertain

votes in the results, so there is no necessity for providing separate items for

unmarked and uncertain votes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 28. An amendment standing in the name of the Member for

Queenstown,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A11, to leave out lines 40 to 43 inclusive and insert-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(b) on which anything is written or marked by which the voter can be identified except the printed number on

the back;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) which is unmarked;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) which is void for uncertainty.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an amendment in the name of the Member for Anson,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page All, line 43, at end, to add -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(c) which is unmarked:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) which is void for uncertainty.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first call the amendment to be proposed by the Member for Queenstown

which  will  open up the whole issue as to what is to be done with unmarked  and

uncertain  votes.  The debate will then, of necessity, have to  range  over  the

principle of sub-clause (1) of clause 29 which tells you what is proposed to  be

done  to  unmarked and uncertain votes as is provided for in the Bill, and  that

debate, of necessity, will also range over amendments (i) and (ii) of clause 29.

The first amendment in the name of the Member for Anson reads,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 16, to leave out from

"who" to the end of line 18, and insert "is

not in favour of any of the proposals posed

by the referendum or has not understood the



questions or the instructions for voting".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (ii) is an amendment in the name of the member for Hong Lim,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 16, to leave out "accepts or is willing" and insert

"rejects or  is unwilling."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of that ruling is that when we come to clause 29, the amendments I.

have  just  quoted - amendments (i) and (ii) to clause  29 - will  be  dealt  with

simpliciter,'  without any further debate. When we come  to  the  question  that

clause 29 stand part of the Bill, there should be no further debate on the  prin

ciple of the clause. This will be apart from my powers under Standing Order  71,

paragraph (2), which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Standing Order, if,

during  the  consideration of a Bill in a Committee of the whole  Assembly,  the

Chairman  is  of opinion that the principle of a clause and any matters  arising

thereon  have  been  adequately  discussed in  the  course  of  debate  on  the,

amendments proposed thereto, he may, after the last amendment has been  disposed

of: state that he is of this opinion and shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



then  forthwith  put  the question that the clause (or, the clause  as  amended)

stand part of the Bill.'



<br><br>I trust I have made myself clear. Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Having read amendment (i) in the name of the Member for

Queenstown,  I will be happy to withdraw mine because I support his  amendment,

Sir.  So  could you treat that as being deleted until such time as I ask  formal

leave for its deletion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> - for its withdrawal.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I will not move it, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will note that in the last general

elections, the blank votes amounted to less than one per cent of the total,  and

these blank and uncertain votes were treated as rejected votes. In the Anson by-election, the same thing happened -  the uncertain and blank votes were treated as

rejected  votes, and these votes only amounted to a very small number. Why  then

do  the  P.A.P.  Government want to introduce this unique clause unheard  of  in

world  history and based on, according to the words of the Minister for Finance,

illegal and unconstitutional principles?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a point of order. The

Member  for  Oueenstown is deliberately misquoting me in the most dishonest  and

I will quote, Sir.

is that I said this law is based on illegal principles, I challenge him to quote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



those  words  from  any  statement I made, either in this Assembly  or  outside - illegal principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order.

The  Member for Queenstown has indicated that he is going to come to the point.

Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, I want to quote from the "bible" of the P.A.P. - the "Petir" of the 28th of April, 1962. There on page 4 in the middle

column, second paragraph, the title reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "DR GOH KENG SWEE TELLS ASSEMBLY OF BARISAN'S LAST GAMBLE"



<br><br>And the quotation I want to read to you

is this, and I hope it will convince the Minister for Finance:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Why was this Clause on blank ballot paper introduced? The reason does not

rest on am constitutional or legal principle.'



<br><br>Black and white.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of order. The Member for Queenstown is

guilty  of a deliberate and mischievous distortion. Where are the words "illegal

principles"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I am surprised at the way the Minister for Finance has

come up to answer what I have said. It is a sore spot; it hurts him a lot and he

does  not  want  to  admit  these words. It says here  "does  not  rest  on  any

constitutional  or  legal principles" - in other words, it  says  it  rests  on

unconstitutional and illegal principles. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is as clear as that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. Can We allow the Member for Queenstown

to distort what I said and after I have pointed out the error, he continues with

his malicious and mendacious distortions?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minister for Finance has raised a point of

order and the Member for Queens-town has quoted from a paper the exact

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



wording  of which is a matter for interpretation whether the words used  by  the

Member for Queenstown are illegal. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Very simple, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is what he thinks.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> When the time comes, he can tell us how constitutional and

how legal these clauses are and on what constitutional and legal principles they

are  based. If he cannot prove that this clause is based on a constitutional  or

legal  principle, then he will have to admit that this clause  is  based  on  an

illegal and unconstitutional principle. That is as clear as daylight. [Laughter]

You see, Sir, the Minister for Finance used to play chess with me before and  he

knew when he would get into a zugzwang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last few days he has been pulling a long face, but today he tries to

laugh it off. I do not know what mirth he can find in all this when the whole of

Singapore knows that the P.A.P. -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. What have all these personalities on chess-playing in the

past got to do with the amendment? Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we will come back to the amendment. As I said, Sir,

this clause is unique in that it is not based on any accepted principle, legally

or constitutionally. And the fact that it was introduced only as an afterthought

after  the First Reading of the Bill shows that it was not based on any constitutional precedent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time for suspension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28-(contd.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 28 - an amendment standing in the name of the Member for

Queenstown. I take it he is, in fact, moving. The Member for Queenstown has not

moved his amendment yet.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg to move,

Sir, the amendment standing in my name,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A11, to leave out lines 40 to 43 inclusive and insert -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(b) on which anything is written or

marked  by which the voter can be identified except the printed number  on

the back;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) which is unmarked;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) which is void for uncertainty.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we broke for tea, Sir, I was saying that this clause was put in as an afterthought by the P.A.P. and thereby hangs a tale. Let us see the motivation behind this new clause. The Minister for Health and Law said, at the bottom of column 102 of the Official Report of the Select Committee on the Singapore Na tional Referendum Bill of 8th May, 1962, that this Bill which we have before the

House  now  is  a general Referendum Bill. And in this particular case,  he  was

referring to clause 5, but he was also referring to this as a general Referendum

Bill following on the pattern of the British parliamentary system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out to you, Sir, that in no place in the British parliamentary

system  is there such a clause called "a blank paper clause" which says  that  a

voter  who  puts in an unmarked or uncertain paper is deemed to  accept  or  is

willing to accept the decision of the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, Sir, to bring your mind back to the historical background in the light

of  what the Prime Minister said in the Second Reading of the Referendum  Bill.

I quote, Sir, from the "Petir", page -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If it is a

speech on the Second Reading, then I think the Member should find the place



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>

in our Official Report, a copy of which is with him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will try and locate it, Sir. I refer, Sir, to the revised

transcript of Official Report dated 16th March, 1962, page 32 [Vol. 17,  No.  3,

col. 285]. There the Prime Minister said in the first paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, if there was the slightest risk of merger being frustrated and the

country plunged into disaster by the activities of the Communists manipulating a

referendum,  let  me  say that it would he criminal folly on  the  part  of  the

Government  to hold a referendum and allow the future of Malaya and Malaysia  to

be imperilled.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this very vital passage means that if the P.A.P. merger proposals were

ever  in  danger of being rejected, then the P.A.P. would not hold a referendum.

Which  again  means, in effect, that in any referendum there  would  be  no  pos

sibility  of  the P.A.P. losing, and from there we can see the diabolical  plot - the  diabolical P.A.P. referendum plot - as we go into the clauses of  the  Referendum Bill.

This little passage also explains, Sir, why the editorial  of  the

Petir  says  "Heads we win, tails they lose." This little passage also  explains

why  the Prime Minister has repeatedly talked of the inevitability and certainty

of  merger  and Malaysia before June 1963 or even by the end of 1962, when  even

the  Tunku  dare not categorically say that Malaysia is going to be a certainty.

And,  this  explains  also, Sir, why the P.A.P. leaders always  talk  with  such

immodest  conviction of certainty, even before a referendum has been held,  even

before the results of the referendum are known. Sir, they can be certain only on

one  condition, and that is the referendum must be so rigged that they know  the

result  even before it is held. This involves the plot of this clause  on  blank

votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, in past general elections and by-elections, the number of

blank  votes only comes to a very small percentage. On this particular  occasion

the  P.A.P. intend not to claim a small percentage of such votes - like  one  per

cent - but to claim a large percentage of the votes. For example, if only 10  per

cent  of  the  people vote for the P.A.P. and 90 per cent of them put  in  blank

votes, then the P.A.P. intend to take in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



these 90 per cent blank votes and call them P.A.P. votes. Therefore, the plot of

the  P.A.P. is to ensure that the people put in blank votes in order  that  the

P.A.P. can claim them as pro-P.A.P. votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Sir. As we already know by now, the original intention of the

P.A.P. was to pose only one question to the people that requires a simple answer

of  yes  or  no. Then, when the plot of the merger proposals based on inequality

was  exposed, or perhaps through their sixth sense derived from information from

the  Special Branch, they realised that their own merger proposals would not  be

acceptable  to  the people and, therefore, to pose their own  proposals  to  the

people  in  a  one  question  referendum would  amount  to  committing  suicide.

Therefore,  it  was  decided  that  a snap referendum  posing  two  unacceptable

questions  would be held with complete prohibition of canvassing. That  was  the

first  switch  in plan and it occurred before the First Reading of the  National

Referendum Bill on 27th November, 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this is to keep you in perspective so that you will follow exactly

what is happening. After this, came this period of indecision and hesitation.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they realised that the people could protest against two unacceptable

questions  by  putting in uncertain votes and blank votes. If, in  actual  fact,

only 10 per cent of the people vote for the P.A.P. and 90 per cent of the people

put  in blank and uncertain votes, it would become very difficult for the P.A.P.

to  claim  that  they have won. Under those circumstances, the original  switch,

namely,  the  plot  of a snap referendum with two unacceptable alternatives  and

with  no canvassing allowed, would be frustrated. And the solution that occurred

to them was that since the reaction to two unacceptable alternatives would be to

put  in  blank and uncertain votes, why then not grab those blank and  uncertain

votes and make them P.A.P. votes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember the period of uncertainty that was characterised by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



the  postponement of the Second Reading of the Referendum Bill.  It  was  during

this period that the Prime Minister gave his historic answer in the Chinese Chamber  of Commerce. When asked whether the P.A.P. would abide by the result  of  a

referendum, his reply was that history would decide. And the fears of the people

were  further  heightened  by the fact that on 15th January,  1962,  the  Second

Reading  of the Referendum Bill was postponed for two months. Now, what was  the

real  reason  that caused this hesitancy, indecision and doubt in  the  P.A.P.?

Originally, it was supposed to have been a perfect plot. It was meant to get the

people  to  cast  votes  for the P.A.P. White Paper merger  proposals  as  these

proposals  were supposed to have been the lesser of the two evils. But realising

that  the  reaction to two unacceptable alternatives and two unacceptable  evils

could  be  blank votes, the P.A.P. had to make sure that these same blank  votes

belonged  to the P.A.P. And having found the answer, they had to make sure  that

they did not make another mistake. They had to make sure that they could provide

all  the  answers. They had to sleep on them and go over them before  they  felt

confident  enough to put this blank vote clause into the Bill. After sitting  on

it  for two months, they finally pounced it on the Legislative Assembly two days

before  the  Second  Reading  of  the  Bill.  And  having  gone  that  far  only

strengthened  their determination to ensure that all the blank votes  belong  to

the  Government. That is why, although we quoted precedents, although we  argued

them  down,  and although they could not produce any more arguments  to  justify

their  blank vote clause, they still refuse to accept our contention that  in  a

referendum it should be a case of one question requiring a simple answer of  yes

or  no and, in fact, it should be the endorsement of what has been passed in the

Assembly,  that  is, Chyuen Min Fu Chyueh. And that is why also  in  spite  of

their past promises, they still stick on to their new switch, new plan, and  new

plot. The only snag in this plot is that if they were to announce the result  to

the  people in detail, and if the people were to find out that 80 or 90 per cent

of the votes cast were blank votes,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



then  it would be very difficult for the P.A.P. to claim that the people supported  their  White  Paper  merger proposals. Hence all this unwillingness  of  the

P.A.P. to accept our amendment to the previous clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it is their intention to frame and word two alternatives which are

unacceptable  to  the people - the White Paper proposals and the complete  merger

proposals of the Penang type or whatever type they can think of. On the one hand

they are asking the people of Singapore to accept second-class citizenship,  and

on  the  other hand they are asking half the people of Singapore to  lose  their

citizenship  in their so-called Penang type or whatever type of complete  merger

which  is  a complete fabrication of the Opposition stand. In the circumstances,

it is just like offering the people alternatives of whether they want to be cows

or  whether they want to be horses. We have previously quoted examples of  dying

by  hanging or dying by tire, but if that seems to be a bit too severe, I  could

give  lighter  examples;  like their asking people whether  they  want  to  take

sulphuric acid or caustic soda. So many examples can be given to you. Sir. Under

those circumstances, when unacceptable alternatives are posed to the people, how

do  we expect the voters to react? They may be confused, they may be disgusted,

and  they  may  show their disgust by making crosses all over the ballot  paper,

drawing  birds  or  just  putting in blank votes.  And  now,  according  to  the

provision,  if  the  voter throws in such a vote, then that vote  is  deemed  to

belong to the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if unacceptable alternatives are offered to the people and the people

want to reject these alternatives, how else can they register their protest? If

they had the P.A.P. Ministers in front of them, I would not be surprised if they

spat  at them. But they will be inside the booths and the P.A.P. Ministers  will

not  be  there  in front of them. The only logical way for them  to  show  their

silent  protest and to register their protest at the injustice done to  them  in

the way the questions are posed to them, is either to put in a blank vote or  an

uncertain vote. Yet, Sir, such disgust by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>

voters  is going to mean ironically support for the P.A.P. This only shows  that

the real plot of the P.A.P. is to pinch and, as I said, hijack votes in this dis

honest  and  unheard  of Referendum Bill, it reminds us of election  rigging  in

South Vietnam and in South Korea, the only difference being that in the case  of

South  Korea and South Vietnam they rigged the election openly without any legal

cover.  Whereas  in Singapore it is going to be referendum rigging  under  legal

cover.  That is the only difference between our Prime Minister and Syngman  Rhee

and Ngo Dinh Diem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have always boasted that their merger proposals have the support of

the  masses.  Then why are they afraid to pose the proposals to the  people  for

acceptance or rejection? Why introduce this unique clause? It is neither found

in  the Elections Ordinance nor is it found in any of the election Ordinances of

countries  all over the world. Have the P.A.P. no more principles? So  bankrupt

that  they  have  to take "disgust", "nonsupport" and "protest"  votes  to  mean

"support"  votes'? Are they so bankrupt of support that even obscene  and  blank

votes  are deemed to support the P.A.P.? Is the referendum going to be  a  mere

ritual for the P.A.P. to push through their merger proposals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. Sir, as has been stressed vigorously by Members of the Opposition,

the  real  reason for this blank paper clause is to convert certain defeat  into

certain  victory for the P.A.P. in the referendum. The only thing  is  that  the

P.A.P. want to steal those votes and are afraid to let people know  the  actual

number of votes they steal.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also ask, Sir, if it is fair to the voters in this particular clause.

In the radio forum we repeatedly stressed that democracy means allowing a person

the  opportunity  to  say  'no'. If you pose unacceptable  alternatives  to  the

people,  then  you  must allow a person to say 'no' to these unacceptable  alter

natives,  otherwise you are actually infringing on the basic  right  of  the  in

dividual.  Every individual has the right to refuse to answer a question  or  to

say 'no' if it is unacceptable to him. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



now it looks as if the P.A.P. want to deny the individual the right to say 'no'.

They are just afraid and they are assuming that the voter has no mind of his own

or  that he is either an idiot, a fool or an imbecile, and that only the  P.A.P.

can make up his mind for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs have repeatedly said that the referendum is to ascertain the will of the majority of the people. Do you

think  a  blank vote will determine the will of the voter? How will blank  votes

give a true indication of the majority will of the people? If you really want to

know  the will of the people, then the proper and correct thing to do is to make

sure  that  there is a means for the voter to indicate his views  and  state  of

mind.  In  which case, if they really want to live up to their words,  then,  of

course,  they  would have to go back to clause 5 and accept our  amendment  that

there  should  be only one question that requires a simple answer  of  'yes'  or

'no'.  Sir, I do not intend to quote many precedents. All this. I think, I  will

leave  to  the  Member for Anson, but I might inform the House that  such  blank

crosses  have  never been used by any government to mean support for  Government

measures.  Let  me refer you, Sir, to column 116 of the Official Report  of  the

Select  Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill,  No.  3,  8th  May,

1962, somewhere in the middle and it refers to the New Zealand Military Training

Poll Act and the operative words here are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the voter strikes out both lines or fails to strike out one of the lines,

the voting paper will he void and his vote will not be recorded.'



<br><br>In  other words, Sir, if anybody throws in an uncertain or a blank vote it means

that he does not support the proposals put down in the ballot paper and his vote

will be considered void. Then in the next column 117, the same thing applies  in

the New Zealand Licensing Act of 1949. The procedure is as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The voter must strike out two proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote will he recorded in favour of the proposal not struck out.'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>

Now, these are the operative words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the voter strikes out all or only one or

none of the three proposals, the voting paper will he void and his vote will not

he recorded.'



<br><br>All this tells us that uncertain or unmarked votes are considered void votes and

are  never  meant to support any government proposal. Then, Sir, in  column  338

[Select Committee on Singapore National Referendum Bill, Official Report No.  5,

15th  May, 1962] there is the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act, 1906-36.

Section 21 (1), Sir, says here:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A ballot paper shall he informal if -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it is not authenticated by the initials on the back of it;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) it has no vote marked on it;'



<br><br>that is the blank vote, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(c) it has more than one vote marked on it.';

<br><br>that is the uncertain vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Those are informal ballot papers and they shall he rejected.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this shows that all uncertain and blank votes are not counted as supporting any government proposition. The Member for Anson handed this to me a little

while back and this is The Plebiscite of Western Samoa. I will read out to  you.

Sir,  the direction of voting and the definition of "informal votes". In section

3 it says here:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In all cases the three kinds of votes may be declared informal for the

reasons outlined in clause 54 (2) which reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the purpose of this clause a voting paper shall be deemed to be informal:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if it does not bear the official mark and there is reasonable cause

to believe that it was not issued by the Presiding Officer, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if anything not authorised by this Order is written or marked thereon by which the voter can he identified, or [and this is the operative

paragraph]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if it does not clearly indicate whether the voter is in favour or is not

in favour of at least one of the proposals.".'.



<br><br>In  other  words,  Sir,  if  the voter says he cannot  accept  any  one  of  the

proposals, then his vote will be considered informal or void or rejected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to repeat, Sir, that this clause shows very clearly the Fascist

trend  that  is  in the P.A.P. All the answer they have been  able  to  give  in

justification of this clause is that it will prevent the mounting of a  campaign

by  the  Communists against the P.A.P. White Paper merger proposals.  I  do  not

think  I  need answer that again, because I already answered that  when  we  dis

cussed clause 5 but the P.A.P. rejoinder the Minister for Finance and the  Prime

Minister  often give is that blank votes will still allow freedom of  choice  in

that  the voter can choose the alternatives posed to them. In other words,  when

there are two unacceptable alternatives posed to the voter, the voter still  has

choice.  I  do  not  know what argument that is. If it is a case  of  acceptable

alternatives, then there is a choice; but if both alternatives are unacceptable,

then  where  is the choice? If I were to say that if the voter is offered,  say,

bee-hoon or mee or kwayteow, then all these are acceptable alternatives to  the

voter;  but if the voter is offered drain water or something not good  from  the

Minister  for  Health and Law, then the voter is not expected to choose  any  of

them.  Those  alternatives are unacceptable alternatives, and the only  way  the

voter  can  show  his disgust will be to put in a blank paper. Sir,  the  Deputy

Prime Minister the other evening said posing alternatives to the people would be

the  same  as  offering different types of drinks to the voter. But  as  I  have

already indicated in Select Committee, when the P.A.P. offers a drink, they  do

not  offer  you  coffee, tea, cocoa, ovaltine, but they offer  you  a  drink  by

holding  your head under salt water. Under those circumstances, the  only  drink

the voter can take will be salt water. So where is the choice?



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have previously mentioned the danger to parliamentary democracy. I have

also  quoted from the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliamentary meetings  in

London.  They talked of the failure of the human material in the maintenance  of

democracy.  I do not need to go back on that, but merely to point out  that  the

failure of the parliamentary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>

system is not due to the so-called Communist bogey which  they  al

ways conjure up, but to the Fascists who pose as democrats in the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the people of Singapore today are literally up in arms against the

undemocratic, unjust and unfair Referendum Bill and the butt of their  objection

is this blank paper clause. All the Opposition Parties - the Workers' Party, the

United  People's  Party  and  ourselves - are against  it.  Outside,  the  Liberal

Socialists,  Party Raakyat and the United Democratic Party are also against  it.

Even  the  S.P.A., the constant ally of the P.A.P. and the good  Samaritan  that

keep  the P.A.P. alive by always voting with them on important issues,  have  to

consider  public opinion and side with us against the P.A.P. on  this  important

clause.  A lot has been spoken about undemocratic and unconstitutional behaviour

and  action, but I want to stress that being in power and in Government does not

make the P.A.P. constitutional when they misuse and abuse their powers to commit

unconstitutional acts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has been forced to admit that this clause is not based on constitutional or legal principles, and if the P.A.P. were to pass a

law  based on unconstitutional and illegal principles, it would not render their

action, taken under cover of such law, constitutional or genuinely legal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You are saying that not legal means illegal.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let us remind the Minister for Health and Law, who is such

a  legal  luminary,  that Hitler also made the murder of  millions  of  Jews  in

Germany  "legal", and in Europe, but such a legal cover for his unconstitutional

act  did  not make him a democrat, and did not make him a constitutional leader.

It  only showed him up as a Fascist and he deserved his fate in the end. I would

not like to say that our Ministers should get a similar type of destruction -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You are talking rot.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - but when the time comes when they have to go back to the

people, then the verdict of the people will be a terrible thing.







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end here, Sir, by quoting from Hansard, Volume 1, column 60, of 27th

April,  1955. The Prime Minister at that time was a great believer in democracy.

He  put  up  that pretence all right. He deceived many people,  and  all  of  us

thought  he  was  really going to fight for the liberty and the  rights  of  the

people. This is what he said in the first paragraph of column 60:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. [Very

brave words, Sir.] If you believe that men should he free, then they should  have

the  right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then no law

should permit those

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- democratic processes to he set at naught, and no excuse, whether of security,

inconvenience to the traffic, or inconvenience to police officers, should  allow

a  Government to he deterred from doing what it knows to be right, and  what  it

must know to be right.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministers of the P.A.P. to pay heed to what the Prime Minister

said  only some years ago. Let them live tip to their words which had  given  in

spiration to many of us in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once told the Prime Minister when there was a possibility of a split in the

Party that I admired him when he was fighting for the rights of the people and I

was  surprised  at the turn he was taking and was leading, and the  way  he  was

getting  away from the people. I told him that he was leading us up  the  garden

path. I wish the Prime Minister

-  if he is not here, the words can be passed on to him - will remember what  he

said,  all solemn words, and according to the Minister for Labour and Law,  with

perfect  co-ordination between the brain and the tongue. Let him  think  of  the

support  he  had  from the people at one time. Let him think of the  rights  and

interests of the people whom he pretended to serve at one time and at least  not

let  his  own name as well as the names of his other Ministers be condemned  and

cursed for years and generations to come. Because if they want to railroad these

merger proposals of theirs by means of this shame and humbug of a referendum, if

they want to bamboozle people with this dishonest referendum, if they want to go

against the wishes of the vast majority of the people of Singapore, then

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>

there can only be one ending for such leaders. They will earn not only the curse

of the present generation hut the curse of many generations to come.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You sound like Abraham!

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, a while ago I have been hearing about the

matter  of  red herrings from the Member for Queenstown, which was rather  long.

The  mode of presentation of his speech is just like what we usually observe  at

Clifford  Pier - a  woman of some age accusing the  Government  and  scolding

someone else in this street.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that, we can see that he is a man with a very bad temper. I think I can

use  a term in chess to describe the situation in which the Barisan Sosialis are

in.  We  can  say that they are being forced into a zugzwang position,  so  that

there  will  be no way for them to wriggle out. And so they cannot  counter  our

merger plan, which is for  the welfare of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has accused us of many things. He quoted the

arguments  advanced by other Members of this House. He repeated them  again  and

again.  He touched on the blank votes provision. He said that these votes should

be considered as negative votes. He meant that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I did not say the words which the

Member has just quoted, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of elucidation? The words being?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What were the last few words that he said? He said that I

said that blank votes were negative votes. I did not say that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order. It is a point of elucidation.

[Interruption] Order. The Hon, the Parliamentary Secretary has been  interpreted

as  having said that the Member for Queenstown suggested that those votes should

be negative votes. The Member has indicated that he had never said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very clear. If these blank votes are not deemed to be in

support  of  the  decision  of the Legislative Assembly,  then  they  are  anti-Government votes. Of course, that is their argument. Is it not very clear?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary has alleged that the Member for

Queenstown  said  so.  He  never  said so. It is the  Parliamentary  Secretary's

understanding of what he said - that then is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I think they want to

distort clear facts. They are very clever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



at  playing this kind of game. We remember that at the time when Members of  the

Barisan Sosialis left the P.A.P., they shouted that they were anti-colonialists.

But on this important issue of merger, they do not appear to be very clever anti-colonialists.  I can give two examples to show that the Members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis are pro-colonialists. The first example is this: what they want is  not

full independence; they want full self-government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are now in a debate as to whether or not this clause

29 should stand, that is, unmarked and uncertain votes, etc, should count for  a

decision of the Legislative Assembly. I am not interested for the moment in what

the  Barisan Sosialis want in regard to merger. That can come later probably;  I

do not know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I  gave  that  example because it is connected with the matter under discussion.

They said that the P.A.P. are bent on selling out the people. They accused us of

being pro-British colonialists. That is why I have to refute those arguments.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Unless the Parliamentary Secretary can show I am wrong, I have

not heard the Member for Oueenstown in this particular debate on this particular

amendment allege that they are pro-colonialists. As far as

I  can make out, the Member for Queenstown had been very relevant in what he had

said in regard to this amendment. So let us try to be relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Since  these  points raised by me have been ruled by you, Sir, to be irrelevant,

then I will not touch on them any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while the Members of the Barisan Sosialis were repeating

their  platitudes  and  phrases  over and over again  and  making  very  lengthy

speeches,  all of us, even some Members on the opposite side, felt very  sleepy.

If,  in the course of the debate, they could push through their amendments, then

they would have benefited by these lengthy speeches. But we know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



that  the Barisan Sosialis have political plots. They are bent on describing  us

as  Fascists  and dictators. They think if they could hoodwink the  people  into

believing  their arguments, then they would have gained something. But  what  is

the true fact? We know that we the

P.A.P. are not what they have described.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have incorporated the blank votes

provision because the House arrived at a certain resolution or decision, and  if

the  people cast unmarked or uncertain votes, then these votes should be  deemed

to be in support of the decision arrived at by the Legislative Assembly.

That is very fair. But the Member for

Queenstown  raised  many points and arguments which were very contradictory.  He

said that the P.A.P. would pose two questions to the people. One is the P.A.P.'s

White  Paper merger; the other is the one proposed by the Barisan Sosialis based

on  Penang  and Malacca. He said that the two propositions were originally  very

bad.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of

order,  Sir. Did he say that the other alternative was suggested by the  Banisan

Sosialis?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have not heard

anything at all. The Member must realise that this speech is being translated.

Will the Member for Queenstown now

repeat his point of order, if in fact it is a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Distortion again, Sir,I never said anything about the

Barisan  Sosialis putting up any stand of complete merger which he  is  now  suggesting.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I think he cannot deny such an allegation, because, during the

radio  forum he had mentioned such an example. He said that he wanted  a  Penang

and  Malacca  type  of  merger, and so he cannot now  evade  what  he  has  said

previously.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very fair for our Government to

pose  two questions to the people, so that they can make a choice. Nobody up  to

now  has  opposed  merger. All have agreed on merger. If the people  choose  the

Government's White Paper, then, of course, it shows that they reject the Barisan

Sosialis' merger of the Penang and Malacca type. How can they say that by posing

such  questions, the holding of the national referendum will be unfair?  We  all

know  that  they  have deserted us, but we have not yet taken  any  disciplinary

action  against them. They have been sabotaging us inside and outside the House.

But  we have not taken any steps to deal with them. So how can they say that  we

are Fascists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Cha Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Bible

there is such a saying as when God wants a person to die, He must make him  mad.

The  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home' Affairs has spoken a  lot

of nonsense. I believe you yourself do not know what he was speaking about.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think the

Speaker ought to be dragged into this debate in that manner. The Speaker is here

to  listen, to try and understand. Even if he does not understand, he can  still

try  to understand and pretend that he understands not only the Government  side

but  also  the  Opposition  side. I ask Members not  to  drag  the  Speaker into

controversies of that nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home  Affairs

has  not  been  able to prove and justify his stand that blank votes  should  be

deemed as votes in support of the Government. I do not know why he has mentioned

anti-colonialism and affairs in the P.A.P., because this has nothing to do  with

the  blank  votes provision. We can say that his speech is void of any substance

and meaning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the acceptance of this amendment will decide the basic human

rights of the people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various classes of society in Singapore are widely dissatisfied with these

provisions  proposed by the Government, and this widespread dissatisfaction  has

led  to the formation by the Opposition Parties of a Five-Party Council of Joint

Action to protect the human rights of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Members of this House, I believe, have received a memorandum

sent  by  the various cultural organisations and trade unions protesting against

this  provision. These organisations and the rural organisations,  the  hawkers'

organisations also strongly protested against this unfair provision made in  the

Select  Committee.  Even  the  Liberal-Socialists and  the  P.M.I.P. in  Select

Committee also strongly protested against this unreasonable provision.  But  the

views  of  the  majority  of  the people have not  been  heeded  by  the  P.A.P.

leadership or ruling clique. Obviously the P.A.P. have thrown the views  of  the

people to the wind. The purpose of setting up a Select Committee on the National

Referendum Bill is to hear the views of the public on the Bill. But their  views

have  not  been accepted by the P.A.P. On the contrary, they have accepted  only

the  views submitted by their colleagues. The views of these few persons  cannot

reflect the views of the majority of the people of Singapore. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

I therefore say that this clause 29 will decide what basic democratic rights the

people of Singapore have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Second Reading debate on this Bill and in the proceedings in the Select

Committee, the Government was not able to quote examples from any country in the

world  which  provides that these blank and uncertain votes are to he  taken  as

support for the Government. The Government has cited examples of referenda  held

in  New  Zealand, Australia, and Jamaica. Then why is the Government  afraid  to

accept the provision that the people have the right to abstain or not to reflect

their  views,  or to say "no"? Why cannot the Government cite examples  to  show

that uncertain votes should be taken as support for the Government?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national referendum was held in Algeria yesterday. Let me quote the Nanyang

Siang Pau. The front page article reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A national referendum was held in Algeria for the people to answer this

question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want Algeria to become an independent country according to or on the

basis  of  an  agreement signed on the 19th March, 1962?"  The  said  agreement

signed  on the 19th of March provided for the ceasefire between France and  the

Algerian nationalist movement.'



<br><br>There  is only one question posed to the Algerians and they were asked to decide

"yes" or "no" to the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now quote the Nayang Evening Post on the result of

the  national referendum held in Algeria. It appears on the first page and reads

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Algeria National Referendum. According to an estimate made last night, the

votes  in favour of the motion were 1,300,000, and the votes against were 6,500.

Here  are  the details of the results of the voting, and the number of  rejected

votes...'.



<br><br>and  so  on.  For the record, let me read a news report regarding  the  national

referendum. The second paragraph reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The affirmative votes amounted to 1,290,360, and the negative votes 6,510.

The rest were rejected votes.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, I can cite many examples to show that no country in the world

has  provided  that blank votes should be taken as support for  the  Government.

Although  President De Gaulle is undemocratic and criticised by his people  (the

bloodshed  over  the past ten years has caused much suffering  to  the  Algerian

people),  his Government's national referendum in Algeria is not as undemocratic

as the P.A.P.'s Referendum Bill. There was no such provision as that provided in

the National Referendum Bill proposed by the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a radio forum held on 29th June, the Prime Minister and the Minister for

Finance  completely rejected a question raised at the radio forum, and  that  is

this:  "In  this national referendum, will the Government allow  the  people  to

reject questions proposed by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



the  Government?"  The Minister for Finance and the Prime  Minister  evaded  the

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can clearly see that in the coming national referendum, the P.A.P. will

pose  two  unacceptable questions to the people. The P.A.P. Ministers also  know

that under those circumstances the people are not in a position to choose.

And when they have no freedom of

choice,  they will be forced to cast blank and uncertain votes. In other  words,

the  Government by this provision is forcing the people into casting blank votes

which will be taken as support for the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Ministers have been talking of democracy all day long. I want to point out to them that the people do not have any opportunity to

reflect on to air their views. What democratic night have they got? Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Prime Minister and the Minister for Law always talk about  respecting

the law. I want to quote a statement issued by the Law Society of the University

of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> They are men who do not know the law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law said that these people do not  know  the

law,  and that they know nothing about law. If these people do not know the law,

how  then  could the graduates of the University of Singapore be recruited  into

the  Law Department by the Government? To say that these people do not know  law

is to slap their faces.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a few days ago the Minister for Law proposed an amendment to

allow  the  graduates  of  the  Law Faculty of the University  of  Singapore  to

practise  law  in Singapore. Is this not contradictory to what the Minister  for

Law said a few days ago?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me quote the Nanyang Siang Pau of 2nd July. On page 7, a statement

issued by the Law Society of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



University of Singapore. Paragraph 5 of this statement reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the majority of the Government in the Assembly House, the

provision  in  clause  29 will be that all blank votes and uncertain  votes  arc

deemed  as  votes in support of the Government or are deemed as in support  of

any actions taken by the Government. No matter what reasons they advance in this

provision, we are of the opinion that this provision should be objected  to.  It

should he opposed, because it is incompatible with the concept of democracy  and

justice  and any national referendum based on this provision will not  correctly

and accurately reflect the views of the people on a particular matter.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, the last paragraph reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If a person casts a

blank vote, the right

of  abstention should be respected and it should not be deemed as in support  or

against  any motion. This is the sober analysis made by the Law Society  of  the

University of

Singapore. We hope this view will he taken heed of by the authority.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Legislative Assembly is a body which makes laws and is

the  highest law-making body. The views propounded by the Law Society should  be

respected  by us. They are the Law Society and they have sufficient  reasons  to

argue  against this provision. They also understand that clause 29 is infringing

upon the rights of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have read the statement issued by the members

of  the  Law Society. They merely state that this clause is undemocratic.  Could

the  Member  for Choa Chu Kang indicate whether they have given any reasons  why

this clause is undemocratic?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government do not advance any reasons to justify the draft

ing of this clause 29.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I wish to indicate that mere opinions expressed outside this

Assembly should not interest us. If an hon. Member agrees with this opinion,  he

expresses  it  as  his own opinion. But if there has been, an authoritative  exposition of the law, then, of course, the authority could be quoted in the Assembly  to  enforce or to illustrate the Member's own point of view. But I  do  not

think  the Assembly should be troubled or should be inflicted with mere opinions

of people outside this Assembly. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



think  the  Member  for Jalan Kayu was guilty of doing the same  thing  when  he

mentioned  the opinion of a Malay gentleman outside this Assembly and  I  pulled

him  up.  That, briefly, is a parliamentary rule which I think Members ought  to

observe.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. in debating this Bill has adopted a certain line of

action.  It  is  that this Bill is a general Bill, but when they have  exhausted

their  arguments they have to concede that this Bill is a specific Bill  on  the

merger question. The Minister for Home Affairs has even said that this Bill will

be  repealed  by the Government after the holding of the national referendum  on

merger.  Therefore, it is clear that the Government has admitted that this  Bill

is  undemocratic and unjust. If this Bill is based on democratic  principles,  I

believe  the Minister for Home Affairs, will have no reason to repeal  it  after

the  holding of the national referendum. When they cannot explain it away,  they

resort  to  their  last weapon. That weapon is one which goes  against  the  Communists and

their bogies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the P.A.P. Political Bureau published a statement.

As  a  matter  of  fact, this Political Bureau is a bureau for  their  desperate

struggle.  The last paragraph of the statement as reported in the Nanyang  Siang

Pau on the 2nd July reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the democratic institution in Singapore laces a danger and crisis, this

crisis does not come from the P.A.P. It comes from the subversive actions of the

Communists.  If  the people do not see clearly this fact, it will  be tragic

mistake.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now the P.A.P. has

made  use  of  this  undemocratic national referendum as a  weapon  against  the

Communists  and  their activities, but let us see what is meant  by  "subversive

actions".  Let us see what the P.A.P. has said on the definition of  "subversive

activities".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Part I, Volume 2,

Hansard  1956, column 498, the Member for Sembawang, namely the present Minister

for Labour, said in support of a motion moved by the Prime Minister,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>

that is to condemn the Government for making use of the P.P.S.O.:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What constitutes subversion? Is militant trade unionism subversion? Are

systematic and constitutional efforts to bring about the downfall of colonialism

and  the  local groups associated with it subversion? Is constitutional  action,

however embarrassing to Government and the colonial powers, subversion?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this was what they said in 1956 when they were in the

Opposition. However, the P.A.P. strongly opposed the Fascist methods adopted  by

the  Labour Front Government, but today the P.A.P. utilise the same methods used

by the Labour Front Coalition Government.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, there will be a delegates' conference to be held during this

week  by  the  various trade union organisations and other civic  organisations.

This  delegates'  conference will discuss the undemocratic  National  Referendum

Bill, especially clause 29.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, at every corner in Singapore, the people and their organisation are rising up to oppose the P.A.P. National Referendum Bill. They have expressed

their  strong  aversion to this undemocratic Bill. They have also  voiced  their

strong  opposition to the White Paper merger proposals. The fact that  they  are

united in their opposition shows that the present P.A.P. line of action is  more

dictatorial  and more undemocratic than the Lim Yew Hock regime.  They  are  now

united  to  oppose the Government on this Bill. Can you say they are subversive?

Can you say they are engaged in subversive activities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we, the Barisan Sosialis, are being described as "Communists". But the Council of Joint Action is composed of various political

Parties as well as sonic Right-wing organisations. How then can the Minister for

Home  Affairs  say that all these Right-wing Parties have now become  subversive

and Communist?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all the arguments advanced by the Government cannot convince

the people. We can clearly see that this unprecedented National Referendum







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



Bill  as proposed by the P.A.P. Government will infringe on the basic democratic

rights  of  the people. Since Members or this House are shouting  all  day  long

about  upholding the principles of democracy, we must then be united and  oppose

clause 29 in this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been debating this Referendum Bill

for  several days. Now, I want to talk about the drafting of the Bill. I believe

everybody  will agree that when we introduce a Bill it will have its  effect  pa

the  people.  We must take into account the circumstances of our time.  We  must

consider  what  effect  it will have on the people. If we  disregard  all  these

factors, then the implementation of the Dill will be completely useless. In this

Bill, the "Singapore National Referendum Bill" is put down as the title. This is

for  the  purpose  of deciding the subject of merger between Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say that when we were debating the White Paper on

merger,  there  was  not a Party in this House which opposed  the  principle  of

merger.  The only question to be resolved is the mode and manner of merger.  The

Barisan  Sosialis, however, has been turning round and round and wavering  about

merger. Nobody can understand what they have been trying to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Queenstown mentioned that in the previous elections

the  percentage of void votes was vory small. Since it is so small, why are they

spending  so  much time trying to win over the small percentage of  void  votes?

This is their plot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their recent propaganda effort, they have been trying to encourage people

everywhere  to  cast blank votes. Their representatives also  have  gone  from,

house  to house saying that the void or blank votes cannot be regarded as being

in  support  of  the decision by the House on the White Paper.  Regarding  this

point it also explains the effect of the intention on this Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we want to have a referendum, we know the reason for these provisions in

the  Bill.  We  know  there are certain people who, hiding under  the  cloak  of

democracy, are trying to reach another objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, here I want to say further. We often find in history that

some  people claimed themselves to be the defenders of certain causes. In  fact,

their  aim  was  to  destroy the very thing for which they were  defending.  The

Barisan  Sosialis are now trying to use this method of deceiving the  people  in

order to achieve their policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to talk about the local situation. I feel that the Barisan

Sosilias have been quite worried in the past few days' debate. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a great deal of amusement going on in the Assembly. But

I  am afraid I have lost this wonderful opportunity of even laughing. I ask  the

Opposition  not  to interject (in Mandarin) because the interjections  are  lost

completely on the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, from the speeches expressed by them just now we can see  what

type  of attitude they adopt in treating parliamentary democracy. Whenever  they

make a speech we remain quiet and listen to their nonsensical speeches. But now,

when we are making a speech, they laugh and make all sorts of grimaces. That  is

how  they  want to destroy parliamentary democracy. [Interruption] I  understand

better than you.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This must stop from the Opposition. I ask the Opposition not to

interject any further.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

At  least  we  have  not put on the cloak of democracy and do things  which  are

against democracy. We do not do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe you also agree that there must be two aspects of

everything.  Some people may oppose and some people may agree to  a  point.  But

when  people  have different stands, they have their own theories about  things.

They then use all sorts of means to smear the other side. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



method itself will also win the praise of those who advocate it. Whether a thing

is good or bad, whether it is black or white, whether it is right or wrong, will

depend  on history. Time will prove. If they do things which are not right,  the

true  facts  will defeat their argument in the end. Truth will show. Members  of

this  House have done a lot of thinking behind the scenes and have made  use  of

all  sorts  of means and all sorts of speeches to advance their arguments.  When

the time comes, history will show the truth.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>     [Mr Deputy SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you want to do a thing, no matter what it is, there must be a use for

it.  For  example,  the  Assembly is used for debate and for  the  drafting  and

passing of legislation. The building of a house offers shelter and warmth and it

enables  the people living in it to have a normal life. If you make a chair,  it

is  clearly for the purpose of sitting. This Referendum Bill should be  regarded

in  the  light of the use to which it can be put. If this cannot be regarded  as

so,  then  why  should we waste our time debating this Bill  for  several  days?

[Interruption] It seems that my speech is annoying the Member for Nee  Soon.  If

he is a true political worker, he should have a magnanimous attitude and not the

attitude  of  a  small  man making all sorts of actions  and  saying  a  lot  of

unnecessary  words. This will not raise his prestige; it will be a blot  on  his

own  character. In the course of the debate during the last few  days,  we  have

seen how they have tried to show themselves as defenders of democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members of the Barisan Sosialis have referred to us as Fascists and that

our  actions are anti-democratic, if it is true that we are Fascists, then  they

would not be so safely seated opposite us now. They would not have been in  this

House  and  they would not have been leading a free life in Singapore  all  this

time.  They  are now very free to do whatever they like. Nobody interferes  with

them. They can say

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>

whatever  they want to say, but it is another matter whether the people  believe

what  they  say. There is still a lot to be said but I do not want to waste  the

time of this Assembly. It is not necessary for me to be used by people who think

for  me  behind the scenes. [Interruption] I am not a repeating mechanism.  They

are  not  shouldering  the  responsibility which  they  should  have  for  their

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order.

We are in Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are any points, the Opposition can take down notes and make any

number of speeches. They can even rise on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, regarding the accusation made these few days  in  the

House  by the Barisan Sosialis about our being Fascists and autocrats,  we  have

already  given some answers just now. I believe that the situation in  Singapore

is  not  like  this.  Every  time they try to emphasise  that  there  should  be

democracy, and so on. From my point of view, freedom and democracy is like this.

A person who claims to enjoy freedom should not interfere with other people. But

from the attitude they have adopted and expressed, if they are real fighters  of

freedom,  why  should they make all sorts of noises when a person  is  making  a

speech  in  order  to  prevent him from doing so? Is it not  stepping  on  other

people's freedom? Why do they not understand the definition of freedom? If  they

want to advocate freedom, and yet act in such a degrading manner, I feel that it

is most improper.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, just now the previous speaker talked a lot. I did

not  know  what  he said. He talked about the so-called freedom, democracy,  and

other things. I feel very ashamed of the Parliamentary Secretary for having said

such  things.  He  did not speak on the clause but he concentrated  on  throwing

abuses at us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, from the debate which took place these few days, I feel that the Government Party leadership does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



not  seriously  accept the criticisms and opinions of the  Opposition.  The  governing  Party's leadership is autocratic and it is trying to force through  this

undemocratic Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mamnen, the Minister for Home Affairs asked me, "What is there in the Referendum Bill that is undemocratic?" He must be sleeping because we have

already talked a lot and he is still not conscious of what we said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mamnen, you can see that the governing Party now wants to force through this Referendum Bill to ensure their political longevity. The blank and

uncertain votes which are to be regarded as votes in favour of the Government is

really  a  joke. Yet the Government is holding on to this provision  as  a  last

straw in order to prolong its political life. Mr Mammen, I can clearly tell the

governing  Party that they cannot go about in this way to save their future.  No

matter how they try to be obstinate and unreasonable, the end of their political

life  is  a  certain  thing. They can never avoid this fate.  We  see  that  the

Government  can provide undemocratic provisions and undemocratic  laws  here  in

this  House, but when they go outside they know what they will get. We  are  not

afraid  of the barbarity and unreasonable actions of the Government. We  in  the

Opposition  want to maintain the decorum and dignity of this House.  We  do  not

want  an undemocratic Referendum Bill as it will make a laughing stock of us  in

the  eyes  of the people of the world. It is our responsibility to see  that  no

such thing happens in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have already said that the provision to regard

blank  and  uncertain  votes as votes in support of the  Government  is  a  very

shameful  provision. We have already said that the Government  is  more  Fascist

than the Fascists. But the Party in power dare not face our accusations and they

cannot reply to them. They can only say that if they were Fascists we would have

lost our freedom long ago and that I would not be sitting here now. A little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



while  ago, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education said  that

if  the  Party in power were Fascists, then the Barisan Sosialis would not  have

been  able to make their lengthy speeches so freely here and perhaps the Members

of the Barisan Sosialis would have disappeared without a trace. Mr Mammen, Sir,

I could quote a few things.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Party in power has come to an impasse and has landed in a pitiful situation. Yet they are still very haughty, and try to show that they are very demo

cratic.  They pretend that they have given us freedom, and so we are  free.  Mr

Mammen, this is a report in the Nanyang Siang Pau of 18th June. In this report a

statement  by Mr Jek Yuen Thong is published in reply to the Barisan  Sosialis.

He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As to the question of Fascists and Fascism, the Barisan Sosialis up to now

have  not explained to us. If the P.A.P. is a Fascist Government, why then  have

the important big shots of the Barisan Sosialis up to now not

lost their hair? And they are so free that everyday they could hold rallies  and

do  whatever  they like? So facts are more convincing than arguments.  That  the

Barisan  Sosialis can carry on all kinds of political activities  clearly  shows

that  the  P.A.P. is a democratic party. In fact, those in the Barisan  Sosialis

should  he  thankful to the P.A.P. because in the past they were all  under  the

protection of the P.A.P. while carrying out their activities. And certain people

had at the request of the P.A.P. been released from prison. I would like to ask:

where  can you find people who having been protected and benefited by  a  Party,

turn around and accuse it of so many things?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this it can be seen that the P.A.P. are unable to amend their ways

and  turn  back. The P.A.P. are bent on this line of making blank votes  and  un

certain votes to be votes in support of the Government. By doing so they deprive

the people of their basic democratic rights. Yet they feel proud and haughty  at

this  act  and pretend that they are more democratic than the Fascists.  We  can

only  see  how pitiful they are. If Hitler were alive, I believe he  would  take

tuition  from  the P.A.P., because under his undemocratic rule he had  not  done

such things as the P.A.P. is now doing, i.e. depriving the people of their basic

democratic rights by refusing them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>







the right to say "no". [Interruption] Sir, we want to point out to the Party  in

power  that in the course of the anti-colonial struggle, in the process  of  con

stitutional advancement, and in the struggle for national independence,  freedom

and sovereignty for the people, democracy is the most important.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Member will try to avoid these small

interjections perhaps she can continue with her speech. So in her  address  will

the hon. Member face the Chair? Please avoid interjections during the speech.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Mammen, these interruptions were from the Minister for Home Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not forget that the only democracy we have now has been achieved

through our past struggle. Democracy is not a gift. If we do not insist  on  our

democracy, then in future we may not have a democratic country. If we do not try

to  achieve independence, eliminate colonialism and to secure safeguards for the

democratic  rights of the people, then we should be doing something  wrong.  Any

government elected by the people should not do things to deprive the  people  of

such rights and democracy. I hope the Party in power will be very clear in their

minds  that the little democracy we have today is not a gift from the  Party  in

power, but is the result of our struggle in the past and we should endeavour  to

protect and preserve it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, whatever problems the P.A.P. have and which they

cannot  solve, they will lay them at the door of the Communists.  That  is  very

preposterous and very nonsensical. I quote from the Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 12th

of  this  month.  Here  is an article by the Political Secretary  to  the  Prime

Minister, Mr Jek Yuen Thong, taken from his radio broadcast. He said,  "I  have

said  that the Communists have tried to wreck the national referendum. They want

to  persuade  the  people to cast blank votes or to prevent  them  from  casting

votes.  According  to them, blank votes and uncertain votes should  he  negative

votes. They are rather

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>

naive  in  their way of thinking. They want to think that the votes of dead  men

should be the votes against merger."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, from this quotation of his, we can see the way they argue,

distorting the meanings which they should have. They distort our arguments.  The

Barisan  Sosialis  has  never  wanted blank votes  and  uncertain  votes  to  be

construed as against the decision of the Legislative Assembly, but they have dis

torted  our  arguments and they have shifted all problems and blame  on  to  the

Communists and the people in the Barisan Sosialis. I would say that the  situa

tion is created by the Party in power and I will also refute the saying that the

Barisan Sosialis is Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, outside the House there are certain people who have given an

analogy  to the Bill. They say this National Referendum Bill is like  a  robbery

Bill.  In  fact, it is truly so because if, say, there are several  robbers  and

rogues and they are well armed and they want to carry out illegal acts, what can

the  people  do against them? The present P.A.P. Government are doing  just  the

same  thing. They have all the Government organisations under their control  and

they are now carrying out political robbery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, I have said that if there is a debate today, it is because

clause  30 has been proposed. The question whether the proposition of a  certain

clause  is  democratic or not directly affects the voting rights of the  people.

The  Government know that if they pose unacceptable questions, the  people  will

have  no choice and they will cast blank votes as a show of protest. In  such  a

case  the  Government should solve the problem in a proper way and  not  try  to

blame the Barisan Sosialis as extremists or reactionaries, or to shift the blame

on  to  the  shoulders of the Communists. We hope the Party in power will  think

properly and mend their ways and not try to muddle along their present way.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, Sir, I believe you and I and Members of this House

have  clearly listened to all sorts of facts and all sorts of threatening terms.

There are people who want to







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



resign.  There  are people who say they have formed a delegates'  conference  to

oppose this Bill.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this clearly shows why they have adopted such an attitude against the

National  Referendum Bill. This is not a question of non-democracy. It  is  also

clear  to  the people of Singapore that there is a minority who will feel  frust

rated  when  this  National Referendum Bill is accepted by  them.  The  National

Referendum Bill was drafted by the government. What is the purpose and nature of

this  Bill? It is to enable the people to decide their future. Because of  their

fear  of the National Referendum Bill and because they fear that their interests

will  he  endangered  and  their future activities curbed,  the  Opposition  are

defiantly  carrying out all sorts of campaigns to stop or block the  passage  of

this  Bill, if they want to stop the passage of this Bill, what are the  methods

open  to  them?  If  they  say they oppose it, that will  not  do,  because  the

reunification  of  Malaya and Singapore and the concept of  Malaysia  have  been

accepted by them and they cannot deny this, if they want to oppose this concept,

then they will be doing something which is contradictory to what they have said.

Therefore, they have switched on to the minor points in the Bill to say this is

not  democratic and that is not democratic. They say the provision regarding the

blank votes in the Bill is not democratic. If the blank votes are to he regarded

in favour of them, then they say it is 100 per cent democratic. If they like it,

then  they term it as democratic, if they do not like it, then they term  it  as

undemocratic. Let me say something about this. The Opposition have been shouting

about  democracy all day long. They say the Government has frightened them about

this matter and has forced them into a blind alley. They try to make use of this

Assembly  to  show that the P.A.P. is bad and not worth a cent. They  have  been

saying  in  this  House  since  the beginning of this  debate  that  the  P.A.P.

government is not democratic and that ii has become a Fascist Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>

The  Member for Stamford has said that we are a Fascist Government. If that were

so,  then  the  Opposition would not he sitting in this House.  If  we  are  not

democratic, how is it that the Opposition Parties are able to hold mass  rallies

and carry out house-to-house campaigns?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> On a point of information?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> resumed her seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not the

Minister for Home Affairs. How do I know that they hold mass rallies? They  even

paste  their  posters in the latrines saying that on certain  days  the  Barisan

Sosialis will hold mass rallies. How can they say that they cannot hold them? If

they  want  to  hold  them every day they can apply to  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs.  As I am not directed to do so, I cannot give directions.  We  can  see

their  attitude.  I  think  if  it is judged by the  people  in  the  gallery - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (New Soon):</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): The Chair has been following closely the

translation  from Mandarin into English, and if I hear an hon. Member  attacking

the  Chair, I naturally will have to pull her up as out of order. So far I  have

not  heard,  and  I  have  not caught it. The Member for  Nee  Soon  understands

Mandarin whereas the Chairman is in a difficult position as he has to depend  on

the interpretation. Madam Chan Choy Siong.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the hon. Member wants to interrupt, I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



today. From this, the people can clearly see that if the representatives of  the

people want to expose their bad conduct, then they will try to interrupt  us  in

every  way, if they can do this sort of thing here, then they can do  the  same

thing  outside  the  House. They try to make all sorts  of  strange  noises  and

gestures in order to interrupt me because they fear that I will expose  them  in

this House. Now, nobody can tolerate their conduct. They have been accusing  the

Government of being undemocratic this whole afternoon. It is not that I want  to

accuse them, but this is clearly seen by the people of Singapore. They have been

trying  to  propagate their views on the merger question and on this  Bill.  The

Government  is a tolerant one, if they want to talk, they can carry  on  talking

and  if  they want to propagate their views, they can do so. But the truth  will

emerge  one day. We are not afraid of being consumed by fire. Why should  we  be

afraid?  It is those people who run here and there to carry out their propaganda

that are afraid and they are trying to save their political fortunes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, they have said that the P.A.P. Government is not democratic.

How  much  democracy  do they have? When they ask the General  Employees  Union,

which  is  controlled by them, to publish a statement, they hope that the  other

trade union organisations will also support them. Do they consult the members of

the  trade  union  organisations? Their method is to issue a  statement  without

first  consulting  the people. This is their definition of  democracy.  This  is

their  rubber-stamp method. Is this democracy? Is this why  they  say  that  the

P.A.P. is  not  democratic and that they are democratic -  more  democratic  than

other  countries?  It is a matter of regret that we have this present  state  of

affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they say that the provision regarding the blank votes in this Bill is un

precedented,  then the fault lies with the Opposition Parties. The blame  should

he on them. Everybody is agreed on a merger between Singapore and the Federation

of Malaya and the formation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>

of  a  Federation of Malaysia. The question remains as to what form  and  method

should be adopted to effect a merger of the two territories.



<br><br>8.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. propose the White Paper merger, and the Opposition Parties also put

forward their own merger proposals. On this question, I say that we are  of  the

opinion  that in 1959 the people gave us a mandate on merger. But we still  feel

that  we  have  to  ask the people for their decision on this  matter.  And  so,

therefore, we have drafted this National Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the provision regarding blank votes, it means that if the people

could not decide on the two questions, they are prepared to leave the matter  to

the  decision  of the Legislative Assembly. This matter could be  likened  to  a

maiden  who  has  two  lovers.  These two lovers are  very  much  liked  by  her

[!interruption,  but one of them is superior to the other who  may  be  on  more

intimate  terms. So she finds it difficult to decide and, therefore,  says  that

she  is  willing to allow her parents to decide for her. And these  two  lovers,

although they like her, do not want to force her [Interruption]. Therefore -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Cannot Members contain themselves when they listen to

love  stories? If they are to continue interjecting, may I suggest  that  it  is

completely  out  of  order,  and  I hope the Opposition  Members  could  contain

themselves.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Their conduct is always like that.

Anyway, this girl asks her parents to decide for her.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This example clearly shows the Members opposite the need for someone to make

the decision. Is this undemocratic?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Feudalistic.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, how can you say this is

undemocratic?  Let me tell you, Sir, why they want to force us  to  delete  the

provision  for  blank  votes. It is because they have been  carrying  out  their

propaganda on a house-to-house



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



campaign.  What have they told the people? No doubt they have aired their  views

on  the  merger  issue - the Penang and Malacca type of merger. Have  they  tried

their best to, win the support of the people? They have not done so because they

are not sincere and because they know that the proposals propounded by them will

be  inimical to them. Therefore, the only way left for them would be  to  oppose

this  Referendum  Bill by saying that the people have the right  to  tear  their

ballot  papers.  What is the motive for putting forward such a  suggestion?  The

people  of  Singapore can think for themselves. Why should the people  have  the

right to tear their ballot papers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the motive? That is what I have been trying to tell Members, Mr

Deputy  Speaker.  In  their house-to-house visits, their effort  was  especially

directed  to the housewives. They told them that they should not  support  the

merger  proposals. If they supported the merger proposals, then their  posterity

and  future  generations will condemn them as being wicked. They also  told  the

housewives this, "Auntie, will you please sign your name on this list  of  names

saying  that you are against the merger proposals?" By doing this, they  thought

they could be successful in the initial stages. But they did not get any support

from  anybody.  Maybe there are a few people in the Barisan Sosialis  who  might

support  them.  But  how can they say the people of Singapore  are  against  the

merger proposals?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will give way. The Member does not give way.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, they are not patient. That is

why  they want to interrupt my speech. If they want to clarify, they can  do  so

after I have finished my speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when they were not successful in their first phase, they carried

out their second method. That is, they make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



use of the provisions in the National Referendum Bill. They hope that on the day

when the national referendum is held they will be able to persuade the people to

tear  the  ballot papers or to cast in blank votes. Then if there  are  a  great

number  of  blank votes, they will be able to say that they are victorious,  the

national  referendum is not valid, and the people of Singapore are  against  [he

merger proposals. This is clearly understood by everybody. This will expose  the

Barisan  Sosialis. They have been saying that they are very much concerned  with

the  future  generation of the people of Singapore. Actually what they  mean  is

that  they  are very much concerned with their own interest and with  their  own

selfish ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Choa Chu Kang quoted a news report on the national

referendum  held in Algeria as an example. But he has forgotten that the  people

in  Algeria  decided  on  whether  they  wanted  a  colonial  government  or  an

independent  country.  If  the  Barisan Sosialis try  to  compare  our  national

referendum  with a national referendum held in another country, it merely  shows

that  they are trying to maintain a colonial government. If you want to maintain

this  colonial government, then you are worse off. We have not been able to  see

who are the colonial agents. They are accusing us of being colonial agents. Will

they openly accuse the Federation Government of being colonial agents?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang has quoted speeches made by the

P.A.P. representatives in 1956. All that time we were defending those who  were

about  to be banished. They will realise that in those days they were struggling

against  the  colonial  government. But today.  Singapore  is  a  self-governing

country.  We want to enlarge our territory so that Singapore and the  Federation

of  Malaya  can  be united so as to give more rights to the people  residing  in

these  territories. I any person tries to sabotage this campaign, they are  pro-colonialists, because  they are trying to wreck something  which  is  of  vital

interest to the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quotation made by the Member for Choa Chu Kang is not appropriate in this

context -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Lady will not give way.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, no matter how the Barisan

Sosialis  make  use of the question of merger or the question  of  the  National

Referendum Bill to accuse the Government of being worse than the former Lim  Yew

Hock regime and that we have degenerated and are desperately struggling for  our

survival, all this should be judged by the people in Singapore. They should  not

be decided by what they say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I not told you just now about the blank votes -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen) thereupon left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of

blank  ballot  papers, the Opposition accused us of being undemocratic.  Earlier

on,  I have explained that this provision is not undemocratic. It is because the

Opposition  are afraid that if merger materialises, their hopes will vanish.  So

we  can  account for their behaviour over the past few months. We  have  exposed

their true colours. They did not get any response from the people to their  mass

rallies.  They even carried out a house-to-house campaign in every  constituency

hoping to deceive the housewives and the town folks, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



they  flopped  in this too. Now they say that the P.A.P. is a Right-wing  Government.  From  their  recent conduct, it can be clearly seen that  when  they  are

cornered and they find themselves in a blind alley, they even resort to  joining

up with the Liberal-Socialists and other Right-wing Parties and take part in the

so-called  Council of Joint Action. This Council of Joint Action is composed  of

all the political "trash" in Singapore. They want to hold a mass rally to oppose

the National Referendum Bill. They say that they will try to prove that they are

not  Communists  because they have now joined hands with the  Liberal-Socialists

and  other  Right-wing  Parties. This is an attempt to salvage  their  political

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not intend to waste your time and impede the work of

the  people  in this House. However. I want to stress that the P.A.P. Government

must  shoulder  its responsibilities and honour its promises to  the  people  in

1959.  We believe that we can work hard to create a socialist and united  Malaya

for the benefit of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since we

began the debate on the National Referendum Bill, there has been opposition from

every  quarter  against  the  undemocratic  and  unreasonable  attitude  of  the

Government. The people of Singapore cannot bear to see their rights deprived  by

other  people. We can see no reason why the P.A.P. Government should deem  blank

votes  as  votes  supporting the Government. They have  advanced  all  sorts  of

unreasonable  arguments and referred to the propaganda launched by  the  Barisan

Sosialis  and other subversive actions. Talking about propaganda and  publicity,

the  Government are in a more advantageous position because they have all  sorts

of  propaganda machinery at their disposal. They have the radio and  Rediffusion

to  assist  them in their propaganda. They can order the Press to publish  their

news  on  the  front  page.  In the field of propaganda,  they  are  in  a  more

advantageous position than any other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



political  Party.  I see no reason why they should say that  the  people  should

support their referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the White Paper proposals are acceptable to the people, the P.A.P. should

not  be  afraid of other people distorting their stand, because the people  have

the  ability to judge. Their arguments are an insult to the intelligence of  the

people.  Are the people in Singapore so foolish as not to be able in distinguish

between right and wrong? In the 1959 election, the Lim Yew Hock Government  also

carried put their propaganda saying that the P.A.P. was had, and so on. At  that

time,  I  was still in the P.A.P. At that time, the P.A.P. said that the  people

were  intelligent and I see no reason why they should regard  our  people  in  a

different  light today. They are afraid because they do not have the support  of

the  people.  The membership of their Party has dwindled to almost nothing.  The

Hong Lim and the Anson by-elections have taught them a very good lesson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister, as the head of the Government, visited

the  Afro-Asian countries. If he had gone there for a pleasure trip, I would not

have  minded, but he went there to sell his merger proposals. This is  something

which  I  do  not  like because his Government did not have the support  of  the

people. He had no right to represent our people when he met the leaders of those

countries. I think he was wrong there. If he wants to learn something which  is

undemocratic,  then  he should go to America, or Formosa, or  Vietnam  or  South

Korea.



<br><br>9.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question of blank votes. I have heard all sorts of complaints and

dissatisfaction expressed from all quarters. The P.A.P. Government must know  of

these  complaints  and  dissatisfaction. But  the  P.A.P.  Government  are  riot

sincere. They do not want to give the people an opportunity to air their  views.

Now,  how can they say that this is democratic? I am of the opinion that we have

wasted a lot of time. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



Ministers  work  only for half a day, and we have spent a lot of  time  debating

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Member for Hong Lim, has given them very reasonable

conditions for not passing this Bill before 1st July. He said that there  should

be  a by-election. We also understand the difficulties of the Government. We  do

not  want them to resign first. We are not acting on the spur of the moment. Our

action  is  motivated in the interests of the people. Our judges, that  is,  the

people, will give a very fair verdict.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the amendment seeks to prevent the P.A.P. from committing  an  act

of  political  dishonesty. It ensures that the people can  enjoy  the  right  of

abstention in the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Referendum Bill has now become a special weapon of the P.A.P. to

suppress  the people's opinion. This Bill is now a P.A.P. Bill that will  enable

the P.A.P. with a must-be-won referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this Bill was first brought to this Assembly, the P.A.P. soon found

out  that  the people did not want the P.A.P. type of merger. Such a  referendum

would then become a "must be lost" referendum if the referendum was held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, knowing that the referendum will be lost - and this will bring about a

total  collapse  of  the  P.A.P.  Government - they therefore  quickly  introduced

certain unusual and unprecedented clauses to this Bill which is going to  become

a notorious Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government adds the clause that blank and uncertain votes shall be

the  votes  supporting the P.A.P. type of merger. This is  one  of  the  illegal

clauses  added  by  this  notorious P.A.P. Government in  order  to  please  the

colonialists and their colonial stooges.

they  bring this "must-be-won" referendum to this Assembly for debate? Sir, they

are  attempting to legalise all their illegal clauses so as to legalise all  the

illegal actions that they are going to take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our stand is that all blank and uncertain votes shall be counted as

spoilt votes. Sir, we do not want these votes to be counted as Government votes.

We also do not want these votes to be counted as votes against the

P.A.P.  Sir,  our amendment is honest and sincere. Never in this world  have  we

seen a Government with such a "must-be-won" referendum that it allows the people

no choice but to vote for the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in this Assembly have the right to say yes or no or even to abstain.

We  also have the right to be absent from voting. Sir, all these rights that we

enjoy as Assemblymen are provided by law passed in this Assembly. Why should the

Government  not  allow the people to abstain by casting blank  votes?  Are  they

sitting here to serve the people or to suppress them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government Ministers have stated their anti-people stand. We hope

that the Government Back Benches will also state their stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were in this Assembly debating the merger issue last year, we saw

the  twists  and  turns  of  the P.A.P. leaders in  this  Assembly,  over  Radio

Singapore and in their smearing campaign against opposition Parties outside  the

Assembly. The twists and turns of their smearing campaign still continue.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  since  we debated this National Referendum Bill, the Assemblymen  from

the  Barisan  Sosialis have constantly accused the P.A.P. of being  undemocratic

and  of being dictators. Perhaps. Mr Speaker, you will remember - so will  other

Members of this Assembly - that when we debated the merger

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



issue,  the Barisan Sosialis put forward their views for complete merger on  the

basis  of  Penang  or  Malacca,  but since then they  have  realised  that  they

committed  a blunder. The Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen then launched a house-to-house  campaign and adopted their usual deceptive tactics to mislead the  people

by stirring up communalism in order to hoodwink them to their side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have been accused by the Barisan Sosialis of being un democratic and of suppressing freedom. I cannot understand what kind of freedom

the  Barisan Sosialis want. There is a poem which says if a man walks  naked  in

the  street we merely stare at him. We must safeguard freedom for the peace  and

prosperity  of  the people. Freedom is not to he controlled at one's  whims  and

fancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis - especially the Member for Queenstown - on 29th June tried to intimidate the Government side, so much so that you,

Mr  Speaker,  had to issue a warning. How worse will be their attitude  to  the

people?  in  addition to their tactics of persuasion, they  will  also  adopt  a

threatening  attitude.  Mr Speaker, since we discussed the  merger  issue,  the

representatives  of  the Barisan Sosialis have shown from their  appearance  and

outlook  that they realise that they can no longer hoodwink the people and  that

their  evil manipulations have been exposed to the people. We can see from their

faces  that  they are more like sick people. They moved an amendment which  they

claimed to be in accordance with the wishes of the people and threatened that if

it  was  rejected by the Government the people would accuse the P.A.P. of  being

undemocratic  and  dictatorial. But Mr Speaker, this is a manipulation  of  the

Barisan Sosialis to salvage their political fortunes. In order to restore  their

own  prestige,  they keep harping on "the people", "the people",  because  their

propaganda  and  tactics have now been well understood  by  the  people  in  our

country. In order to save themselves, they have put up many amendments  so  that

merger will not be achieved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have tabled this Referendum Bill in the Assembly so that the Opposition can debate it thoroughly. The people know that we will continue to

debate  this  Referendum  Hill.  Is  this  undemocratic?  We  have  given  every

opportunity to the Opposition to debate the Bill.



<br><br>10.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, the representatives of the Barisan Sosialis and the

U.P.P. charged Radio Singapore as Radio P.A.P. putting out P.A.P. propaganda,

but  it  may he that the representatives, of the Barisan Sosialis and the U.P.P.

have  forgotten that we gave every political Party an opportunity to  air  their

views  over  the  radio.  Can  this be considered  undemocratic?  What  kind  of

democracy are you asking for? Is this the type of democracy you are asking for - that  you  require  a  man to walk naked in the street? I  think  the  democracy

required  by the Barisan Sosialis is a Communist democracy, but not a  socialist

democracy.  Yes, Mr Speaker, it is good that we have a thorough  discussion  of

this  Bill  in  this  Assembly so that the people will  not  be  misled  by  the

representatives  of  the Barisan Sosialis and the other Opposition  Members  who

support  the Barisan Sosialis or who are the frontline of the Communist  forces.

Mr  Speaker, I think this is not the end of the matter. I am confident that the

Barisan  Sosialis  will adopt other tactics in order to wreck or  frustrate  our

merger. However, we, the

Government of the P.A.P., will continue to fight and overcome all obstacles  now

and in the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have proposed this amendment and Members in

the  Opposition have given various reasons and examples to substantiate that  it

is  justified and to show that if the Government could carry out an  honest  and

democratic  national referendum, it would get an honest and  democratic  answer.

But we have not heard any substantive arguments from the Government Ministers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



and their Back-Benchers to refute our arguments. The undemocratic provisions  in

this  Bill  are known to all the people of Singapore and have been disclosed  in

this  House. If we go out to the rural areas to listen to the farmers, or go  to

the  factories  to  listen to the workers; or if we go and  meet  merchants  and

people  in  other walks of life, you will find that they all accuse  the  P.A.P.

Government,  which insist on the blank votes provision to save  their  political

life, of being dishonest and undemocratic in having such provisions in the Bill.

Mr Speaker, Sir, if the P.A.P.

Government  dare  to say that they can put a straightforward question  on  their

White Paper merger to a straightforward answer by the people, then they can  say

that our amendment is not necessary. But the Government do not want to let their

White  Paper  merger  proposals be decided by the people in  a  democratic  way.

Therefore,  they  have  no alternative but to depend  on  means  which  are  not

democratic to get the answer they want. That is why today they insist  that  all

blank votes should be deemed to be votes in support of them. My colleagues  have

advanced  many  arguments to refute such a proposition. We have  also  mentioned

that  there  has been no precedent in all the countries in the world  which  can

show that any government can have such a provision as the P.A.P. Government  now

would  want  to  have in this Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P.  Ministers  and

their  Members are unable to advance their reasons and arguments to prove  their

case. They have also advanced something which cannot he substantiated, something

which  is  not  based on reason. For instance, when we oppose  the  undemocratic

provisions of the Bill, all the Members from the Government side try to  explain

that the opposition to the undemocratic provisions has been provoked by the  Com

munists.  They  say  that  today in Singapore the most  isolated  ones  are  the

Communists.  According to them, there are only 300 Communists in Singapore.  Why

then have we been hearing from them all the time that all those who oppose these

undemocratic provisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>





are  Communists? Are not their arguments contradictory? Do the Government mean

to  say  that when we oppose these undemocratic provisions, it will affect  many

people  in  future  and many people will cast blank votes when two  unacceptable

questions are advanced in the future national referendum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only goes to show that the P.A.P. Government have no confidence in their

own  White  Paper merger. It also proves that no matter how the  Government  can

make  use  of  all propaganda machinery to spread their point  of  view  to  the

people, it will be of no avail to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment by us will not be accepted by the Government.

This  goes  to  show that they are not sincere in having a national  referendum.

They  intend to force through this national referendum in order to salvage their

political fortunes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we as representatives of the people have received repre

sentations from many organisations which are representatives of the people.  All

those representations have given their arguments and attacked those undemocratic

provisions  in the Bill. We therefore want to point out clearly here  that  when

the  P.A.P. came into power, it did so with the support of the broad  masses  of

the  people, the labouring classes, 'farmers, and others. Today every Member  of

this  House  here  has received such representations asking  the  Government  to

abolish  those undemocratic provisions. But the P.A.P. Government today seem  to

want only to stay inside air-conditioned rooms and are oblivious to the views of

the people outside. That is why today we are unable to hear the answers from the

leaders of the P.A.P., especially the Ministers. They have been saying that  the

P.A.P. came from the people and they will go among the people. I would say  that

they have already thrown the people overboard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must point out to the P.A.P. that today people in all

walks of life in Singapore strongly oppose the undemocratic provisions that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>

all  blank  votes and uncertain votes are deemed to be in support of the  Government.  If the P.A.P. want to achieve their purpose by Fascist means, they cannot

do so by just passing this Bill, which will not save their political future. The

Prime  Minister has said that the judgment of history is very cruel, and I would

remind  them of this, that history will give a very correct record of the  whole

events and things to come.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in debating the amendment moved by the Member for

Queenstown,  the Opposition Members have said a lot about the terms  "democracy"

and "undemocracy". There is a popular Malay saying that the person who shoulders

the responsibility knows best the position.



<br><br>10.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, many of the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen are single, I think. These people have not yet had the experience of being a father whose

responsibility  is  to  look  after the welfare of  his  children.  Indeed,  Mr

Speaker,  implementing a proposal cannot satisfy all sections of the  community.

However heavy the downpour of rain, there must be a spot where the land is  dry.

This  is  the natural course of events. As I have said earlier on, I have  heard

much  being  said about democracy and undemocracy. I say if we are undemocratic,

this  Referendum Bill will not be tabled in the Assembly, because the Government

have the unfettered right to carry through their proposals without a referendum,

but  it is on the basis of democratic principles that they have brought in  this

Referendum  Bill,  so  that  these may be discussed  fully  by  each  and  every

responsible Member of the Assembly who is answerable to the people  and  to  the

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me give a simple example, so that even if it is heard by young children, they may be able to understand it, as it is very easy. For

instance, a father is responsible for his children, and when the time comes  for

dinner or lunch, all the children rise to have their food. The question is what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



kind  of  food  will they take, or what kind of food shall we  take?  Then  the

father  asks  the children, "Awang," for instance, "what would  you  like?"  And

Awang replies, "I like meat." Then he asks Ali, "Ali, what about you, what will

you  have?"  And he says, "I prefer fish." Then again the father  asks  Mohamed,

"What  will  you take?" Mohamed says he likes vegetables. And so on. Then  there

are so many questions posed to the children. One child prefers fish, because  he

thinks  that  it  is  better  than vegetables. Another  child  prefers  meat  to

vegetables. As a responsible father, whose duty it is to look after the  welfare

of the children, he is obliged to determine what he can afford, if he has twelve

children,  and  if he is a working-class man, he has to spend according  to  his

means,  on  food  containing  vitamins which are necessary  for  his  children's

health. Then he arrives at a decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the children are asked, there may he one or two among them who are confused

because they cannot make up their minds which is the better food, whether it  is

vegetables,  meat,  or fish. They then remain silent. They  leave  it  to  their

father's discretion as to what he thinks best. In other words, they give a blank

vote  to the father, so that the discretion is left to the father to decide what

is best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have just quoted the simplest example so that it can be understood by all. This is not a Government nominated by the colonialists. This

is  a Government elected by the people and is responsible to the people. One day

when  the time comes we will return to the people. It is suggested that we  have

betrayed their interests, hut we have to face them one day. If we have done so,

it will not only be we but our children too who will be condemned by the people.

We  realise that as elected representatives we are responsible to the people and

we  think this is best for the people. The people may he confused by the tactics

adopted  by  the Barisan Sosialis on the question of merger as set  out  in  the

White Paper,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



because  complete  merger  as  required by  the  Barisan  Sosialis  (which  they

subsequently  denied)  is merger on the basis of Penang  or  Malacca.  When  the

people  are in such a confused state, they will naturally cast a blank vote.  It

is  the  duty of the Government to protect the people. The Member for Toa  Payoh

said just now that if we were to go to the people, we would hear them condemning

the  Government. If we were to listen to the merchants, we would also  hear  the

same  views.  But, Mr Speaker, they are responsible for planting the  seeds  of

hatred. We never go to the people just for the sake of misleading them.  We  are

unlike the Barisan Sosialis whose main job is to confuse and mislead the people.

Therefore, in a democratic way, we put it to the people and tell them that  this

is one of the best ways in which we can ensure their future, it is up to them to

choose.  So, Mr Speaker, I think the blank votes are the result of their  being

confused  by disruptive elements and that they have given their mandate  to  the

Government to look after their welfare. It is appropriate, therefore,  that  the

blank votes should be used to look after their welfare.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe

that  even  in the 19th century, there was no provision of this kind. I  believe

the  people  in  this  House too have never heard of this provision.  Under  the

system  of  one man one vote, there have never been such things as  blank  votes

being  treated as in support of the Government's proposition. There is  also  no

such  provision  in dictatorship countries. There are no such  things  as  blank

votes  being  counted in support of a dictatorship. In Singapore  we  are  in  a

special position, because we are under a dictatorial P.A.P. Government, but they

have  very subtly shouted their slogan of 'service to the people'. They  pretend

by saying that they want to let the people decide their destiny themselves. That

is  to  say,  let the constitutional arrangement of the future of  Singapore  be

decided by the people of Singapore. But the P.A.P. Government already know  that

the constitutional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



arrangements by them have been discarded by the people. Therefore, they know

that in a national referendum they will be defeated, and in order to save their

faces, they, in a thick-skinned manner, unashamedly want the blank votes to be

counted  as  in favour of the Government's proposition. Therefore,  they  can

deceive the people and say that they are very democratic because they let the

people decide and the people use their votes to decide in their favour.

Therefore, in the Referendum Bill this plot has come out. Where is the origin of

the  plot?  It  is like this. The P.A.P. Government know that the  people  of

Singapore  do  not want the constitutional arrangements, that is, the  White

Paper on merger.



<br><br>10.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that the people are given a choice of two alternatives - the White

Paper type of merger and the Penang/ Malacca type of merger. This means  that

the  people  are forced into selecting one of two unacceptable  propositions.

This  is  just  like conditions in a feudalistic society.  The  parents  want

their son to choose one of two brides.

One of the brides is a leper and the

other  a  T.B. patient. Whichever bride the son chooses, it will  only  mean

calamity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous speaker said that the Government is something like a father.

This  father is something like the father in the example I have just  quoted.

Is  it  good for a father to force his son to take morphine? Suppose you  say

that  the  people should take morphine. Can you force the people to take  it?

Or is it right for them to take it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the P.A.P. Members had gone to the coffee shops they

would  have  heard from the talk among businessmen and trishaw  pullers  that

they  object  to  the Government's dictatorial method used  in  the  National

Referendum  Bill. To liken the Government to a father of the  people  in  the

example  given, who regards the blank votes as supporting the Government,  is

not right. I think the P.A.P. Members have not been to the people, otherwise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



they would have heard of these conversations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government are just like prostitutes who regard those people who do

not  speak  to them as no good. This is a shameful act. If the P.A.P. Government

puts  forward  two questions, one on the White Paper and the other  on  the  so-called  Penang and Malacca type of merger, with the condition that  blank  votes

are counted in favour of the Government, then in an electorate of 500 people, if

200  votes  are in favour of the White Paper, 200 in favour of the Penang  type,

then  the  100  blank or uncertain votes will under this clause  mean  that  the

Government  is  winning  when,  in  fact,  it  is  losing.  That  is  a  way  of

misinterpreting the will of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do the Government want to have the blank votes provision? The arguments

are  that the purpose is to frustrate the Barisan Sosialis' intent to wreck  the

national referendum. Are you treating the people as blind people or people  with

out brains? When they elected you to form the Government, were they blind?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member

must remember that he is addressing the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, the P.A.P. therefore is near the point of collapse, just like  the

time  when  the Lim Yew Hock Government used to say that the people of Singapore

were ignorant. The P.A.P. say the Barisan Sosialis are provoking the people into

wrecking the national referendum. But today, Sir, the political knowledge of the

people  of  Singapore  is far greater than that in 1959.  They  have  made  much

progress  and  they cannot now be fooled by politicians. If  a  thing  is  good,

correct and advantageous to them, they will fully support it. But if ii  is  bad

or  inimical to them and detrimental to their future or their generations,  they

will strongly oppose it. That is why up to now the PAP. Government are unable to

and  cannot  quote  precedents in any country in the world that  adopts  such  a

provision  as  this  one, providing for blank votes to  be  in  support  of  the

Government. If the Government are really sincere in preserving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



the  democratic rights of the people, then they should abide by the will of  the

people  and  should accept the views of the people and let the people  have  the

right  to  say "yes" or "no" and should not try to adulterate the views  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a little while ago certain terms such as "democracy" and

others  were  used  by  the  Government. They  argued  that  democracy  has  the

connotation  which  should be interpreted in relation to the  prevailing  circumstances and objective surroundings. But if they really mean democracy, then  the

Government should not prevent the people from having democratic rights.  And  if

you  want to have democracy you should not only exercise democracy in this House

but  also  let  the  people have the right to democracy outside.  That  is  only

democratic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these protestations of concern, for what the

Barisan  Sosialis  choose  to  call the basic democratic  right  to  organise  a

campaign  for the recording of blank votes in order to frustrate the  referendum

on  merger,  can  be  dismissed  with  the contempt  that  they  deserve.  These

protestations sound hollow and hypocritical coming from the lips of those  whose

manipulators  outside the Assembly have very little regard for democratic  forms

and  practices. There is nothing undemocratic in giving the voter the  right  to

choose between two or more honest proposals in a referendum, and say to him that

if  he  cannot  make up his mind, then he is deemed to accept or be  willing  to

accept the Legislative Assembly decision on the matter referred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is nothing eternal or immutable about the principles underlying

electoral  procedures,  nor is there any such concept as the  fundamental  human

right  to ascertain. Electoral procedures are primarily designed to ensure  that

elections  and  matters put to the electorate are fairly and honestly  conducted

and fairly and honestly put. And if there is a threat of abuse, then these proce

dures must be amended to check the possibility of such abuse. In an election  or

a by-election there is no temptation to organise a campaign for the purpose of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



recording blank votes, and experience of general elections and by-elections  has

shown that blank votes form a negligible percentage of the total votes cast.  If

it  becomes apparent that a move is afoot to organise a campaign for the purpose

of  recording blank votes to frustrate the referendum, then it would be  foolish

on the part of the Government not to introduce this counter measure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Can the Minister explain that if an honest referendum is held where

the  question  posed  to the people is simple and where the  people  can  easily

answer, why should anybody want to organise a campaign to put in blank votes?



<br><br><!-- Prime Minister -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They will be

recorded, that is why.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> If it was an honest referendum -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Then, Sir, it would he

foolish  on the part of Government not to introduce counter measures to  nullify

such  a campaign while, at the same time, ensuring the voter his freedom to make

a  democratic choice. If, in effect a no-merger proposal in the disguise of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  proposal  for complete merger with  automatic  conversion  of

citizenship and proportionate representation is put to the electorate, it  would

be a fraud on the electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has been challenged to publish the Tunku's reply to his

Party's proposal on merger, but he has not dared to publish it as it will expose

the  deception by which the Barisan Sosialis have sought to conceal their  bogus

complete merger proposal. The publication of this reply will convince the public

that  the Barisan Sosialis have deliberately made claims for a merger which they

know are totally unacceptable to the Tunku and the Federation Government.

It  takes two parties to make an agreement, and an uncompromising demand is made

only when it is the intention not to reach any agreement at all. The argument



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  is  that if neither of  the  questions  put  to  the

electorate in the referendum on merger is acceptable from their point  of  view,

clause 29 should include a provision to enable the voter to abstain by recording

a  blank vote, and that his blank vote should be rejected so that they can mount

their campaign for the recording of blank votes to frustrate the referendum. If,

however, their bogus proposal for complete merger intending that there should be

no  merger is put to the electorate along with any other question including  the

White  Paper proposals, then clause 29 in its present form does not  become  any

problem  to  them  as  they  could mount a campaign in  favour  of  their  bogus

proposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Do you seriously believe all this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I cannot see anything undemocratic in putting the Barisan Sosialis'

first  proposal for a merger of the Penang and Malacca type, which is a  genuine

merger  proposal, as against their later dishonest and faked no-merger  proposal

to the electorate, and asking the electorate to choose between this proposal and

the  White Paper proposals; or between their proposal of the Penang and  Malacca

type  of merger or any other proposal which their leaders in this Assembly  have

also suggested, and the White Paper proposals. Nor is it undemocratic to say  to

the voter that if he is unable to make a choice of one of these proposals, he is

deemed  to  have  accepted or to be willing to accept the  Legislative  Assembly

decision on the matter referred.



<br><br>10.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason why we should lend the Barisan Sosialis a helping hand to

mount  a  campaign for the recording of blank votes by omitting  this  provision

from clause 29 to enable the Barisan Sosialis to frustrate the referendum on merger when these questions are put to the electorate in the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 is both democratic and necessary. The Banisan Sosialis in their

amendment want to make it not an offence for the voter to destroy or deface his

own  or another person's ballot paper. They have clearly manifested their  intention to frustrate and defeat this referendum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



on  merger.  There  is no reason why we should help them to achieve  their  evil

purpose. This new clause, which was not in the original Bill, was inserted  only

after their plan became apparent, and it will ensure that they will not be  able

to achieve their disreputable aim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown and the Member for Thomson accused the

Government of wanting to grab blank votes and to steal blank votes. They do  not

want  to  remember what the 38 trade unions and the Country People's Association

said  before  the Select Committee. Their friends and supporters in those  trade

unions  wanted it enacted in the Bill that the affirmative of a question put  to

the  electorate should be given effect to only if it received 60 per cent of the

votes  cast. A case like this was put to the unions. Suppose there were  100,000

electors in a referendum who voted:

49,000 voted for the affirmative and

40,000 against; and there were 11,000 blank votes. They were asked on which side

the  11,000  blank votes should be counted. The reply was that the 11,000  blank

votes  should be counted on the negative side. In other words, they made a claim

to  these 11,000 blank votes. Why then do the Member for Thomson and the  Member

for  Queenstown accuse the Government of wanting to steal these blank votes? All

that the Government propose is that voters who cannot make up their minds on the

question  or questions put to them should be deemed to have accepted and  to  be

willing  to  accept  the  decision of the Legislative  Assembly  on  the  matter

referred.  How then can the Government be accused of wanting to grab  the  blank

votes  and  to  steal  the blank votes? It looks as if the thieves  are  on  the

Barisan side.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an atmosphere of shyness pervades the

Chamber  tonight on this debate on the amendment to clause 29 of the  Bill.  The

Government  Front-Benches have suddenly become bashful. Like  young  maidens  of

bygone  days, they think that to be silent is to be more discreet.  We  expected

that  the  Government Front-Benches would come in to defend  their  indefensible

position.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Obviously they

know  that  discretion is the better part of valour. We have waited for  a  very

long  time,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, and we have not heard any new  arguments  except

repetitions of the old falsehoods.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> From your point of view!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Obviously the

Government Front-benches are fully aware that to defend an indefensible position

is  hopeless. They have left this onerous task to the Back-benches. It does  not

give  me very much pleasure to reply to Back-benchers, nor to rebut their  silly

arguments.  But in the absence of more positive statements and more  solid  argu

ments  from  the  Government  Front-benches, it  leaves  me  no  choice  but  to

understand  that what the Back-Benches say represent what the Government  think,

and  that  the Front-Benches do not have enough courage to say the  things  them

selves.



<br><br>10.50 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]  </b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Back-Benches, Mr Mammen, Sir, are therefore left with this baby and they have carried it in the most awkward manner. They have defended their indefen sible stand with contradictory statements. They have even slapped the faces and reprimanded the conduct of their own Government Front-benches. [Interruption] Am I kidding myself, Mr Mammen, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take the Back-benches one by

one,  although  most  of  them  said  the same  things  and  repeated  the  same

falsehoods. Earlier in the evening, the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for National Development, in the course of his arguments, made three points. The

first was the attempt to give a comical - no, tragical, if I may say - discourse  on

the meaning and practice of democracy. Secondly, he demonstrated very clearly  a

guilty  conscience when he tried to defend democracy. Lastly, he went  to  great

lengths  to  reprimand the Opposition for interjections which, by the  way,  are

parliamentary and which, in so far as I personally

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>

am  concerned,  I  have  learnt from the Prime Minister  and  the  Minister  for

Finance.  One can remember the days not so long ago, even just a few  hours  ago

perhaps,  how the Prime Minister, whenever he gets piqued by a point  raised  by

the  Member  for Queenstown, laughs like a horse, and certain Ministers  chatter

like gibbons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He is acting just like a miniature Member for Anson!

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You have confirmed what I said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> So I see no

reason  why  such antics which are permissible for the Government  Front-Benches

are not permissible for the Opposition Benches. In fact, in a democracy, it  is

always  the Opposition that has more leeway and enjoys more flexibility  in  debate -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Where did you

read that?

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - than the Government Benches. The Minister for Finance

seems  not  to  have  read it. If he wants to read it, I  can  give  him  a  few

references so that he may be able to acquaint himself with the actual  processes

of democracy. It will be my pleasure, Sir, to give him the references as soon as

I  have  finished. If he will come with me to the Library, I will show  him  the

books.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of



information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not want

general  references on the democratic processes. I have heard  an  extraordinary

statement that in a democracy the opposition has greater opportunity and greater

leeway  than  the Government. This is a most astounding innovation  to  me.  The

Member  for Nee Soon claims that there are books and authorities to back up  his

statement.  Please  produce them now. I am all agog  to  listen  to  this  extra

ordinary theory.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Nee Soon has promised to give the Minister

for  Finance  the necessary books. The Minister for Finance should be  satisfied

with that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He is too anxious to learn!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please proceed, Dr Sheng.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I have

indicated  that in a parliamentary democracy, in so far as debates in the  House

are  concerned, the Opposition always has more leeway and flexibility  than  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> What does the Minister mean by "rubbish"?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member

for Nee Soon has made his point clear.

There  is  no need to go into this subject again. Please come back to the  amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With respect,

Sir,  I  will certainly do that. But allow me to back my contention  that  in  a

parliamentary  democracy the Opposition is given more leeway. I would  ask  the Minister  for Finance to cast his mind back to some five years ago and  imagine

the  time  when the Prime Minister was on the Opposition and the  advantage  he

took  over  the  Government, the amount of flexibility and  leeway  he  allowed

himself -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A lot of falsehoods!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> True, too, he said a lot of falsehoods. If the Minister

for  Finance is seriously suggesting that what the then Member for Tanjong Pagar

and  also  the now Member for Tanjong Pagar did was something that  was  against

parliamentary democracy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have made my ruling very clear. We are not debating

here  what  is  democracy and what is not democracy. We  are  now  debating  the

amendment  moved by the Member for Queenstown. So far I have allowed the  Member

for  Nee Soon to continue with his reply to the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  National Development. And the Member for Nee Soon  has  made  his

point  very  clear. It would be better if he could come back  to  the  amendment

which has been moved by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Mr Mammen, Sir. I will adhere to your advice.

As  I  was saying, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development gave a comical and farcical discourse on the meaning and practice of

democracy.  He  said that the Opposition was wearing a cloak  of  democracy  and

practising  all  things that were undemocratic. He tried to tell  us  that  just

because  we are able to stand here in this Chamber and speak from the Opposition

Benches it is by the grace of the P.A.P. Have they arrogated unto themselves the

rights of the people? Let me tell them, Mr Mammen, Sir, that we are here not by

their  grace.  We are here because of our rights. We have been  elected  by  the

people to speak here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. The Member is trying to intimidate the

Front Benches.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think

it  is  a  point  of  order.  I think the Minister  for  Finance  is  not  being

intimidated by the Member for Nee Soon. Dr Sheng.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Surely Mr

Mammen,  Sir,  I  had expected the Minister for Finance to be  made  of  sterner

stuff.  After  all,  he  is second in command in the Government  today.  Once  I

remember I read in Time Magazine that his views were considered to be almost  as

independent as those of the Prime Minister. [Interruption] Oh, yes. Mr  Mammen.

Sir, the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



Home  Affairs is hardly the man to speak of medical practice to me, as  I  am  a

doctor.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This debate is getting out of hand. I have ruled that the

Member  for  Nee  Soon should come back to the amendment and not  speak  on  the

person of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Home Affairs, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you,

Sir, for your guidance again. I have to keep on coming back to what I was saying

because I am being interrupted. I would try very much, Sir, to look at you  when

I speak so that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is good.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - the picture of the comical "horse opera" opposite will

not detract me from what I am saying.



<br><br>11.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development

also  said  that  the  very  fact  that we have been  having  mass  rallies  and

canvassing  and  newspaper  statements and political Party  newspapers  are  all

attributed to the leniency and the grace of the P.A.P. But let me tell him  that

it is not so. We enjoy this right by virtue of the Constitution, and even if the

P.A.P. would like to suspend the Constitution, it is not within their powers  to

do so. That is the sadness of the P.A.P. So they try to tell us that what we are

allowed to do under the constitution is by their grace. It goes to show how hope

less  the  Government  Bench  is in that, in trying to  defend  an  indefensible

position,  they  have to give falsehoods, half-truths and untruths  to  back  up

their arguments.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I feel that I am going to sleep.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Go and sleep!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I understood from Mr Speaker one day

that it is perfectly parliamentary for Members to scoot or to walk out and if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



Members find it very sleepy here, I see no reason why they should not go out and

sleep -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is not interesting now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> We are now on

the  most important part of this National Referendum Bill - clause 29. And it  is

astounding to hear the Government Benches maintaining that what they  are  doing

is  democratic. What is democracy? Democracy is, in essence, the  power  of  the

citizen  to  exercise his right, the right to elect and the right to  ultimately

form  the  Government in the country. But that is a right which has two aspects.

One  has  a right to say 'yes' and one has the right to say 'no'. If  a  man  is

given a right and that right is limited to only saying 'yes', that right can  be

very, very dangerous. It is much better that one is deprived of the right to say

'yes' rather than be compelled to say 'yes'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, I remember seeing a picture, I think it was "Trial at Nuremburg". Those Germans during the time when Hitler was just coming to power were

compelled  by  Hitler's  Government to say 'yes' to certain  of  the  legal  constitutional  changes introduced by the Nazi regime. I remember  one  of  the  democrats in that picture was trying to defend his democratic stand. When  he  was

asked  by the prosecution how it was that he said 'yes' to Hitler's constitutional  changes in the legal field, he said, "But everybody had to say 'yes'. Nobody

was  allowed to say 'no'." Therefore, he said 'yes' because everybody had to say

'yes'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have gone one step further than Hitler. They say you only say

'yes';  you do not say 'no'; and even you say nothing, it means 'yes'. Where  is

democracy  now? You only have the right to say 'yes' but not the  right  to  say

'no' or 'abstain'. And yet we see sensible and intelligent Government Front  Ben

ches  seriously  standing up to defend this situation. How far  can  one  go  in

trying to deceive oneself and in trying to deceive the people? All the arguments

of  the  Government hinge on one thing, i.e., the Opposition is likely to pinch,

as  the Minister for Health and Law said, the abstaining votes. Just because  it

is contended that the Opposition might pinch



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



the  unmarked  and  blank votes, the Government justify themselves  by  stealing

those votes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I did not say that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Where is the moral? Where is the decency of the move?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You mean it is all right for you to pinch votes?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> No. I never

said  so.  Mr Mammen, Sir, I say it is contended by the Government.  If  it  is

contended  by  the Government that the Opposition want to pinch the  votes,  the

Government therefore justify themselves by stealing votes. I never said that  it

was  our  intention to ask for the blank votes. We have never stated that  blank

votes are Barisan votes or Opposition votes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Come, come!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> We have never stated that. It is because of a twist in

logic that they say we have stated -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of

order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will

give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I did not accuse them of wanting to pinch votes or anything like

that.  We  were accused and I was explaining to them that we were  the  innocent

people  and  we  were accused. So if they call us thieves, they show  they  have

those thievish intentions in their own minds. Is that not fair?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, the Minister is either marble-headed or

is  half asleep. My argument was that just because it was their contention  that

we  wanted to pinch them, they justify themselves by stealing the votes. They do

not  seem  to  understand it. Let me come to the point. Why  is  the  Government

making  such  a  big fuss about blank votes? Is it because the Government  think

that more than half the people of Singapore will be casting blank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>

votes?  In that case, Mr Mammen, Sir, it is an open admission that the  Barisan

is  able  to swing the views and opinions of more than half the people in  Singa

pore. If that contention is not in the minds of the Government Benches, if  they

feel  that with Radio P.A.P., with all the newspapers, with all the Ministry  of

Culture  vans  going  around they should easily be able  to  out-propaganda  us;

wherein  lies the fear that the people will be confused, as I heard one  of  the

Back  benchers mutter? If the people are confused, it is because they have  been

confused by the Government. If it is contended that the Opposition have confused

the people, surely, Mr Mammen, Sir, the right thing is for the Government to go

and  unconfuse  the people, so that when it comes to a matter of  such  national

importance as the referendum on merger, the people should be able to make  their

decision with clear and open minds. Are the Government so sure that despite  all

their  propaganda apparatus they have no chance of winning the hearts and  minds

of  the people, that they must resort to legal looting in order to have one over

the  people?  If  that is an open admission, then we will have  less  to  grouse

about.  Even then, standing here as representatives of the people,  we  have  to

stand up to protect the people's rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government keep on harping that if they are a Fascist Government the

Barisan  Sosialis would not be here. They forgot the time when  they  themselves

were  over the other side, in 1958 and the beginning of 1959, when there  was  a

serous  move from the then S.P.A. Coalition Government, in conjunction with  the

then  Director  of Special Branch, to ban the P.A.P. I believe  in  one  of  his

sparring episodes with the Member for Anson, the Minister for Health and Law did

mention in his open letter to the Straits Times where I became involved. In  the

period  1958/1959, the greatest danger the P.A.P. faced was proscription by  the

S.P.A.  Government. That was written by the Minister for Health and Law himself.

I  presume  it  is an accurate statement, and I presume, being the Minister  for

Law, he has a lot of evidence and a lot of grounds before he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



makes such a categorical statement in the Press. Why then, Mr Mammen, Sir,  was

the P.A.P. not proscribed in 1958/1959? Why was it not banned despite the strong

move  by  the  then Government to ban it? Because it is known  that  under  the

Constitution, the then Government could do only certain things and could go only

that  far.  I  put  it to you, Mr Mammen, Sir, that the P.A.P.  Government  are

suffering  from the same limitations, although they try to persuade  the  people

that  the  correct way to fix the Barisan is not to lock them up, as the  Member

for  Cairnhill has frequently challenged them to do so. They contend that in the

fight  for  the  hearts and minds of the people of the electorate,  to  ban  the

Barisan,  to  lock  up the Barisan leaders is not the right move.  That  is  the

strategy they have advocated and that is the reply they have always given to the

Member  for Cairnhill whenever the hon. Member for Cairnhill, the ex-Hon.  Chief

Minister,  challenges them to lock up a certain portion of the Barisan  Sosialis

leadership. They have established that fact and today they come and tell us they

are  not  banning  the  Barisan  Sosialis or that  they  are  not  limiting  the

activities of the Barisan Sosialis because they are democratic. They are  by  no

means democratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here, firstly, because we have the right to he here and, secondly, be

cause  they are trying to avoid a fiasco in the battle for the hearts and  minds

of the people and they know that the surest way of losing the battle is to close

up  the  Barisan. Surely it is not by their kind-heartedness or good-heartedness

that  we are here. It is that small light that shines at the edge of the  window

that inspires them -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Point of order. Can we come back to the blank and

uncertain votes?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



reply to certain points made by the Government Back benches. So far he has  made

the point clear. If he goes beyond that, I will rule him out of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Mr Mammen, Sir. As I was saying, there was a

little  light coming from the corner of the window and the P.A.P. looks at  that

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> That is the trouble with the Minister for Health and Law,

think that -

here.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> If I wanted

darkness  to  pervade  this Chamber, I would not be  speaking  of  light.  I  am

speaking  of  light because I thought and I hope some sense would permeate  into

the skulls of some of the Front Benches.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have made it very clear to the Member for Nee Soon that

he  has  made  his  point,  So  far as Members of  the  Government  Benches  are

concerned.  But if he is going into too many details, then he is completely  out

of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Can I just sum up what I meant, because I meant to go

slightly  further? All I wish to say, Mr Mammen, Sir, is that  we  are  allowed

certain  flexibilities and certain leeways, certainly not because of the  Govern

ment's love for democracy. If they loved anything at all, they would love to see

the end of the Barisan Sosialis, but certainly not by proscribing it.

practising bayoneting on gunny sacks.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Will the Member for Nec Soon indicate how all this fits

in  with  the amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown? I have already  said

Sir,  if you will just bear with me. I only meant to say that in the early  days

of  this Session of the Assembly the P.A.P. used to say that the correct way  of

dealing with has-been political forces or spent political forces was to consider

them  like  gunny bags suspended from crossbars and being bayoneted by  Japanese

soldiers in the early dawn. But have they been treating the Barisan Sosialis  in

that manner, Sir? No, they have not. And they try to tell us that the Barisan is

in a zugzwang. If the Barisan Sosialis were really in a zugzwang, the Government

Benches  should just sit down quietly and feel confident and smug about it,  and

not  be worried and extend Assembly sittings till 12 midnight when there  is  no

Press coverage after 8 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It will be in the papers tomorrow.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Of course, it

will  not  be  in the papers tomorrow. When I was speaking from  that  side,  it

always  got  into the papers. That is the essence of parliamentary democracy  as

practised by the P.A.P. When I was speaking from that side - Mr Mammen, Sir,  you

must  forgive  me for being unduly sensitive to your nods and the  movements  of

your  head.  We who practise the art of medicine detect signs more acutely  than

the average layman.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have made

my point very clear to the Member for Nee Soon, and if he continues on this line

I have to rule him completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you,

Mr Mammen, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister likened the Gov

ernment to a father and the electorate as sons. That is a fair enough simile.  I

will  acknowledge it. But then when he went on to justify that blank  votes  and

spoilt  votes are votes in favour of the Government, he went a bit  too  far  to

suggest the simile of a father asking his children what food they liked. He  was

saying that if the father was uncertain whether to give his children fish,  meat

or  vegetables,  he would ask the Sons whether they should have what  particular

type  of food on the table. Mr Mammen, Sir, I say that if he did that, he would

be  a very stupid father because children naturally like tasty food, sweetstuff,

foods that are full of calories and carbohydrates, but of very little nutritious

value. If you let kids have a say in what they should take, they will be sucking

sweets all day. A responsible father will not ask his children whether they like

this or that, but he will just give that to them. [Interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister for Home Affairs will

bear  with  me - a responsible government will not go round asking the  electorate

whether they want to smoke cigarettes, or pipe tobacco, or cigars, because those

things should be decided by sensible people. It is only when issues of grave  im

portance come into the question that it is necessary to have a referendum. After

all, we all know that a referendum will







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



cost some $400,000 in this part of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for the Hon the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister to suggest

similes that are absurd would indicate the absurdity and the bankruptcy  of  the

stand  of  the Government in that, they have to divert intelligent  people  into

some silly argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the last speaker from the Government Benches, the Minister for Health and

Law, contended that clause 29 is both democratic -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> And necessary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - and necessary. We know that one of the strongest

arguments of the Government is that this Bill is a general Referendum Bill meant

for  general referenda. Today, Sir, when I came into the Chamber I was surprised

to find an amendment tabled by the Minister for Home Affairs - to be known as Part

VI under the sub-title "DURATION":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This Ordinance shall cease to have effect

on the merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.'



<br><br>They  now come and tell us that it is a general Referendum Bill. It is a general

referendum all right. As soon as the referendum on merger is over, the  Bill - it

will be an Ordinance then - will also be finished. So is not this Bill a specific

Bill  produced  for a specific purpose as defined by the Hon, the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for National Development? He remarked just  now  that

any sensible person must always have a motive when he does a thing. He said that

in the case of this Bill the motive is to bring about merger with the Federation

of  Malaya. They go to great lengths to demonstrate to this House that the  Bill

is  a  specific  referendum Bill. And this amendment here, Mr Mammen,  Sir,  is

concrete proof that the Bill is specific. Yet they keep on repeating their false

hood  that this is a general Bill. But never mind about that. The merits of  the

arguments have been recorded in Hansard, and it will be futile for me to  repeat

those arguments when, as I have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>

said,  there  is so much schizoid tendency on the Government Front Benches.  But

let us see why it is necessary to introduce this amendment in relation to clause

29.  I  venture to suggest, Sir, that the Tunku, who has a lot of say  fn  these

things, has suggested to the P.A.P. Government that clause 29 is unacceptable by

the  Federation, and that he will only have anything to do with the Bill if that

clause is deleted. He has made no pretensions about his views on this clause. He

has said so openly. He has at least implied that it is undemocratic.

I mean clause 29, Mr Mammen, Sir. And

this is but a compromise between the

P.A.P. and the Tunku.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. All these arguments on Part VI, which is an amendment to

be  moved by the Minister for Home Affairs, can well be reserved when we come to

that particular item.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With due respect, Mr Mammen, Sir, I have made it very

clear  that  I am speaking in relation to clause 29, and I am just  touching  on

this as I am anticipating it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I venture to suggest that the Tunku will have nothing to do with an undemocratic Bill which, after the passage of the Third Reading, will become an

Ordinance. And if there is any compromise at all, this Ordinance will be revoked

immediately  after merger. So that in so far as the Tunku is concerned,  he  has

nothing  to do with it. That goes to show, Mr Mammen, Sir, that even the  Tunku

does  not want clause 29. The Tunku is sensible enough to know, that the  people

should  not  be cheated, because once they are cheated they lose  faith  in  the

whole parliamentary machine.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

On  a point of order, Sir. Is it reasonable for the Member for Nee Soon to bring

up  arguments  that the Tunku has a part in this referendum Bill, especially  in

regard to clause 29?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think before the

Member for Nee Soon makes an allegation against a friendly Prime Minister, it is

better he is able to produce in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



House  any  concrete evidence to substantiate whether, in fact,  the  Tunku  has

dictated to this Government to introduce a new clause. Otherwise he should not.



<br><br>11.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I had come to the conclusion that the

Tunku felt that this Bill was undemocratic -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. A point of

order has been raised. The hon. Member cannot make a statement imputing that the

Federation  Prime Minister had a hand in drafting the amendment proposed  to  be

moved by the Minister for Home Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With great respect, Mr Mammen, Sir, I would not dream of

rebuking  the Federation Prime Minister. I have never said anything that  sounds

like a rebuke for the Federation Prime Minister.



<br><br>11.31 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): If the Barisan Sosialis Member for Nee Soon

cannot  bring forward reasonable arguments to oppose clause 29, I  think  it  is

better  that  he  should not refer to the Prime Minister of  the  Federation  of

Malaya  in  this debate. This is a matter which is coming near to involving  the

Prime Minister of the Federation in the politics of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have been following

this  debate. I do agree that it is wrong to involve the Prime Minister  of  the

Federation  of Malaya in this debate. He should be left completely out  of  this

debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With great

respect, Sir, could I just clarify how I

got involved in this, because I do not

want any misunderstanding -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member

has been ruled out of order. I suggest that he go on to another aspect of the

amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I have your indulgence to record

just one statement? In my speech.

I have never rebuked the Tunku.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the

Member has made that point. He has not rebuked the Tunku. But the most important

part  of  the  whole  thing is that the Prime Minister of the Federation  should

never  be  dragged into a debate of this nature, unless there is specific  proof

that he has intervened.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was saying that from the amendment

proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs, one is able to anticipate that  there

is some disagreement in some quarters on the whole context of the Bill. The most

likely place where disagreement can be recorded would obviously be in clause 29.

if  one is acute enough politically in one's thinking. Since clause 29 is likely

to be the most offending clause, this little bit of amendment could very well be

a compromise between negotiating parties so as to put on record -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is still trying to insinuate what he

has insinuated, then I must pull him up and be very serious about it and ask him

to  cease  speaking. I have indicated that that insinuation is wrong, completely

out of order, and therefore he must not persist in being out of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you for your guidance, Mr Speaker, Sir. Let me say,

in conclusion, that we have built up a fine tradition of parliamentary democracy

in  this  part of the world, seeing that we have only had such a short  time  to

develop  it,  when other countries have taken centuries. It is my fervent  hope.

Mr Speaker, Sir, that what we have gained must not be too easily given up. What

we  have gained so gloriously in the past must not be allowed to be thrown  away

in  order that certain people can sustain their political longevity. Let us  not

anger the people. Let us not make the people lose faith in the machinery of  one

man one vote. Let us try to nurture this very sensible form



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



of political ideology to its full growth.

In all sincerity, Mr Speaker, Sir, I urge

the  Government to have second thoughts on clause 29 of the Bill and to consider

accepting the amendment moved by our leader.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the question of merger between

Singapore  and  the  Federation of Malaya, it is most  democratic  to  pose  the

question  in  a referendum to the people for their decision. But the  Opposition

are  accusing us of being like Hitler. What are they saying? They say  that  the

P.A.P. is no good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, we know that Members of the Barisan Sosialis were on very

good terms with the P.A.P. not very long ago. But today they say that the P.A.P.

is  no good. How can they say that? Are they not slapping their own faces?  They

are  deceiving the people and cheating the people when they say that we are  not

sincere and loyal. It is they who are not loyal to the Party. How then can  they

he  loyal to the people? To be loyal they must not waver. But now they have gone

over  to the side of the Communists. Maybe in the very near future they may come

back.  Now  a  really devoted wife is not married to two husbands. So  therefore

these  people, to be loyal, must be loyal to the Party forever. They must  serve

the Party loyally, just like a woman who cannot he married to two husbands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Barisan Sosialis is married to the Communists. In the very near

future, to whom will they be married? All of them are suspicious of one another.

I think they will perish in the near future. Yet they say that we the

P.A.P. are going to perish. Is this

not nonsense? Is this not deceiving the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the people of Singapore and the Federation want merger. Yet the Barisan

Sosialis want to oppose this merger. What is their reason for opposing  this?  A

few years ago, when the British divided Singapore and the Federation, the people

in both territories were opposed to the divide-and-rule tactics of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



the  British  at  that  time. Now the people want to be united  again.  But  the

Barisan Sosialis want to oppose this merger. What is their reason for this?  We

know that this is because they want to compete with us for political power  and

leadership.  We  are now going to put the question of merger to  a  referendum.

The provisions concerning the blank votes are meant to encourage the people  to

go  and  vote.  If they want merger, they must cast their vote for  merger.  If

they  do  not  want merger, then they cast their vote for non-merger.  How  can

they  say that this is not democratic? If merger materializes, then the  people

will  benefit  from it. If merger fails, then it is the people  who  will  fail -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is getting

late,  and the Member starts shouting very close to me. He must try to  modulate

his voice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I abide by your ruling. If merger fails, then it is the people

who will fail. It has nothing to do with the P.A.P., because this is the view of

the  people. Whether it is right or not will be judged by the people. The people

can  give their final decision. The Barisan Sosialis is disregarding the intelligence of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass rallies organised by the Member for Queenstown were attended by only

a  few people, just like those rallies held by the Lim Yew Hock Government. They

did  not  receive  the support of the people. We can say that the  mass  rallies

organised by the Member for Queenstown were a flop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to rebut the Member for Anson who, speaking a few

days  ago, accused us of not being loyal and not sincere. It is a matter for  re

gret  that he is not here. But I still want to say that he criticises the P.A.P.

Of  course, it is right and proper for him to criticise us. The Member for Anson

said that he advocated that Singapore should be given to the United Nations as a

trust territory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Point of order.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point of order

being?



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> The Member

for  Tiong Bahru says something about the question of a trust territory  by  the

United Nations. This has nothing to do with clause 29.



<br><br>11.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the point of

order  is well taken. Unless the Member can indicate how the United Nations  has

crept  into clause 29, if he can satisfy me, he can carry on. If he cannot satis

fy me, then perhaps it is irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I must say that to you, because the other day he accused us of

being insincere and not loyal. But when our country is given to other people  to

govern, then all our properties will be stolen by others. Therefore, he  is  not

fit to be our representative here. Will you allow me to continue with my speech,

Mr Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I certainly will

permit the Member to continue with his speech if he continues to be relevant.  I

think  he  has made his point about the United Nations. Let us turn  to  another

point now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I would like you to allow me to continue because  the  Member

for Anson has accused us of so many things which are not true. Therefore, I have

to  rebut or to reply to these accusations. At one time in the Tanjong Pagar by-election,  he  challenged our Prime Minister to resign from Tanjong  Pagan,  but

later  on he backed out. He deceived the people. Yet he said that we the  P.A.P.

deceived the people. Therefore, it is the Member for Anson who is insincere  and

not loyal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in these few days, we have had a very heated debate

on the question which is of interest to the whole of the people of Singapore. We

can  see that not only our benches, but even all the gallery seats are full. Not

only this -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have indicated in the past that in so far as the gallery

is concerned, Members should make no direct reference to the gallery. The Member

is speaking to the House through the Speaker. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng:</b> (In Mandarin):

According  to  the  report, in these few days, all the people of  Singapore  are

focusing  their  attention on the Assembly where the Referendum  Bill  is  being

discussed, and not only within this House, as to how the decision will  be  made

on  the  question  which  affects  the  politics  of  the  whole  of  Singapore.

Singapore's record of democracy will also be affected. Mr Speaker, Sir, in this

Bill  there  are many clauses which are against the principles of democracy.  My

Party Chairman and comrades and the majority of the Opposition Members have made

very  clear  remarks that there is no precedent like the provision made  by  the

P.A.P. Government -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must ask the

Member  to do what I have just asked the Member for Tiong Bahru to do, that  is,

to modulate his voice and speak a little softer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

On  this  question,  my  Party and the majority of the Opposition  Members  have

already said that the Referendum Bill proposed by the P.A.P. Government  has  no

precedent  throughout  the world. This does not mean that  there  are  many  pro

visions  in this Bill which are against the interests of the people.  There  are

many pseudo democratic expressions here.

On  the  question of the referendum under discussion, the P.A.P. want to have  a

false merger. They want to cause the realisation of a pseudo merger. We on  this

side,  the  majority of our Opposition Members, i.e. the Barisan  Sosialis,  the

Workers'  Party, the United People's Party, when the Government brought  up  the

White  Paper Command Paper 33, we protested very vehemently. At that time,  they

got  the  support of the S.P.A. They got their victory in the first  round.  But

what about the people of Singapore? Can they be deceived repeatedly







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>

under  such circumstances? All the people in Singapore consider the P.A.P. type of merger as a sell-out. Now -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I take it that the Memebr is referring to the White Paper merger

proposals when he refers to the P.A.P. sell-out merger. I have already indicated that to

refer to the White Paper as a sell-out merger is completely out of order, because it is a

reflection on a vote of the House. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as a sell-out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I  want  to strengthen my point on this present Bill on referendum. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  people of the whole world today have the right to have democracy.  At

this  time  the  P.A.P. have arranged for a merger which  will  be  against  the

interests  of  the people. They try to put this referendum to test the  people's

opinion. They use this method "Do you want it? We will let you vote on it and we

call  it  a referendum." And they claim that by doing so it is already a gesture

of  democracy. But in the Referendum Bill, this type of democracy is not a  true

one. In clause 5, we have proposed that we should only allow one question to  be

posed  in  the  referendum instead of two, i.e. whether the people  support  the

White  Paper  proposals as published in Command Paper 33. The P.A.P.  Government

have  already taken Radio Singapore as their propaganda machinery and they  have

already  said  that  this type of P.A.P. White Paper merger proposals  gives  us

autonomy in labour and education. They feel that this is already something to be

very proud

of. They have deprived many citizens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



of  their citizenship right. They mention as an example the Penang/Malacca  type

of merger by which Singapore citizens will lose their citizenship. Now the

P.A.P. Government's attitude can be

judged  by  us, especially in the light of what we have published. We  have  pub

lished the pamphlet called "The Tasks of our present struggle". In page  9,  we

have  described the platform of our policy, which says that the citizens should

automatically  become citizens of the Federation. There should be proportionate

representation  in  the Central Parliament and Singapore.  There  should  be  a

general  election  to let the people decide openly whether there  should  be  a

merger with the Federation of Malaya. In other words, before deciding the  question,  that  is,  on the date of merger, all Singapore citizens  should  become

citizens  of  the  Federation and at the same time there should  be  a  general

election to decide the question -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member

is now being irrelevant. It is 12 o'clock and I propose to adjourn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to report that the Committee has
