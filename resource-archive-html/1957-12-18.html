<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Supply [3rd Allotted Day]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question (17th December,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1957) proposed to Head 25 in the First Schedule of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Bill,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by $120,000 in respect of subhead 33 therein."-(Mr

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. Jumabhoy).



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>FIRST SCHEDULE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 25 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in view of the limited time allotted, I propose

to go direct to the point to give the others a chance

to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the third time I have to announce to

the  people  of  Singapore the Government's  wasteful

policy  in  coming here and asking for a grant  of  a

large  sum  of  the ratepayers' money for  a  useless

purpose like family planning. I say "useless" because

to  a  Question I put to this House last month asking

for  birth statistics for two periods, I got a  reply

which  showed  that births had increased  instead  of

decreased.  In  other  words, family  planning  is  a

failure. Indeed, Sir, the Family Planning Association

admits  it  in page 5 of their Seventh Annual  Report

which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one is more conscious than we of the fact that

family planning cannot hope to provide a solution  to

the  problems which face Singapore with a  population

which  is  likely to treble itself in  less  than  30

years."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, knowing this, I think the Association should

have  the  conscience to give up and make a  retreat.

Instead  of  that, they come to ask for money  to  be

wasted. I now await to see what the attitude  of  the

Government  is. As for myself, I strongly  object  to

the grant.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Chief Minister did

announce that there is going to be a free vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Yes, that is right.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3154</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> They still rule.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  it  will be extremely unfair not to make  this

grant to the Family Planning Association. It will not

only disorganise that Association and may render  the

members  thereof liable for damages for  one  month's

pay  in lieu of notice, etc., but it will cause great

hardship  to those women who have been accustomed  in

the  last few years to come to "the Association"  for

advice and for other forms of assistance. We must  at

least make this grant this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this present Session of the Assembly, we have

had  the  Estimates Committee sitting  and,  if  some

Members  are not satisfied with the way in which  the

Association has spent the money, the matter could  be

referred  to  the Estimates Committee  for  the  next

Session  to investigate into how the money was  spent

and  a  report will be made. If, as a result  of  the

investigation  by  the Estimates Committee,  we  find

that   the  money  had  been  wasted,  then  we   can

reconsider the matter next year but it would be  very

unfair  indeed  to refuse this grant  without  notice

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore appeal to Members to take these two

points into consideration when deciding whether  this

grant should or should not be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

was  rather  a  funny argument by the hon, nominated

Member Mr R. C. H. Lim. He said that it would  cause

hardship  to families. Have we not got our hospitals?

Have we not got our clinics? Can these people not  be

attended  to  there? How much is one month's  pay  in

lieu  of  notice? Is that not better rather  than  to

keep on paying $120,000 a year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, yesterday, I said that I moved this

amendment  with an open mind and pointed out  that  I

did so on certain principles. I mean no disrespect to

the   honorary   workers  of  the   Family   Planning

Association  who  are giving of their  time  and  not

money  because they only contributed $1,000, as  laid

down in their own pamphlet.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the question was raised yesterday about

the  Jams. It is a very important religion  which  is

one  of  the  recognised religions of  India  in  the

world.  Why  should  we  not  show  respect  to   its

followers  if they raise certain objections?  One  of

their beliefs is that you should not kill even an ant

if  you  can  help  it. Now, Sir,  there  is  also  a

religious body here which is an inter-religious  body

consisting of various religious heads. Have they been

consulted  as  to  whether  they  approve  of  it  on

religious  grounds?  Has the Muslim  Chief  Kathi  of

Singapore been consulted?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> I have.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Now, Islam is definitely against

unnatural  practices but it also stresses that  if  a

woman  does not want to have children for reasons  of

health,  she can take all the precautionary  measures

possible. There is no question about that.  The  main

reason  of  the objectors is that their money  should

not  be  spent  or given away. Let me also  say,  Mr

Speaker,  that possibly due to the prayers  of  these

religious  objectors, the Labour Front has lost  four

of  its Members including the ex-Chief Minister  (Mr

D. S. Marshall). Possibly they may lose all; the time

is not far off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I said that there is strong objection to

family planning on religious grounds but my objection

is  this, that you are giving away $120,000 to a body

for a purpose which may be good but how much are they

raising  themselves? It is only $1,100. Now, has  the

Government   any   control   whatsoever   over    the

administration?  We  have received  another  pamphlet

from the objectors giving us the number of hours they

work  in the Association and so on, and informing  us

that  $83,000  was  spent on salaries  and  provident

fund.  Now. Sir, if the Government is giving so  much

money,  why not run this department on their  own  in

the  interests of the public? We are not against that

because  with  the increase in population,  Singapore

may not be large enough to accommodate everybody.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3156</b></font><br><br>



No  taxpayer then can object to that but  what

they are objecting to is giving away $120,000 to this

particular  body which can only raise $1,000  itself.

But it seems that there is to be a free vote. I would

still  like  to  hear  arguments  in  favour  of  why

Government  should  give $120,000  to  a  body  which

raises  only $1,000 through subscriptions  and  maybe

through  other  sources. That is  a  different  thing

altogether.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this is the third year in  which  this

subject  has been raised in the Assembly.  Everything

that  could  be  said  one way or  another  has  been

previously  expressed  most forcefully  and  must  be

clear in the minds of those present, because the set-up  of this House is the same as has been during  the

last  two years with the exception of the new  Member

for  Cairnhill (Mr Soh Ghee Soon) - I am sure that  he

has  taken an interest in this matter and read up our

local  Hansards on what has been said on this subject

in  the  past. I agree with Mr R. C. H. Lim that  no

further  time should be wasted on detailed arguments.

My  stand however in this is quite clear. I can  only

repeat what I have said in the past and that my stand

on  this  subject  in supporting  the  mover  of  the

amendment is the same as it was and ever will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree with the Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R.

Jumabhoy) that there should not be discrimination  on

the question of religions, when he was discussing the

ecclesiastical votes, I would like to point out  that

this  is  not  a  question of religion  and  religion

should  not be an issue. The two issues as I  see  it

before the House are (1) the complete deletion  of  a

vote  for $120,000 to the Family Planning Association

and (2) whether the increase of $20,000 is justified.

I  am in full accord with all those who say that  the

taxpayers' money should not be used in something that

is  against  the  very tenets of  their  religion  or

against  their conscience and Government  should  not

bulldoze   through  its  policy  by  compelling   the

taxpayers to contribute to something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3157</b></font><br><br>



which  they  think is really wrong.  On  that  point,

everything that could be said has been said.



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can furthermore see no justification whatsoever

for  this increase of $20,000. The increase of grants

to  this Association has gone up from the paltry  sum

of  $5,000  to  $10,000, $30,000,  $45,000,  $60.000,

$80,000, $85,000, $100,000 and now it is going up  to

$120,000.  I would like to know where this  will  all

end  when  there are other most deserving  charitable

causes  like  the  Home  for the  Blind,  the  Little

Sisters  of  the  Poor, the Ramakrishna  Mission  and

several  other missions whose needs are  far  greater

than  those of the Family Planning Association  which

could,  with voluntary effort, raise their own funds,

as  pointed out by the Member for Telok Ayer. I think

that it is a wasteful act to allot such a vast sum to

an Association the majority of whose sister bodies in

other parts of the world are self-supporting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion which was moved by the Member

for Telok Ayer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  I have to continue with my reply to the speech

of   the   Minister  for  Communications  and   Works

yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we should not repeat and repeat the

same  old  story again on this controversial  subject

but  I would like to raise three points for the House

to  consider.  Firstly,  on this  issue  are  we  not

defeatists?  We have no hope to provide for  what  we

have to provide. The Minister for Communications  and

Works  has warned us that there is a rapid growth  of

population  in  the  whole world and  that  therefore

Singapore  should be on the safe side to be  able  to

provide the means of livelihood for the people.  Sir,

I  stated  yesterday that we are in the  age  of  the

hydrogen bomb and that we are about to conquer space.

I  mentioned  also  that the Prime  Minister  of  the

United  Kingdom has hopes of drawing power  from  the

sea instead of from coal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3158</b></font><br><br>



dug by miners. In the old days travel from the United

Kingdom  to  Singapore took months but now  it  takes

just  over two days by Comet. Therefore, in the  same

way, we should strive through hard work to produce an

ideal  system of society. Sir, I strongly  object  to

the  unnatural practice of birth control and one must

have  strong faith in an ideal social system  with  a

fair  distribution  of wealth. I am  sure  that  many

office-bearers  of  the Family  Planning  Association

have  a so-called small family. To them, two or three

children  are  really sufficient and  more  would  be

troublesome but I am sure that their houses must have

many   rooms.   Sir,   I  think  the   Minister   for

Communications and Works knows where I stay. I have a

room which I occupy and based on the standard of  the

houses of those office-bearers it would qualify as  a

servant's  room. But I have five children  and  I  am

very  proud  of  them.  Sir,  if  one  has  hopes  of

conquering space in the future and of many scientific

improvements, we should not therefore worry about the

rapid increase in population. We must not think  that

if  we limit the growth of population, there will  be

less delinquents and illiteracy in society. We should

build  more  schools and more hospitals  rather  than

say,  "We should limit the number of patients to  the

hospitals  or limit the number of new pupils  to  the

schools."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, the argument is that Singapore is a

small  island  of  224  square  miles  and  that  the

population in 1965 will be about 2 million. Sir,  why

can  we  not  look  forward  to  a  merger  with  the

Federation of Malaya? The all-Party agreement in this

House  is  that we must merge with the Federation  of

Malaya.  We  may  be  citizens of the  Federation  of

Malaya   in  the  future  and  therefore  the   over-population problem of Singapore could be solved.  One

could  admit  that  a merger with the  Federation  of

Malaya is a long way off but, Sir, I say, "No, it  is

not so."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I think the Government has shown some

favouritism  in  its  generous grant  to  the  Family

Planning Association. The Member for Telok Ayer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3159</b></font><br><br>



stated  that  there is a tendency to  instability  in

this   country  which  is  mainly  due  to  the  high

population of youth but when the Chinese Young  Men's

Association asked for a grant from the Government  to

help  to  solve  their  financial  difficulties   the

Minister  for Finance said that he will consider  the

matter - consider for many, many months! I  cannot  see

which  is  more  important, the Chinese  Young  Men's

Association   or  the  Family  Planning  Association.

Everybody   agrees   that  family   planning   is   a

controversial problem. I am sure that everybody would

like  to support the Chinese Young Men's Association,

and  yet  the  result  for the  Chinese  Young  Men's

Association has been adverse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the mover of the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

until  we  can live in space and drink sea water,  we

must  come down to earth and face facts as they  are.

The  only objection so far as I can see to this  vote

for family planning is the question of $83,000 having

been  spent on salaries and provident fund.  When  we

look  at  it  from this point of view - that  there  is

hardly  any other expense except the hiring of people

to  do the work of helping and giving advice to women

then it must necessarily be so that three-quarters of

the  funds  of  this Association has  been  spent  on

salaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another remark was, "Why was such a little amount

raised  by  private subscriptions?" That  is  because

most  people feel that this work should  be  done  by

Government.  It is really a Government responsibility

and  this has been adopted by many countries.  I  can

say that it is now being supported by Governments  in

India,  China, Japan and Pakistan but I say  that  if

this  branch of work were to be carried  out  by  the

Government and its hospitals I am afraid that it will

achieve  less  than  half of  what  can  be  done  by

voluntary  people  who without selfish  reasons  come

forward  to  work hard because they feel that  it  is

essential for the welfare of our state.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3160</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Federation last week voiced great concern

over  the difficulties of finding employment  for  an

extra  million workers in the next ten  years.  Their

population  is  now  nearly eight million.  With  our

population of about 1½ million, we are going  to  get

nearly 400,000 people seeking employment in ten years

time  and we in Singapore are suffering from lack  of

space with no new lands to open up. If the Federation

with  its  huge  hinterland could  worry  about  this

increase  in  the workers and finding employment  for

them  what must we in Singapore think? Shall  we  get

into  the  position of what Japan and  China  are  in

today  where  abortion is legalised?  In  Japan,  any

medical practitioner can perform an abortion for  two

reasons:  one,  if it is for health  reasons  of  the

mother;  and  two, when it is economically  essential

for the family to have the abortion performed. Is  it

not better Sir, for us to plan to avoid the abhorrent

position that may and will arise if we do not support

the  Family  Planning Association and the  very  good

work that it is doing today?



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I usually have the greatest respect for

the  Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng)  for  his

reasoning  and his way of tackling a problem  but  my

respect  for  him  this  morning  has  been  somewhat

shattered  because the arguments he  put  forward  in

support  of the motion before the House are  actually

arguments in favour of the grant to be given  to  the

Family  Planning Association. He speaks of the  youth

problem  and the delinquents that we are facing  now.

If  we  do  not have family planning on  a  voluntary

basis to restrict the birth of young children how can

we  ever  provide places for the children in schools?

As  it  is,  I have to revise my estimates every  six

months.  I have to see that more buildings are  being

constructed to provide places for the children  going

to  secondary schools and if we allow things to go on

as  they  are,  we  will never be able  to  introduce

compulsory education. No government, as far as I  can

see, will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3161</b></font><br><br>



be  able to do that if the increase in population  is

allowed to go on without a check. I am glad that  the

Member  for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck)  mentioned

about  Japan  where  abortion is  legalised  for  two

reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the third time, I think I have to contradict the

Member  for  Bukit Panjang (Mr Goh Tong  Liang)  who

describes   the   Family  Planning   Association   as

"useless". I say for the third time that it is useful

and  I  take  off  my hat to many  of  the  voluntary

workers  of  the Association who are doing  a  useful

job. Instead of condemning them, I think they deserve

all the praise from us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I am a new

Member of this Assembly and I must confess that until

lately  I  did  not know how much good the  Singapore

Family  Planning Association had been doing  for  the

public of Singapore. They must have been in existence

for  at  least  eight years now. I  am  glad  that  I

received a report lately giving me a clearer  picture

of what the Singapore Family Planning Association had

done. When I received the Estimates, my first impulse

was  to  vote against family planning. I feel that  a

project  like this should be supported by the  public

and not by Government. On going through the report, I

found  that the Association had done very  goo4  work

and, if given a chance, I think they would do better.

It  is nonsense to say that it is a pleasure to  have

many  children and that the Chinese are proud to have

many  children. We realise the hardship of the people

who have too many children and not being able to give

them  a good education. It is a sin and by not giving

such  children  a good education, we are  encouraging

them,  to join bad elements. We are fighting  against

such things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true to say that Singapore is not over-crowded. Only lately, I heard-if not in this Chamber

it  was  somewhere else-that Singapore is one of  the

most  populated areas in the whole world and that  it

will  be  very much so in another 10 or 15 years.  At

the  moment we cannot cope with the housing  problem.

Look  at  the Singapore Improvement Trust.  Thousands

and thousands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3162</b></font><br><br>



are  still on its waiting list and the situation  has

not  improved although many buildings have  been  put

up;  about  the same number of applicants for  houses

are  still  on  its waiting list. It  shows  that  we

cannot even house them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel that family planning must be

strongly  supported by Government and  I  even  think

that  $120,000 is not sufficiently enough to  do  the

good work that they are doing for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Member for Bukit Panjang (Mr Goh Tong Liang) has

clearly indicated to us this morning that this is the

third time we are debating this subject It appears to

me  that  this subject has become very stale  and  it

will carry on and on year by year if we are going  to

continue debating this subject every time it comes up

during the Committee of Supply. Last year, the Member

for  Bukit  Panjang was defeated for the second  time

and  I  told  him that he was trying to flog  a  dead

horse. Now this morning I am not going to repeat that

same  phrase  again. The mover of the  amendment  may

expect to succeed after some canvassing or so outside

this Chamber. If he succeeds with his amendment, good

luck to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I notice, Sir, is the question of the

increase  in the grant. I think we should concentrate

more on the increase in the grant rather that on  the

actual  grant  itself. In the year before  last,  the

Association was granted $80,000. Last year,  it  came

up  to  $100,000. It is now $120,000. As  one  Member

pointed out just now, where is this all going to end?

Are we going to increase again the grant next year to

$140,000, and so on? As I said, then year after  year

we will have to debate this same subject. Now if this

grant is going to increase year by year, would it  be

fair  to the other charitable organisations? As I  go

through  the list, I find that some of the grants  to

these   organisations  have  decreased  rather   than

increased - apart from those which remain with the same

grant - such as the grant to Voluntary Institutions for

Children  which  has  come  down  to  $295,000   from

$350,000, the maintenance of St. Andrew's Orthopaedic

Hospital from $5,000 to $3,000, and many other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3163</b></font><br><br>



items  (I  have not gone through the list carefully).

So,  Sir, I think that now is the time we should stop

the  increase in the grant rather than  to  stop  the

whole grant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is going to grant $120,000 and

increase it every year, what about the application of

the  Chinese  Young  Men's Christian  Association?  I

believe  that  the Hon. the Financial Secretary  said

that it is still receiving consideration. How long is

the  application  going to receive consideration?  As

far  as  I know, the application was submitted  early

this  year. I brought up the issue last year and  the

Hon. the Financial Secretary promised to look into it

last  year during the Committee of Supply.  One  year

has  elapsed and nothing appears in the Estimates for

the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association? Why is

that, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be very unfair to cut out the whole

grant altogether. As the hon, nominated Member Mr R.

C.  H.  Lim  pointed out, how is the Family  Planning

Association  going  to function?  Also  we  would  be

subject to legal expenses in paying extra salaries to

the  staff  of the Association on the termination  of

their   services.  Are  we  prepared  for   that?   I

understand  that  the Member for Cairnhill  (Mr  Soh

Ghee  Soon) said that this Association has been going

on  for  eight years and that we have been  giving  a

grant to it for quite a number of years. The thing to

do  now, I think, is to stop the increase. If Members

are   not  satisfied  with  the  functions   of   the

Association,  let us get a Committee going  then  and

investigate   into  the  actual  functions   of   the

Association. If the Association is doing pretty  well

and doing good work as the Member for Cairnhill said,

then  let  the Committee recommend to the  Government

that  there should be an increase in the grant rather

than  stop  the  whole grant. If the Committee  feels

that  the Association is doing work which is  against

the  interests of the public, then it can either stop

the grant or stop the increase in the grant, Sir,It

will be unfair now to cut off the grant altogether to

an Association that has been going on for years. I do

not  think  that  it  is right,  Sir.  Last  year,  I

abstained  from the issue, because I was neither  for

or against. I am quite happy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3164</b></font><br><br>



so  long  as the Association carries on and maintains

itself and I think, to be fair to the Association  as

well  as  to  the Member who moved the amendment,  we

should cut off this increase in the grant. So  may  I

have your guidance if I can move an amendment to  the

amendment, Sir? With your permission, Sir,  I  intend

to move it to debate-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member no doubt knows

Standing Order 69 (7) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any Member may move an amendment to the schedule to

reduce by $   the sum to be allotted for any head  of

expenditure  in  respect  of  any  sub-head  or  item

therein, but at least two clear days' notice of  such

amendment shall be given."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not trying

to  move  an  original  amendment  as  the  amendment

appears on the Order Paper. My intention is to  amend

the  amendment and I wonder if that is in  order.  My

intention  is  to  leave out "$120,000",  and  insert

"20,000"   which  would  retain  the  old  grant   of

$100,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> My reading of financial procedure as a

whole  is such that I think I must disagree. I cannot

allow  an  amendment to an amendment of  that  nature

because,  if  the hon. Member will look at  paragraph

(8), it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When several such amendments are proposed to the

same  sub-head  or  item, the amendment  seeking  the

smallest  reduction shall be first  proposed  and  an

amendment to omit the sub-head or item shall only  be

proposed  after all motions for reduction  have  been

disposed of."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows therefore that the financial procedure

presupposes that there should be specific  amendments

to  each  sub-head or each item. Therefore, I  cannot

allow an amendment to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> On a point of further clarification, Sir.

If   no  amendment  can  be  moved  to  the  original

amendment, I would like to enquire whether the  mover

of the original amendment could amend his amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The principle is still the same.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since I am

ruled  out  of  order  to move my  amendment  to  the

amendment,  may  I then, Sir, ask the  Government  to

look into this suggestion of mine that a Committee be

formed  to  investigate or to look into the functions

of  the Association and then recommend either to this

Assembly  to the Government next year the grant  that

should be made?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, as the Deputy Speaker stated

just  now, the Estimates Committee could go into that

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  do  not propose to adduce any  arguments  in

support  of my view which is unchanged because  I  do

not  want to bore the House with reiteration but  one

thing  that has stiffened my resistance is the amount

of  lobbying  I  have had from religious  bodies  who

emphasise  that they are putting forward their  point

of  view from a secular and an economic basis and not

from a religious basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is indeed either in favour of family planning

or  against it. I do not believe that any  amount  of

debate  would change anybody's views on the  subject.

One  either holds the scientific point of view or the

superstitious.  For  myself, I  am  inclined  to  the

former.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point, Sir, that occurs to me in connection with

the  remarks made by the Member for Changi  (Mr  Lim

Cher Kheng): it may not have occurred to him that  in

looking  for  greater  Lebensraum  in  interplanetary

space, he might find perhaps that the population,  if

any,  of  Mars and Venus - especially Venus -  might  be

more advanced in birth control than we are.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> This item

has  not  been placed in the estimates  in  order  to

provoke  a debate but because Government thinks  that

the  grant  should  be made and it would  perhaps  be

appropriate for me at this stage to give the  reasons

why.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, it is generally accepted, as a matter

of   policy,   in  most  civilized  countries,   that

instruction and advice in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3166</b></font><br><br>



matters  connected  with family  planning  should  be

available  to  all those who wish to obtain  it.  As

will be seen from the voluminous correspondence which

has been exchanged between the various

organisations  interested in  this  matter,  in  most

countries, the state either undertakes the  task,  or

gives  financial assistance to voluntary  bodies,  or

does  both, to promote the cause of family  planning.

There is no doubt in the mind of the government  that

family  planning  is,  under  modern  conditions,  an

essential  service and one which does  a  very  great

deal   to  dispel  ignorance,  to  alleviate  misery,

poverty and hardship, and to promote a full and happy

family  life. Al, though this advice can be  obtained

on  request from Government hospitals and clinics, it

is  considered  preferable, in the  conditions  which

exist  in  Singapore at the present  time,  that  the

ground-work  in  what  must be an  expanding  service

should  be done by a voluntary organisation like  the

Family Planning Association which can, I think,  make

a  more personal contact with the population than can

an impersonal Government department.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the letters in the barrage of

correspondence  which has been laid down,  criticisms

were  made on the inefficiency of the Family Planning

Association.  I  have been into the  affairs  of  the

Association with considerable care knowing  that  the

matter  would  come up once more for  debate  in  the

Assembly  and I can say that I am satisfied that  the

Association is a very efficient organisation  run  on

professional lines. Its overhead expenses are low.  I

think  perhaps  this  is because  so  much  voluntary

assistance is given by a dedicated band of women. The

salaries  of  its paid staff are in no way  excessive

when  compared  with  the  emoluments  of  comparable

Government officers. In this connection, I should say

that  the  proportion which emoluments bear to  total

expenditure  is in no way out of the ordinary  for  a

body  which does nothing but render services  to  the

public.   I   am  satisfied  that  the  grant   which

Government  makes  to  the Association  is  well  and

properly  spent.  It  is a fact that  the  Government

grant does make up a large proportion of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3167</b></font><br><br>



income of the Association and that these grants  have

increased  considerably  over  the  years   but   the

increase in the amount of the grant has been met by a

corresponding  increase  in  the  activities  of  the

Association  as  an  examination  of  the  statistics

provided  in  the  Annual Report will  show.  At  the

present time, it will be seen from the Annual Report,

that the Association conducts four daily clinics, one

weekly   clinic,   eight  bi-weekly   clinics,   nine

fortnightly  clinics  and three monthly  clinics  and

that  the  attendance at these clinics  now  averages

close  on 15,000 persons a year. I am satisfied  that

any  addition to the grant will result in  a  further

expansion  of  the very desirable activities  of  the

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Sir, that this question of whether a grant

should  or  should  not be given is  a  matter  which

should  be  decided  on what I might  call  practical

humanitarian    grounds,    and    that     religious

considerations  should not be taken into  account.  I

feel  that  if hon. Members will weigh the  pros  and

cons of the matter, they will come to the conclusion,

as  the  Government has done, that it is the duty  of

the  state either directly or by financing an  agency

or  by both means to make available to all those  who

wish  to obtain it in whatever walk of life they  may

be,  information about the planning of  families  and

kindred matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like hon. Members to ponder the

consequences  which would befall if this  grant  were

not to be made in the coming year. It would mean that

the activities of the Association would have to cease

and  it  would cause untold misery to all  those  who

have voluntarily gone to it for assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion that the affairs and

activities of the Association should be examined by a

Committee,  I would repeat what the nominated  Member

Mr  R.  C. H. Lim said, namely that this is a matter

which  can  properly be gone into  by  the  Estimates

Committee of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt

that  the Association is doing very good work but  my

point is that when Government is paying 85 or 90  per

cent of the money, it is the Government's duty to run

this Association



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3168</b></font><br><br>



or  an agency. What Government control is there  over

such  an  agency? That answer has not been  given  at

all.  The Hon. the Financial Secretary said only that

he  was  satisfied. There has been some objection  to

the grant as it is public money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on this subject, I promised

yesterday  to get the dates of the letters  addressed

to  the  Government  from  the  Chinese  Young  Men's

Christian  Association.  A letter  was  addressed  in

February 1957 and a reminder was sent in May 1957. It

was  to  the fact that they were owing over  $350,000

and paying interest on it. It is December now and yet

the  Government has not come to any decision so  far.

It is most disgusting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ramakrishna Mission wrote also in February

but  the  Hon. the Chief Minister explained yesterday

that  they were asked for some particulars  and  that

the  onus  lay  with  the  Mission  to  furnish  such

particulars to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Trustees of the Sultan Mosque applied for a

grant  on 20th May, 1957 for repairs. I was  told  by

the  Hon. the Financial Secretary that  he  did  not

receive  that letter. The letter was dated 20th  May,

1957,  addressed to him. Now, Sir, the Government  is

paying  Ecclesiastical Grants and yet when  the  main

mosque for all Muslims, irrespective of any sect,  is

asking for repairs, the application has not yet  been

considered  or the letter has not been  received.  We

are   spending  a  lot  of  money  on  St.   Andrew's

Cathedral. I have got no objection to that. Spend  if

you want to but give equal treatment to everybody.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I had intended to speak on this matter

with   your  permission,  Sir,  when  there  was   an

opportunity for debate on the whole head and  perhaps

I might be allowed to keep my remarks until then?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It might be convenient to carry on,

Mr Financial Secretary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3169</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> It was my intention to inform the Member

for  Telok  Ayer that I wished to correct a statement

which I made yesterday, Sir, and to ask him to accept

my  apologies  but  as I was late in  coming  to  the

Assembly,  I  had not the opportunity of speaking  to

him beforehand. I think I said yesterday that, to the

best  of  my knowledge, no application for  financial

assistance had been received from the authorities  of

the  Sultan Mosque, the Ramakrishna Mission  and  the

Young   Men's  Muslim  League.  The  Hon. the  Chief

Minister said that he had received an application  in

the  Social  Welfare Department from the  Ramakrishna

Mission.  I have made enquiries, and I find  that  in

June  last  year, we did receive an application  from

the Sultan Mosque for money for repairs to the mosque

and  I  must confess that I myself saw the letter  in

October.  Due to preoccupation with other matters,  I

forgot  all  about  it. The Ramakrishna  Mission  did

apply for some assistance as far back as 1952 and the

Young Men's Muslim Association applied for assistance

in  1947 but the reply in each case was that  it  was

contrary  to  Government's  general  policy  to  make

financial  contributions  to religious  organisations

and that in the circumstances it was not possible  to

agree  to  the  application. I should like  the  hon.

Member   to   accept  my  apologies  for   being   so

categorical-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> - in my rebuttal to him yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a place like Singapore where so many religions

are practised and where so many different branches of

religions  flourish, it would be extremely  difficult

for  Government  to  admit the  principle  of  giving

assistance  to religious bodies. As I said yesterday,

the  case  of the St. Andrew's Cathedral is rather  a

special case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to organisations like the Chinese Young

Men's Christian Association and other similar bodies,

it  has always been the policy of Government to avoid

as far as possible giving direct financial assistance

to organisations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3170</b></font><br><br>



which  are  connected either directly  or  indirectly

with particular religions. Assistance, of course, has

been given in the matter of sites. In the case of the

Chinese Young Men's Christian Association, we gave  a

most valuable site in the Telok Ayer area and I think

that  the  Y.M.C.A. has also had assistance  in  this

connection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we received an application from the Young

Women's   Christian  Association  and,  as   I   said

yesterday,  there  were  special  considerations   in

connection with that case and we dealt with it  on  a

special basis. I think, Sir, you will agree that  the

education  of  young  women  gives  rise  to  special

problems  in  a  city  like  Singapore  and  in  this

particular   case   the   Young   Women's   Christian

Association  proposed  to  erect  an  institution  in

Outram  Road  which  would  provide  instruction   in

domestic  science,  home craft and kindred  subjects.

Now these are matters which the Education Department,

due  to  preoccupation with other matters,  have  not

been able to develop as much as they would have liked

and  again there are no facilities as far as  we  are

aware  in that particular part of Singapore to  teach

these  subjects to young girls. For that  reason,  it

was  decided  to  give  the Young  Women's  Christian

Association  a dollar for dollar grant,  although  it

was  a denominational organisation, on an undertaking

from them that the institution would be used for  the

dissemination of instruction in domestic science  and

would be open to young girls of all races and creeds.

This  decision of course, Sir, opened  the  door  for

applications from other organisations for  assistance

from  Government. The Chinese Young  Men's  Christian

Association and the Young Men's Christian Association

both  applied  for grants. The Young Men's  Christian

Association  wish  to build hostel accommodation  but

have  not  yet obtained a suitable site and have  not

yet  considered  in  any great detail  the  financial

implications  of  their proposal. The  Chinese  Young

Men's Christian Association has indeed built a hostel

and  club premises in the Telok Ayer region on a site

provided by Government but they have, I think, rather

exceeded their resources and are in debt to the  bank

to the tune, as I understand it, of $320,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3171</b></font><br><br>



The Government  is sympathetic towards both these cases  and

they  are actively under consideration at the present

time and I hope that early in the new year we will be

able  to  come  forward  with  certain  proposals  in

connection  with both associations but I should  warn

the   House.  Sir,  that  there  are  still   certain

financial difficulties which have to be examined with

some  care  before  we  are in  a  position  to  make

recommendations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just wish to

make some remarks on this family planning vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been, as I said yesterday, showered by an

endless number of pamphlets and letters bearing  five

or seven seals and signed by seven different persons.

It  struck me that the Catholics are a very efficient

pressure  group.  They  do  just  what  we  hear  the

Communists do. They never give up. They know that  it

is  a  hopeless fight. They know that it is not going

to get them anywhere but they keep on trying.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yesterday, in the Chamber, I

received  a  letter marked 'Urgent'  in  red,  treble

underlined.  I  slit  open the letter  and  I  saw  a

familiar  signature. I knew what it was going  to  be

about.  Yes,  there it was at the top of  the  letter

"Please Vote Against" with the word 'Against'  treble

underlined.  Sir,  never had I been  more  determined

that it is necessary to tell such people that as much

as  we  admire  their persistency, determination  and

obstinacy,  the  freedom of  one's  views  cannot  be

curtailed  by  such high-pressure tactics.  There  is

only  one  point on which I agree with the  Catholics

and   that   is  that  perhaps  the  Family  Planning

Association is not efficiently run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this dialectical exercise, what the Catholics

want - I do not think they will deny it - is to stop  any

aid that will increase the practice of birth control,

because it is against the teaching of their religion.

But  that  not being accepted by others  who  do  not

accept  the teaching of their religion, they  try  to

find  every conceivable reason why we should  support

them  to achieve this objective. That is part of  the

practice of dialectics. They say, 'Well, never  mind,

let forget



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3172</b></font><br><br>



about  the  religious  point of view';  they  mention

damage  to  health. They say it is  contrary  to  the

principle  of spending money contributed by everybody

to  use it in ways which offend somebody, and so  on,

ad  infinitum. They even go so far as to suggest that

we   should  stop  the  Family  Planning  Association

because it is inefficient.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my spare time I sometimes ruminate through these

letters and I was very much tempted to write back and

say,  'Well, all right, we will have a real efficient

branch  of  the  government or some really  efficient

institution   to   make  family  planning   a   great

success' - which is just what they do not  want.  Well,

Sir,  I  agree with them. However, its criticism  has

not much of an impact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, great respecter as I am of established

standings in society, I find it difficult to  believe

in  an Association with all these honourable names as

patrons,  presidents, eight vice presidents,  and  no

less than eight patrons. What they do nobody knows. I

am  sure  they  do nothing, otherwise none  of  these

persons  would  have  the time to  be  patrons.  Lord

Sheppard  of  Spalding,  Dato  Sir  Cheng-Lock   Tan,

K.B.E., D.M.M.J., J.P., Mrs W. A. C. Goode (I  think

that is out of date, but never mind, they will change

it  next  year  at our expense!). Sir Percy  McNeice,

K.B.E.,  C.M.G., O.B.E.; and  there  are  eight  vice-presidents. None of them is ever likely to bring this

family  planning  idea down to the people.  They  are

people  who live right on top in the clouds. They  do

not know what is happening in Singapore. They are not

ever likely to. And as long as it is run by people in

that  particular  sector of society, family  planning

will be what it is: a very laudable, praiseworthy and

Sunday-school type of project - one does it because  it

is  a  good  thing to spend a little bit of  time  on

helping others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you want to make it really work, then get the

organisation  on  the ground, sell it,  and  sell  it

hard.   The   Indian  Government,  and  the   Chinese

Government  now, are embarking on birth  control  and

the propagation of simple birth control methods on  a

scale unparalleled anywhere else in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3173</b></font><br><br>



world.  They  know  that if they want  to  raise  the

standard  of  living of their people, there  must  be

some  check  on  the tremendous and rapid  growth  of

population. I do not think we will be faced with  the

same  acute difficulties facing either the Indian  or

Chinese  Government, but I do suggest that we  should

make  a  better effort than just through  the  Family

Planning Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we give it this $100,000 but, at the same time,

we  had  better  spend  some time  thinking  how  the

Minister  for  Education's  worries  should  be   not

further  increased,  or  the Minister  for  Housing's

worries  should  not be too greatly enlarged,  by  an

unrestricted growth of population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the sum to be allotted for Head

25  be  reduced by $120,000 in respect of subhead  33

therein.'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 6.

therein.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every year for the last three years we have had

this  sum  recurring - $2,400 for the  Singapore  Civil

Service  Association. I would like to know  from  the

Hon. the Financial Secretary - because this is one  of

those  things "Subject to Treasury sanction, (6244/53)" - whether  he thinks this particular  contribution

should  go  on  year  after year  in  perpetuity,  or

whether  at  some time or the other we should  put  a

stop to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> This, Sir, is a grant which we propose to

make  to  the Singapore Civil Service Association  to

enable  it  to  upkeep  its  recreation  grounds  and

clubhouse. I do not think I need explain to the  hon.

Member  what  the  Civil Service  Association  is.  I

think  he is very well aware of that. Government  has

given this Association considerable assistance in the

past.  Before  the war, it made gifts  of  a  playing

field and clubhouse. I think shortly before the  war,

the    Association   found   itself   in    financial

difficulties  and unable to upkeep  the  grounds  and

clubhouse in the manner in which they should be kept,

and  on representations being made, Government agreed

that  the  rent accruing from the canteen behind  the

Government  Offices in Empress Place should  be  made

available to the Association to enable it to meet its

recurrent expenditure. That practice has continued up

to the present time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1953, however, the Staff Side of the Council of

Negotiation  recommended  to  Government   that   the

collection  of  rents from the staff  canteen  should

cease and that the control of all canteens should  be

placed in the hands of a Coordination Committee,  the

object, I imagine, being that the charges made by the

canteen  operators  to Government servants  would  be

reduced.  The effect of that decision would  be  that

the  Association would be deprived of  the  $2,400  a

year  income which it received from the canteen  rent

for   the   upkeep  of  its  grounds,  and  it   made

representations   late  in  1954   that,   in   these

circumstances, Government might replace the  loss  of

revenue from the canteen by an annual grant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was put to the Finance Committee at that time

and  was approved by the Estimates Committee  of  the

Legislative  Council, and in the Estimates  for  1955

the  sum  of  $2,400  was placed  in  the  Estimates,

subject to Treasury sanction. It has so happened that

effect  has not yet been given to the recommendations

of  the  Council  of  Negotiation, the  Co-ordination

Committee  has  not  yet  called  upon  the   canteen

operator to cease paying rent, and the Civil  Service

Association has not yet had to call on Government  to

make  this  grant. Consequently, this item  has  been

repeated  in  the  Estimates  this  year  subject  to

Treasury sanction. If and when application is made by

the Association for the payment of this grant, I will

of  course  go into the whole matter to  see  whether

there is any reason to upset the previous decision of

the  Legislative  Council that this grant  should  be

made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, we are not against giving

assistance  to  employees of the Government  to  seek

healthy recreational activity. But it does seem to me

a  little bit too much to say, 'First of all, let  me

stop  collecting rents from the canteen in order that

the  prices it charges can go down and I can get  the

same  thing for less; then give the money to me as  a

grant   of   $2,400.'   There   are   thousands    of

clubs - football, cricket and badminton clubs - in  which

people  get  together on a voluntary  basis  to  seek

recreation. There is enough drive and verve  in  them

to  see  that  it is done on an economic basis,  that

income  balances expenditure. It is a  sad  thing  to

notice that every time you come across people in  the

English-educated field, whether in  boys'  clubs,  or

other  recreational  clubs,  they  need  crutches  to

survive.  They have been molly-coddled and expect  to

be  aided somehow or other, so that they do not  have

to  make  so much of an effort. I would like  to  say

that  although  I propose to withdraw this  amendment

(not  because I am fully satisfied but because we  do not  want  to  make  it an issue just  yet),  if  any

association,  be  it of Government  servants  or  any

other voluntary organisation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3176</b></font><br><br>



expects a grant in perpetuity (that is what  it

more  or  less  does amount to), then it  is  greatly

mistaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the purpose of Government. We can give

grants  to set some thing on its course, to launch  a

movement,  but  if  that  movement,  organisation  or

society is not strong enough to sustain itself on its

own, then it does not deserve to survive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I find much in what the hon. Member

says  which strikes a chord in my own heart, and when

the  matter  comes up for consideration I shall  bear

most  carefully  in mind what he has said  about  the

necessity  for  clubs  of  this  nature  being  self-reliant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> On a point of clarification, is the hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar withdrawing his amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I said so, Mr Speaker. I ask

leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 46 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 46 is listed as "Leeson Park. Dublin . . .

subject  to  Treasury sanction". I understand  Leeson

Park  to  be  a kind of students' hostel for  Malayan

students  in Dublin. Now, Sir, I do not want  to  let

this grant go unnoticed and I hope in particular that

those students will either read the Straits Budget or

some  such newspaper and remember that if they expect

always  to be the privileged godsons of the Singapore

and   Federation  Governments,  then  they  are  very

mistaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both in London and in the other big cities

where  university students from Malaya are  studying,

there is a prevailing sense of calculated importance,

partly because visiting Ministers tell them that they

are the future leaders of Malaya. To my mind, nothing

is  further from the truth. From what I see of  them,

in  free and open competition with other groups vying

for leadership in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3177</b></font><br><br>



Malaya,  they would perish, most of them. It is  only

the  very  few in London and other towns in  Britain,

and   in   Australia,  who  are  likely  to   survive

competition for leadership here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these students, particularly in London, get

used  to  the  idea that there must  be  a  vote  for

something  or the other - like a billiard or ping  pong

table,  or there must be nice and comfortable  chairs

for  them and a common lounge room. They never  cease

to  ponder  why it is that hundreds or  thousands  of

their  fellow-countrymen are living in slums  and  do

not  get  such favoured treatment from the  Singapore

Government. I do not think that they are  the  future

leaders of Malaya. They may be the future technicians

of some government in Malaya. What worries me is that

many  of  them  will, in fact, be not very  efficient

technicians at that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that must be brought home to them is

that  they  must  understand that the  Government  is

doing this, just for the time being, in the hope that

it  will  be diminished, in the hope that  all  these

intellects  will  be  of use to  the  future  Malaya.

Unless  the returns are there, then all this  subsidy

should go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way it was better when I was a student there,

because  we  did not have these subsidies  in  Malaya

Hall.  We survived for ourselves but perhaps  it  was

too rigorous. When University closed for the vacation

we  just roughed it out. We either roughed it out  in

the country or went down to London and roughed it out

somewhere.  Nowadays  they expect  to  write  to  the

Warden of Malaya Hall and say, 'Dear Sir, please book

me  a room at 7s. 6d. and let me have running hot and

cold  water, and central heating turned on.'  Anyway,

three-quarters of these students are sons of  wealthy

parents who can afford to give their children  a  bit

extra  to  make sure that all this comfort that  they

require  is  paid for, it is only the one quarter  of

scholars,  either state or otherwise subsidised,  who

get  this favoured treatment. However, no system  has

yet  been  devised whereby a man first  produces  his

scholarship  card and then gets entry at special  cut

rates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let these students remember that we are giving this

subsidy in the hope that it will produce the kind  of

cadre  or  material that will be of some use  to  the

Malayan society to which they belong. If it turns out

that this is all a great loss of money, then we shall

put a stop to it in the very near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am not quite sure what the point is I

have to answer, Sir, but if it is on the question  of

expenditure on these hostels for Malayan students,  I

would  say that it is scrutinised with the same  care

with  which  spending  in Government  departments  is

scrutinised.  I  can  give that assurance.  No  doubt

students  there ask for hot and cold water, they  ask

for -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Central heating.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> - central heating, and of course chairs,

but  I  am pretty certain, Sir, they do not  get  all

they want.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Could the Financial Secretary tell

us  the  details of expenditure of this vote for  the

Leeson Park hostel and the accommodation available? I

myself have not been to Dublin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am afraid I do not have the details

here, but the vote is for the Singapore share of  the

estimated  recurrent expenditure for the  forthcoming

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,616,690 for Head 25 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

referring to Head 25, subhead 30, would the Hon. the

Financial Secretary explain the reason why there is a

decrease  in the grant to voluntary institutions  for

children?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> If I may draw the attention of the hon.

Member  to  the fact, I think the answer  is  in  the

footnote.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, if you compare the relevant

amounts, you will still find that there is a decrease

of $30,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Financial Secretary of course

have it flow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Yes, Sir, I shall look into the matter and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,616,690 for Head 25 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 26 -

to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 27 -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the

amendment standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 27 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have chosen the first item merely to initiate

discussion  of  this  Department,  the  Customs   and

Excise.  I  do  know  that  it  is  being  run   very

efficiently and that the Permanent Secretary  of  the

Ministry  is  also very efficient. The remarks  I  am

making  are suggestions on whether we cannot  improve

the service in the Customs.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been to several countries. As a tourist,

my first impression of a city will be gained from how

I  am  received  on landing, at the airport,  railway

station,  or  docks.  Now the treatment  given  to  a

visitor  is  of paramount importance because  of  our

position. Singapore is centrally situated and we have

to  depend  on  our  wits for our income.  We  should

welcome as many people as possible to visit Singapore

and spend their money here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is also a free port and there is no duty

on imports except some items. Vigilance is necessary,

no  doubt, against smugglers of dutiable articles.  I

must  at  this stage pay a tribute to the work  being

done  by the marine branch in arresting smugglers  or

preventing  the  smuggling  of  tobacco   and   other

contraband. It is doing wonderful work. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3180</b></font><br><br>



I   think  improvement  is  needed  at  out  airport,

Clifford  Pier, the railway station and  the  harbour

board.  This  can be achieved in a very easy  way  by

having  an  experienced  officer  in  charge  of  the

customs  officers stationed there. In recent times  I

think   they  have  improved  a  bit  but   not   yet

sufficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if one goes to London, Hongkong, Japan or

any  other  country,  one  sees  experienced  customs

officers  who can tell from the face of the traveller

what  type  of person he is and what he is  carrying.

Sometimes  they open the luggage at random, sometimes

they pass them. Experienced officers in charge of the

customs  can  do  a  lot  to  earn  the  goodwill  of

visitors. In Singapore, there are certain articles on

which duty is levied and sometimes strict examination

is  necessary.  But  when a person leaves  Singapore,

what  examination of his luggage is needed? I  cannot

understand the need at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hongkong if you are leaving, they "O.K." you. You

can  buy  and take out as much as you want. In  Japan

too, a country where import duties are levied, only a

limited  examination is carried  out  and  with  most

courtesy on entry, but when you are leaving, off  you

go,  buy  and  take  as  much as  you  want,  and  no

examination is necessary. In Singapore we are in  the

position where no tax is levied on goods bought  here

and taken away. However, when you step on to Clifford

Pier  to  board a ship the Customs say,  "Buka  ini".

What  for?  Why?  Go  to  the airport  to  leave  for

Penang - "Oh, misti buka ini."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this rigid procedure necessary? I think it is due

to  lack of supervision of young customs officers. It

does  leave a bad taste. The Customs must know  where

contraband  usually comes from, or  what  is  usually

smuggled out and to which country. Certainly there is

no  smuggling to and from all countries. Instructions

should be issued to be very courteous to tourists and

visitors because we want the goodwill of the tourists

and should avoid unnecessarily annoying them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is by way of suggestion out of the

experience I gained in other countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I much appreciate

the confidence which the hon. Member has expressed in

the  Customs service. I am grateful, Sir, and I  sure

members of the Customs service will appreciate it  as

much as I do. Thank you very much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate everything he has said about the

necessity  for  a  proper  welcome  being  given   to

visitors  to Singapore, that their treatment  by  the

Customs should always be courteous and as expeditious

as  possible. It may conceivably be that  there  have

been  instances  where  people  have  been  held   up

unnecessarily, that perhaps have not been treated  as

courteously as they might expect to be treated, but I

think  these cases must be very few and far  between.

However,  I  shall  take note of  the  hon.  Member's

remarks  and  pass them on to the Customs Department.

Quite  obviously we should be above reproach in these

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed, Sir, a free port. We collect duties

only on a very limited number of commodities, and  so

of  course we might say that, prima fade, there is no

reason  why  there should be any examination  of  the

baggage of passengers leaving Singapore. But I  think

the  hon.  Member forgets that we are a part  of  the

sterling area and, as such, it is necessary to ensure

that  travellers leaving Singapore do not  take  with

them  valuable securities, cash and things like that.

Speaking  from memory, I think that one  is  shown  a

list  by  a Customs officer when one leaves Singapore

and  is  asked.  'Have you any of these commodities?'

and  these  items  do figure fairly largely  on  that

list; but I am subject to correction there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing here, I think, is that the hon.

Member has made a very good point. We are a centre of

communications and we do hope to encourage  tourists.

We  do  hope to encourage people to come to Singapore

and  it  is,  I  think, of vital  concern  that  when

visitors do come here, they should be shown  as  much

courtesy  as possible and that their entry  and  exit

from the Colony be made as easy as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3182</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Lim, Sir, I wish to support

the two points, one made by the hon. Member for Telok

Ayer   and  the  other  by  the  Hon, the  Financial

Secretary, on the efficiency of the Customs  in  this

country  and  on  the  need for Customs  officers  to

extend  courtesy to tourists. But,  Sir,  I  wish  to

point  out one further important point touched on  by

the Financial Secretary in his Budget speech, I think

the  other  day, about the smuggling of tobacco  into

this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder how much information the Government

has  gathered on the big-scale smuggling  of  tobacco

into  this  Colony since we increased the  duty  last

year.  As  far  as  I am concerned, I  have  received

several  pieces of information about a few  personnel

in  the Customs being involved in big-scale smuggling

and  about their integrity being doubted. I take this

opportunity  to point out to Government the  need  to

screen  or observe whether there is a possibility  of

big-scale  smuggling involving Customs personnel,  or

its existence already.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I just want to say that the

Singapore Harbour Board has built a terminal for  the

comfort  of passengers coming in and going  out,  and

that this terminal will be opened shortly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am afraid, Sir, that I did not follow

very clearly the remarks made by the last hon. Member



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Me?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I beg your pardon, I am referring to the

hon.   Member  for  Changi.  He  may  possibly   have

suggested  that  the members of the  Customs  service

were  acting in collusion with smugglers. I must  say

that  if  the hon. Member considers that he  has  any

evidence  to  that effect which he considers  can  be

substantiated,  it  is his duty to  give  it  to  the

Comptroller  of  Customs. It is  the  duty  of  every

citizen  of  Singapore  to give  information  to  the

appropriate authority of any breach of the law, and I

hope  that  he will do so. At the same time,  I  must

express doubt whether there is any substance  in  any

of these contentions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,632,444 for Head 27 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 28 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 28 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 2 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move this amendment just to get information from

the  Hon. the Financial Secretary. The vote  for  this

year appearing in last year's Estimates was $900; I see

that  it is now $2,000, an increase of $1,100. This  is

more  than  a 100 per cent increase. Will the Financial

Secretary  give an explanation why such an increase  is

necessary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> My friend the Attorney-General has pointed

out  that the explanation is given on page 450  of  the

Estimates. The answer is in two words "fruit machines."

The Collector of Stamp Duties now has the duty of going

to  various clubs and associations where fruit machines

are in situ to examine the contents of the machines, to

check the contents of the machines. As a result of  the

duties, which will increase in the coming year, it  has

been  necessary  to  increase the vote  for  travelling

expenses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the

explanation  given  in page 450 of  the  Estimates,  it

would  appear  that Government is trying  to  encourage

more  fruit  machines to come in, and to see  that  all

clubs  and associations are equipped with such machines

for  the  benefit  of the members and,  I  suppose,  to

collect duty on.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, that is not the case. In the past the

Collector  of  Stamp Duty inspected machines  in  clubs

when there has not been a paid official. Recently,  all

fruit  machines have been fitted with padlocks and  the

keys  are  in the possession of the Collector of  Stamp

Duty, and it is now necessary for him to make a trip to

every  club or association where a machine is  situated

in order to examine the contents of the machine.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3184</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, a small query - the Hon. the

Financial Secretary has just said that the keys to  the

locks  of  these fruit machines are with the Department

concerned. I am just wondering how often and when these

locks are opened and how the tax is collected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $140,750 for Head 28 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 29 -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 29 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (6) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I select this item also for initiating

discussion  under the whole of Head 29. Income  Tax  is

the  most important department collecting revenue.  The

sum  collected  or  to be collected  seems  to  be  $65

million,  even after the tax on individual incomes  was

increased. This is a Department which should take  more

rigid  steps so that evaders of taxation can be brought

to  book  and  the  full  amount  of  tax  due  to  the

Government for running the Colony is collected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave further discussion to others, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,972,900 for Head 29 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3184</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 30 -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 30 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 11 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are perturbed at the slow rate of progress

being  made  by the Minister in promoting  the  tourist

industry, and we want to know rather more about what is

being done. I urged this matter in this House first two

years  ago, in November 1955. I raised it again a  year

ago in Committee of Supply, when it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3185</b></font><br><br>



was  gratifying to find unanimity from all  sides  that

tourism as an industry should be actively pursued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After further prompting from me in May this year, the

Minister  announced  on 19th June that  Government  had

decided,  as  a  first step, to recruit  an  expert  in

tourist  promotion  work from overseas,  to  appoint  a

Director of Tourism under the Minister for Commerce and

Industry. Six months later, no step has yet been taken.

No  Director  of  Tourism has been  appointed,  as  the

Minister  told us yesterday. But the position is  this:

that  anybody  who is now selected will, one  imagines,

take another six months to reach Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is to be host in February 1959 to the

Pacific Area Travel Association's annual conference,  a

target  date which everybody interested in  tourism  is

aiming at. Singapore has to be on display, as it were.,

in a big way by then, if we are to make the most of our

opportunities with overseas people coming here in large

numbers;  and  the  Director of  Tourism  is  not  even

selected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other step which the Minister has taken is to

appoint  an  Advisory Committee, to use the  Minister's

own words, "to give advice and guidance to the Director

of  Tourism". So long as the Director is not there, the

Advisory Committee is hamstrung.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that this Committee is

advisory. The Minister is in executive charge.  He  has

taken  on  that responsibility himself, and he  is  not

administering it as we would like to see it. He  cannot

hide behind the Committee. Sir, we want to know what is

going  on. We want to know how this sum of $300,000  is

being  allocated for 1958, and we want to know, because

of  our dissatisfaction, what statistics the Government

has  regarding the present rate of tourist spending  in

Singapore in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is not unfair to say that we are lagging

behind neighbouring countries - Hongkong and Ceylon,  for

example.  There is going to be enormous competition  in

the next few years to attract the tourists, and we have

a big leeway to make up. Let me quote, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3186</b></font><br><br>



an  example, figures of what is going on in Ceylon.  In

the whole of 1956, tourists spent Rs. 8.3 million while

in  the first five months of 1957 - this year - they  spent

Rs.  6.2 million. This means that Ceylon this year  may

go  very near to doubling its revenue from tourists. In

Ceylon  they believe that, properly organised.  Rs.  50

million can be received from tourist spending, or  four

to  five  times the present figure. Therefore we  would

like to know from the Minister what figures he can hope

for Singapore and what our position is.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> First of all, Sir, I would like to

refute the suggestion or the inference contained in the

hon.  Member's prepared speech which he has just  made,

that it was his prompting which got the Minister to  do

something  for  tourism. That  is  not  so.  The  first

initiative  was  taken  by the  ex-Chief  Minister  and

myself, when I presided over a meeting in 1955 of those

interested  in the tourist trade. I put it squarely  to

them  that Government was prepared to contribute dollar

for dollar to what the trade contributed. But there was

no  response  at all from their side. They  wanted  the

Government to spend all the money and they to  get  the

benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we had an expert from New Zealand and he

submitted a report. That report I considered did not go

far  enough, and therefore it was on my initiative that

I  recommended to Government that a sum be  set  aside - $300,000 - so  that we would really go in a  big  way  to

attract  the tourists here. In between, of course,  the

hon.  Member did ask several questions, but  they  were

just  incidental. If I had thought that it was  only  a

waste  of  money, no prompting on the part of the  hon.

Member would have made me recommend this

sum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the inference is that I am hiding behind the

skirt of the Tourist Advisory Committee. That again  is

not  so.  I  am actively watching what it is doing.  In

fact,  I  spend  a  lot  of time reading  its  minutes,

discussing  things with its chairman  and  the  members

themselves  when  I meet them outside;  sometimes  they

come to my office to discuss these things.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit, Sir, that Government machinery is a little

slow  in  certain matters and we had to take a  bit  of

time  to  get the director's salary fixed up  with  the

Establishments Branch and the Treasury. There again  we

had   of  course  to  satisfy  the  Treasury  and   the

Establishments  Branch. We have at last  been  able  to

persuade the Establishments Branch and the Treasury  to

create  the  post  and to fix the remuneration  of  the

director.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meanwhile, time has not been wasted. We have

been   receiving  applications  from  various   persons

overseas  who  are interested in the  post,  and  these

applications  have  been sent to the  Tourist  Advisory

Committee for its consideration. The Committee has been

considering   the  applications  and,   as   I   stated

yesterday, it has now made a short list of eight or ten

names. But the information given in the applications is

not  sufficient and therefore the Committee has written

back  to the applicants asking for further information.

As  soon as that further information is forthcoming, it

will be in a position to make a choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There again, Sir, if I had on my own initiative

chosen  a  man  from  the big number  of  applications,

probably  the hon. Member would have had  a  chance  to

stand  up  and say, 'The Minister is favouring  so  and

so.'  In order not to give the hon. Member that chance,

I have referred the whole thing to the Tourist Advisory

Committee.



<br><br>12.00 noon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must stress that the final authority is in

me whether to choose or not to choose a particular man.

If  I think the Tourist Advisory Committee's choice  is

the  wrong one, I will say so and refer the matter back

to  it.  However, I do not envisage that there will  be

trouble  on this score. I believe the Tourist  Advisory

Committee  has been doing a lot of work.  It  has  been

very  active.  In  fact, it is one of the  most  active

committees that I have got in my Ministry. I  have  the

Trade   Advisory  Council  but  the  Tourist   Advisory

Committee has exceeded all expectations and I must  say

that it is ably guided by its chairman, and the members

are very enthusiastic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3188</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what has the Tourist Advisory Committee done

besides  considering  applications  for  the  post   of

director?  It  has  been actively pursuing  a  research

programme  into all aspects of tourist promotion.  This

includes  production  of  brochures,  guide-books   and

literature,  the extension of amenities  for  tourists,

overseas  publicity  by  film, television  and  feature

articles and so on, statistical surveys, transportation

facilities, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee is also preparing the groundwork for

the  formation of a tourist association which will take

over  tourist  promotion. At the inaugural  meeting  of

this Committee I stressed very strongly that Government

was  not  going to shoulder the burden of  tourism  for

ever,  and  that  it was my intention  that  Government

should get out of this as soon as possible and hand  it

over   to  the  trade  in  a  true  democratic  manner.

Government  acts  as a midwife; it sets  up  something;

then  the trade sets up a tourist association in  which

all  those  interested in promoting tourism  can  join,

because  different scales of fees can be fixed so  that

it  can  take in the smallest tradesman and shopkeeper,

as  also the air and shipping lines. As soon as I  have

the  tourist  association going,  I  will  see  that  a

statutory  tourist  promotion  board  is  set   up   by

legislation   with  the  association  having   majority

representation   on   that  board.   Thereby,   tourist

promotion work will slowly pass from the hands  of  the

Minister  (who is normally a much maligned  person)  to

the people who are interested in the trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that, in a couple of years, or in

three  years, this tourist association will be able  to

raise  the entire funds, not only by subscription,  but

probably also from advertising rights in certain  areas

(it  can  issue pamphlets, guide books and so  on,  and carry  advertisements in them), and from lots of  other

ways. Then the whole of tourist promotion work will  go

into  the  hands  of the Tourist Advisory  Board  which

would  be a body controlled by the tourist association.

The  people interested in the trade would then  control

their own promotion work and Government would step out.

That is how I see the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has taken the step of inviting the PATA to

hold its 1959 annual meeting here. I am going to set up

a committee shortly (probably early in the New Year) to

get down to making the arrangements for the conference.

This  committee  will contain members  of  the  Tourist

Advisory Committee and others who may be able to help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that it will take as long as six

months  to get a director. We hope we will be  able  to

recruit  one  and  get him here probably  within  three

months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the hon. Member quoted figures about the

contribution of tourists to the revenue of  Ceylon  and

various other territories. If I start giving figures to

this  House,  I could go on ad infinitum  and  probably

occupy all the time allocated to this vote, and I  will

not  have  the bother of having to listen to criticisms

from  my  hon. Friend opposite who is ready, I see,  to

lash  away at me on other spheres in my Ministry  which

are  more  important. I will confine myself, therefore,

to  stating that the figures we have show that American

tourists  alone have spent U.S. $2 billion  a  year  in

travel  (excluding cost of passages). If we can attract

even 5 per cent of this figure to the Pacific area, and

if  Singapore could get one or two per cent,  it  would

run into millions of U.S. dollars. Therefore I am quite

sure  that tourism has a good future and that Singapore

can  hope to attract a good number of tourists who come

into the Pacific area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other thing - I have been very heartened, Sir, in

the  last  week or two, to read that the Federation  of

Malaya  is  also  interested in tourist promotion,  and

that  some arrangement might be arrived at between  the

Federation and ourselves. I do not know enough  yet  at

this too early a stage to comment, but both territories

could benefit by the influx of tourists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I merely wanted to stand up and say, 'Hurray for a

good Minister!'-



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3190</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> -when he said that it was not the

idea of the hon. Member for Tanglin or anybody else but

his  own.  I  was pretty moved when he  said  that  the

credit  should  go to his ex-chief, the  ex-Member  for

Cairnhill, who  had  the  drive,  the  ideas  and  the

foresight.  But  with  his ex-chief  now  out  of  this

Assembly,  the drive also seems to have gone  out  with

him!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard a lot of outpouring, but for all that the

result  is  nothing. Words, words, words,  nothing  but

words - Meetings, decisions and indecisions. We have  to

get  a director of tourism, we cannot do anything until

then.  No,  we  must  wait for  applications;  we  must

scrutinise  them.  We  must wait  six  months  for  the

director  to  come;  in  the  meantime  we  cannot   do

anything! Oh yes, we are still doing something, looking

into  the information coming in and going out,  and  so

on. Yes, we can do one thing and cannot do another. The

net  result, however, is that nothing concrete has been

done. Sheer waste of time!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister has taken the credit and said,

'I  am the executive. I will do everything. I will make

the  decisions.' Show us something! Show  us;  tell  us

what you have done. Does anybody outside Singapore know

that it is a place where tourists may stop over?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not heard anything concrete from the

Government. I know that expenditure will arise and that

any   benefits   ever  likely  to  accrue   from   such

expenditure will only be lost in time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Lim, Sir, I am sorry to speak

against  the Opposition Members for rushing  Government

to  implement the policy on tourism. To me, boosting up

tourism to increase our national revenue is one  thing.

We  must  be  interested; then, as  suggested,  we  can

divert  one per cent of the U.S. $2 billion  into  this

Colony. How much benefit it will be to this country!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is money more important than morality? Have we

ever  in  this House, or have even the people connected

with the tourist trade, advisers or experts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3191</b></font><br><br>



ever think what American tourists are most enthusiastic

about   and   interested  in?  Tokyo,  Paris - are   they

interested  in the scenery or culture of those  places?

No;  I  am  sure it is wine, women and song  attracting

more tourists. It is in most cases the night clubs they

want.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> He has been there!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> If one has stayed in Paris and

Tokyo, perhaps like the hon. Members for Serangoon  and

Tanglin and others, and one returns to Singapore,  what

is  his answer if a friend should ask him, 'Do you find

any  place better than Singapore?' His answer will  be,

'No. The best place to live in is Singapore.' Why? They

see the pleasant night life of Paris, even New York and

Tokyo, and Manila, but still they prefer Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I wish to put forward this paramount

important  point to the Government: the policy  of  the

tourist  association can be to boost  tourism  in  this

country but it should not forget to maintain the higher

moral  standard of this city. We prefer to starve  than

make  dirty  money. We prefer to tax liquor  and  other

luxury  goods  to  maintain our expenditure  on  social

services,  but do not expect that we are going  to  woo

the tourists, especially the American, to come here  to

enjoy the night life in Singapore, which I think is the

doom for the people here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope therefore that all Members in this House will

remember  that  the  people of Singapore  would  really

prefer  to starve than to earn filthy money. I  am  not

opposed  to the principle of exploiting the possibility

of  tourism  in  this  country, but  do  not  rush  our

Controller  of  Immigration  into  admitting  beautiful

entertainers  and telling him, 'The most beautiful  and

most  famous  Paris Folies Bergere must be  allowed  to

come  in', or a whole team of entertainers from a Tokyo

night   club  which  must  be  classified  as  eligible

immigrants! The Controller will not have to be busy  on

how to maintain our moral standard if we will not allow

such so-called 'highly civilised artistes', to come in.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the principle of tourism but

I  prefer the Government to be very careful not  to  be

rushed  and  misled into believing that in boosting  up

tourism  we  must  be  prepared  to  lower  our   moral

standard.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very glad to

learn   that   the  Hon. the  Minister   accepts   all

responsibility regarding the expansion of tourism, even

to the extent of having thought about it before anybody

else did. But having thought of it before anybody else,

somewhere  back  in 1955, we would like  to  know  what

expansion  since that date he has achieved, whether  he

has  achieved any increase in revenue. If he  has  done

that, I would be the last person to malign him. Sir, we

shall continue to prompt him on the question even if he

proposes  to  ignore our suggestions (as  it  seems  he

will) and he does not like them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks about democratic procedure in running

tourism  but  he  has still to learn to  be  democratic

himself.  We  still  ask for statistics  regarding  the

expansion of the tourist industry on which he has  been

working so hard in the last two years.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to revert to the

question of the expansion of industry in Singapore. The

Minister   says  that  the  number  of  new  industrial

companies  registered in Singapore in 1957  is  at  the

moment 129, while our criterion of industrial expansion

is  based on the number of people who work. I  am  sure

that  it  is no comfort for the unemployed in Singapore

to  be  told by a Labour Government Minister that  more

companies  have been registered. The fact is  that  the

number   of   labourers   employed   in   manufacturing

industries  dropped  by 2,321 between  March  1956  and

March  1957. The Minister claimed that a vegetable  oil

refinery, with a capital of $1½ million, was registered

and  is operating. But, Sir, if you look at the figures

of  employment  in  the  Malayan Statistics  Digest  of

Economic  and  Social  Statistics  issued  in  November

1957, that  is the latest issue there is,  under  the

head  "Manufacturing of non-metallic  mineral  products

except  products of petroleum and coal" - and I  take  it

that  that covers vegetable oil refineries - I find  that

in  March 1956 the total number of persons employed was

3,131.  In September 1956 it dropped to 2,969,  and  in

March of this year there was a further drop to 2,644.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also stated that a million dollar biscuit factory had been set up. But if you will refer

to   the  same  statistics  under  "Food  manufacturing

industries  except beverage industries" you  will  find

that  in  March  1956  there were 4,099  employed.  The

figure dropped to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3194</b></font><br><br>



2,818 in September 1956. There was a rise in March 1957

to  4,062. But there is still less employment in  March

1957 than in March 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are two of the examples which the Minister gave

us  a  few days ago. The rest of his claims lay in  the

future. We are concerned with what has been done in the

past  two and a half years, not with what will be  done

when  the  Minister is no longer in  office.  The  fact

remains   that  while  new  companies  may  have   been

registered,  there are less opportunities for  work.  I

will therefore seek clarification from the Minister  on

three questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, will he state how he reconciles the

declining  employment  figures  with  his  claim   that

industry is expanding?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, will he give us the figures of how many

industrial  concerns have closed down in the  past  two

and a half years? And



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, will he state how many people will find work

as  a  result of hush-hush schemes which belong to  the

future?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I give figures

of  industrial companies that have been registered  and

those that have closed down in the past two and a  half

years:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, 74 new industrial companies were registered

and 75 closed down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956, 93 new industrial companies were registered

and 54 closed down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 11 months in 1957, 129 new industrial

companies were registered and 45 closed down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the whole, we still have an increase of

industrial, companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member said that what is of concern is

what  is  happening now rather than what  is  going  to

happen after I am no more a Minister. I hope, Sir, that

the Member does realise that laying the foundations  of

a  sound  economic policy cannot be done overnight.  It

has  to  take time. We are laying the foundation  stone

for a sounder economy for the future and I am sure that

succeeding  governments will benefit  by  the  planning

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3195</b></font><br><br>



present  Government is doing and perhaps they may  even

get  the  credit, because they are going  to  reap  the

fruits of our labours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also sure that the future people of Singapore

will benefit as a result of our planning today. We  are

today  in  the transitory stage. Our past  economy  has

predominantly been a trading economy. We  now  want  to

encourage  industries. This takes time. It is  not  our

capital  that  will be involved. It is the  capital  of

outsiders and we have to give them confidence in  order

to  induce them to come here. Once they come  here,  it

takes  time - maybe  a year or two - to plan  and  build  a

factory, and so it can only go into production after  a

year  or  two when it is built. Therefore it is  not  a

matter  of reaping the fruits today, but it is a matter

of planning today to gather the fruits next year or the

year   after - possibly  during  the  time   of   another

government.  Probably that government would  claim  the

credit  for  it, but I am sure the people of  Singapore

will  not forget - their memories are not short - and  they

will understand who planned these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a lot of grouse that industries

are closing down and what is the Government doing about

it. The inference from the Member's remarks just now is

that more industries are closing down. Sir, there is  a

tendency  today  in  Singapore for  people  to  run  to

Government for spoon-feeding. This is a very bad  sign,

because  when  they  run to the Government  for  spoon-feeding,  they  lose  their  initiative,  and  if   the

initiative is lost, industry cannot flourish.  Industry

has  primarily  to have its own initiative.  Government

can  only  give  a helping hand. It has been  so  after

elections.  In many fields, not only in the  industrial

field, but also in other fields too, you will find that

whenever every little thing happens, people run to  the

Government.  That sort of attitude has been  encouraged

to a great extent by Members of the Opposition. What is

the  Government doing about this and that? Why  is  the

Government  not  helping? They have even  gone  to  the

extent  of  asking  me  to use my  influence  with  the

Industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3196</b></font><br><br>



Promotion  Board,  which  is an  independent  statutory

body,  to  get  them  to make a  loan  to  the  Beehoon

Cooperative, when the Board did not consider it to be a

sound investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the big factor is the creation of

confidence,  Sir,It has been remarked  in  this  House

that the "unholy alliance between the Labour Front  and

the  P.A.P."  has been responsible for the  loss  of  a

certain amount of confidence. But, Sir, it is not  only

that.   Members  may  feel  that  the  manoeuvring   of

political  Parties  is  responsible  for  the  loss  of

confidence, but the Labour Front and the P.A.P. are not

the  only Parties to blame. You have today the ex-Chief

Minister   shouting  his  head  off   on   a   lot   of

things-perhaps  not to detain subversive  elements,  or

not to banish people and so on and so forth. Perhaps he

is  embittered because of certain failures  during  his

political career. But, Sir, you have no excuse for  the

Liberal-Socialist Party encouraging David  Marshall  to

form  the Workers Party, and [Interruption.].  Here  it

is, from the Torch issue of 31st August:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must also encourage splinter groups, e.g. David

Marshall's  Workers Party and C. H. Koh's Youth  Party,

etc, to split the Labour vote."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now here is a Party which claims to act in a

responsible  manner,  which  claims  to  represent  the

capitalists, encouraging the formation of a  subsidiary

Party  to  itself to split the Labour vote - the  Workers

Party.  Is  that a responsible Party's job?  The  Torch

issue goes on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must encourage the left to merge" - it has been

achieved  more  or  less - "and  then  condemn  them  for

seeking  immediate  political  gains  by  an  electoral

alliance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First encourage the left to merge. When they merge,

you condemn them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I was just wondering whether the

remarks  of the Minister were relevant to the  question

of the expansion of industry, which I was asking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was, in fact, waiting for that point

of order to be raised. I think the Minister has gone  a

little too far. He is becoming completely irrelevant in

his remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry that you have ruled me

out.  I  thought the matter of confidence was of  great

importance  to  my  Ministry in encouraging  industrial

development  in  Singapore. It  is  how  the  political

Parties  behave  that  is going to  gain  or  lose  the

confidence  of outside investors. Sir, I  was  pointing

out  how  they have been responsible for  the  loss  of

confidence in Singapore by making such remarks in their

official  bulletins, and by creating  an  offspring  to

split the Labour vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Point of order, Sir, I was just wondering

whether the Minister has regained relevance?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Minister was trying to

explain   how   he  was  relevant  as   against   being

irrelevant. I think the Minister ought to switch on  to

another  topic because, if he continues in that strain.

I will have to pull him up as questioning the ruling of

the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Far be it from me, Sir, to

question  your  ruling.  I will  be  content  with  the

remarks that I have made on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member stated that in March last year

there  were  so many labourers employed in  industries,

but in March this year there were 2,000 less; but as  I

mentioned  earlier, you cannot take one  month  as  the

criterion. You have got to plot the graph over a period

of  years to see the trend of events, and therefore  it

is  completely illogical to take any one month  out  of

context  and  pinpoint it and say, "Here you  are,  you

have  lost  so many workers this month," or  "you  have

done this or that."



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are going to

have  up  to  3  o'clock to thrash out  this  important

question  of commerce and industry. During  the  Second

Reading  of  the  Appropriation Bill I  never  had  any

satisfaction from the replies of the Minister.  I  will

put  some questions to the Minister and I hope he  will

give me the answers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the oil milling industry. What is he doing in

order to prevent it from closing down?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoe industry. There is keen competition from

Japan



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Tariffs!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> What steps is he going to take?

We  have  never been satisfied with what  he  has  been

doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soap and biscuit factories - dwindling

manufactures, and moving of factories from Singapore to

the Federation. What is he doing to prevent all this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are today not grousing but presenting to the

Government the very serious situation with which we are

now  faced. There is no consolation in having  so  many

factories registered since more factories have to close

down.  The Minister has admitted that it takes quite  a

lot  of  time  for a factory to start functioning;  but

when a factory is closed down, it means that the people

employed  therein have lost their jobs. That is  indeed

very serious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody is going to take credit for the planning done

by  the Labour Front Government. I think we cannot  get

anything from that source. Everything, they say,  needs

planning.  They  plan  and  plan  and  they  are  still

planning.  May  I suggest to them that planning  should

have  started  before they contested the  elections  in

1955,  and  that from then on up till now there  should

have   been  enough  time  for  planning?  If   nothing

materialises, it means either they have never given the

thing  a  thought or all the plans as usual  have  gone

wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we hear from the Minister about his idea of

initiative and a helping hand from the Government. I am

wondering in what way government has helped.  There  is

the  Master  Plan  that has not even  come  before  the

Assembly. You can only site your factory here. You  can

only site your factory there. Nowhere else can you site

your  factory. What help has Government been  extending

to  industry  regarding  power  and  all  other  allied

matters? Has Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3199</b></font><br><br>



helped  in  accelerating  the  approval  of  plans   of

factories?  Let me hear from the Minister how  long  it

will  take a person wanting to build a factory to  have

his  plans passed? I think my colleague was right  when

he  said that it takes longer to have the plans  passed

than   to   have  the  building  built.  If   that   is

encouragement  from  the Government,  I  think  I  must

differ.  That  is not helping trade; it is discouraging

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have

to  agree with the views expressed by the hon.  Members

of  the  Opposition  on this most  important  Ministry,

Commerce   and  Industry.  During  this  debate,   many

speakers have emphasised one way or the other that  the

political  stability of Singapore is dependent  on  its

economic  stability.  The  Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry   has   been  to  Saigon  and  other   foreign

countries.  He  has attended Colombo Plan  conferences.

But I do not know how much knowledge he has gained as a

result  of  these trips abroad and what he  can  do  to

boost up industrialisation. Sir, time is running short,

and  I  wish to say this: One of my friends from abroad

joked  with  me  and  said, "Singapore  is  lucky.  She

prospers by the instability of South-east Asia". He did

not  envisage  that  if the neighbouring  countries  of

Singapore  are once stabilised, then how will Singapore

fare?  In  other  words,  Singapore  today  lives   and

prospers because of the instability of this region.  Is

it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Member for Serangoon

again  raised  the same point about certain  industries

that  are  suffering at the moment because  perhaps  of

Federation  tariffs.  Sir,  the  oil  industry  is  not

suffering  because of tariffs; it is suffering  because

of  the shortage of copra at the moment. Sir, if we put

a quota on the import of Japanese shoes, the Member for

Telok  Ayer  (he  is  also  a Member  of  the  Liberal-Socialist Party) will say that we are going against the

free  port status of Singapore. Conflicting views  from

the same Party!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Bad management!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3200</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, we cannot have a free port

and   yet  have  a  range  of  tariffs  on  all  items.

Therefore, I told the oil industry that I would take up

the matter of reducing the freight rates from Singapore

to  Europe.  Sir,  it  was  also  as  a  result  of  my

representations  that the freight rates  on  copra  had

been  reduced  by the Straits/Homeward Conference.  The

previous  rates  were  much  higher  until  I  met  one

Conference member and told him, "You are not giving  us

any attention." They then reduced the freight rates  on

copra.  Now  we are taking up the matter of  getting  a

reduction of freight rates on coconut oil to Europe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rubber shoe industry: I referred this matter to

the  Industrial  Promotion  Board  and  asked  them  to

investigate  whether  there  are  any  other   possible

methods  by  which  they could cut  down  the  cost  of

production. Tariff is not the answer, Sir.  You  cannot

impose a tariff or quota just for the asking. You  have

first to find out if there are any other methods.  When

you  are satisfied that there is no other method,  then

you can think of tariffs; otherwise your entrepot trade

is  going to suffer and I am sure the Member for  Telok

Ayer  will  agree  with me in this - he  is  so  keen  on

maintaining  the free port status, as he has  mentioned

earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might also mention this, Sir, that the oil millers

approached me and said, "We cannot sell our copra  cake

because  of  the  flood of copra cake  from  Indonesia.

Would  you  please put a restriction on the  import  of

copra cake?" And I said, "Go slow, please. Do not  just

rush  me.  Let me investigate what your case  is."  And

while the investigation was going on - it was not even  a

month - they came back and said, "Our problem is  solved.

Now  we  are able to sell our copra cake. There  is  no

need  for  you to put a restriction." So you see,  Sir,

immature  minds  only will rush to  do  a  job  quickly

without   planning   and  without   thinking   of   the

repercussions. Ministers cannot do that. They  have  to

think  of the future, and not of today only. What  they

do hastily in order to get results might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3201</b></font><br><br>



mean upsetting something else. It is all right for  the

Opposition to shout about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changi has harped on the problem

of  Ministers  travelling  far  and  wide - he  mentioned

Saigon - and  asked what they have achieved.  His  speech

was  in  line with what the Member for Telok  Ayer  has

often  mentioned in this House. Sir, I went  to  Saigon

and  met  Ministers  from  other  countries.  I  had  a

discussion  with Mr Casey. I impressed  upon  him  the

need  for an animal feed mixing plant for Singapore  in

order to encourage the farmers. I am glad to say that I

have received agreement in principle from Australia  to

give  us  an  animal feed mixing plant worth Australian

£15,000, with the necessary technical assistance to set

up  that  plant.  That plant is going  to  provide  our

farmers  with a balanced mixture of animal  feed  which

has  been recommended by Dr Kelly, who is carrying out

research on the best type of food for pigs and poultry.

So  you will have a saving because the middle man will.

be  cut  out when you buy the feeding stuff and farmers

will  therefore  get the mixed feed cheaper  than  what

they now pay for individual feeding stuff. Also poultry

and pigs will be growing at an accelerated pace because

of   the  nutritional  value  of  this  balanced  feed.

Therefore one advantage has been achieved by  my  going

to Saigon - a trip which cost about $825.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my return, I stopped at Bangkok and made a rice

contract with the Thai Government. We were not  getting

enough  rice  and  there was also an uncertainty  about

getting  it.  So  I  made  a  contract  with  the  Thai

Government for 18,000 tons at a price of about one  and

half  to two pounds a ton cheaper than the market price

and thereby saved the colony $200,000 to $300,000. That

is another example of what Ministers can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had unofficial Members of the Legislative

Council visiting foreign countries in the past. Mr Tan

Chin Tuan and Mr Yap Pheng Geck made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3202</b></font><br><br>



trips  abroad.  Mr C. C. Tan went to London,  Karachi,

Ottawa,  and New Delhi. And the hon. Member  for  Telok

Ayer visited Rangoon, Bandung, Manila and so on. But no

concern  was  expressed then of  the  taxpayers'  money

being   spent  by  Unofficials  who  were  not   in   a

responsible  position and had no executive powers.  But

today we are Ministers with executive powers, and  when

we go out to discuss matters with other Ministers at  a

high  level, we achieve something. So you can  see  the

mentality of the Opposition today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue, Sir, with these allegations that my

Ministry has not been able to encourage industries. The

soap  and biscuit factories, Sir: we are now taking  up

the  question of tariffs with the Federation.  We  have

had discussions with them on this matter since the past

one  and a half years. We have decided that there  will

probably  have  to be a joint meeting of  the  Economic

Committees  of  both the Governments  to  discuss  this

tariff  issue;  though I have all along felt  that  the

economic  problems of Singapore and the Federation  are

complementary and therefore there should be  no  tariff

barriers  between us. It is, however, an idea which  we

have  to sell to them, and it is not easy to do so.  It

is  very  easy  to say, "Why do we not merge  with  the

Federation?"  If we are willing but they are  not,  you

cannot  do  it. And we cannot declare war on  them  and

say,  "If you do not remove your tariffs, we will fight

you."  You  cannot do that sort of thing. You  have  to

talk to them and try to persuade them. You have to show

them  the  advantages of removing trade  barriers,  and

that  takes time again. It is very difficult  for  hon.

Members  on  the Opposition side who have  not  got  to

shoulder  responsibility  to understand  these  things.

They  can shout here at random as they like, but it  is

we who have to do the job and who know the difficulties

of  doing  this  job and the time that is  required  to

carry out the operation.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> There is only one minute left. When

I  spoke  of  the  jolly rides of the  present  Members

whilst in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3203</b></font><br><br>



the  previous Councils, Singapore was more  politically

advanced  than the neighbouring territories.  Today  we

are still a dependent territory, but the Federation  is

independent.  However, Sir, the time is  short  and  on

some  other subject I will deal with it and  I  hope  a

seasoned man on the Government side will reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Just two seconds, Sir, to sum up

the  Minister for Commerce and Industry's  speech,  and

that is "Carry on, sergeant!" For the oil affair he  is

taking  up  the  matter;  for  the  shoe  affair,   the

Industrial  Promotion  will investigate,  and  for  all

other matters, "Carry on, sergeant!"



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $760,490 for Head 30 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3203</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 31 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 31 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that in Singapore the available land for

farming  is dwindling. This is because most of it  must

be  taken  up for building and other projects. However.

we  still  find that Government is expending a  lot  of

money on experimental farms. I have a feeling that just

as  in  the  case  of  the other Ministries  which  are

putting up plans which will never be realised,  in  all

probability  these experimental farms, when  they  pass

the  experimental stage, will leave us with very little

land worth talking about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main point about agriculture, Sir, is that at

present  we  have  farmers. There are  two  departments

which deal with farmers - one, the Health Department; and

the  other,  the  Agricultural Department.  The  health

authorities will go to the farmers and tell them,  "You

cannot  put  up pig-sties. There are flies. You  cannot

have  ponds.  There are mosquitoes."  The  farmers  are

faced with such troubles. We should have expected that

farmers  would  have been able to  get  help  from  the

Government. They want a lot of insecticides.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3204</b></font><br><br>



They want a lot of fertilisers.  Do  I  see

Government  purchasing large quantities  of  fertiliser

and  then  passing them on to the farmers at  wholesale

prices?  Today  I still see the farmers having  to  run

along  to  the shopkeepers for their fertilisers.  Even

the  use of modern fertilisers has not been rammed home

to the farmers as being more effective and sanitary. So

far  as  I understand, the Agricultural Department  has

been of very little help and this sum of money spent on

agriculture,    other   than   decorating    government

departments, is of no direct help to the people engaged

in that industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to raise

only  one point, and it is very closely connected  with

the  Ministry  of Local Government, Lands and  Housing.

Sir,  as  Assemblymen we have received  complaints  and

pleadings  for  help  in regard  to  resettlement  from

people  who  can be termed professional agriculturists.

These  people grow vegetables, but there is no security

of  land tenure for them in a period when Singapore  is

developing  fast. They are merely termed  as  squatters

although  in the official records, and even during  the

occupation period, in their identity cards they are put

down  as farmers. But, Sir, they are not farmers.  They

do not have farmland at all. So I wish the Minister for

Commerce and Industry will look into the matter of  how

to  provide  security of tenure for these people.  Give

them  security of tenure for at least 80 years so  that

they can make sure that they can make a living from the

land.  At present the private landlord has every  right

to  serve  eviction  notices  on  any  whom  they  call

squatters. They do not know that such people  render  a

great  service  to this country by growing  more  food,

thus easing the food problem. Sir, I sincerely wish the

Government  can  give us an outline of their  long-term

policy  to  protect the farmers with more  security  of

tenure.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, for once I am in agreement

to  a certain extent with the Member for Serangoon, and

that  is,  we  can  do  much more  for  the  farmer  in

providing him with fertilisers and teaching him how  to

use  them.  Although we are doing  this  to  a  certain

extent now,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3205</b></font><br><br>



I  myself am not satisfied that that is enough. But the

reason why we cannot do more is because we have not got

the facilities. Members must realise we have taken over

a  transitory stage; we have taken over a machine which

has   to   be  adapted  to  the  needs  of  an  elected

government. The adaptation takes some time. It is  like

converting a motor-car - it takes some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, not much attention has been paid to the

rural  areas.  With an elected Government taking  over,

that  attention has been stepped up. Members will  have

seen  figures  of  the  increase  in  poultry  and  pig

production. This experimental station which I have been

talking of is going to help a great deal in this  line.

When  the station is ready - and I hope part of  it  will

start functioning somewhere in the middle of next  year

at  Sembawang - the Agricultural Department will be  able

to  develop and extend its services which will  include

provision of better seeds, fruit trees, tobacco  plant,

fertilisers,  treatment  of  pests  and  diseases,  and

studies of mixed farming methods. We can teach, and  if

the farmers are willing to learn and to follow what  we

teach,  they  will benefit. But I must confess  that  I

myself am not satisfied that we are doing enough at the

moment. There are however limitations and we cannot  do

more until we have this experimental station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the tenure of land, Sir, that is entirely a

separate   question.  It  is  now  actually   receiving

attention  from  me  and from the  Minister  for  Local

Government, Lands and Housing.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Sir, I do not know whether it is

in  order for me to touch upon the speech made  by  the

Member  for Changi. It is about the security of  tenure

in  resettlement areas. I can say this. Sir,  that  the

hon.  Member will probably be glad to learn that during

the  first  week  of  January 1958 Government  will  be

giving  out 61 land titles to 61 farmers for leases  of

60  years.  We are also proceeding with our  survey  of

2,652 farm lots and we hope, if the farmers comply with

the   conditions,  all  these  2,652  farm  lots   will

similarly be allocated to the farmers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3206</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I would like to seek some

information from the Minister. In Singapore we have, on

the  one  hand,  large  rubber estates,  large  coconut

estates and probably some large pineapple estates,  but

all  these  belong to large companies  which  can  look

after  themselves. I want to know how much agricultural

land  there  is left in Singapore. How long  will  such

land remain as agricultural land? At what rate will the

availability of such land dwindle?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is: instead of having to experiment

with mixed farming, with fertilisers and this and that,

is  there  not an agricultural station in  Serdang  now

belonging  to the Federation of Malaya? The  Federation

of  Malaya is still a friendly neighbour and if we  can

obtain  information from them, would it  not  save  the

Minister the trouble of having to experiment with mixed

farming, etc.?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the primary function of

Serdang is to train officers in the agricultural field.

We have sent trainees there. We do get information from

there   too.   But  it  is  not  just  a  question   of

experimenting in our station. It is rather  a  question

of  bringing our farmers to the station and  saying  to

them, "See for yourselves what we can do with this  and

that."  You  cannot  take them  to  Serdang  for  that,

because it will cost too much, and Members will grumble

about travelling expenses. I think the hon. Member  has

also raised another point, but it has slipped my mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> We are indeed very pleased to

hear  the statement just made by the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands and Housing regarding the  impending

issue  of 61 land titles to farmers, Sir; but one thing

he  has  omitted  to mention: I think these  farm  lots

belong  to  Government. I wonder whether  the  Minister

will  consider  compelling  the  private  landlord   to

provide  the  same  compensation  facilities   as   the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was just

wondering why the figure of 61 titles is so small.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Sir, the reason is this: we

started surveying land a year and a half ago and it has

taken some time to get the proper measurements for  the

areas occupied by these squatters. It has also taken us

quite some time to get the survey corrected, but I have

promised   that  when  all  these  lots  are   properly

surveyed,  there  will  be a  further  2,652  lots  for

distribution to the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for

Changi, I think that was the one which he raised in the

Assembly  3  days ago - although he was not present  when

you  called out his name, Sir,I have already  provided

the Member with the answer. He asked whether Government

would  compel  private  landowners  to  make  ex-gratia

payments when they evict the tenants; and my reply  was

that  it  was  not  possible for Government  to  compel

private land owners to make ex-gratia payments  to  the

settlers because if it is ex-gratia, then there can  be

no compulsion.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, another point that was

raised  by  the  Member for Serangoon - a survey  of  all

lands. We have up to now no real detailed survey of all

the available land. We have had a general survey, but I

do  contemplate - Members will  be  glad  to  hear  about

this - having a proper survey carried out so that we will

know exactly where vacant lands are and what lands  are

not utilised or put to economic use.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $105,990 for Head 31 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3207</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 32 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 32 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move this amendment in order to seek more

information.  So  far  as  cooperative  development  is

concerned,  it  is  still an unknown  affair  with  the

people.  Very few people know that this is a government

undertaking. So far as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3208</b></font><br><br>



I  can  gather,  many people believe that  co-operative

movements  are run by the P.A.P. This really  surprises

me. So I would like to seek this information:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many co-operative societies are there? What is

their  total membership? What is the work  of  each  of

these  societies? How much good have they done for  the

people out of the money voted for them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a matter of

information to this House on the point just  raised  by

the  hon.  Member  for Serangoon that  the  cooperative

movement  is quite unknown to the people of  Singapore,

and  that  even some people mistake it for  a  movement

encouraged  by the P.A.P., I think that  is  not  true,

Sir.  As  far  as my personal experience goes,  when  I

founded the now dissolved Farmers' Association,  I  did

formally suggest to the Association to carry on and  go

all  out in its cooperative work; but there was  strong

opposition  from  the P.A.P. clique, and  so  this  co-operative movement died. The P.A.P. said that  the  co-operative  movement is just an instrument of Government

and  a colonial method to woo the people. However,  all

this is not a matter of concern to this House. It is, I

think,  the responsibility of the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry  to  find out why  the  people  are  ill-informed of such a wonderful administrative machine  in

the  Government.  Every Party in Singapore  now  styles

itself as Socialist and I am sure that the co-operative

movement  is one of the most important of any socialist

movements. Why is the public still unaware of  such  an

important movement existing in Singapore? I think it is

because  they do not know what benefit they can  derive

from  such  a movement. Therefore I formally make  this

request: whether the Government will consider extending

a  cash  loan, or even set up a co-operative  bank,  to

help  the  poor  farmers  and hawkers  and  even  small

business men.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The Ministry of Commerce and

Industry is indeed a Ministry of Shoes - even though they

may  be  made  of rubber - and we concern ourselves  with

ships  and  sealing  wax, and even  cabbages  from  our

farmers!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3209</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the request for figures from the

Member  for Serangoon, there are 30,000 members in  the

96 cooperative societies in Singapore today.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<pre>



  Thrift and loan societies - 37.

  Thrift and investment societies - l7.

  Stores and shops societies - l2.

  Marketing societies - 10.

  Housing societies - 2.

  Rural credit societies - 4.

  Co-operative credit societies - 3.

  Labourers' co-operative credit societies - 2.

  Co-operative unions - 2.

  Miscellaneous societies - 5.

  Banking societies - 2.



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total is 96 societies out of which 13 have been

formed this year. I have not been caught napping,  Sir,

by the Member for Serangoon. I have the figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the hon. Member's allegation that the co-operative movement is unknown, that may have been so a

couple  of years ago, but it is becoming more and  more

known now, and I am sure it will become much more known

in  the future as more propaganda is being spread about

this movement in the rural areas among the farmers. But

we  are at the moment suffering from a lack of suitable

officers.  We advertised in Hong-kong, I think  it  was

the  year before last, for a Chinese to be the head  of

this  department - essentially  he  must  be  a  Chinese,

because  we have to make propaganda amongst the Chinese

farmers since they constitute the majority of the rural

population - but  we could not get a suitable  man,  with

the result that we had to have other officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Another six months.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Frankly, if we cannot overcome

this  problem, then the co-operative movement will  not

be  given  a  push forward. We must have  more  Chinese

officers trained in the co-operative movement and  they

are very difficult to get.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3210</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for

Changi  about  a  rural bank, I  do  not  know  whether

Members  have  noticed that there  is  a  vote  in  the

Estimates  for $50,000 to the Agricultural Co-operative

Union.  That  vote  is given on the understanding  that

they   raise   $10,000  themselves.  It   must   be   a

partnership - even   though   they    may    be    junior

partners - between Government and them. They cannot  have

complete  spoon-feeding from the Government. They  must

make  an  effort also, but they have up  to  date  been

unable  to  raise  this $10,000 because  of  jealousies

amongst  their own constituent societies. That  is  the

plain  fact,  Sir, and I am not prepared  to  recommend

giving  the $50,000 unless they agree to abide  by  the

terms  to  which  they  have  agreed  with  us  at  the

beginning when they said, "Give us $50,000 and we agree

to raise $10,000.".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I thought my question was,

what  work  have these societies done and what  benefit

have  they  brought to the people? I just do  not  want

figures.  In  regard to the housing societies - how  many

houses or fiats have they built? What have they done?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I have just a minute and a half,

Sir.  The  Public  Services  Co-operative  Store  is  a

landmark in the drive against indebtedness - that I think

the  hon.  Member knows. This is an urban  co-operative

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the request for more information from

the hon. Member, Sir, 79 new houses have been built  at

Paya  Lebar  by  the  Government Officers'  Cooperative

Building  Society - I do not remember the name correctly,

Sir.  Then,  Sir, the Malay Co-operative Banking  Union

has  already saved $16,000. Then there is a Fishermen's

Society trying to co-ordinate the sale of fish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the hon. Member can go to Seah Street and

buy  eggs  cheap from the Agricultural Union. They  are

selling  eggs  cheaper than what  we  can  get  in  the

market. So that is a benefit which even the hon. Member

could  derive  from the activities of this co-operative

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $117,430 for Head 32 ordered to stand part

a discussion on Exchange Control in general.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Can the hon. Member explain why

he has chosen this particular item (5) to initiate a

debate on the policy as a whole?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The reason why I have chosen this

item (5) is to initiate a debate on the whole policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps the hon. Member will

wait  until I have proposed the question on  the  whole

Head and then he will be in order. His amendment is out

of  order.  The  Question now  is,  "That  the  sum  of

$262,420  for Head 33 stand part of the Schedule."  Mr

R. Jumabhoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, you have ruled that my

amendment  is out of order. What item would I  have  to

move  an  amendment  to, Sir, in order  to  initiate  a

discussion?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The proper item would be item (1),

referring to the head of the whole department.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. My idea

is  to discuss Exchange Control as a whole. This  is  a

subject  which  I have raised for many   years  in  the

previous  Legislative Council and in this  Assembly.  I

asked the Financial Secretary then and I have asked the

present  Financial Secretary about Singapore's earnings

of  hard currency. I have never received a direct reply

that Singapore's earnings have been so much for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3212</b></font><br><br>



so  many  years, year by year. Our surpluses have  been

for  somebody's benefit. The only reply I have received

all  this, time has been rather evasive. Possibly  the

view   is  taken  that,  being  a  joint  concern  (the

Federation of Malaya and Singapore), the hard  currency

earnings, are lumped together and not separated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are today still a colony, while the

Federation  is  an independent country  enjoying  equal

rights  as  any  other  Commonwealth  country.  I  have

always, pointed  out that we are buying  hard-currency

goods  at  black  market rates from Hongkong,  and  the

colonial power has always tolerated that at the expense

of  the  taxpayers. Sir, one cannot deny that the  most

important factor in entrepot trade is the relaxation of

exchange  controls as far as possible or make Singapore

as  free as Hongkong. That does not mean that Singapore

will be taken away from the sterling area. No. Hongkong

has the maximum relaxation of exchange controls and  it

is still tied to sterling. Sir, Hongkong is flourishing

because  of its free exchange. There is enough  capital

from  various countries lying there. Capital is without

fear  about putting in money in the Hongkong market  or

in  Hongkong wares; so in turn, there is enough capital

[Interruption.].



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I know that Ministers may need

to  have private conversations but if they are of  some

length  I suggest that the Ministers retire behind  the

senior man on the-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, to continue on this subject,

what   I   want  is  to  see  development,   and   more

development, for our vast population, and  to  see  our

entrepot  trade  flourish.  We  have  connections  with

Indonesia  and  Thailand;  we  have  connections   with

Vietnam,  Cambodia, Laos and various other  surrounding

countries for trade. If there is less control over  all

these transactions, we are sure to gain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3213</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time at my disposal is rather short, Sir, but I would

like  to  ask  a  question of the  Hon. the  Financial

Secretary, the expert who deals with exchange  finance,

to  let me know if it is possible for him in the  short

time available - notice of my motion has been given and I

have been talking on this pet subject for many years - to

give  figures at least of the past three, four or  five

years  showing Singapore's hard currency  earnings  and

how we have spent them.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland:</b> May I ask a point of

elucidation of the hon. Member who has just  sat  down,

Sir?  Is  he advocating a free market in Singapore?  Is

that  what  he  is  advocating, or is he  advocating  a

greater  relaxation of exchange controls?  I  think  he

ought to make that clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Well, that is a surprise question

for  an  experienced banker. He may possibly  be  right

about sterling. What I worry about is Singapore's trade

for  the  sake  of the people here and at  the  present

moment I shall be quite satisfied with a relaxation  of

controls  before complete freedom from it.  I  hope  he

will be satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> In that case, Sir, I do not

understand why he brings Hong-kong into the picture  at

all.  The exchange control regulations in Hongkong  are

precisely the same as they are here, but Hongkong has a

free  market.  If he would like me to say something  on

that, I shall be very pleased to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I was really quoting Hongkong as a

flourishing  colony  because of  its  free  market.  We

should start first with a relaxation of controls and if

that succeeds, we can in future be in the same position

as Hongkong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a great

deal  of  loose  talk on this subject. As  recently  as

November  30, the Singapore Standard said in a  leading

article:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The present foreign exchange restrictions should be

lifted because these militate against the interests  of

Singapore.  It is illogical that, although all  foreign

currencies can be bought in Hongkong. Singapore is tied

hand and foot.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3214</b></font><br><br>



If  British  trading  interests in  Singapore  wish  to

continue   their   trading  operations,   the   British

Government should remove currency restrictions and  put

Singapore on a par with Hongkong."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I think that is actually what the hon. Member has

in  mind.  But  this article, Sir, does not  state  the

whole  truth. The fact is that Hongkong has  precisely

the  same exchange control restrictions as we have. Its

foreign  exchange arising from exports is  subject  to

precisely  the same controls, but Hongkong has  a  free

market.  Now  this  free market is something  that  has

accidentally developed. It started from gold and silver

being  freely traded in Hongkong before the banks  were

re-established  after  the  war.  Again,   it   has   a

tremendous  influx  of United States  dollars - I  saw  a

figure  mentioned  of $200 million a  year - coming  from

Chinese  residents in the United States, and  from  all

sources including U.S. dollars which virtually was  the

currency  of  Nationalist China after the war.  It  has

this tremendous store of dollars to draw upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is from these sources of free dollars that the

importer  finds  his foreign exchange. Tourist  dollars

also find their way into this market. Most people,  and

I  think actually the hon. Member for Telok Ayer  also,

think  that we can start a free market in this  country

by   freeing   foreign  exchange  here.   Incidentally.

Singapore  does  not earn any U.S. dollars;  it  has  a

deficit  in its balance of payments with hard  currency

areas;  but  they think they can start this  market  by

freeing  foreign  exchange arising from  exports.  That

would  be  a leak in the sterling area. That  would  do

absolutely no good at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are considerable advantages in belonging to the

sterling  area,  and it is necessary that  the  central

reserves  of  the sterling area held in  hard  currency

should be controlled by the United Kingdom. The Straits

dollar cannot fall below its statutory limit because it

is 100 per cent backed with sterling; and it is well to

remember   that   the   pooling  of   hard   currencies

strengthens  sterling and, therefore,  strengthens  the

Straits dollar.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hongkong, the supply of hard currency, of U.S.

dollars, is adequate. There are sufficient U.S. dollars

finding  their  way into that market for purchasers  of

U.S. dollars to find them there. But such a  situation

cannot  arise  in  Singapore. If we  establish  a  free

market here, where will the U.S. dollars come from?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> From the air!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I will tell you one thing, Sir, and

that is that if we do establish a free market here,  if

we  take steps to establish a free market and say, 'All

right, let the U.S. dollars come in', there will  be  a

tremendous demand for them and the result will be  that

the free market will collapse in a very short space  of

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are simply not the sources of supply in this

part of the world. There is no analogy between Hongkong

and Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the hon. Mr Sutherland has

admirably  put up the arguments against a  free  market

here.  There are some who consider that if we establish

a  free  monetary  area  here  in  Singapore,  we  will

probably  attract dollars from Hongkong but  that  will

not be the case because Hongkong will then restrict the

export  of its dollars. It will see to that because  it

will  be going to lose the trade which it is doing with

us.  If  we get its dollars, we will then use  them  to

import  goods direct; it will therefore see to it  that

it  restricts  the export of dollars to  Singapore.  We

will not be able to attract dollars from Hongkong;  and

as for attraction direct from the source, there is none

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, Hongkong is a sort of shop

through which we purchase American goods, sometimes  at

four  per cent, sometimes six per cent above the price,

depending  on  the  free market rate  of  exchange  for

dollars in Hongkong and the little commission  of  the

middleman.  But Hongkong has placed one restriction  on

us,  and that is that whatever goods we import from  it

with  its free market dollars, we cannot export at will

to  any  other  country - although to  help  us,  we  are

allowed to re-export



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3216</b></font><br><br>



to  our  traditional entrepot markets, and that we  are

doing  now.  But  that gives you an indication  of  its

attitude: if it will not allow us to re-export  to  any

country  goods purchased with its free market  dollars,

it  will  further  still not allow its  dollars  to  be

exported to Singapore and be utilised by us to cut  its

own   trade.  Apart  from  this  possible  source  from

Hongkong, I cannot see any other source of dollars  for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone into this question at great length, Sir,

for  months and months, to see if there is any possible

method  of establishing a free market here,  and  I  am

convinced that there is none. We do not earn sufficient

dollars  for  our  own  consumption,  and  in  fact  by

remaining in the sterling area and having this control,

we  stand to benefit rather than to lose. The moment we

have a free market, our imports will be restricted very

greatly  and we will not be able to import all we  need

from any dollars officially earned by us.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $262,420 for Head 33 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3216</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 34 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $401,220 for Head 34 stand part of

the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to vote against

this Head. It is regrettable that I have to revert once

more  to  the subject of prawn ponds. If I do  so,  the

Minister  has only himself to blame. He held  back  his

information and arguments when he spoke in reply to his

motion on 4th December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally agreed on this side of the House that

if there is the remotest possibility that the supply of

prawns  will drop with the cutting down of 1,000  acres

of mangroves and replacing the breeding area by similar

trapping areas, then the Government should not proceed.

Now, Sir, the Minister admitted, a little late, that he

had to reply on his Fisheries Officer. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the House feels that the opinion of the Fisheries

Officer  is wrong, then the House can vote against  the

motion."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3217</b></font><br><br>



The  Minister  then  read out the  Fisheries  Officer's

expert  opinion, rather rapidly, I thought, for it  was

not  easy  to follow; in any case, I had no opportunity

to  reply.  The  expert opinion on which  the  Minister

solely relies - he is not prepared to listen to any other

expert  opinion - is to be found in column 2884 of volume

2, No. 40 of the Official Report. Perhaps I may read it

just a little more slowly? The second sentence is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No conclusive research work on the breeding of

Peneids in Malayan waters has been carried out."



<br><br>That is a significant point - the Chief Fisheries Officer

has  no  conclusive evidence. So we will, according  to

the  Minister, cut down 1,000 acres of trees first  and

then come to conclusions later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go on, the third sentence reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The present state of knowledge based on the research

work done in the United States of America and elsewhere

on  this  group  of prawns indicates  that  they  breed

fairly far out to sea in clear water. A review of  this

work  by three U.S.A. experts on prawns, namely, W.  N.

Anderson, J. E. King and M. J. Linder, may be found  in

the Biological Bulletin of 1949, and this work has been

accepted by biologists all over the world as accurately

representing  the position, so that we may  until  such

time as proof to the contrary is available, assume that

our  Peneid prawns spawn fairly far out to sea and that

their  larval stages are brought into the ponds by  the

tide  from spawning grounds which may be ten  miles  or

more from the Ulu Pandan area ...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I looked up this work which actually is in volume

96,  on page 168 and the following pages - I have it with

me here. The actual title of the paper is "Early stages

of the life history of the common marine shrimp Penaeus

Setiferus (Linnaeus)", and this edible prawn is  to  be

found  in  the  South Atlantic and the Gulf  of  Mexico

region  of the United States. So that when we are  told

that  this paper refers to the group of Peneids, it  is

not in fact the case; it refers to a single species  in

the  family  of Peneids - and I have it on other  expert

authority that this prawn is not to be found in Malayan

waters. And even if it does, perhaps the Minister  will

ask   the  Fisheries  Officer  whether  he  can   state

positively that Penaeus Setiferus (Linnaeus)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3218</b></font><br><br>



is  to  be found here. That is the reason why  I  asked

what   research   had  been  done  by   the   Fisheries

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are nevertheless conclusions made by

the three Americans:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The relationship of nursery grounds to commercial

catch [which is the summary of the paper]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conclude that the number of openings to the

outside  waters  and  the extent of favourable  nursery

grounds   are   two  of  the  major  physical   factors

influencing   production  of  shrimps.   Secondly,   in

addition  to  the number of passes to the area  of  the

nursery grounds, coastal or nearby offshore areas  with

relatively  shallow water, high salinity and  mud  also

seems to be a requisite."



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you were to search these four pages, you will

not find a reference anywhere to the breeding of prawns

10  miles  out  to sea. There is no mention  about  any

distance whatever. In fact, if anything, the reverse is

hinted  at, and this work also does not pretend  to  be

conclusive  even about the movements of this particular

South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico prawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The factors responsible for the inshore movement of

larval and post-larval Penaeus Setiferus have not  been

determined. We believe, however, that for the young  to

reach  the  nursery  grounds,  they  must  encounter  a

favourable incoming current."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the point which I did refer to very briefly

the  other  day  in this House, that  the  question  of

currents  was a most important one with regard  to  the

movement  of  prawns  to or from  the  breeding  areas,

wherever  these may be, and to the feeding  grounds  in

mangrove,  and  quite clearly I think  the  House  will

agree that the currents around these islands are pretty

tricky  ones and I think it is quite true to  say  that

not  enough is known about them to make it quite  clear

what the movements would in fact be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, as there is not a shred of evidence in this

paper in support of what the Minister said was in it, I

cannot but come to the conclusion that the Minister has

not,  in fact, read the paper himself. So, Sir, we  are

satisfied  that  the Minister has not proved  his  case

from the biological point of view. If he will only look

at  the evidence with a little less prejudice, he  must

come to the conclusion that the action he proposes to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3219</b></font><br><br>



take  may  do more harm than good. I say 'may  do  more

harm than good': it is open to doubt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us turn to two other points. Firstly, I have

a written answer to my question regarding the extent of

other areas of mangrove suitable for the development of

prawn  ponds.  The estimated present acreage  of  prawn

ponds  is 1,883 acres, and there are still 5,945  acres

approximately  of Crown land suitable  for  production.

Why  cannot  these  be  used instead  of  the  area  in

question?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only argument against the development of prawn

ponds  in the Johore Straits, which comprises the  bulk

of 5,945 acres given by the Minister, is because of the

curfew  and the restriction on fishermen to fish  there

at  night. This argument, Sir, does not seem to  me  to

make sense. Prawn ponds are on land and not out at sea.

If  fishermen are restricted from fishing out  to  sea,

there is all the more reason for developing prawn ponds

as  an  alternative or additional livelihood.  Why  not

make a start of increasing the prawn catch on this West

Coast  instead  of at Ulu Pandan? And there  are  other

factors  which should make us hesitate before  changing

conditions at Pandan because two other big changes  are

already being made. I refer to the affluent of the  new

sewerage  purification plant being built in Ulu  Pandan

which  would discharge into the Sungei Jurong and which

could  possibly upset salinity; and there  is  the  new

Caltex  oil depot and jetty being built at the Southern

extremity of the Nature Reserve, with the danger of oil

discharge - two  factors  above  and  below  the   Nature

Reserve. Why add a third and possibly fatal disturbance

when there is other land available?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has told us it has not yet been

decided by what method the 800 acres are to be let  out

for development as prawn ponds. That is all to the good

and gives a further chance to the Minister to pause and

think  again. But I would say this, that if he persists

in   going  on  with  the  scheme,  will  he  give   an

undertaking   to  this  House  that  he   will   invite

applications   to   operate  the   scheme   by   public

advertisement and public tender? I mention this because

I and my colleagues have heard rumours



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3220</b></font><br><br>



- and rumours should be scotched quickly if untrue, as I

am  sure  they are untrue - that applications  for  these

acres  were made in January and February of this  year,

and that promises were made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, will the Minister and the Government

agree to review this whole matter again? In view of the

evidence, it is their plain duty in the public interest

to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I must confess I have not

read that learned treatise to which the hon. Member has

found access.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I will lend it to the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you, but I must also say

that if Ministers have to read all that sort of

academic books and volumes -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of information, Sir, the paper is

only four pages long.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, if they have to read all

that,  they  will  not  be  able  to  carry  out  their

ministerial   duties  without  having   another   three

assistant ministers, especially in a Ministry where, as

I  say,  we have got to deal with cabbages and  prawns,

foreign  exchange control and ships, and all  sorts  of

other things -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And rubber footwear.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Besides rubber footwear. On

technical matters, Ministers have to rely on  heads  of

departments who have the technical knowledge, and as  I

said,  I was prepared to accept the advice given by  my

technical officer on fisheries. The hon. Member in  the

debate earlier this month cited technical opinion given

by  professors against the Scheme, but then  they  were

not  professors  of  fisheries,  whereas  my  technical

officer is an officer qualified in fisheries. Evidently

I have to take his advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work of the three United States professors is

accepted  by all biologists as an authentic  work,  and

their  paper also contains a review of the work carried

out in other countries such as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3221</b></font><br><br>



Australia  and India, which the hon. Member might  have

failed  to notice. If the hon. Member wants to  have  a

review of the total published knowledge on prawns, that

can be prepared by the Fisheries Department for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member harped on the point that there

are  5,945  acres of land not utilised for prawn  ponds

but   which  could  be  used.  That  is  precisely  the

point-out  of these 5,945 acres of land,  I  am  taking

away  800  acres, which happen to be in the Ulu  Pandan

Nature  Reserve. The land there is not being  used  and

therefore I am taking away a portion of it for  use  as

prawn  ponds,  and  that is what  the  hon.  Member  is

protesting against.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other pieces of land, Sir, enumerated in my reply

we  cannot utilise because the fishermen object as they

are  fishing in the swamps at the moment. Some of these

lands,  as  you know, verge on the Straits  of  Johore.

There  is  a  curfew in that area on night fishing  and

therefore it will affect the livelihood of fishermen in

that area. That is why we are not using the land there,

but  as  soon as the curfew is lifted we will certainly

consider doing so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member mentioned the point that he understood

applications  were  made in January and  February,  and

that  promises  were  made. That  is  not  correct.  No

promise has been made to anybody and none will be made.

If  an  applicant is successful, he will get it;  there

will  be no promise that he will get it and then things

are  moved in that direction. Applications are in  fact

coming  in right now, every day. I have not yet decided

what  method'  to  use  to  allocate  the  prawn  ponds

resulting from these 800 acres. As soon as I decide  on

it,  the applications will be judged, but if the Member

so  wishes we will certainly give a press release  that

anyone who wishes to apply can do so. There is no  harm

in  that.  In  fact  the people know about  the  matter

already,  from the publicity that prawns have  received

since they have "sprouted wings".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $74,940 for Head 35 stand part of

the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the Ulu

Pandan Forest out of the way to be used as prawn ponds,

we  are  left  with a little patch of forest  in  Bukit

Timah  and another little one in the Reservoir Reserve,

yet  we are still going to expend a lot of money on the

Forest Department, with a staff of a Forest Officer  at

$17,000 per annum and other forest officers. I ask  the

Government  whether we are getting value  out  of  this

expenditure.  I  think with such small forests  as  are

left  now  in  Singapore, it is time  Government  think

again  on the matter of expenditure. The total area  is

small, probably only a few square miles, and if we want

to  get  any information on forests we can get it  from

the  Forest Department in the Federation. It  would  be

cheaper paying for its advice. I think that for an area

of  such small size, only a warden will be necessary to

keep  the  forest in order and to prevent  people  from

pilfering wood or damaging it, but I see no reason  why

we  should expend a large sum of money for a very small

area of forest.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Forest Department was

set up years and years ago as a pan-Malayan department,

and  in  fact  at  the  moment the  Forest  Officer  in

Singapore  is the head of this pan-Malayan  department.

Half  of  his salary is recoverable from the Federation

of Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3223</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work that Singapore does is more in the field of

timber  grading and certification for export.  Most  of

the  timber  export business up to  now  has  been  via

Singapore,  though  the Federation  is  now  getting  a

bigger  share,  and actually this Department  could  be

properly  renamed the 'Timber Exports Department'.  But

since the set-up has been there from previous days, the

old  name  has  been  used. Most  of  its  work  is  to

encourage  exports,  to give technical  advice  on  the

Malayan timbers to importers in other countries. I have

many  times  seen  letters from the Forest  Officer  to

Australia  or to the Trade Commissioner in  the  United

Kingdom  setting  out the advantages of  using  certain

types of Malayan timber.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I may just add one point from my

Ministry's point of view. For certain purposes, teak is

very  largely used in this country. It is of  course  a

very  costly wood which has to be imported - you pay  not

only  for the wood but also the cost of transport  from

the  teak  forests. Alternatively, other Malayan  woods

are  used which are often not properly seasoned. I have

been  anxiously  seeking to get co-operation  from  the

timber  trade for we should be able to use more of  our

Malayan woods, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3224</b></font><br><br>



Forest  Officer has been of great assistance  in  this.

Though  we  have not succeeded in getting all  the  co-operation  from the industrialists we would have  hoped

for,  there  is  a  potentiality of  very  considerable

savings  through the services of the Forest Officer - the

timber  adviser, as I would call him - who has the expert

knowledge   which   is  not  available   otherwise   in

Singapore.

and took the Chair of the Assembly.
